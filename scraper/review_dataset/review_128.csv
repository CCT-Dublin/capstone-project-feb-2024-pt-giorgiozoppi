128,Absolutely perfect!,"What a wonderfully comfortable hotel, perfect location and such friendly staff.  Went out of their way from beginning to end, to ensure we were all taken care off.  A special mention to Alock Yana and the front desk team.  Professional, friendly, nothing was too much trouble. 
The superb breakfasts, complimentary coffees, teas and apples, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Felt very spoilt.  See you all in December.  Our 3rd Montcalm stay, first fir the Brewery, absolutely perfect!",5,2024,10,20
128,"Unreliable, Double Bookings, Don't Pay Up Front, Still Chasing Refund Despite Disappointment. Met Others Stranded Also","If I could give a minus score I would.
Don't get me wrong - the accommodation looked great and location fantastic, however they seem to have a practice of overbooking and I wish I hadn't taken the risk.
I booked for 2 nights to stay before and after my daughter's wedding at the Barbican just 3 mins away.  Booking via booking.com I paid up front and added a note about the significance of the event and my need for certainty.
I arrived to be told that the room had been given to somebody else who had booked via their website and I had been listed as a 'no show' despite standing right in front of them.
After many tears I was allowed to use a bedroom to change for an hour instead of the toilet or gym area which had been offered as compensation.  I was also told I could stay in their 'sister hotel' instead since this accommodation was fully booked.

This all messed up my day and night, but what is surprising is that when I returned for my case which had been looked after by concierge (since I wasn't given a room) I heard somebody in the foyer with the exact same story.  They were also being fobbed off with an offer of a stay at the 'sister hotel'.  I recorded this conversation on my phone for sanity.  Needless to say I was not surprised to find similar stories on review sites across the internet.
This hotel - without a shadow of a doubt in my mind - overbooks to ensure they cover costs irrespective of inconvenience to the customer.

I have contact Booking.com for a refund of my 'no stay' but the hotel is bad at answering phones and responding to emails.  Further more their string of changing duty managers mean if you have a problem it is more or less impossible to sort out the difficulty.
On one occasion I outlined all the difficulties I had experienced and stressed I was still waiting for my refund (and TBH I feel I deserve compensation for the way their mess up impacted my daughter's wedding) only to receive an email that said 'all sorted' we are pleased you enjoyed your stay ....OMG !!!!This is the worst and most frustrating hotel experienced I've ever had in my 60 years of life.

Give it a try if you have a penchant for risk - OTHERWISE AVOID THIS HOTEL",1,2024,10,19
128,beautiful hotel with good location and lots and lots of charm,"Stayed here with my daughter (22) for three nights at the beginning of octobre. Personnel was very friendly and helpfull, from the frontdesk, to the breakfast. Our checkin ánd checkout was handled by Alexandra and couldn't have been more frinedly. Location is very good, quiet enough to relax and close enough to subway and lots of rental bikes/scooters within reach. Loved the fact that there were so many references to the old brewery and must honestly say that our 'standard' deluxe room was more then luxurious enough for a long weekend stay.",5,2024,10,12
128,"Overpriced, dirty rooms, unpleasant experience","For a hotel advertising itself as a ""5 star"" hotel on online booking services, who encouraged me to upgrade to a ""deluxe"" double room, this is quite possibly one of the worst hotel experiences for the price I have had in many years of trips to London...
The room was small, and in a very poorly maintained state - stains on the bathroom walls, broken fixtures and fittings, cracked floor tiles that rocked when you stepped on them, loose light fittings in the ceiling and a broken bathroom door with exposed nails.
The experience was made worse by the fire alarms going off twice within an hour of me arriving at the venue, and as I tried to exit down the fire exit, on of the stairs is loose and I nearly went flying down a flight of steps.
Reception staff were sullen on check-in and too busy dealing with other customers complaining to check me out when I left.
The whole place looked tired and in need of a complete refit and repair to make it fit for guests. AVOID.",1,2024,10,02
128,Excellent Customer Service - Carina,"When we arrived at the hotel we was greeted in an excellent manner,The room was lovely, the customer service was excellent and the food was amazing 
And we had a great time staying at the hotel and we will definitely come back because the experience great.",5,2024,09,27
128,An oasis of charm and peace in the middle of the City of London,"A surprisingly lovely experience among the towers of the City on a business trip. Charming environment, carrying staff (thank you Alexandra O and Ramona!)  and a cosy breakfast room !  What else to ask for on a rainy day?! Thank you for everything, Laura S",5,2024,09,26
128,Anniversary weekend,"We chose this hotel for being close to our plans . We arrived just after 12 and was greeted by Carina who checked us in . Very professional and friendly and explained our luggage could be stored as room not available until 3.
We were perfectly happy with that and went on our way as had things planned . 
On returning , our room key was handed over and was shown to our room . We were staying across the road not in main hotel .
The room was lovely and had been beautifully made up for us with rose petals . We also had a bottle of Prosecco and very yummy cakes .
Breakfast was very good , it was very busy but the staff worked efficiently and we had a full belly before going off again with some planned events .
We would definitely recommend this hotel , we found  it perfect for us 5 mins to the underground , bars and restaurants around .",5,2024,09,24
128,Good place to stay - great staff,"This hotel has great ambiance and great staff but If you do not like stairs, this place is not for you.  There are elevators but a lot of stairs to get through the hotel.  

I arrived late when the bar and restaurant was closed but the front staff brought me drinks and some peanuts so I could have a quick meeting.  They had also agreed to keep one of my bags for a few days while I went out of the country.  So, first impressions were very good.  The rooms are large, comfortable and adequate.  

I stayed for 3 days, left for 3 days and returned for another 4 days.  There were several minor issues on the return but nothing serious enough to go into.

I don't recommend the restaurant despite the good atmosphere and the very good looking pints of Guinness which seemed rather popular.  The menu is very small which makes it a bit inexplicable to run out of several items.  I am not sure how anyone runs out of burgers with Waitrose and Tesco's but a minute walk away.  It is the same restaurant used for breakfast.  Ordering full English breakfast a la carte was a mistake, the scrambled eggs were inedible.  I recommend going serve yourself; there is quite a bit of choice.

There is a bar (apart from the pub type one in the restaurant) in the hotel which is open for a couple of hours after 5:30. Some items are free but, unfortunately the majority of items on the menu that I asked for were out of stock.  That included all the food items, both non lager beers, and the Laurent Perrier (not free but still not available)

The location is between Moorgate and Barbican stations and there are a lot of pubs and restaurants in the immediate locale.",4,2024,09,19
128,40th Wedding Anniversary ,"Booked a club room through Agoda. Called the hotel to ask if we could have a nice club room as it was our 40th wedding anniversary.  Alexandra Sharp was very helpful.  Well, when we got to our room, there were rose petals, Swan towels, balloons, a small bottle of prosecco, and macarons there. Lovely surprise.  Juliane on reception was very pleasant and helpful too. ",5,2024,09,15
128,Quality hotel,"A little out of the centre of London, I usually pick somewhere by the west end as it’s a little easier to get around having said that the underground is so good that a 5 minute walk to the closest station had you within easy reach of everywhere.
The hotel reception is stunning, staff were amazing, friendly, helpful and cheery. 
The room was across a small courtyard and even that was interesting and quirky. 
The room itself was maybe a little on the small side but had everything you needed including a small fridge, safe, iron and board etc. it was very clean and the turndown was also done perfectly. The shower was good with instant hot water and the lighting was controllable from the bed which is a small but nice touch.
The breakfast was first class! Amazing hot section with the best scrambled eggs you can find (even if they appeared a little sloppy) the bacon and sausage was first class too! There were cured meats, cheeses etc also. I finished my breakfast with a Greek yoghurt filled with fruit and dried fruits and honey and it was amazing, not to mention freshly squeezed orange and pressed apple juice. The only thing that could maybe be improved would be to get rid of the self serve coffee and tea pumps (where you depress the top) and have someone coming round to top you up, that would be fab but it’s a small niggle. 
All in all we absolutely loved our stay here and would return if you’ll bring me my coffee ha ha.",5,2024,09,15
128,"Great location, tasteful, comfortable, clean. A hotel with character.","I love this hotel and feel it should have a higher trip advisor rating. It is always clean and fresh, the decor is tastefully modern but cleverly blends with the original architecture and the rooms are thoughtfully appointed. You couldn’t get a better location for the Barbican and St Paul’s and Tate Modern are just a short walk away. Also well connected for tube stations etc. Staff are always very helpful. I love it here.",5,2024,09,15
128,Thank you for a lovely experience,It was lovely to speak with Corina Dinu whilst having drinks in the club lounge. Thank you for being very friendly and providing us with guidance to where to go in the area. We would like to stay again. Great experience and will recommend to family and friends,5,2024,09,14
128,Good place to stay near Liverpool Street Station.,Highly professional welcome at reception by Raissa . The team couldn’t have been more helpful. Lovely interpretation of this early Whitbread brewery with one of the first James Watt condensing steam engines. Our room was large with a well equipped bathroom and great shower. Being 6 feet 5 inches I would have preferred a larger bed but it was very comfortable. The breakfast was good with plenty of choice and healthy options. I would recommend this hotel .,5,2024,09,13
128,Not worth it,"Charged a £50 deposit, didn’t send it back. Paid for a double room, was given a tiny single bed. Was running on 3 hours sleep after a 12 hour working day and travelling since 5.30am, didn’t have the energy to request, and then have to move, to another room.

Paid near £200 for one night, wasn’t sent my deposit back, was given the wrong room, wallpaper peeling all in the corridors, wallpaper ripped in the rooms and cracked tiles in the bathroom.

Not worth it! Don’t bother :)",1,2024,09,07
128,Birthday surprise,"We went to London for a  friends birthday celebration. Location and value - good. Room and breakfast also good. 
Staff were very polite, however, I must make a big shout out to two people in particular- Alock and Corina who made our stay even more special. They helped me to surprise my friend, very warm hearted welcome - they are an asset to the Montcalm.",5,2024,09,06
128,"Room was nice, shame about the party!","I usually stay at the Montcalm and it's a reasonable hotel with good service.

Unfortunatelty, there was a corporate event held in the courtyard (the second such event in 2 stays) which finished at 1:30am, with a loud clean up that went on until 2am. Needless to say it ruined my night and I didn't get much sleep.

I complained to staff in the night who could only apologise, as the events are managed by a seperate company. 

I mentioned it at reception in the morning and was met by another apology but not much else.",3,2024,09,05
128,Best hostess Alexandra!,I love Montcalm Brewery hotel. It is a beautiful hotel with a very nice room. Breakfast is extraordinary as well as the cappuccino. Bit most of all I love the service from the conciërge and most of all the hostess Alexandra and also her collegue. Thanks for making me feel welcome and special!,5,2024,08,30
128,Ok but a few issues.,"I like the Montcalm brand so had a good expectations. 

I was in room 223 on the night of 27th August. Unfortunately this was a bit of a let down. I found the room had not been fully cleaned. An empty plastic water bottle was on the floor and hand marks showing on the glazed toilet door from previous guests. 

I was not told at check in about the Club lounge so unfortunately I missed this which was disappointing. 

A light fitting on the top of the bed was faulty and on initially entering the room it was flashing for the first 30 minutes. 

The room was nicely furnished and bed comfortable.

Breakfast starts at 7 which is a little late for me so will probably have left by then. However it’s usually very good in other Montcalm.

I do like the Montcalm brand and they have some lovely hotels. Perhaps if the price is right I will give this another try in the future. 

I think my expectations were expecting a little more in respect to the cleaning of the room and my previous experience of their hotels.",3,2024,08,27
128,Great Stay,"We booked into the townhouse and initially our experience was poor. The room looked dated, a/c did not work and the lights were faulty. I reported this to Juliana on reception who could not have done more for us. The service we received turned our experience from being initially quite bad to exceptional - all down to Juliana going above and beyond. I have stayed in many hotels but never received such great customer service, when I stay in London, I will definitely return to the Montcalm Brewery. The breakfast was also very good, plenty of options and a decent eggs Benedict! 

Thankyou Juliana and the brewery staff, we loved our stay.",5,2024,08,20
128,Manage your expectations ,"Manage your expectations, it's not the Ritz but it's fine for a London stay, Staff superb location good. It's a converted Brewery so it's going to be a bit quirky. The pub connected to it is a great place for food and drink and a ten minute walk gets you to Bank station ",5,2024,08,20
128,Skip this hotel,"The pictures are misleading. Skip this hotel and find another. The room I had looked very worn down and dated. The halls and room had a very strong mildew odor. When I first arrived, the room was drenched in a floral perfume in a failed attempt to hide the mildew odor.

I had my ‘Do not disturb’ light on and housekeeping ignored it and cleaned my room anyway. Later that day when I was in the room with the ‘Do not disturb’ light on, housekeeping knocked, opened the door and attempted to come in. Unacceptable violation of privacy to ignore the ‘Do not disturb’ light and enter the room, twice in the same day.",1,2024,08,16
128,Great stay!,"We stayed in a club room for two nights and found it spacious and comfortable. The AC worked perfectly (which was welcome with the warm weather!) and the bathroom was modern and well appointed. Receptionists and concierge helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a really good location, easy walk to Moorgate station or Liverpool Street station. Really enjoyed our stay and thought it was excellent for the price paid!",5,2024,08,14
128,Wonderful,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel , the staff were fantastic, really helpful.
We stayed for 3 nights , Katrina was wonderful asking how the stay was and if there was anything we needed. The reception staff were wonderful and concierge were brilliant. Will definitely return and recommend. Thank you",5,2024,08,09
128,Great place to stay right next to Barbican Centre,"A great find so close to the Barbican Centre, and to Moorgate tube. Lovely quiet, well-insulated, comfortable superior room with a spacious bathroom. AC very welcome on a hot August day. Tea/coffee making facilities and a fridge. Plush carpets underfoot and comfortable bed. Breakfast was really excellent - the best we've had in London. I didn't check out the wellness room but will next time. Accommodating staff on front desk, and delightful service at breakfast. We will definitely be back.",5,2024,08,04
128,This is not a 5 Star Hotel ,"First and foremost, the front house and restaurant staff are amazing but this hotel is at par with 3 star hotels I've stayed in Worldwide. 
How is this 5 star?
We were in room 223 and the tv cabling is so untidy. In the bath, the stopper was broken and could be dangerous to a person in the shower.
In the morning at 09:40, a member of housekeeping simply burst into the room with no announcement, nor knocking. I'm not sure why as checkout is 11am. She apologised, but it was a tad unsettling. 
It is only a 10 minute walk from Moorgate and Liverpool Street stations, so convenient for public transport. 
Beautiful flowers at reception.

128,Parik,Parik was absolutely amazing extremely helpful kind and he gave us a lovely room for my bday . Amazing stay hotle was clean breakfast was expensive but nice . All staff were welcoming and friendly . Everyone was smiling and always available for any  questions,5,2024,07,31
128,Tired property no Wow in a Wow suite!,"This is an underwhelming property. There is no Wow factor in a Wow suite just a somewhat tired and outdated room lacking some basic facilities. Think hard before you pay the extra for the Suite or Club Lounge. 
Staff are friendly. Not great value for money.",3,2024,07,29
128,Positive Title,"Mr Rennjith ( Night Incharge) checked us in. Very friendly and efficient.We checked in midnight he was kind enough to offer us drinks and took good care of us dropping our bags himself. I would recommend this hotel for anyone traveling near St Paul's area.

128,Smart and sophisticated stay,"Wonderful welcome at front desk supported by Bek who saw us to our room - v engaging and interested to know the purpose of stay etc.
Room v clean with everything you need and a great comfortable bed and linen. Sleep 100% despite location which is perfect for City and access to Elizabeth Line @ Liverpool St",5,2024,07,26
128,Pre Barbican Theatre stay,Perfect place to stay if you are visiting the Barbican Theatre as it's 50 yards away! Beds were a little softer than we are used to but slept fine. Very large room with Tea making and free water. Easy access to 'Jugged Hare' pub which was lovely (a bit expensive though!).,5,2024,07,26
128,Hotel,"The Montcalm Brewery Hotel in London combines historic charm with modern luxury. Set in a former brewery, it features stylish rooms, excellent dining options, a spa, and a fitness center. Its central location and attentive staff make it ideal for business and leisure traveler's. Amazing service, Friendly staff very good central location of the hotel, comfortable rooms. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2024,07,25
128,"Smart, comfortable hotel with lovely staff",We stayed here for a birthday celebration and the receptionist Juliana couldn't have been more obliging and made our stay very special. We had a disabled room which was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel is in a quiet location opposite the Barbican. The breakfast was also very nice. We would definitely stay here again and thanks to Juliana and all the staff!,5,2024,07,25
128,the curious case of a hotel chain unable to honour bookings,"I booked two nights at the Piccadilly West End hotel through the corporate hotel booking system used by my employer. My booking which I received a documented receipt for was for the 17th and 18th July, checking out on the 19th. Upon arriving at the Piccadilly West End hotel I was informed that despite the hotel having received my booking and details no room was available for me, I was informed that my booking could be transferred to another hotel in the chain. Luckily rooms were available at the Montcalm Brewery hotel, so far so good. Upon returning to the hotel on the evening of the 18th I found that my key card was no longer working. I asked at reception for this to be checked only to be informed that:

a) They had no record of my hotel booking for the 18th

b) That housekeeping were in possession of all my clothes and items I had left in my room and that the soonest I could get them back was at 7 Am on the morning of the 19th.

To achieve the almost seemingly impossible of making the hotel look more amateurish than it already was I was then told they could not give me the email address of the general manager due to the fact that ""The system was not loading"". I have booked hotels in the UK for around 30 years and this experience has been unique.",1,2024,07,18
128,Graduation of Daisy,"Customer service was excellent.  Nothing was too much trouble. Juliana and the Front Desk Team coupled with Alock and the Concierge Team made our stay memorable.  They all deserve a pay rise. Tough job, long shifts but service  with a smile regardless.",5,2024,07,17
128,Experience hotel Montcalm at the brewery,Really nice and helpful Rezeption (Juliana Raissa and co.) Some things were broken in the room but overall the room was really comfy and big. The bed was big enough and WiFi was working the entire time without any issues. Good location to get in the city.,4,2024,07,16
128,Graduation stay 2024,"On arrival, we were met by the most obliging and helpful staff. Julianna, Raissa and Carina facilitated our family booking over multiple rooms with ultimate efficiency. They were so friendly, and engaging that they added an extra layer of joy to our stay.

Our visit was to celebrate the graduation of Daisy and the whole team including Shantanu, Alok, Parik,and Renjith.

Riaz, on the night staff was particularly helpful on the room service and will now be known forever and 'The Spoon Man' affectionately within our family.

The smiles and camaraderie of the whole team led by Juliana was a credit to the hotel, when clearly they were working long hours. Having their joyful faces greet us all day during the graduation was an added benefit to our day and they could not do more to ensure the experience was spectacular.

They all deserve a pay rise for excellent customer service!!

There were many more that contributed to our excellent stay who we did not get their names, but again were fabulous.

Congratulations to the 'our' Greenwich boy who is graduating in 6 wks time. Sorry, we didn't get your name x

Overall, the rooms were great. The baths were an added benefit and greatly appreciated after a long day on our feet. 

We will be back xx",5,2024,07,16
128,"Five stars, hands down","It is not often that a hotel exceeds my expectations the way the Montcalm Brewery did. I booked the hotel online expecting the usual tiny London rooms and worn-out interiors, but it was a pleasant surprise from the second I entered the lobby to the moment I left the hotel. I stayed there for a week with my sister. Our first impression was the beautiful welcome and the helpful staff at the front desk. They were accommodating of our requests to have a room on the street side with two separate beds. The room was very clean, with comfortable beds, functioning AC, room slippers, complimentary water, tea, coffee, and cookies! The hotel itself has so much history, which was showcased through a series of photos across the hallways and facilities. I used the gym a couple of times; it was clean and well-maintained, with towels and water provided for free. The breakfast was perfect and included the hot and cold items you would expect. Our room was cleaned daily, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Mayuri and Katina made sure we had everything we needed and pampered us with extra towels and extra pillows. On our last day, we walked into our room to find complimentary drinks and macarons. I made sure to call and thank Rodhika personally for her nice gesture. This hotel was a random find on a hotel booking website, but now it will be my destination whenever I'm in London. I know that my review sounds a little too positive, but I honestly can't think of anything negative to mention. Warmly, Sarah Abbas Funkenstein",5,2024,07,15
128,Family trip,"Nice clean comfortable hotel. Very impressive reception area. Good location . Room a little hot but it did cool down over time . Some reviews complain about glass window between bedroom and bathroom - we did have one of those but there is a blind you pull down to make it totally private - I guess some people didn’t notice that 😂
Breakfast lovely and disappointment was no mushrooms so not the end of the world. 
Was a tiny faff at checking in and did offer to move us to sister hotel but we stayed put .",4,2024,07,14
128,No room at the inn - even though you’ve already paid !!,"Like many other guests who have had similar experiences, on arrival I was told unsympathetically by the reception team that “as there are unexpected maintenance issues, some of our rooms are out of order- you need to go to another hotel which is a ten minute walk away”!!!

I had booked a Club room at £300 for one night well in advance. I had even enrolled into their Club Rewards scheme. 

When I complained to the manager, he told me this was actually not true - the hotel had overbooked that evening and I was being bumped into another hotel. 

I stuck to my guns and refused to move - so they did find me a room- although, just to add insult to injury, there were no hangers in the wardrobe. Not a five star experience!

Reception also failed to mention that I could  enjoy the Club facilities - when I did go there, it was completely empty and lifeless - are they not therefore reminding eligible guests deliberately? Even worse, they told me breakfast was not included, but it should have been. 

Avoid this hotel - the reception team fail to give clients transparent information and you risk not having a room when you turn up !!! Despite paying £300!!",2,2024,07,11
128,Great Stay,"Stayed here for 1 night with friend's as we were going to Hyde park, Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean but our friend's had a suite and said it was dusty, but we had no issues. Helen at Reception was amazing at assisting any needs we had. Breakfast I could not fault so much choice. I would definitely stay again",4,2024,07,11
128,"Shambolic, total failure to take responsibility","Shambolic.  Moved my booking to Paddington without telling me, offered to take me over there but not bring me back to the City for an event.  Booked another room and refused to help with travel.  Appalling attitude, terrible organisation and total failure to accept responsibility.",1,2024,07,09
128,Great Location,"Perfect location for a business trip and attending an event in the area. Hotel Wow Suite was very comfortable, club breakfast was limited but sufficient for short stay.

Hotel was clean and well maintained given the age of the buildings. I would stay again.",4,2024,07,08
128,A disappointing experience overall,"A rather disappointing stay. The hotel claims to be a five star but is far from it by our expectations. Room had to be changed due to a dirty, stained toilet and broken bath and the second room was little better. Rooms seem rather tired and in need of a refresh. Bed was rather small and soft which did not suit us. Breakfast was good although self service. Staff were excellent throughout but the hotel was disappointing. Considering the cost I would rate the room as no better than a premium premier inn room and not as clean. Having stayed in true five star hotels around the world I would rate this hotel as 3 star at best.",2,2024,07,08
128,Not worth £300+ a room ,"Stayed for one night as we were having a weekend  away in London wanted to stay so somewhere nice and thought this being a 5 star hotel would treat us, but might as well stayed in a £100 travel lodge and got the same service, I booked a Montcalm club double room as looking at what came with the room a d what you would get thought it would be worth it ! How wrong was it, we booked in and was told morning and given no information at all about the club room or it's benefits but was being sold a £25 so £50 on total for two breakfast for the morning ! When a continental breakfast was meant to be included with the room I had paid for ! So I refused the breakfast and again not told anything about the club benefits, where to go or times of anything, was told where the lift was and that our room was on the other side of the building no offer of the porter to take our bags like others before us !

Once we found our room which was on the other side of the building our key wouldn't work after trying for 8 attempts we finally managed to get in, we was greated with the room, now for a room that costs over £300 it wasn't much better then some -£100 hotels I've stayed in the website advertised a Nespresso machine which was nowhere to be seen the room had no and I mean no information on anything no information on WiFi details no information on the club room no Information about room service nothing ! 

Having looked around the room one light for the mirror in the bathroom was broken the plug to empty the bath was broken, reading light next to the bed didn't work stains on the floor and bed very poorly made where the protector/topper wasn't even fitted correctly and we had to remake it.

The Aircon wasn't doing anything and couldn't change the temp and had an error code in the display so couldn't use that, we only had one bath towel between the two of us which for a double room is stupid and clearly would need two.

Would not stay again unfortunately and the lack of information from staff is terrible for what is meant to be a 5 star hotel ",2,2024,07,07
128,Week stay in London to visit friends and see sights.,"Excellent service: attentive & friendly.  Breakfast and coffee were top notch.   Room service food was excellent and available until very late.  And, the GM told us that they are making even more improvements.  

Short walk to St. Paul's Cathedral and Liverpool Station.",5,2024,07,05
128,Such nice staff!,I wanted a hotel near the Barbican Centre and this is just around the corner from the main entrance.  It is converted from an 18th Century brewery complex and has a variety of rooms in different parts of the complex.  beautifully decorated with an amazing staircase off Reception.  My room was neat and comfortable and on hte ground floor which is great because I have a mobility issue.  There are lifts however.  BUT the staff were some of the most helpful and nicest I have met this year.  They helped  me up and down the few steps to reception and offered to help me at breakfast etc.  The breakfast was very nice so all in all a great stay.  My one issue is that the hotel bar is also the local pub so there is no were in the main building to sit and enjoy a quiet drink.,5,2024,07,02
128,"Poor staff, unwelcoming & zero atmosphere.","I'd asked for our two rooms to be ready by 2pm (check-in is 3pm) - my colleague and I arrived circa 2-20. The lady on reception was busy so the gentleman who was behind the concierge desk came across. He went straight onto the computer, I assumed that he was going to check us in. After nearly ten minutes, and without looking up to make eye contact he just said 'surname' - no welcome or any social graces, he continued to work on his computer. He eventually printed off a form for me to sign but for only one room. He was adamant that I had only booked one room, eventually the girl on reception, who by now had finished with her customer, came and help show him where the room was on the system. It was very stressful as I was on a tight time schedule. The process seemed to take an age. There was no offer of help for bags. The staff were all changing furniture around in reception or stood around. The air-con in the room was poor, the window would not stay open and the signage in the block opposite reception was difficult to navigate. When we came back into reception staff were not friendly, did not help open doors even though they could see we were loaded with bags. There were other customers looking lost, the water jug in reception was empty, nobody senior was paying attention to detail. This is meant to be a five star hotel, the service was truly shocking and the staff are very badly trained. It is a real shame as I had been looking forward to my stay. The overall experience was disappointing and I expected far better. There are lots of good hotels to choose from in London, I doubt that I would consider staying at the Montcalm Brewery again.",2,2024,06,26
128,First class!,"As a birthday and anniversary treat I booked the Brewery for my wife and I on an evening following a special day.
From the moment we stepped into the lobby we were made to feel welcome and the process of checking in was made easy after a tiring day.
We were shown to the room by a very excited lady who was clearly keen to show us the trouble that she had gone to.
The room itself (007) was very special indeed with a huge chandelier and wonderfull decor. 
The bed had been decorated with towel swans, rose petals, and ongratulations balloons we scattered around.
Strawberries & Prosecco were also kindly left thanks to Carina Alock. ❤️
We had a small issue in the Jugged Hare at dinner but this was dealt with perfectly and would be excited to return.
Breakfast was also excellent with so much on offer at the buffet and more importantly,  great coffee! 
This place is right up our street, unpretentious, cool, relaxed but very, very Profesional. 
Thank you to all involved, you made our weekend memorable and we will never stay anywhere else in London.",5,2024,06,25
128,Good Experience,It is a very elegant and well-kept hotel. the service is impeccable and the staff very kind and attentive to customer needs. the area is served by all the necessary public transport and the connection to the airports is excellent. excellent english breakfast. To be recommended and repeated.,5,2024,06,23
128,Great location for the City & events,"I stayed at the the Montcalm at the Brewery for a business event our company were hosting at The Brewery. My stay lasted three nights, Wednesday to Saturday. Room was a good size, very quiet (note, I was on the fourth floor alongside only another handful of rooms on that floor) with all amenities at hand. Breakfast was good - continental with a full English available.

Highlights were the rainfall shower and incredibly comfy bed. Staff were friendly and attentive - particularly Alexandru. In general, nothing was too much effort.
There weren't really any negatives, but this will depend on your expectations. The wash-hand basin in the bathroom was blocked on arrival (noticed that it took a while for water to go down). This was repaired quickly. If I am in the area again, I will stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery.",5,2024,06,23
128,Bog standard average city night stay!,"So to start with the Hotel for us shouldn't be £170 a night stay! I personally this hotel isn't worth that amount of money for a few reasons. 

The rooms are very misleading in the photos for size and are actually quite small in real life! You feel trapped within a small square box. The air conditioning doesn't also work which is a nuisance for this warm weather. I also have to comment on the fact that the water pressure within both taps and shower is rather low! So if you're wanting a relaxing bath please do give it some time. We even had to use the free water within our room to brush our teeth!  

This Hotel is also like a maze once checked in and having been told to wait for concierge for 10mins it's not the most pleasant of experiences. Talking of experiences we was welcomed to an unannounced protest right out of the hotel which was quite intimidating whilst waiting to check in (Personally wouldn't of stayed if we was informed of this) Although not their fault but prior warning would of been nice as all we could then hear was loud abrupt and disrespectful chanting for hours on end during the evening! 

Another small gripe was being told upon arrival that they'd be taking a security deposit for our room which again was unannounced although having prepaid for the room. I'm still awaiting for our money to be returned.  

My last gripe which can be seen as annoying is the fact you don't also get free breakfast for the amount of money you pay to stay each night! 

Overall it isn't a bad place to stay but I won't be returning as there is better hotels out there within London whom provide a better service. Please do consider staying here if needed though. I will end with a positive and that is the staff are friendly and helpful!",3,2024,06,23
128,Extremely Disappointing!,"Very disappointed with this Hotel. 
Booked a room with Booking Com. 
The room I booked was described as ""spacious"" and the photos looked lovely. 
Very deceiving! The room was very small and very dimly lit , very tired and uninspiring to say the least.
Wallpaper had scuff marks, Furniture tired and chipped . No mini bar. Bed so soft it dipped down in the middle. 
Small window was filthy and the view was an office block right next to the window.
Loud noise from some kind of generator/ air con fan? Had to keep window closed to try and keep the noise down but it didn't really help and was on 24/7. Switched air con on as the room was very hot and stuffy. Air Con made a very loud clattering noise so had to switch it off 
Staff use the guest lift as their service lift, very rude and ignorant to guests waiting for the lift. We were not made to feel like respected hotel guests.
Went to breakfast to be told my booking did not include breakfast? I had paid £567 for two night bed & breakfast for my husbands Birthday . There is absolutely no way I would have paid that amount of money for room only!
Receptionist then said the room does include a continental breakfast 
We were escorted to a room with a small area for breakfast consisting of cornflakes and granola, bread, fruit salad & yoghurt etc.
We were the only two people in the room, no atmosphere and staff not very attentive, our used crockery left on our table.
Fortunately we were out most of the day sightseeing but arrived back to a demonstration going on outside with police presence. Private functions in the Hotel Court Yard took place on both of the nights we stayed very loud!
This Hotel does not warrant a 5* Rating.
The photos of the rooms on their website are nothing like the room we received. 
I feel ripped off and angry that this experience ruined what I thought was going to be a special time for my husband.
I strongly advise you look elsewhere and stay away from this place 
I intend to notify Trading Standards of my experience and Hotel Inspector",1,2024,06,23
128,Rubbish overnight stay - very disappointed,"Really poor quality hotel - avoid if you actually want to sleep

Arrived late-ish this evening Our room was ridiculously hot despite it only being about 20 degrees outside - the air conditioning unit did not work at all Could not get it below 22degrees 

And the room ‘emergency’ light was so bright you’d be able to read a book by it! So I won’t be getting any sleep at all

Had to physically go to reception as no one was answering the phone. Apparently they are unable to help 

Really really unimpressed Book elsewhere if you want to sleep 

Really not what one would expect from a decent hotel",1,2024,06,22
128,Not as expected - very disappointed,"I stayed in this hotel a few years ago over a weekend. I have to say it’s gone downhill. 
The ‘deluxe double’ in the photos is definitely not what you get. The photos are very deceiving and rooms are incredibly small. Minimal storage. No remote for TV, windows do not open and are unsympathetically screwed shut with air conditioning that is ineffective. Overall it was like sleeping in a sauna and was unbearable. 

The ‘luxury’ rain shower had poor water pressure and more of a ‘dribble’ and The bath took ages to fill. 

Good stuff, the bed was ok, although very flat pillows. Daily housekeeping was good and thorough. 

I would recommend other places rather than this hotel.",2,2024,06,22
128,Disappointing stay. Tiny dark room.,"Stayed 20 June for one night. Not a 5 star experience. From the start there was a long wait at the check in desk when we finally got served the lady took few minutes typing in her computer. She then looked up at me and said “sorry just struggling to find you a room”. Not really what you want to hear when you paid £££ for the room !

Room was finally allocated 138 in the south wing. The room was pitched black because it only had a tiny, very dirty window with a broken off handle. It felt like we were in a dungeon. There were stains on the carpet, room did t feel very clean, the body wash bottle was empty. There was some sort of generator outside making noise all night. We had to rush out as we were going to a concert so I didn’t have the time to ask for a change of room and luckily this was one of the stays were we did t spend much time in the room. I am however already  booked in for 7-9 July so in two weeks and I hope that the staff make a note of this so our upcoming stay is a lot more pleasant.",1,2024,06,22
128,Be wary of booking this hotel,"Where to begin, writing review from my room at 5.30am having not slept a wink all night due to a noisy/rattling fan. Tired, dirty and dated room with stains on walls and carpets. What’s more it’s the 3rd room I’ve had since arriving last night. 1st room (153) was literally a metre away from a brewery event in the courtyard that was beyond noisy, probably 150+ people enjoying themselves with food, drink and music but right outside my room, told it was on for another hour (at 7pm) to then learn it would be 11pm earliest. Then moved, incredibly to another room although higher still facing the event and being disrupted by the noise. Only having trailed to reception and asking to speak to a manager was I given this horrendous room (across the road in 621). When at reception complaining to the duty manager about not being made aware of the huge event taking place at any point pre arrival, his response was “its not a hotel event it’s the Brewery”, talk about abdication. He then said “nobody complains about the noise”, even though I was standing doing so, I would be amazed if people paying upwards of £300 for a nights stay would be pleased with the noisy tbh. Avoid this hotel at all costs, as someone who stays in London for business every week this is up there with the worst and not just based on the above, the rooms are well below the so called rating/standard, the service is questionable and the rooms (even if they don’t have a broken noisy ceiling fan) would be bang average at best.",1,2024,06,20
128,Billed as 5 stars but unless you pay the top price the service and experience struggles to make 3 stars,"It bills itself as a 5 star hotel, but if you don’t book the top price rooms you feel the difference! So there is a two tier breakfast and if you don’t book the top tier rooms you are at the mercy of the continental breakfast which had products which weren’t correctly labelled so as a person with food intolerances I felt unable to eat there meaning the “included breakfast” was useless (also almost everything is pastry or dairy based!!) Also if you don’t book top tier rooms then the breakfast area is really small and chances are there won’t be room for you to eat anyway. The kettle in the room didn’t work and there was some sort of air conditioning which made a noise regardless of whether it was turned on or not. The hotel is especially difficult to find your way around as it’a a series of listed buildings cobbled together. There are better hotels with actual edible breakfasts available for the money. 5/10.",3,2024,06,19
128,Everything good,"Very good experience. The room was very good and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was also good and well equipped. Everything was clean and as expected.
I had an issue with the key card and I want to extend a big thank you to Juliana for helping me with the key card.",5,2024,06,19
128,Love the Montcalm Brewery (London) Hotel,"I booked and made full pre-pay for one three-person and one single-person room, but the hotel could not give me a three-person room upon check-in at 9:30 pm. After several rounds of communications and rearrangements, I got two inter-connected rooms with king-size beds in lieu of the non-available three-person room. Also, the hotel gave complimentary breakfast for all three rooms that we eventually settled in. I appreciate it and am grateful because we booked a three-person room to share talks and stories overnight during our London stay. We were still able to do that with the hotel's new arrangement.

The hotel is very well situated.  The nearest tube station is Barbican.  After the station exit, it is a 3-minute walk to the hotel.  Barbican is a community constructed in the 1970s with an arts and cultural theme.  There is a Barbican Center with various arts and cultural programs.  The residents of Barbican from the 1970s have gradually been replaced by a newer and younger generation that admires the estates' architecture.

Barbican station is just one station from Farringdon (which connects directly to Gatwick Airport) and a few more stations from Paddington (which connects directly to Heathrow Airport).  It's so convenient to go to the Westminster to see the parliament building, the Westminster Abbey, and the Churchill war room!

The Jugged Hare is a pub next to Montcalm Brewery, which our friends in London recommend.",5,2024,06,17
128,Good experience,"Great comfy bed. It was clean, the room had a bath tube with a rainforest showerhead and it was pretty nice. The staff was very helpfull especially Alexandra O. who was friendly and gave us alot of tips on how to get through London!! Thank you!!",5,2024,06,08
128,Lovely down to earth hotel,"Very nice hotel. Simple, clean and with a British touch to everything. Staff was super nice and welcoming. Everything worked as it should. Water did take a little long to get hot (a little wasteful in terms of water). Otherwise very pleasant stay.",5,2024,06,07
128,Certainly not bad but needs a refresh,"Not bad, nice room and incredibly comfy bed and pillows. Quite squeaky doors and needs far better soundproofing

TV could do with a modernisation and would stay again, overall not bad just needs a refresh. Room looked quite bland and empty of features",4,2024,06,04
128,Lots of Potential,"The building is lovely (former Whitbread hq, with a pretty terraced area which I guess was the old loading bay for horse-drawn beer deliveries) in a great City location with very helpful and friendly staff.  However the rooms are tired - scuffs on wallpaper, no bathrobe, nowhere to put towels, weird lighting controls with different options on each side of the bed. The room service options are shockingly bad (especially for a five star hotel with two good dining options in house - see photo attached).  

As a solo female business traveler who didn’t fancy sitting in a restaurant alone, this was not the 5 star treat I’d hoped for.  If I was just judging on location, cleanliness, comfort and friendly service - that was 4-5 stars. For decor, layout, room service choices - barely 3 stars.  I’d love to see what a skilled designer and chef could do to improve things.

(Also note that they put a £50 ‘hold’ on your card on arrival to cover incidentals. Which is not uncommon but can be a shock if you haven’t budgeted for it).",2,2024,05,29
128,Gone downhill,"I’ve stayed here a few times over the years and it’s definitely gone downhill.

I booked with hotels.com and I noticed that I wasn’t offered any of the luxuries that are listed on the website. Where was my pillow menu? My nespresso machine? My access to the Club Room?

The bathroom also needs a refit as it’s water / limescale stained and some chipped tiles. 

However the staff are very friendly and welcoming and the building is lovely.",3,2024,05,29
128,"Great stay with attentive, professional staff","The hotel is a 5-10 min walk from the Barbican Underground station. The staff were very attentive, professional  and helpful. The staff in reception, Daniela and Yana, made the Check in/check out quick and efficient. The Club room was clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable and the facilities in the room were of a good standard that included an iron and ironing board. 

We ate in the Chillwell Street restaurant  one evening. The food was of a high standard and the staff again very attentive and professional. It is well worth taking breakfast as it is of a good standard and set us up for the day. 

We would definitely recommend a stay at the Montcalm, the brewery.",5,2024,05,24
128,Excellent customer service from the Manager (Robert),"A few issues in the first room on our arrival but these were quickly rectified by the Manger Robert and his friendly staff 
- changed room and really enjoyed the rest of our break - great location- a beautiful hotel in an historic building - would definitely return",5,2024,05,17
128,Great location but no great facilities,"We chose this hotel due its location and it was great location for our needs.
The hotel is advertised as 5 star luxury, it did not meet our expectations!
The floor tiles in the bathroom were broken and moved when we walked.
There were water stains in the shower head/screen and limescale.
The mirror was wonky.
Room size was good but facilities were dated and not very good.
Curtains were old and wonky.
Windows were old and could not open.
Corridors were smelly & old.
Bar was very disappointing and the staff not very friendly.
Would not recommend or stay again.",3,2024,05,12
128,Really great hotel and smiley  staff.,"Wonderful welcome and front of house took our bags to our Club Room which was spacious with bath and shower. Super comfy beds and pillows.  Great location for parking, Tube and restaurants.  Hotel full of character and charm. Definitely would return.",5,2024,05,12
128,Not a pleasant room,"Booked a Montcalm Club Room. Received none of the complimentary benefits. Our room was definitely not like the one shown on the website. It was dated, my towel was dirty, the room smelt. Regulars at the Montcalm East and always have great experience. This hotel I was disappointed.",1,2024,05,12
128,"Right next to the Barbican, this is a great find.","Check in was courteous and efficient and the front of house was well manned with aimiable congierges holding open the front door when you go through it. The room was very comfortable (although the mattress had a tendency to slope into the middle of the bed when we moved) and the facilities excellent. The en suite was basically a wet room and I wish we had been staying longer so good was it. We did not have time to eat dinner in the hotel but the service and quality of the breakfast was wonderful. Check out was equally painless Definitely a place to stay for more than one night. 
There is always a ""but"" and here it is. Please find an alternative to Nescafe in the rooms.",4,2024,05,01
128,5 stars and more,"From the reception to the check out I found friendly and careful staff.
I can say that expectations were largely met. Every detail in the hotel was really appreciated. From the main entrance, the hall, the courtyard, rooms to the pub.
The room was comfortable and quiet. The bed looks imperial and pillows were good and soft as well. 
Nothing in Montcalm brewery hotel is left to chance. For example, the room was full of all sorts of electrical cable outlets, accessories for personal needs (slippers, hair drier, iron and ironing board, a desk, lamps, a fridge, a complete breakfast set, kettle, cups, biscuits tea bags, two bottles of water.. just to name a few.
The room was clean and in an impeccable order.
Perfect service from the staff (reception l, waiters,...).
Hotel consistent with the environment for its British style despite being in the modern district of the city.
The location of the hotel is convenient for getting around the center and for going anywhere else because it is 13 minutes walk from Liverpool street, a hub for transpors (trains and underground).
Thank you AlexO amd Alock.
Good job",5,2024,05,01
128,Gracias!!!!,"We have been surprised, the attention to detail has been an experience that has touched us. From the moment we were welcomed, their interest was genuine and the kindness of Ramona and the team made us feel at home .... 
Just by mentioning that we are Argentinean, we were treated to a bottle of wine from our country, not knowing that it was made in our hometown of Mendoza. 
We were touched. 
Thank you for the excellence you have given us. 
❤️🥹👏🏻✨☺️",5,2024,05,01
128,5* hotel absolutely superb,"5* for sure. Beautiful venue, great staff. Stayed in the Wow Suite and  that was definitely WOW.

Couldn’t fault the experience and the room was outstanding 

All the staff were great bit we’d lake to make special mention to Alex, Carina & Alock for making stay fabulous.

Will certainly be staying next time I’m in London",5,2024,04,28
128,A bit pat to be honest,"Stayed before and was on lovely brick ceiling room and very good price , so stayed again and the room was miles away from reception like a 10 min walk and was pat, the breakfast was so cold and totes pat really not good at all and they wouldn’t cook me eggs and stuff",3,2024,04,27
128,The Wow Suite,"My stay at the Montcalm was exceptional and further enhanced by Daniela’s attention to details, helpful disposition and ability to communicate in two languages (English and Spanish). The Wow Suite exceeded my expectations and Daniela went above and beyond to make my stay unforgettable.

The Wow Suite was gorgeous and evoked a palatial feel featuring a gorgeous chandelier and a 4 post bed with one of the most comfortable mattresses I have experienced.

I especially appreciated the option of a late checkout as most hotels do not have the same flexibility.

The centralized location of the hotel was perfect as it provided several dining and entertainment options. I would definitely consider staying at the Montcalm again in the future.",5,2024,04,24
128,Worst nights sleep in a “luxury” hotel,"The hotel is nice and the rooms are top end. However - I had 5 hours sleep because there was so much noise outside of room. It sounded like an air conditioning unit and it was constant. 

The breakfast area for continental breakfast is very small with limited seating space. 

I did complain to reception but I may as well have not bothered. 

This is meant to be a luxury hotel, but I will not be back.",1,2024,04,23
128,Avoid,"Well, no shower gel/shampoo in bathroom, room furniture in poor condition. The light fixture in wardrobe was hanging loose not working! Bathroom light not working. Towel dryer electrical testing date was out of date by 4 months. Room is dark and over looked by a office block",1,2024,04,22
128,Worst hotel in London,"Stay in London a lot with work and this is the first time I've ever been compelled to write a negative review, genuinely the worst hotel experience I've had.

- I was put in a disabled room which they refused to change, staff were actually really rude about it. I didn't see or hear anyone else on my floor and even the lobby was never busy so it definitely wasn't full either.
- On arrival they demanded that I pay myself despite it already being prepaid through work, after the stay the travel agency confirmed they'd made payment and the hotel would give me a refund. Still trying to get the money back multiple weeks later.
- Room was really old and tired.
- The drains in the bathroom stank, you couldn't turn the noisy bathroom fan off, half the tiles in the bathroom were loose and neither the tap, nor the shower went below lukewarm in temperature which meant the tap water was undrinkable.
- Provided drinking water was two tiny bottles, rather than two liter bottles that most other hotels provide.
- Layout of the bathroom was bizarre, the towel rail was on the complete opposite side of the bathroom to the shower and there was nowhere else to hang them up nearby so you either had to leave the towel on the floor (which wasn't very clear) or had to make the entire bathroom wet to get your towel, so you got your feet / socks soaked going in for anything else the rest of the night
- The bed was really short, I'm not amazingly tall at 6'1"" and my feet hung over the edge.
- There was a bluetooth speaker in the room that they hadn't cancelled the alarms on which someone else had programmed in, I didn't notice this fact though until it went off at 3am and woke me up.
- The room service menu had about 3 things on it, one of which was tomato and basil soup for £10. The only main meal they served was pizza.

All this for £270 per night (excluding breakfast), incredible value.",1,2024,04,22
128,"Creativity, caring and proactive nature of the staff","If i have one ask for The Montcalm management is to look after the excellent and professional staff they have very well. My special appreciation goes to Juliana, Alexandru, Syed and Alok for going going extra mile to make my stay a memorable experience. Clearly people and technology makes a massive difference in creating great guest experience for an organization particularly a hotel. Well done in hiring great people, well done in motivating your staff to delivering beyond best to your guests.",4,2024,04,19
128,Exceeded expectations.,"So after reading mixed reviews I was apprehensive about our stay but had done extensive research to know what to expect. We arrived and was advised of the £50 damages fee to pay, which we did and was shown to our room. I confirmed we had booked a montcalm club room but was shown to a montcalm double. We went back to reception to advise of the error and were immediately shown to the correct level of room to ensure we were happy, which we were and we transferred to this room. The club lounge was great for both evening drinks, which we were constantly topped up, and the morning continental breakfast. The room was spacious and clean. Few amenities missing- the nespresso machine, which they sought within 5 minutes of me raising it and the complimentary mini bar, which I was advised they no longer do despite it still being advertised on the website. Lots of people on trip advisor not happy that this is a 5 star hotel and their expectations are not being met but we had a fab time. Few issues we had were resolved promptly and the staff were very attentive,  especially in the club lounge. We will certainly be returning. My advice would be to manage your own expectations, if you expect high level 5 star accommodation you need to be realistic with the price your are paying. You get what you pay for and actually we felt this was an absolute bargain and cannot wait to return. Thanks for a great stay x",5,2024,04,16
128,Not 5* - very run down,"We stayed in ‘club room’ through booking on booking.com and definitely felt as though we were being treated like second class citizens. 

Despite the name ‘club room’ it is not one, and you are not entitled to use the club room bar or any of the services offered. The room was very tatty and dirty  (see pictures) and not what is expected from a 5* hotel. The switches by the beds and usb ports did not work and when we reported this, the man behind the reception said ‘yeah, they don’t’, only after we continued to complain did he say they would send someone to look at them (we don’t know if they did, but they didn’t work when we got back).

Some Customer facing staff had very little grasp of English and struggled to understand us which should not happen in a 5* hotel. 

You need to pay extra (£95) in order for rooms to be decorated for a birthday - we mentioned it several times and not even a birthday wish! Customer facing staff did not seem to want to be working there. Very disappointing!",2,2024,04,14
128,Loved it!,"Had the most loveliest 2 night stay despite being rudely awaken by workmen right underneath our bedroom window at 7.45am
on the Saturday morning. Booked the hotel to celebrate our 15th Wedding Anniversary and emailed before our stay to advise and we were so very lucky to be upgraded to a Montcalm Club Room no 107 The room was so spacious and did not disappoint. Unfortunately we were rudley awoken by workmen out side our windrow at 7.45 Saturday morning. 
My husband phoned through to reception to complain and after. brief discussion they offered to move us rooms and gave us a complimentary breakfast. We stayed rooms (due to checking on a website that stated works on a Sunday only take place in emergencies) We accepted  the breakfast which was lovely, we could not fault it so much choice!  Buffet full English, Greek Youhurt, pastries, muffins, bagels, smoked salmon, fruit, cereal, continental... The list goes on! Ate far too much 
The bed in the room is so comfy. Toiletettries were all good quality and lovely shower.
Could no fault the reception staff so friendly and helpful! Alock on reception always had a smile and hello when ever we came back into the hotel.
It did take 7 days for the £50 refundable deposit to be returned to my card. 
The location was good, close to Moorgate station and bars & restaurants in Shoreditch 
Will 100% return if we ever return to London for a special occasion!",5,2024,04,14
128,Amazing hotel,"Stunning hotel, my boyfriend let them know it was my birthday and they very kindly decorated the room with balloons. Daniela was an amazing member of staff, helping us with an upgrade to a wow suite to make my birthday even more special. Will definitely be coming back.",5,2024,04,08
128,A lot of much better options in London,"We stay 5 nights at this hotel in the beginning of April. The best first... The service level the girls at the front desk offer the guests is first class and always with a smile. I am more than happy with that. When it comes to the hotel and the rooms it is far away from first class. Yes, I say rooms since we get a room with broken sofa and air condition not working. Then they give is a WOW Suite with yes broken sofa and air condition not working. I will that this hotel need a big renovation. The cleaning is not top nodge either. 5 stars? In todays condition I will say 3 stars. The breakfast is nothing to be happy for either. In the breakfast room the service level is far away from the experience at the front desk. Some of the employees at the breakfast room was mad with each other in the front of the guests. At least for the amount you pay for this hotel, you can find a lot of better hotels. Even some of the new Premier Inn hotels have much better rooms. It should not be like that. If we now this we would choose another hotel.",2,2024,04,07
128,Charming Overnight Crash Pad,"I had a one night stay in this central, modern hotel near Moorgate (chosen for its proximity to the tube line to Wembley, and for a short walk to work the following morning). Check in was friendly, charming and efficient and my bag was carried to my room (a nice touch). My hotel room was clean, well appointed and with good environmental controls. The decor was a little worn in places, but it had lovely refreshments, toiletries and a very comfortable bed. All staff I encountered were pleasant and smiled and available to answer my questions. The location is great - near to tube stations, train stations and bus routes. There were plenty of shops, pubs, and restaurants in the surrounding area. The hotel is on split levels so I had a few short flights of stairs and corridors to navigate - fortunately I had a small case, it might have been difficult with heavier luggage or for someone with accessibility needs.",4,2024,04,07
128,Carina and Aleck are excellent hotel ambassadors,"Carina and Aleck kindly facilitated an early checkin. As I waited for my room, they gave me a cup of coffee. I could tell that my stay here this week will be fantastic due to the exceptional hospitality. The hotel is beautiful too with all of the amenities I require.",5,2024,04,07
128,Charming Hotel,"Reception by receptionist Daniela, very professional and friendly. Also the concierge very professional and friendly.
Charming hotel, very comfortable.
Comfortable room, large and spacious.
Based in the city of London , very easy to move from and to the hotel.",4,2024,04,06
128,Disappointing former favourite,"We’ve stayed here a few times before and always enjoyed lovely experiences characterised by a sense of luxury and cleanliness.  

Unfortunately, this stay was marred by a tired room which didn’t feel too cared for or clean: there was a stain on one of the bedside lights, what looked like blood on one of the pillows, scuffed cupboards and drawers and loose shower fittings which made it impossible to drain the bath.

What had always been a really positive memory has been soiled by this weekend’s experience - despite a warm welcome upon arrival, the hotel’s standards don’t seem what they were pre-Covid.",2,2024,03,31
128,Amazing,Daniela was very friendly and helpful. We were received straight away and quickly. The rooms are clean very good and we were able to deposit our luggage at the receipton without any problems. Daniela looked after us from the beggining to the end.,5,2024,03,28
128,Great!,"All perfect! the attention was superb, and the room was perfect. Special thanks to Juliana the receptionist, who made our stay really easy. I do recommend this hotel which is also close to the City of London main companies.
I didn't try to have breakfast due to time constraints, but next time I'll surely have feedback to give :)",5,2024,03,22
128,An ideal London business trip,"Superb stay - highly recommended.  Location is ideal, facilities are beautiful.  Historic and charming, yet modernized (e.g. room appointments are great).  Had an issue in my room location with plumbing.  The staff member Juliana (and her colleague Alex) really went out of their way to accommodate me.  Incredibly attentive and generous despite a problem that no one could have foreseen.  This place is great!",5,2024,03,21
128,Definitely not 5 stars,"Stayed here as I was attending a work meeting. Hotel is ok but no where near the 5 stars they claim to be. Room was tired with ripped wallpaper.  Bedding was 2 star, bed hard lumpy and uncomfortable. Room had a musty unclean smell, bathroom bin broken, marks on curtains, toilet not cleaned properly, smell of sewage in corridors.  Very noisy from street and people in the hotel. Wasn't told where to go for breakfast when checking in and Room service options were awful. If I had booked and paid for this hotel myself I would be looking for a refund.",3,2024,03,15
128,A brilliant adaptation of the old brewery and a well appointed hotel,The greeting was warm and inviting. As the room wasn't ready and we were early we were offered tea/coffee while we waited. Features of the old building are visible with cast iron elements and much exposed brick features in the building. The bedroom was modern with all the usual additions. Having booked the Club level the facilities were across the covered way in one of the adapted buildings with its own staff and service providing evening drinks and nibbles as well as a light breakfast. The hotel is adjacent to to an attractive events centre with a magnificent cast iron staircase and a large event space.,5,2024,03,13
128,Nice enough - but not 5 stars,"I picked this hotel as it was a convenient location for my work trip.

The entrance is a bit faded looking as is the room.  I was in a club room but was not advised that I had  access to the club lounge - maybe I didn’t who knows- and wasn’t told where I needed to go for breakfast.  It turned out that was in the club room, continental only ( not made clear on booking) but was nice with a good selection including smoked salmon and avocado .

The hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren and the tiny gym was almost impossible to find. Like most things here it’s the small details that let it down - no water available although lots of empty bottles, pencil to sign in was blunt and unusable. It’s a bit like the room, the bed was comfortable but no robe, fruit or minibar as promised.

It’s a decent enough hotel and I’d stay here again for the location but they either need to change their website to accurately reflect what they offer ( and perhaps lose that undeserved 5th star) or deliver what they promised and train up front of desk to provide all the information needed.

Big shout out to the lovely gentleman concierge who directed me to the gym in the end !",4,2024,03,12
128,Montcalm London City,"A pleasant one night stay, made all the better by Daniela thanks to her professionalism and hospitality, who went over and above to make sure my stay was enjoyable. The club lounge was nice and relaxing, worth the little extra to have access in.",5,2024,03,08
128,December stay,"We came here for our Christmas break! It was a lovely hotel, room was small but cosy. Bed was lovely and comfy. The downfall was that the room was absolutely freezing, with no heating,  and the floor in the bathroom was stone. If there hadn’t been robes and slippers provided it would not have been an enjoyable stay. Quite a walk to get to transport!",4,2024,03,03
128,Weekend away,"Was very happy with our Room.  Larger than expected. Clean. Only thing I thought was missing was a house robe.  But I will definitely be returning
Staff very friendly. Shame the on site pub had a private function so closed.  I would stay here again though",5,2024,03,02
128,Alock deserves a raise!,Staff went above and beyond! First time staying here and did not know what to expect. Room had everything that is needed for a short stay. Will definitely be back :) Thanks Alock for being so helpful. Every hotel needs an Alock! Lovely features in the building with an impressive history.,5,2024,03,01
128,5 stars for Alock,"Lovely rooms/building, super handy location. Rooms are well kept and are well stocked for toiletries.

The staff at the front desk were very helpful with late night requests, kudos especially to Alock for his superb customer service skills!",5,2024,03,01
128,Great service,"The service from the front of the house, Alock, Juliana, and Carina was fantastic. They were very friendly and made sure we had a great stay. They also made sure we were allocated to a room with perfect decorations as requested for our special occasion. I highly recommend staying at The Montcalm !!!",5,2024,02,25
128,Can’t really fault this!,"A friendly welcome on arrival, concierge walked us to our club room across the courtyard- which was very comfortable, although a standard double is a squeeze!  Nice quiet location, well appointed bathroom, Breakfast was epic and good vfm for London. Will return soon as it’s a perfect location 5mins from Moorgate Tube.",5,2024,02,24
128,Birthday Experience!,"We came over the weekend for my friend’s birthday party to the Montcalm at the Brewery Hotel. We mentioned earlier that it’s my friends birthday, Alex O. & Carina organized a very nice treat! We had an awesome experience! They are super attentive and decorated the room with balloons & champagne. 
I would definitely recommend to stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery Hotel!! We will definitely come back very soon.",5,2024,02,18
128,Check your bank account,"Confusion at check in when I asked to store my bags and was rudely told my room wasn’t ready. That’s why I’ve just asked to store my bags? My £50 authorisation fee still hasn’t been paid back to my card, I have called and emailed but still no reply. It’s a shame as this is a nice hotel, but I would urge all guests to check their bank statements.",1,2024,02,15
128,Service beyond belief!,"I revamp to London almost weekly. I have also been around many hotel, I have note recieved a welcome and service like I did from both Juliana and Beck. Honestly, can my even explain how welcoming they were. From the moment they welcomed me, it felt like I knew them all my life. I wouldn’t even expect their great service at a top class 5 star resort! TOP CLASS, personal experience!!! 10/10",5,2024,02,07
128,Excellent spacious room. Super comfortable. Luxurious hotel. Fantastic receptionists.,"Staff was very helpful, timely and kind. Room space was finally normal. Most london hotel rooms are tiny. Very comfortable rain shower and calm environment. Location is great and elevators are available. There some stairs to take with your luggage for certain rooms though. I am sure you could get help if needed.",5,2024,01,29
128,Definitely Never Staying Again!,"I stayed in this hotel about eight years ago and remember having a positive experience. I stayed again at the weekend due to having a Buy A Gift voucher, and I was quite shocked at how tired the hotel is now. 

Our room was very small and VERY tired. Wallpaper and fittings were falling off the walls, blown wood on most of the furniture, stains on the bedding, frayed towels, some lights not working. It didn’t feel clean either. The room was very dark with horrible dull green lighting that felt almost clinical. The bed felt small and dipped in the middle which was uncomfortable. 

I really hated being in the room to be honest and couldn’t wait to leave in the morning. 

The corridors were also very scruffy – stained and ripped carpets, marked walls, stained tiles in the lobby. 

To top it off, a false fire alarm went off at 2.30am. But atleast the system works! 

The staff were all very polite and welcoming. I can’t fault them and it’s not their fault that the hotel has become so run down. 

Fortunately we were only sleeping and showering here due to visiting friends. If I had been staying for longer than I would have asked to move rooms.

I’ll never stay here again and I’m very glad I didn’t spend “real” money on my stay.",1,2024,01,23
128,Not 5 star but very comfortable,"A little bit tired in terms of furniture and fittings, not quite 5 star but pleasant, friendly staff, especially Shahid on reception. Good location, quiet for London, especially at the weekend. Room was small but comfortable. Happy considering the price I paid.",4,2024,01,22
128,Do not bother booking here...,"Very dissapointed with this hotel.
The reviews were so good we thought we had landed on. On arrival the lobby area was very cold.
We checked into room 108 which was also freezing cold. We put the heating on and the bathroom was so cold you would think you were in the north pole - you couldn't stand on the tiles bare foot as it was that cold. We complained to reception who notfied us our heating was broken, the handle on the bathroom door was broke so it was letting all the cold in, the rainfall shower in our room didn't work either. We were given 2 portable heaters as it was 11:30pm. The next day we moved rooms to 017 which was much better but the bathroom was smaller - but warm at least. Also this room had a double bed whereas the previous room had a king size bed.
Breakfast was £19pp per day, and on the second morning at 9am (breakfast ends at 10) they had no sausage left. We asked them to cook more but they said no - at £19pp this is disgusting. Also the plates at breakfast were cold - so food went cold instantly. We saw someone had ordered a mcdonalds breakfast to their room and wish we had thought of the same idea!!
Fire alarm went off accidently at 2:30am and woke everybody up.
The bridge from the main building to the south wing is freezing and the building smells of sewage.
If you had a room on the front (like a family member did) you will hear alot of noise. The photos on here and booking sites show a bar, the hotel does not have bar but is joined onto a bar - which closes at 11pm and staff in there are rude.
I would not bother booking this hotel at all - i'll never stay again.",2,2024,01,22
128,A great holiday experience,"Excellent customer service and a wonderful stay, with quality amenities.

The interiors were very classically beautiful, and that enriches the London experience. 

Special thanks to Carina for her patience, good attitude and helpfulness making our stay much more enjoyable. 

Thank you all very much for a lovely stay",5,2024,01,21
128,Good hotel and better staff.,The hotel is wonderful but the experience was made even better by the staff. Hotels in London usually have small rooms and they are spacious rooms. I would especially like to highlight Daniela's treatment because she makes the trip special. We are delighted. The bed is perfect even if you have back problems.,5,2024,01,19
128,Perfect location and very nice stuff,"The hotel it’s nice but needs improvement. The location is perfect for visiting around the central London. We had some problems with the heating but it was fixed quickly.
The receptionist Alex O she was one of the nicest receptionist we have ever met. She helped us with everything we needed.  100% we will be back",5,2024,01,16
128,Definitely not a 5 star hotel…!,"The room was pretty small and with low ceiling, without proper windows and not as shown in the pictures. We booked a Deluxe Double room and got a small tiny room about any light coming from the window as I was sealed. In the description it points that the windows open partially but it was not possible. Very claustrophobic.
Not recommended...!",1,2024,01,15
128,Terrible… Old and Shabby!!,"This hotel is not even close to 5 star! What a joke! Furniture is delaminated, hallways are a terror with holes, marks and a very dated old look, and shabby/old looking rooms. The whole hotel is tired and dated. The bathroom shower faucet is so corroded it has no finish left. It’s plain awful!! No other way to describe it! There is also not much choice in the way of restaurants around it and is not near major sightseeing. 3 star at best. DO NOT STAY HERE. How do the star ratings get changed because stating this is a 5 star is false advertising and very deceiving!!",1,2024,01,12
128,London stay in the city,Very poor service from this hotel. Didn’t have our room ready till 6pm and mayhem at check in. We was offered free breakfast witch consisted on toast and jam. It’s a good value hotel for London but very far from a 5* hotel. Maybe we just hit a bad time but I wouldn’t stay here again.,3,2024,01,12
128,Lovely hotel. Value for Money,"Lovely stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery. Good value for money. We had booked 2 rooms and requested they were close by to each other and they were next door. Both rooms were lovely - comfortable beds, really spacious, good shower. Only downside all in all was one of our rooms was really dark. Very small window and not enough lights in the room to light it. We weren’t in the room that much but getting ready in a dim light was tricky! The other room was bright with more lighting in the room and a huge window. Luck of the draw. Lovely hotel in The City of London and I would book again.",4,2024,01,11
128,lower your expectations and you'll probably be happy,"Booked the hotel at their website.  Seemed very nice.  I booked the special club double bed room that provided access to their club lounge.  Upon arrival, we were checked in and given a ""Club Room"" but no mention of the lounge, despite hearing them mention it to the guest who checked in right in front of us.  When I inquired the agent seemed confused.  They asked me to show the where it said i was supposed to have club lounge access.  I did that.  The other agent standing next to them said he would ensure our keys had access.  We were shown to the room through a filthy and smelly hallway that led to the adjoining restaurant, the Jugged Hare.  When making the reservation I was asked to pre-reserve my pillow preference and room scent preference.  Both selections were absent in the room, as was the fresh fruit basket that was supposed to have been there.  This particular room had a very small oval shaped window that was at floor level and was maybe two feet tall.  You literally had to bend all the way to the floor to see outside.  Because of that, the room remained rather dark most of the time.  There was literally NOTHING special about this room, what-so-ever.  A little later we decided to check out the ""Club Lounge"".  Our keys didn't work.  I went back to the front desk, again had to show them my reservation that showed I was supposed to have access.  They fixed the keys and showed us to the Lounge.  We had access.  It was a fairly small room with a few tables.  That's it.  Nothing else.  I went back to the front desk to ask about the ""Club Lounge"" and see if I was missing something.  They advised that breakfast was available between 7am-10am and an evening cocktail hour between 530p-730p.  We did end up going for breakfast and coffee several times and it was nice.  The gentleman working there in the morning was very friendly and accommodating.  Never made it for the cocktail hour.  

To sum all of this up in fewer words, don't expect much.  The staff were friendly enough.  The rooms just okay.  The property, meh, nothing special.  The location, okay.",3,2024,01,09
128,Good choice,"I loved the room, it was very confortable and clean
The Staff also was very kind, specially Daniela from reception who helped me with a few requests
I just have to say that it not so close to the tourist attractions but you can find restaurants around and the underground was enough close
I think relation quality and price is very good",5,2024,01,09
128,Amazing room. Amazing service 10/10 bed is comfy and the room is so clean. Would 100% recommend. The restaurant is amaz!,Daniela is a diamond! The room is perfect she helped me surprise my partner with lovely flowers and champagne. Got upgraded my room and it’s amazing. The staff our lovely and they helped us to our room. Such an amazing place. Thank you all. Especially Daniela ,5,2024,01,06
128,Great experience at The Montcalm At the Brewery London City! Definitely visiting again!,"Everything about the hotel was perfect. The reception was very welcoming and knew some greek words to welcome us which I found sweet thank you Alex O! The room was very clean. The bed and pillows were so comfortable! The bathroom was very clean, every day we got fresh towels. We went earlier than our checking time, but they let us let our luggage to the concierge which was very convenient to us. Also there was a lot of underground stations nearby.  Everything was great!",5,2024,01,03
128,Excellent ,"Excellent service provided by the staffs alock and daniela. Really enjoyed our stay . 
Room was also clean , comfortable and cozy.. The bed was perfect, air condition was good. If you have any appointments in VFS its near to the office . I will strongly recommend the hotel and services. ",5,2024,01,02
128,Avoid not worth the money,"Stay 31st december  1 night. Good points. Bed comfy tv good shower lovely worked well nice hot.
Bad points. Freezing cold room ask at reception they said Maintenance would look at it never made any difference at all. Cold from when got in room till check out. No dressing gown or Toothbrush was given once contacted reception.  Only 2 Sugars two milk no teaspoon to stir the tea. Usb dint work so phone dint charge. Floor Tiles in bathroom broken very dangerous could cut your feet as sharp. I paid good money for a deluxe double room. I have stayed in much better Accommodation for half the price. No Restaurant but does say food available.  That maybe the £19.50 each breakfast. 
Definitely not going back to stay there again. I will be emailing the mangerment tomorrow. ",2,2024,01,01
128,Best location and staff,"Very nice location. the room was very clean big, and has all the amenities that we need. The girls in reception were very helpful specially Daniela, who give us a warm welcome and l lovely welcome card! She was very professional and polite with me and my wife. ",5,2023,12,31
128,Pleasant ,"My overall experience was great. The bed was really good, as well as the rest of the accommodation! Super nice staff. Near the Barbican underground station, Tesco and you have a pub just across the street. 100% coming back.",5,2023,12,30
128,Nice,"The location is great to explore London with lots of attractions accessible on foot, and easy access to the trains. 
The best thing about this hotel is excellent service and welcoming professional staff! Special thanks to Alex O. She made us recommendations for what to visit and where to eat. I appreciated the fact that we received water bottles every day for free. ",4,2023,12,28
128,Daniela,"During my stay at the hotel I felt very welcome and cared for by all the staff, but especially by Daniela. Always ready to help and make my stay more pleasant!",4,2023,12,27
128,Wonderful place ,"thoroughly enjoyed my 2-day stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery Hotel. The impeccable service, luxurious accommodations, and attention to detail exceeded my expectations. The central location, coupled with the elegant ambiance, made it a memorable experience. Highly recommend for a delightful stay in the heart of the city. And special mention to those people at the reception, Alock, Alberto, Alice and Daniel. They really provided wonderful services. ❤️",5,2023,12,26
128,Good staff,"Very good staff, I stayed with my wife in this hotel and Daniela was always very attentive. She is very kind and professional. She recommended us different places and restaurants to go to. and she chose a very nice room for us.  The room was clean, the location is very good and it has everything you need.",5,2023,12,23
128,Daniela ,"I’ve came here with my family and I cannot be more grateful and happy with the attention I received from Daniela. She’s very professional and polite ! Helping me every time I needed.
She’s making my stay very nice. 
Thanks to all the team!!",5,2023,12,23
128,Influencer in London,"I'd love the treamtent, Juliana and Alice was so kind and lovely <3
the room was clean and smell good.
there are free wifi and is really fast, if you have to upload or make business call si perfect.

128,Perfect for a getaway in London,"The best thing about this hotel is excellent service and welcoming professional staff! Special thanks to Alexo. The room was very comfortable, and the location is great to explore London with lots of attractions accessible on foot, and easy access to the trains. Highly recommended!",5,2023,12,21
128,Needs stars regrading,"You can tell why this place has 5 stars, but it probably needs reviewing and bringing down to 3 stars.

They clearly haven’t been up keeping the hotel, mainly the communal areas. The lifts have scratches and graffiti in them, the communal carpets stink and have multiple stains in. 

That being said, the reception area feels classy and the room wasn’t too bad. The duvet cover had stains on which I didn’t see til the morning and felt horrified that I had slept in it.",3,2023,12,20
128,Lovely hotel and exceptional staff and service,"The room has everything you need and comfortable but the selling point is the staff. 

Very friendly and helpful

Alex, on reception was particularly helpful as she found us a room after a long overnight flight and could see we were exhausted.

It was raining the day we left and we wanted to have breakfast and all the staff rallied around to find us an umbrella.

Really friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend",5,2023,12,19
128,Lacking quality control,"It was just one problem after another!
Broken shower; including the temperature stuck on hot (health and safety issue) as the dial comes off the wall, the plug didn’t seal so a bath wasn’t an option and the dial to change from bath to shower head was a struggle to turn off! 
The pillows was so soft, I woke with a bad back! The air con did very little so I woke several times in the night too warm!
We complained about the shower and was offered a 2nd room to have a shower, however it was the opposite side of the building so had to venture across (outside) in pjs (a complete mess) to a single room which meant no consideration that we would need more towels for both of us to have a shower.  The shower in the 2nd room was also broken as the door then would not shut so we ended up soaking the en-suite which made it very slippy and on reaching for the towel available, someone else’s lingerie flew onto the floor!
This is suppose to be a 5 star hotel! 

The receptionist when I made my final complaint was very attentive and offered a complimentary breakfast and a part refund.",2,2023,12,18
128,Could be better,"I’ll try to be as fair as possible.  
First impressions were amazing, staff friendly on arrival room on first view looks amazing.  

But when the initial excitement of seeing the room wears off the reality sinks in.    The bathroom was tatty,  the plug hole was filthy the bath took forever to run and water was warm at best.   The dust on the mirrors behind the coffee machine was terrible.  Wall paper was peeling in places.  

Positives.  Bed was very comfy pillows were plush had a great sleep.  

Location was perfect for where we needed to be.  If I had to mark out if 10 I’d give it a 6/10 

Just needs a refresh and some updates.",3,2023,12,17
128,Comfy but room needed some TLC,"On arrival I was offered the wing outside I was worried it was the annexe I’d read about in trip advisor and very quickly Alock changed this for me and I got a room in the main building. 

My key card says Mrs Alexis when I’m Miss which is annoying. 

Room was a good size. Curtain hook at end wasn’t in so gap where light gets in, I stood on the chair and fixed this. Internal window wouldn’t close but external does. 

212 the heating was broken maintenance came within moments of me calling, reset it and returned to check it was working; it wasn’t. So maintenance brought me a plug in electric heater which along with my travel hot water bottle was sufficient but surprised no one tried to fix it next day. 

Desk needs resurfaced or replaced. Lot more dust in lights than you’d want. The desk has 2 drawers which my legs bang against when working at the desk.

The shoe protector thing on end bed was stained on outside and inside looked like blood on it.

Weird the tv had a padlock on it I assume it prevent removal! 

The hand held shower isn’t working half the water comes out the hose not the shower head, there’s a waterfall shower too. Reported this and a lightbulb out in bathroom and bathroom mirror light on checkout.

The shower screen has a gap if you stand under rainfall shower the water comes through it and soaks the toilet paper. Plug in bath the pull and turn knob didn’t work and whole thing came out in my hand.

Quiet room comfy bed good sleep. 

I had do not disturb on at 13:17 housekeeping kindly checked if I needed anything clean towels etc and dug me out extra Jings Earl Grey :) 

Fantastic food at the Jugged hare. There weren’t any seats in restaurant but was served the restaurant menu in the bar which was perfect. Service was also excellent. 

Overall the service at the hotel was great but expected bit more attention to detail in the room itself.",3,2023,12,17
128,Not Honourable and true to their word.,"I booked 4 rooms for an awards ceremony at The Brewery directly with the Montcalm reservations. Received confirmation from them stating such.
At check in, I was told that there were 5 rooms booked for us. I explained that this was incorrect and gave all the reservation numbers that we had. 4 rooms were used.
Breakfast was extremely disappointing. A small room with an off-room with continental offerings. But there was hardly anything there. We had to ask for top ups of orange, bread for the toaster, milk, croissants etc. Really poor.
When checking my bank a few days later, I found that they had taken payment for 5 rooms. I rang the hotel and spoke to the very nice lady who checked us in on the day and remembered the mix up. She put me on to her manager. I explained the situation and she said that 5 rooms were booked by me and that as one was a 'no show' i would still have to pay. She was having none of it. I rang the reservations team who directed me back to the hotel. I was again told that 5 rooms were booked and I would have to pay for the no-show room. 
I forwarded my email confirmation to the Duty Manager at the hotel, which clearly stated that there were 4 rooms booked. She then replied saying 'Please note the amount has been reversed however thus (sic) can take 3/5 working days to reflect into your account.'
Surprise surprise, no payment has been received and I have had no response to my latest email asking them to call me. So I am £384 out of pocket now. 
I have since learned that this is not the first time that this trick has been pulled off with them. 
So please be careful. If you must stay here, check your bank!",1,2023,12,14
128,Sh*t Show,"Don't waste your time and money, the room was cold because the ac didn't work we called reception and were ignored. To top it off I still have not received my deposit from the room 3 weeks later,the email address given on their website is bogus. Don't go please",1,2023,12,13
128,Warm welcome from AlIce,"Nice stay Thursday 23rd. Warm welcome from Alice who helped sort out my booking issues. Quiet stay in 252.  Early alarm call by a bin lorry and 10,000 empty bottles being added fo lorry.   Wouldn't bother with breakfast  bead comfortable and room clean",4,2023,12,10
128,Nice stay in the East End,"Alexandra on the front desk was really helpful. In the morning, we were offered complimentary coffees which went down a treat. 

I found the room nice, clean, and spacious. The bathroom was a surprise as you could look straight through a glass partition/window and into the bathroom. I suppose this is somewhat romantic, but not for all activities! Positively, this glass partition/window had shutters, which you could use if you wanted some privacy.",5,2023,12,07
128,Disappointing visit for husband's birthday treat,"A very disappointing stay.  Asked for a room with a shower not a bath, not too much to ask one would have said.  Checked in had a room with a bath!  Queried this was told hotel was full, not sure they could accomodate but eventually did but it took them almost two hours to sort it out.  I am glad I wasn't in a wheelchair because the room we were given had the wash hand basin one side of the bathroom, mirror the other and very cold.  To add insult to injury the room was over the pub that adjoined the hotel and music was still going at 1am.  Quiet weekend not.  TV didn't work with remote so you had to get out of bed to switch on and off.  No toilets rolls in the room so had to ask for them.  Heating didn't work reported both but nothing happened while we were still there.  We had to change our returning back home plans due to the train strike so needed another night, no chance at this hotel so we booked the premier inn down the road which was excellent.  If you want a luxury break don't book this hotel! Oh and just be aware that the two bottles of water in the room are not complimentary we were charged £5 for using one of the bottles.  ",1,2023,12,05
128,Great service ,"Juliana was fantastic on the front desk. Very friendly and helpful .

Would be 5 stars if breakfast went on longer!  Looking forward to the days of full English again in jugged hare

Thanks again for a great stay ",4,2023,12,05
128,Excellent location but even better front desk service,"Excellently located hotel in the city of London - very close to Liverpool St station for those taking the Elizabeth Line from Heathrow.

What sets this hotel apart is the excellent customer service at the front desk. We had the fortune to be served by Alex O, who once realising we were on a post wedding city visit, made sure that we received excellent treatment and in our room. Alex O and her Manager (I didn’t get his name) made our stay so memorable, thank you so much. The Montcalm is lucky to have them!",5,2023,12,03
128,Anniversary Trip,"They really made it special for our anniversary. Reeg really hooked us up. Led us right to our room.
My only complaints is that it can be quite labyrinth-like, but that's not their fault. Also, I couldn't figure out the shower, but I think that's my fault. ",5,2023,12,01
128,Weekend trip to London,"Great service from staff. Everyone was very welcoming and attentive. The guest satisfaction personnel, Daniela, was the sweetest. The room was clean and had everything we needed. The location was favorable for the underground and the hotel was easy to access and find.",5,2023,11,27
128,Best staff,Me and my friend were completely surprised with how warm and welcome was everyone. Specially Daniela received us with an amazing welcome. It was impressive how Daniela made us feel like home and so comfortable in the hotel. She was very attentive and that was something we aporecciated a lot. We needed a person that made us feel like we were taken care of. At the end of the day she was always there for us and helped us have a better stay. Thank you so much for this beautiful experience. I can‘t wait to come back and hope to see Daniela and the fun turkish guy! Both full of beautiful energy!,5,2023,11,27
128,Amazing Service and Stay,"Exceptional stay at The Montcalm, London! Juliana's reception service was outstanding, providing warmth and efficiency. The rooms were a highlight – impeccably clean and wonderfully maintained. Highly recommend for a memorable London visit!",5,2023,11,27
128,Comfortable ,"Room was ok, the see through glass between bedroom and bathroom lack privacy as the blinds were unable to close. 

I had the pleasure of interacting with Alice, the receptionist at the Montcalm at the Brewery Hotel, and I must say her service was exceptional. Alice went above and beyond to ensure my experience was nothing short of great. Her dedication to customer service is truly commendable. Thanks a lot, Alice, for making my stay memorable!

128,Great staff,"Reeya, Juliana and Alexandra on the front desk are an absolute credit to the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble and my wife and I had a lovely stay. Thank you so much for making our stay such a happy one!",4,2023,11,23
128,Good overall but with a HUGE MINUS-no breakfast included.,"Very nice and proffesional staff, especially girls at the check-desk Alex, Karina and Alice, but also all the other staff members - male and female- very nice and willing to help. Nice hotel in general but with one HUGE MINUS- no brakfast included in the price of the room. Really a HUGE MINUS. And if you want a breakfast it is very, very expensive for the hotel-25 £! For this reason I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone even though the staff and the hotel is good in general.",4,2023,11,22
128,Best Birthday night everrrr,"The hotel was absolutely stunning and the staff members were so nice and helpful, they were able to answer all my questions and assist me with any queries I might have. Juliana was so amazing she helped my check out process very smooth and she even complimented my nails me and her could have easily been friends 😂 . The hotel room and bed was stunning and the bathroom omggg definitely put the bathtub to use 😂and the bed and pillows I literally slept like a baby  ill definitely be coming back I had a wonderful  stay .

128,"Fantastic value for money, great location and a room full of character","Absolutely fantastic stay. A real all round pleasure from the moment we arrived. We was greeted at reception by a member of staff, shown over to the reception desk where we needed to check in. We were looked after by Juliana, and what a credit to your business she was. Polite, friendly, warm and attentive, it was a pleasure to meet her. The room was wonderful, it had a real sense of character that you don't often find with rooms in London. The room had everything we needed, the shower was fantastic and had great pressure to it. The bed was comfy and ensured a great nights sleep. The location is perfect, we noticed no street noise and there is a Tesco express just across the road too. We will be back to stay again soon!",5,2023,11,20
128,Much like a maze,"This hotel might have 5-star features, however it is certainly not 5 star standard. I was in the West wing on the first floor; to get there one must go up and down circa 5 flights of stairs - much like a maze, it is easy to get lost.. In the room, could not control the temperature. The oversized bathroom (booked into a Montcalm Club room) needed a refresh, with chrome bits in the bath ""peeling"" away, and again, the room simply too cold.",2,2023,11,20
128,"Excellent stay, thank you for everything",Absolutely wonderful and helpful staff. Free upgrade to room for my mother's 70th birthday and breakfast. Staff were so attentive and friendly. Rooms clean and lovely decor. Not far from Moorgate tube or the Elizabeth line. Would 100 per cent recommend. ,5,2023,11,19
128,Amazing stay,"We had an amazing stay, all staff were very attentive. Made my girlfriend's 21st very special. Would like to mention how accommodating Juliana was. Always greeted us with a smile and was very helpful if we were in need of anything. The room was decorated perfectly for her birthday as well i must add!",5,2023,11,19
128,Gorgeous rooms & incredible staff ,"We had the most amazing stay for my 21st birthday. The staff were incredibly attentive and made my stay so special by decorating the room with balloons and petals. We also had some help from the amazing Juliana who was incredibly kind, helpful and served us with a smile every time. I cannot recommend this place enough!",5,2023,11,19
128,Good nights sleep ,"Lovely spacious room. Comfortable bed and I slept so well (highest sleep score in Fitbit for a long time). All staff friendly, professional and polite and it was good to be able to leave bags with concierge. No bathrobe in room but not a problem. Will definitely stay again next time I am in town.

128,Great guest | moderate conditions | Pleasant stay,"Alex O and Corina were super hospitable at the reception, recommending places to visit, great restaurants and making our stay very pleasant. Class A service! The rooms were large & clean, good hot temperature and good wifi. There are things which could be improved, like having a window which you could open and a restaurant facility.",4,2023,11,14
128,Travelled from Ireland,"Just superb, our booking and fantastic stay was managed by a very professional young lady named juliana, she was delightful and so very very helpful, an absolute pleasure to have met her. 
We were able to check in much earlier than expected and were delighted with the room.",5,2023,11,14
128,Juliana was a real help to us.,"Excellent service and help from Juliana on reception, enabling us to have one of our six rooms early to get changed for a lunch event at The Brewery. Superbly appointed room and excellent breakfast. We will be back next year!",5,2023,11,14
128,Excelent experience at the brewery,"Excellent stay, facilities and the personal was simply one of the best that I had exeprienxe in the hotels i  London. Juliana at the reception was   very competent! Next time in London I'll stay here for sure.",5,2023,11,14
128,Nice stay,Had a nice stay here at the weekend. Reception staff were very friendly. Room very nice. Comfy bed. Was on 3rd floor of east wing looking out on the yard. Very quiet. Bathroom was a good size with decent shower & shower gel. Stuff was provided to make myself a coffee in the morning. 14 minute walk to Liverpool Street station,4,2023,11,12

128,"Very good location, close to tube, clean rooms.","Alice from reception was absolutely very helpful. She arranged everything and helped to resolve every minor problem. 10/10 for her. 
Concierge was also very helpful.
Clean rooms, good location, close to tube, movie theaters and lots of restaurants and pubs around.",5,2023,11,09
128,Fabulous,Great room. Very comfy. Juliana at the front desk was especially helpful. I was a bit out of my depth in another country and she was calm and thoroughly helpful with every question I had. She even anticipated a few questions I did not know I had.,5,2023,11,07
128,ALOCK,Thanks to Alock. He managed me delicately and kindly provided many services such as breakfast and cell phone charging when he couldn't enter the room due to his friend's special situation. It was the best service to experience in the hotel. I want to visit again next time. I gave you a £5 tip and spicy sauce as a gift before returning home. I hope he is always healthy and happy.,5,2023,11,07
128,Lush abode to make stay comfortable ,The room was big and very comfortable with nice fluffy bathrobes! The service was excellent and Juliana at who checked me in was very sweet and helpful!!  Only drawback was the water pressure for the bath..,4,2023,11,04
128,Great customer service ,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Montcalm hotel that provided an exceptional reception experience, and I cannot praise it enough. Juliana gave me a warm welcome and was the epitome of hospitality, showing efficiency and professionalism and being very accommodating to my circumstances - really great experience and well done to Juliana",5,2023,11,04
128,Hospitality near the barbican,"The staff was excellent, we were made to feel very welcome. 
A special shout out to Alice and Alex O. at the reception and the gentlemen at the concierge desk. If one is attending events or concerts at The Barbican Centre, the location is unbeatable. We would definitely return!",4,2023,10,31
128,Great Customer Service!,"We were staying for 2 Nights and sadly there were some issues with our Room. 
We went back to the reception, and they helped us straight away. We got moved to a different Room and everything was perfect.
Things can always go wrong but the way you deal with it is What really matters to me. 
And Renjith did a fantastic Job! Thank You very much for Your excellent Service. We are looking forward to our Next stay at your Hotel.",5,2023,10,29
128,Home across the pond,"The Montcalm in London was an excellent stay. It was close to the Elizabeth line that brought he is in from the airport. The hotel staff were all very warm and welcoming, especially Zhanna..The room had all the small details to make our time in London feel royal. I plan to book again when I return. ",5,2023,10,28
128,A real gem of a hotel,"What a find the Montcalm Brewery is.  Excellent service throughout, the room was clean and well equipped and very quiet.  Comfortable bed and, although the glass wall to the bathroom was a bit weird, all worked well.  
We were greeted by Alexandra at reception and throughout our stay the staff were highly attentive.  I particularly loved the yogurt for breakfast.
All in all I highly recommend The Brewery City at the Barbican.",5,2023,10,28
128,"In need of modernisation, but excellent staff","Overall our stay was decent. The overall condition of the room is not up to par with a 5 star hotel. Our assigned room was really dirty with stains on the walls, loose tiles on the bathrooms, stains on the carpets and chairs. 

The location of the hotel is very good.

Alock was the star of the show and made sure that we had a comfortable stay by assigning us to another room.",4,2023,10,26
128,Nice quiet place in the middle of London ,"The room was nice and clean the service was excellent and they helped us with everything. There's a very peaceful yard and that means the rooms are very quiet, shielded from the noise of the main street.
The location is near a lot of city attractions and very close to the barbican estate.",5,2023,10,23
128,"Cosy room, friendly staff and overall good experience","I recently visited the Montcalm Brewery in London and had a good experience. The ambiance was great, the staff were friendly, and the bed was very comfortable. The only downside was the lack of room service. Nonetheless, I recommend this place!",4,2023,10,22
128,Good experience overall,"Good experience overall. There were small incidents, but nothing dramatic. The front-desk lady, Alex O, was very helpful with everything. The breakfast didn't have many options, but was good. They also have options for vegetarians.",4,2023,10,21
128,Over priced,"Room outside of main building so walking in the rain to accommodation. No window in room. Temperature control broken for 2 out of 3 days. No wifi signal. No room service available. Water in room never replenished. TV kept loosing signal. Towels thread bare. 
Not even worth 3 stars.",2,2023,10,19
128,Avoid rooms East Wing if you want to sleep,"We stayed at the hotel  evening of Sat 7th Oct.  I didn't sleep a wink due to The Brewery venue which is located on the other side of the courtyard to the East Wing of this hotel.
There was no noise issue from the function itself, but they clearly have a team of staff that work overnight clearing up as staff were still working  past 4am.  There was banging doors, shouting, constant wheeling of trolleys across the cobbled courtyard.  It was truly a night from hell.  I phoned reception at 2am and then at 3.15am and they said they had spoken to the workers at the venue who said they would finish shortly but they didn't.  The Brewery clearly has no respect for the hotel or it's guests.  So if you have to stay here, please ensure you are not accommodated on the East Wing.  The other problem was that The Brewery left it's lights on all night.  Clearly no probs paying energy bills there.  But while our room had curtains, the curtain pole did not extend the length of the window and so the lights were shining it all night.  It was my worst hotel stay ever.  I spoke to reception the next morning and a lovely receptionist listened to my complaints and was understanding and said she would ask the Manager to speak to me.  The Manager couldn't be bothered!  The receptionist was told to offer me a 20% refund however I had not booked directly with the hotel but with a booking site, paying considerably more than the invoice the hotel showed me and from which the discount was being taken.  I had not asked for a refund.  I feel that the Manager should have dealt with this and not left it to the receptionist and for a business, it's quite unbelievable to me that the Manager did not step out of her office for a few minutes to hear of my really rubbish stay so it's made me think that complaints are frequent.",1,2023,10,14
128,Friendly and Professional Service,"What a wonderful stay I had at the Montcalm Brewery, from start to finish, I really feel spoilt and valued. I've stayed here multiple times, and this is one of the only hotels that I know that really acknowledges their loyal customers. The Duty Manager Zhanna is highly professional and ALWAYS greets you with a smile.  the rooms are upgraded with all the modern cons (coffee machine, new decor) and so clean!  I would gladly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,10,10
128,Lovely hotel . Pleasant staff,"Lovely hotel . Pleasant staff   , we were able to check in early which was a bonus . Juliana very plrasant on reception. We will definitely be returning to the hotel.We were also upgraded to a club room which was a nice surprise. Good location for busting around the monument area and London Bridge area,",5,2023,10,08
128,Great stay ,"Large comfortable rooms & amazing staff 
Enjoyed the location and how welcoming this place is. Also got upgraded to the suite 

Will definitely come back to this hotel 
Close to stations and very accessible ",5,2023,10,04
128,"Super hotel, staff and facilities ","Swift efficient service from the moment I approached the front desk.  Very nice room, super quality bed. Tasty breakfast, only marred by ignorant person using their phone. 
Check out as smooth as Check in. ",5,2023,10,02
128,Not good,"checked in and got to the room. Definitely not a 5 star by any means more like a 3. Air con didn’t work. Windows only opened about 2 inches so room was unbelievably hot. Tiles on bathroom floor weren’t secure so kept lifting when you walked on them. Do not disturb sign did not work for the door. Wallpaper peeling off the walls in different areas. Bath plug was broken. Room was really small and quite dingy. Someone had put black masking tape on the ceiling to cover up a green light.. all night you could hear people flushing the toilet and the water running down the pipes at the side of the room. Would not return here. Booked on the premise of a ‘Luxury’ 5 star, worlds away from this. If you want a nice hotel in London, visit leonardo hotels (where we usually always stop)  they are superb compared :)",2,2023,10,01
128,Not as advertised ,"Nice enough hotel but they advertise room service yet they don’t provide this, as a solo female business traveller this is not acceptable. If you expect room service from a 5* hotel don’t stay here. Only option to go out late in London to eat was not expecting this. ",3,2023,09,21
128,Not a five star hotel at all,"Bad organisation, front desk not knowing what to do, aircon in rooms not working. Definitely not 5 star. Rooms are small and why I know as I stayed in 3 rooms in 2 nights. AC didn’t work in room 1-they moved me, lost my hairbrush in this move and housekeeping could not look or were not bothered to look for it. Room 2 small very small and shows it’s age. Room 3 suite and small sleeping area on a mezzanine.",2,2023,09,20
128,"Great location, lovely staff badly maintained","Great location, lovely staff, but badly maintained. AC didn’t work, no water or shower due to pipe leak, room not made up, had to call for water, no mattress topper only loose sheet. But having said that great location and staff did care despite 5 calls to reception . ",3,2023,09,17
128,"worst hotel, most dangerous for health","worst hotel, most dangerous for health

i will take legal action

tried to call emergency services to expose them

all staff said not their problem

all lies, they say room service but no answer

they say aircon but not true with no window   am at 30 degrees and rising

",1,2023,09,12
128,Major Incompetence!,"What a farce of a hotel. Stayed mid July and was put in a room with air conditioning that didn't work. The maintenance guy came, fixed it, but said he'd probably have to come back as would likely break again.

I complained to reception who moved me to another room which was actually warmer than the one I was in so complained again and so eventually moved for 3rd time. I was told I would be given a complimentary breakfast but would be called or emailed- never happened and as I was leaving early I wouldn't have been able to have it anyway.

I have complained 8 times and only once had a reply (email number 5) where they suggested I book another room and I will be given a free upgrade. I'm not parting with another penny to stay at such an incompetent hotel where they can't even do the basics.

I stayed here in 2014 when it was a fantastic hotel but has sadly declined rapidly.",1,2023,09,12
128,Repeat visitors!,"We’ve stayed here at least 3 times now. Our visits are always so smooth! A big shout out to the reservations team for all of their help! The room was very classy. Clean, simple with all the essentials you would need; iron, ironing board, hair dryer etc!

Breakfast was brilliant too!

Looking forward to our next stay!",5,2023,09,10
128,Grim ground floor room,"Room 10 is utterly grim. The room itself is adequate but the ground floor window lets in no light , and the reason is that there is a huge air conditioning duct right outside the window. And this leaves you with a persistent and loud hum all night even if you switch off the room's own air conditioning.
I suspect that rooms 9, 11 and 12 all suffer from the same issue.
If you get offered one of these rooms, say no thanks. ",2,2023,09,07
128,Hunting For A Twin!,"Great location for transport & enjoying a weekend in London's City district

We'd booked a twin but somehow found ourselves in a lovely four-poster double with see-thru bathroom wall! 

We could see immense efforts had been made to welcome us for friend's birthday with balloons & towel swans but we were missing a bed! It was only a small double in size so a twin was definitely needed & was what had been agreed to make up for a previous booking that hadn't gone well

Luckily the hotel wasn't full so we were escorted around another 4 rooms some doubles  (??!!) & plumped for the one that had 2 beds ready made up & a street-side opening window for air

Overall was clean & well appointed Beds were comfy enough & had small shower room with extra touches of robes slippers & bath products

Lovely breakfast buffet - hot food perfectly cooked with the softest scrambled eggs ever in a hotel Thanks
Chef 😋 The Chiswell Dining rooms look a good option for pre-theatre eats too

Booking up the spa at the sister hotel got sooooo complicated we gave up the plan as you CAN'T take your bags over there.. couldn't therefore understand how you would go with your swim things & wash bag - use pool/spa with nowhere to leave belongings - then come back with your wet swim things We couldn't seem to be understood as to why this was problematic & no suggestions came from either of the hotels around managing this.. perhaps bring a separate sports bag if you'd like to make use as it's advertised

Would I stay here again? NO Lovely friendly front-desk people but they've had their chances & just didn't understand that running around a hotel for a few hours isn't what we'd booked up for no matter how many birthday balloons & beautiful towel swans we're given

Might give the pre-theatre menu a try & there's a pub I'd recommend coming for the breakfast if you're in the area & if it's available to non-residents ",3,2023,09,04
128,Great stay,My room was great and very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and chic and I had an amazing stay for which I have Ioana to thank for! She provided the best service I’ve ever received at a hotel and I’ll definitely be recommending The Montcalm to family and friends. ,5,2023,09,04
128,"Dated, scruffy and messy. Dissapointing.","Scruffy and dates hotel, needs a revamp and a tidy up, the reception area is nice but the rest is very tired. Our deluxe double room was tiny, pitch black with no window, we have stayed in the same level of room at another Montcalm and it was perfect. We were upgraded after we complained but the corridors were littered with service trolleys and laundry carts and smelt very bad! The courtyard had wooden pallets dumped on the paths which the hotel said they cant move because the courtyard doesn't belong to them but they show you to your room via this courtyard and expect you to climb over the pallets. When emailing to raise my concerns after my stay as I had another stay there coming up, I was ignored for weeks despite me calling twice, was then told the courtyard isn't their problem, no apologies for the stay not being what we expected etc and no acknowledgement of the photos I took of stuff laid around in the corridors! Disgusting customer service from what should be a high end hotel. The Montcalm Royal London is miles better. Very disappointed. ",2,2023,09,04
128,Truly exceptional level of care and service,"Absolutely exceptional level of service. A beautiful hotel that hugely exceeded our expectations on every level. Superb value but most importantly, on arrival we were treated like old friends and no request was too much trouble.

Highly recommend and many thanks to Asfanjya for making our stay so memorable and we look forward to returning again next year.",5,2023,09,03
128,How this is a 5 star hotel I'll never know ,"Don't get me wrong, the staff here are excellent. Dressed smartly, efficient, professional and friendly. 
The room itself? I've stayed in 3 and 4 star places with better soundproofing (I stayed in the east wing) 
I could hear cars from street level which as you can imagine isn't ideal in the early hours. 
The shower/bath combo wasn't the easiest to use so ended up not bothering 
The room we stayed in had scratches on the walls and gashes in the wallpaper - as well as a nice thick layer of dust in the harder to reach areas - I'd expect that in a bed and breakfast maybe but not something that claims to be 5 star.
There was a funny electrical noise from the towel rail in the bathroom so didn't touch that either. 
I'd love to be more positive but there really isn't a huge amount to be positive about -
It's a very convenient area to stay in, and it's a really nice old building. ",2,2023,09,01
128,I won’t be back here again!,"This is the second time I’ve stayed here and it’ll be the last. I had a poor stay pre COVID and put it down as a one off. However never again.
I arrived 30 minutes earlier to be advised that I had to come back in 30 minutes. There was no check to see if the room was ready as you would normally expect. I felt that I was putting them out paying to stay here.
When I eventually checked in I was taken to a club room, which was an upgrade to what I booked. Great I thought. I dropped my bags off as I had to leave to be somewhere. When I came back later that evening I noticed that out of the 3 blinds in the room 1 had no cable to move it up so that was permanently down. When I lifted it to see why I noticed no window handle and the window was in poor condition. The second blind worked but the window wouldn’t open at all. And the 3rd blind in the bathroom was non existent. So if you wanted a shower at night with the light on anyone who’s room faced your bathroom had a free show!.
I sat on my bed to read a book and went to move the reading light only to find it was broken and was jammed inside the bedside lampshade for that reason.
Definitely not a patch on the Montcalm London City and Mable Arch.",2,2023,09,01
128,"Lovely hotel, terrible service.","This is a beautifully appointed hotel, with a warm welcoming reception and genuinely historic courtyard. The rooms are well-equipped and comfortable, with superb beds, and lovely bathroom.
That's the good stuff.
Unfortunately the service is very, very poor. From being left in a queue to check in and out, while a second staff member comes and goes with papers, to an empty concierge desk, one felt unimportant and ignored. 
Phoning down to book breakfast results in being told to return to reception (presumably in pyjamas) to pay for it. Refusal results in being put on hold for so long, one quite reasonably hangs up. Outcome? No breakfast.
To be fair, this all stems from an under-trained staff, who clearly don't know what they are doing. Ultimately, there is a failure of management, meaning I won't return.",3,2023,08,31
128,Very hot room!,Stayed here before a business event. The staff were lovely however the Aircon in my room didn't seem to work and I asked for assistance and no one never came. Unfortunately this resulted in quite a poor night's sleep. I would stay here again as the location is sound however I'd hope the Aircon would be powerful next time! ,3,2023,08,31
128,Just wonderful,"Just wonderful. The staff were very friendly and super attentive. The room was superb and the bed was so comfy with feather pillows. The breakfast was fantastic with a superb selection of continental and cooked goods. A wonderful stay in 5* luxury, highly recommend.",5,2023,08,27
128,We will be returning…,"Beautiful hotel entrance.  We’d already been upgraded via email due to checking room availability and found our room we originally booked was substantially less than we booked it back in May, as we were staying 3 nights. 
Reception team were polite, especially the young lady who checked us in, we were in an accessible (requested) Club Room, with complimentary use of the Club Lounge, including continental breakfast included. We opted for hot breakfast at an additional fee which is served from the Chiswell Dining Rooms. 
Room was huge, only a double bed tho, where most budget hotels you get a king size bed.  Elmis toiletries in the huge accessible shower, complete with overhead rain shower.  The Website says fruit in the room, there was non provided, which tbh doesn’t bother us per say as fruit is free from the lobby along with ice fruited water.  
Breakfast each morning was lovely, continental was also available to go and help yourselves too. 
Now my only issues, lighting wasn’t 100% working in the room or bathroom (mirror),  no room service or any information in the room. Tea & coffee facilities great, but at 5star you’d expect a nespresso machine at least, with a good selection of biscuits, not Crawfords like I had at school 30yrs back.  Room just need a bit of care and attention to make it 5star, 
All in all we had a lovely time, and will return, but it’s just the little things that make something just so much more.",4,2023,08,21
128,"Great location, first class staff and room. Excellent choice.","We stayed here for a night to enjoy a day out in the City of London. Can’t recommend it highly enough. From our arrival staff were super friendly and helpful. The opulent reception reflects the quality of the rooms and the location is fantastic to walk to loads of fab pubs and restaurants. Nearest tube station Moorgate is only 5 minutes walk away which makes it super easy if you get the fast trains to St Pancras. 
In the room, shower was superb , bed huge and I would definitely upgrade to a large room because it was one of largest rooms I’ve enjoyed in the City. The price was very reasonable considering all I’ve commented on above and to be frank I really can’t fault it.  We did not stay for breakfast but friends of ours did and were so impressed they were sharing photos of it while we were on the train home. 
All in all a great recommend and if you’re out in this area you won’t find better for the price. We will not look any further when we’re next in London for a night out.",5,2023,08,20
128,Beware.  AC doesn’t work,This place sucks.   It’s 4am.  It’s hot.  The AC doesn’t work.   The front desk guy sent someone to fix it who came to the room and declared that it worked because it was blowing air.   But the room temp hasn’t changed all day and it’s F’ing hot.  Nothing better than some good old fashion gas lighting by hotel staff.   ,1,2023,08,17
128,Amazing stay : thank you,"Amazing stay. The stay exceeded our expectations and was perfect. Thank you!
From the location, the facilities, the value for money all the way to the superb team we were delighted. 
We would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend our friends and family to also.",5,2023,08,15
128,Perferct and calm,"We have really good time at the hotel. All the staff were great. Great  value for money. Big thanks to shahid at the réception. We will definitely come back. 
Great location and staff

I will advice everyone to come to the hotels ",5,2023,08,15
128,Great location and rooms. Manager and reception staff very good. Concierge friendly.,"The hotel was in a good location and the rooms were outstanding especially for the price. However, the hotel was very hard to find but we felt very welcomed on arrival once we found it. Gorgeous fresh fruit bowls, umbrellas for guests to use and fruit infused water in reception area was a lovely touch. The only downfall to our experience was that our room was entered twice (that we know of) while we were in the room with no knock? Once at around 6pm. We had fallen asleep as the beds were extremely comfortable and we had been traveling all day. Then again at 8:30pm with no knock or a call while I was indecent. Went down to reception as obviously very concerned by this point of our safety that our room was being entered so easily and the manager assured me that he would find out what had happened. I must say he acted very quickly and made several trips to our room with updates! He assured me at first that he spoke to housekeeping and that it wasn’t them that entered the room and that he would check the cameras. He then said that he checked cameras and it was housekeeping. This was a weird back track but I work in hotels myself and know that sometimes communication between absolutely everyone can be difficult. Overall a good stay and wouldn’t let this ruin it as it was rectified very well and obviously just a miscommunication.",4,2023,08,12
128,Welcoming experience ,"Loved the hotel reception and ambiance 
If you’re looking for a stay in London 

The receptionist Waheed Khan that attended to us at check in is very knowledgeable and a credit to the hotel.  Because of Waheed Khan, I’m tending towards a five star ⭐️, however, the room we stayed in was pretty cramped and would recommend more options for breakfast. Breakfast was very ‘healthy’. No fried eggs option 

Overall, hospitality received from Waheed Khan was superb
It would have been a five star if above options were available 

Highly Recommend",4,2023,08,12
128,Good in parts,"Lovely historic hotel with friendly, helpful staff.
Room was fine with a very comfortable bed and a massive bathroom.  However there was no information on the hotel, facilities or local area in the rooms, which was strange.  I was also made aware (after we left) that we should have had a complimentary fruit bowl in the room which didn’t appear.
The big issue for us however was the lack of soundproofing between rooms and between our room and the corridor.
Our neighbours were by no means noisy but we could hear every single word of their conversations-and also the arrival of late night/ early morning guests. In addition from around 5am, we could hear the noise of what sounded like trolleys being wheeled over the yard at rear of the hotel where our room was situated. All this made for a very sleepless night.  I mentioned this at checkout to reception staff and they didn’t seem at all surprised; obviously a common complaint.
It’s such a shame as the hotel was lovely but would not stay again due to the noise issue ",3,2023,08,07
128,Excellent service.,"Staff at the perfection was so professional and polite. 
Rohit recommended me this hotel and it was great place to stay. Rohit and Alius made our stay even better by providing excellent service to us.  I would definitely recommend my friends and family to stay at The Montcalm at the brewery hotel. ",5,2023,08,05
128,Lovely lovely stay,The room was decorated on request and it was amazing. The communication was really good it was All organised on time with the grateful help of Zhanna and Emanuel. Thank you both it was really lovely of you both .,5,2023,08,05
128,Lovely stay,"Fazil was so kind, polite and attentive. He looked after us for the whole weekend and showed us to our spacious club room. We would highly recommend the Montcalm which was clean, cosy and comfortable. ",5,2023,08,03
128,Nice staffs,"Excellent stay at this hotel.
Thanks to ANAM, he was very nice and made everything go smooth for us for this trip!
He provided very great service.

All the staffs are nice. Muhammad is also the other staff that made our trip nice here.
Hotel facilities are good. I will come back to visit again.",5,2023,08,03
128,First impressions tempered by poorly maintained bathroom,"We booked an overnight stay via Expedia. We got an excellent price for a 5 star hotel and we’re therefore naturally very excited to check in. On arrival we had a shortish wait whilst one of the receptionists seemed too busy to serve us but eventually someone else became free and was quick to help us (as well as quietly speak to her about it). Nice checked in and show. To our room we were both fairly impressed, it was small but we did not expect huge. There was a lovely brick ceiling and, what appeared to be a well appointed bathroom. 

After a reasonably decent nights sleep, I got up to shower and that’s where the issues began. Initially gettin the right shower to work was a challenge, then the bath began to fill but the dial for the plug was loose. Eventually I got everything just right when I picked up the shower gel from the shelf, which promptly fell off and it’s sharp, heavy (glass or Perspex) shelf narrowly missed my foot, if it had hit there would have been quite an injury. The lighting around the shaving mirror also did not work.

I did complain to reception on check out and after a brief apology they assured me that maintenance would be straight onto it. No help to us obviously,but hopefully someone else will not have the same experience. 

It was a shame that the poor standard of the bathroom spoilt our visit.  It certainly did not make me feel it was a 5 start experience by any standard.",3,2023,07,31
128,NOT 5 stars,"If you Google this hotel you'll see the following - ""Montcalm At The Brewery: 5 Star Hotels Near Liverpool Street"" but this is not a 5 star hotel.

It's a nice enough today, but it isn't good value for money.

Our (first) room was a bit on the small side.  The air conditioning didn't work so we called reception.  Maintenance soon arrived and we were told that the AC in this part of the hotel wouldn't be working until at least 48 hours later as a new condenser had been installed and needed to settle.

We then made a further 3 phone calls before we were offered a new room.  Each time we called we were told someone would call back so from first phone call to being shown to our new room was about 90 minutes.  Not very 5 star.

As well as the faulty AC, there was a faulty light switch next to the bed and the silver colour on the rail in the bath was peeling away.  Not very 5 star.

The new room did at least have working AC but it also came with a poorly maintained bathroom.  The 2 mirror lights had different colour temperature bulbs in them, one was white, the other very yellow.  The shower cubicle was quite small and the left hand door kept wanting to fall off as the roller at the top wasn't attached.  Not very 5 star.

So all in, it's a nice enough today but it's not nice enough to warrant that price tag.",2,2023,07,31
128,Average city hotel but affordable,"This is an ok hotel.
Tired and need of update.
Room amenities are average.
No minibar.
Can't open the windows. aircon loud.
Hallways are a maze, can't find way out
Lift was out of order
Service on desk was ok
Price is affordable if u are stuck in town",2,2023,07,30
128,Always a pleasure!,"Last minute booking through booking.com and this hotel never disappoints! Has a stylish but quaint vibe as you cross the courtyard to your room. Always immaculately clean and the staff are absolutely fantastic. We checked in about 9pm and were upgraded to a club room which was a very pleasant surprise! its our go to when hitting the town for drinks as it’s close to Barbican, Moorgate and Liverpool Street. We were offered breakfast and didn’t have it this time (due to sore post cocktail heads!) but when previously staying -  visiting the brewery for breakfast is pleasantly different and the food is lovely! Thank you again for having us!",5,2023,07,30
128,Best customer service from WEHRED KHAN,"I’ve been here for about an hour and honestly the best service I’ve ever experienced ever, I tried to upgrade on booking.com for days but their website wasn’t working but weheed saved my day, thank you",5,2023,07,29
128,Nice hotel,"Sachin in Reception was very kind and helpful. He helped us to upgrade our room and a nice breakfast at the hotel even if we booked in the last minute. We had such a nice time, we will definitely be back, 100% recommended! ",5,2023,07,27
128,Will definitely be staying again!,"Possibly the best customer service I have experienced at a London hotel! The receptionist, Renjith, was so welcoming and attentive! I had an issue with the room and received a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience. The room was spacious, clean and stylish.",5,2023,07,26
128,Our best hotel experience!,"Had trouble with the door to our room and the hotel staff were so helpful and changed our rooms and went out of their way to make sure my boyfriend had the best birthday.
Great customer service, will definitely be returning! 
Sachin was so kind and took care of us! Thank you!",5,2023,07,25
128,Great,"We had a great stay at the hotel. All staff were so friendly and helpful! 
Especially Anam who did everything in his power to make our stay even better, we had a great night great food including the lounge which was our favourite bit",5,2023,07,25
128,Dissappointing,"I've stayed at the Montcalm several times. Breakfast advertised in the Jugged Hare from 7am but was closed at 8am. Offered if i prepaid full English only in Chiswell St Dining Rooms. Didnt want that. After finding the cafe over the road closed too they told me eventually they would offer complimentary continental breakfast in Club rooms. Eating options seem pretty limited for a hotel that size.
On arrival evening before room was like ice. Had to go out for a couple of hours whilst we had turned up the heating. Got back after a meal out and tv didn't work. Too late to complain so went to bed. It seems the attention to detail has been lost in this otherwise good hotel. Not sure how it claims a 5 star rating",3,2023,07,23
128,Checked in and had to walk five blocks to my room,"I checked in at Montcalm the Brewery after a fairly painful trip to get there, and was told o had to walk “just down the street” to Montcalm Royal London House, where my room was. 

Five blocks later, after shlepping my suitcase along London’s broken and crowded pavements, I had to check in for a second time all over again. Neither hotel was particularly nice: old and in the case of the Royal London absolutely packed full of boozers on check in. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid, unless you like unpleasant surprises, inconvenience, entitled staff and tatty furniture. Acts like the Ritz, feels like the neglected stepchild of a tired Travelodge.",1,2023,07,21
128,Not up to standard,"This hotel seems overrated looking at the reviews? 

Cleaning is below standard, there is no room service and the hotel bar is the pub next door.

Checking in, key cards for the room did not work - not even the master key card for the reception staff. We got an upgrade in room due to this, which was nice, though, but….

Cleaning staff forgot to change the shower soap, did not provide towels, did not provide new service, did not clean bedside tables, did not change bed sheets etc.

Looking at the hotel Facebook page, the market room service - breakfast in the room - this is not available.

I am afraid hotel stars are a bit excessive and wishful thinking.",3,2023,07,17
128,Very cozy ,"I had a long delay of my flight and booked the hotel for the night.
The reception is very welcoming, the rooms are wide and the bed is very cozy. 
The location is a bid distance from the center (10-15 minutes by taxi)
You have a welcoming kit of water, 
At the room, you'll find full bathroom kit, fridge, and iron. 
",4,2023,07,15
128,Excellent ,"Amazing stay with excellent staff and the room was spacious, all in a great location will definitely stay again soon for business or pleasure. On checkout we even got complimentary take away coffee, nice touch ",5,2023,07,11
128,A little on the tired side perhaps,"I stayed for 2 nights and had a generally decent experience. The staff were all really friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The room was clean, but was definitely in need of an update. The curtains did not cover the whole of the window which meant light coming in as soon as the sun came up, around 4:30am. There was some large furniture in the room which hindered access around the bed and made the room feel a little dark and gloomy. The mattress had definitely seen better days and could have done with replacing. However, the location is great and the building is lovely, so I would probably book another stay.",4,2023,07,07
128,An impeccable stay at a drop dead stunning hotel!,"From the warm and welcoming reception from the staff to the stay at one of the most stunning looking hotels ever, it was an experience that exceeded my expectations to the max, I’m so looking forward to booking with you guys in the near future again!",5,2023,07,05
128,Very bad experience,"1- when check in the room was not available but reception asked to pay immediately the total of the six nights
2- the air conditionning did not function with a very warm weather in London. And we understood that they only had 12 Rooms with effective AC. In some Rooms, you cannot open the window. So be careful when booking your room.
3. When we asked for a discount for thé discomfort of sleeping in a very hot bedroom we only managed after long argumentation to get 10% off. So one pièce of advice don’t pay upfront make sure you keep some leverage. ",1,2023,06,25
128,Tired and grubby,"Tired and grubby.

My room was a small room- not deluxe as advertised.

The room had crumbs on the carpet that clearly a previous guest had left and hadn't been cleaned up in between them leaving and me staying.

The bed was comfortable. Temperature of the room was comfortable. In-room refreshments a little bleak, no coffee machine, no Bluetooth speaker, a selection of cheap biscuits in the tray was provided though.

All in all, it's an okay place to stay. 

The hotel needs a good clean !",3,2023,06,22
128,"Very underwhelming, with lots of problems","Just recently retuned from a very underwhelming stay at this Montcalm hotel. This was not our first visit - we like the location as its suitable for events around North London, and we had something on in islington. The barbican is always an interesting area - very quiet on weekends, but stuff to see, and lots of history. This is not an ideal area for tourists - and transport links are not great - best bet is Moorgate station for Northern Line. 
The hotel is an interesting building, and as many have said looks nice. But the staff are so disinterested its almost comical - our receptionist barely said 2 words - and when we had some issues with our room the staff could honestly not care less. And sadly there were quite a few issues - which pushed this review down to a 2 star. Firstly room keys didn't work - twice. had to return to reception to sort this. Then, at around 5pm no hot water in the shower - needed to get ready for a night out. we complained - 30 minutes later maintenance came up to have a look - flicked a switch in a cupboard in the hallway - but by that time we had to depart. 
We noticed at the same time the room phone was disconnected - the junction box was broken, and the wire connected to nothing. We also pointed out the AC was faulty - flashing red the whole time on the panel - with no air coming from the vent. This problem was obviously beyond their onsite staff - it did not get fixed during our stay, and we suffered a hot night in an airless room.
These lazy issues were slightly offset by the very cheap rate we paid via expedia - we used our points, and the nightly rate was low anyway - now i can see why. 
Other amenities are fine - honestly nothing special.
The next morning the staff did not even speak to us long enough to see how our stay was - perhaps they already knew the answer...
This is most certainly a 3 star hotel - book on this basis, and have low expectations and you may well be happy.
We remembered it being a lot more comfortable in the past - but now you have so much choice, there really is not any one compelling reason to come here - unless maybe you have to be right next to the Barbican centre perhaps.
",2,2023,06,18
128,Great value for the location,"Easily accessible from a number of tube stations (if coming in to Paddington you can get to Liverpool Street directly on the Elizabeth line, and then it's a pleasant 15 min walk), this centrally located hotel is very reasonably priced.
Not only was the standard price very good for this sort of hotel in this sort of location, but they were quick to offer us an upgrade - which is always welcome!
The room was clean and comfortable with a large, well equipped bathroom, and aircon - which did seem to be struggling a bit on a very hot day, but was better than nothing. Bed was soft, but not too soft - it was a bit of a climb though, anyone shorter than 5'6"" might need a leg-up!
Check in was very slow and the staff on reception seemed distracted, we found ourselves being asked the same questions more than once, but after we had gotten past the front desk the concierge was very helpful in leading us to our room, and then again after check-out as we needed our bags looked after while we went for a walk.
In all a positive experience, and when you consider price and location, it's hard to give it any less than 4 stars.",4,2023,06,15
128,BED BUGS INFESTATION AT BREWERY. RUN AWAY!!!,"************ JUST A SHAME *********

I stayed at the Brewery for 2 nights from May 10th to 12th, room 404. When I woke up on 12th, I horribly discovered bed buds on my bed and many bites on my body. To be noted that when you sleep in a place with bed bugs they stick to you clothes, fabric... If you unfortunately take some back home it becomes a nightmare to remove, a lot of money.

>> Personal issue: many bites on my body, had to throw my 2-days clothes and bags to ensure I was not bringing that back home which cost me more than 3,000 EUR to replace everything.
>> Gesture of good will by the Customer Care which I had a lot of back-and-forth and sent evidences (pictures and videos): ""my offer of full refund for your most recent stay and possibility for a complimentary one night stay in next 12 months, if you choose to stay with us once again at The Montcalm at The Brewery London.""
>>Todays status: no refund of my room, no refund of my loss, no caring about my health. Just nothing done by the hotel and silent mode since.
>> My next step is to call the local health department and explain the situation so what happened does not happen to other visitors.

************ JUST A SHAME *********

No way that I put a foot again at the Brewery. No way that I again stay in any of the Montcalm. In case you plan to stay in this hotel and you see this commentary, think twice!!!",1,2023,06,13
128,Worst experience. Not a 5 star as described.,"Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel. Would rate it a 3 star as has no facilities and issues described below.
Booked the Montcalm club room as central reservation recommended it being a better room, with facilities such as club lounge access, room bar, spa access and a larger room fully renovated etc.
Club lounge access is not as described. It’s a dated dark room with few beverages and no food. Definitely no chef for canapés . It’s crisps and peanuts.
There are no snacks or drink in the room as the website describes for this category of room. It has an empty fridge.

I took my 8 year old to the sister hotel, and they refused entry to the pool. Stating our insurance only allows for kids from 9-12 and we are fully booked for the whole weekend with our own guests. very rude and arrogant staff there.

We were given the room after few delays. 
The room was very dated but acceptable until we realised the AC doesn’t work. They tried 2 times to fix but was unable. It’s now 10.45pm with a 8 year old in pyjamas waiting to sleep. It was so hot that even the staff suggested keeping the door open to let the hallway cool the room.
Only option was to move to another room, which they guaranteed was cool. Walked in and it was also a sauna. The staff were ashamed and offered 2 fans to help. 

Its honestly been a terrible stay and wouldn’t return with this service. The offer of free drinks wasn’t enough to cover the horrible experience. 
Staff are friendly but they also can’t solve the issues we had. Personally would advise to stay elsewhere if you think your booking a 4/5 star. This isn’t.

",1,2023,06,10
128,Needs alot of help,"First arrived at the train station with 4 luggage bags. I called the concierge for help with calling a taxi they told me on my own to call for help that I was too far. 1.3 miles away. Even after I told them that they still would not help. 
I Showed up to the hotel after locating a taxi and no one helped me with my bags. Had to carry all to the front desk even though a worker was by the front door.
I asked for assistance in locating a place for money exchange they told me the banks near their hotel. Not true banks would not exchange US cash for pounds. A clothing place near by helped me.
I asked about help with the metro or train they told me to go to the station. They had no tourist pamphlets.
I had to take 4 luggage and  3 bags to my room the coenceier helped with two which I did appreciate. (NOT EASY) dragged on heavy carpets and stairs
The rooms air conditioning is horrible and the windows are secured except for one which rolls up only two inches.
A shower piece is broken and tile are loose in bathroom.. staff not very friendly at all. You are not allowed to walk to the rear of the complex when they are having several parties there. 
They would not let me have a drink at the bar said I had to go down the street ",1,2023,06,10
128,"Great hotel, great staff, tremendous restaurant","I'm a regular visitor because the hotel is always clean, comfortable and very welcoming. The building has a good bit of character to it so therefore feels different to usual London hotels. Shout out to Anam who always makes time to say hello.",5,2023,06,06
128,Average,"I must say I was rather disappointed with my stay here. We only stayed for one night, we arrived a little early and our room wasn't ready but as we had reservations we asked if there was anywhere for us to freshen up and get changed, the only option was the toilet and changing in a cubicle is not easy.

Reception area is decorated beautifully and it makes a great first impression, but the service on the front desk was very lacklustre, we felt like an inconvenience.

The room itself was small but most are in London, however the bed was by far the smallest I've ever stayed in, I'm only 5ft10 and even my feet were hanging off the end of the bed. It was also rather uncomfortable. The layout of the room wasn't great either, with no plug sockets close to the bed. 

The bathroom was nice and shower was great.

Overall a very average stay and for over £200 a night I absolutely wouldn't return.",3,2023,06,04
128,Wow wow wow ,"Wow wow wow!  We stayed here for one night for our wedding anniversary. We've stayed in many london hotels over the years and this one really is spectacular. It certainly has the wow factor! Check in was busy when we arrived (Friday))  but the quick and efficient staff had us checked in in no time. We were seen to our room by a friendly gentleman and were so surprised to see our room had been decorated with balloons. We also had some prosecco waiting for us with a note from Mihai wishing us Happy Anniversary.. This really was such a lovely touch and made us feel extra special! Our room was outstanding.  Huge high ceilings, a fireplace and the most comfortable bed. It was all spotlessly clean.    We went down to the bar for some drinks after our day out. It had a great atmosphere and seemed the in place to be! Overall our stay here was really amazing and the hotel really stands out from similar hotels within the same budget. We would definitely recommend it and cant wait to return. Thank you for a fantastic stay ",5,2023,06,03
128,Truly wonderful stay ,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels in London and this was one of the most enjoyable experiences by a long way.  We were in the Duplex Suite over 2 floors - with an incredibly huge and comfortable bed on the top floor and leather sofa, desk, chair on the bottom level.  Bathroom facilities on both floors.  Mini bar, dressing gowns, water, toiletries, coffee, biscuits etc all available. Amazing views of the Barbican out of the double height window!  We certainly felt like a Hollywood celebrities in this spacious, relaxing and luxury environment!  We didn't have time to sample the breakfast or use the Club Lounge or gym, but will do next time!

The hotel itself is charming, in a historic building with many interconnecting corridors and levels, it's adjacent to the Brewery conference centre and also the Jugged Hare pub, which serves the most wonderful food and drink in a lovely atmosphere.

Anam and his super helpful and friendly team on the hotel front desk are deserving of a special mention and note of thanks - nothing was too much trouble and they are so welcoming and professional, helping ensure your stay is a truly memorable and enjoyable experience.

Based on our experience, we would thoroughly recommend Montcalm Brewery for a business or pleasure trip in London - it's a fantastic hotel in a convenient central location, just a short walk to the nearest tube (Barbican or Moorgate). 

We certainly can't wait to return!!",5,2023,06,03
128,Not business friendly,"Although the rooms were comfortable, the check in process was not smooth. Also when asking for a meeting room, we were advised it would be £500 for one hour. Then advised to use the pub next door as it is free! Not at all supportive of businesses. ",3,2023,06,02

128,Montcalm Staff Review from a traveller,"I must say I am beyond happy that my first time in England London was an exquisite time. I came for my graduation and the staff at Montcalm was exquisite,  honourable mention to Sorina and Mihai. They helped me tremendously with copies, whereabkuts and gave the best advice to go to the best shops , they always remained polite. There was this gentleman that brought me a heater because I'm a stranger to temperate zones. I was  delighted with the treatment and will return again. I look forward to being a guest at this establishment again. I highly recommend and will be referring my travel friends to this spot as it's location is ideal to maneuver the city. 10/10.",5,2023,05,15

He very accommodating and excellent customer service. Thank you! We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2023,05,13
128,Embarrassed by staying here,"How on earth is this a five star hotel is beyond me.

I arrived at this hotel not knowing where to go, where to check in or where to find my room. 

Once we got into our room, it was shabby and not so clean. We asked for a big TV, high floor and nice views. Instead we got the complete opposite - bottom floor, view of bins, a tiny TV which is far from the bed. 
The room itself was quite spacious but so many defectives for instance, the bedside power socket did not work (woke up to my phone not being charged) No air flow so the room would get hot. (There was an air-conditioning unit right above the bed. So the choice was either boil at night, or put up with a noisy air-conditioner whirring literally a couple of feet from you)
The dressing table was broken from behind so stuff like our accessories would fall behind and get stuck.
The bathroom door panels were lose and had screws popping out (dangerous) 
We used the telephone at one point but had no answer.
A good chunk of our time was spent cleaning the room as there was smudges on the walls, hairs all over, setting the tv up, sorting the wardrobe knobs out as one fell off.

Also, within the first hour, i hurt my hand because of the door (pics enclosed) but to add insult injury, at night i dropped my phone behind the bed so i slipped my hand behind and i felt a nasty pinch, i thought it was a bug or so but upon discovery, it was a used toothpick - we also found other bits and pieces underneath the bed like an extra slipper, food etc.. 

- For the sake of balance, I would point out the staff were helpful and polite but they seem overly busy - i had to wait 10mins to check in, another 10mins to check out, and wait 10mins upon collecting my luggage.
 
I travel a lot and use 4/5 star hotels. I've been disappointed with hotels before, but l've never left a hotel feeling conned and angry like on a level like this. I have previously stayed at the Montcalm Royal London which is awesome and I was naively expecting the same level of experience here.

I wrote so much here and I can write a lot more and that says everything about my experience here.",1,2023,05,07
128,Amazing stay,"Ahmed was brilliant, we had a confusion with our booking and he went above and beyond to ensure it was rectified and upgraded us. Very pleasant stay will be back soon. Thank you Ahmed for going above your job Role to ensure we was comfortable and happy ",5,2023,05,05

128,Beautiful place and extraordinary service,"What a beautiful place to stay and located literally just inside The Brewery, a massive events venue, in the City of London. Incredible check-in service and such kind and welcoming receptionists. Beautiful modern rooms. However, a huge and special shout-out to concierge Ahmed who has gone above and beyond and found another stunning room after I flagged a minor concern! He very kindly took me my new room and offered me a free continental breakfast to make up for my inconvenience (which really wasn‘t one) with the argument that at this place they do anything to make their guest enjoying a wonderful stay. Thank you!",5,2023,05,01
128,5,"I would like to leave a review for the hotel. I really enjoyed my stay at the Montcalm. The service is excellent. Sardor, helped me a lot witht any kind of request. Rooms are clean and comfortable. There should be a gym but didn’t have time to explore. I stayed only few days but next time I’ll have more time definitely. Keep going.",5,2023,04,29
128,Excellent experience - I'll be back,"I stayed a night with my mother as we had plans for drinks at the Gherkin and dinner in Shoreditch that night. This hotel was perfectly located, only a short taxi journey to and from both venues and had my mum been younger, we could have walked.  Every part of our experience at this hotel was excellent. Good service from the team on the front desk, a lovely room with the twin beds we had requested and most important of all - a very peaceful night's sleep. It is why I chose this location - it is in a nice, quiet part of town.",5,2023,04,24
128,A pleasant stay,"A comfortable stay with a large room. Decor a little dated and cleanliness could have been a bit better (ended up standing on a piece of broken glass in the carpet!). Breakfast at the continental buffet really nice, and was made to feel very welcome. Really ideal location for tube stations and offices. I would stay here again on a work trip. Would I bring family? Probably not.",3,2023,04,16
128,Reasonably comfy room in a good location,"The room was fine - bit dated, could have been cleaner, but nothing that’d upset you too much. I was only staying for a night for work and mainly booked because of the location (which was great btw). It was fairly priced compared to some of the more budget hotels nearby. Would stay again if I had to!",3,2023,04,13
128,A great hotel :),"Very nice hotel.
We reserved a room for 2 ( couple) and it was great. We got a big room with a window. The bathroom was clean and big. The staff were nice and kind. The breakfast is expensive, but I recommend to take it at least one morning to enjoy the restaurant.
The hotel is close to the city by the underground so it's easy to get around the city. If we could, we would stay a few more days.",5,2023,04,12
128,Average and in need of refurbishment.,"Upgraded to Club Room, which was quite a good size but very poorly lit. My view was a wall about 3m away, which didn't help with the lack of light. One corner of the room had no lighting at all, apart from a desk light. Bed mattress too soft and in need of replacement. Heavy duvet unsuitable bedding for the time of year.

Room overall was rather dated and probably 20+ years old since it was last refurnished.

Oddly, there was no information about the hotel facilities in the room. The minibar was empty, and there was no room service. The restaurant only opens Mon to Fri and there is no bar. The adjacent Jugged Hare pub is privately operated and apparently has nothing to do with the hotel.

The hotel is a maze of virtually identical corridors and multiple wings. The signage is lacking and maps with colour coding would seem called for. Expect to get lost.

The South Wing lift was out of service for the whole of my stay, and from the temporary signage seemed to have been for some time.

Reception made no enquiry as to my stay on checkout. The complimentary fruit failed to appear and the complimentary water was hotel branded.

While the location is good for the City, it isn't so good if you want to visit the rest of London. It has three tube stations nearby but none of them all that near, about ten mins walk. The walk to Barbican Station, the nearest, involves walking a long covered road under the Barbican centre, which even during the day is unpleasant.

I wouldn't return, while my stay was average I could have stayed somewhere better for what I paid.",2,2023,04,09
128,A nice clean quiet hotel in the city.,"The room was comfy and clean with a good bathroom which was well equipped. The beds were very nice with v nice pillows. Rooms are quiet, The whole building is very interesting and full of character, we found the staff helpful and polite.",4,2023,04,03
128,Not my hotel!,"The bed was terrible, the hotel was old. They promised me spa at the sisterhotel and I was really looking forward to it, but the day after ordering there was much fuss around it and at the end there was not possible for us!! The hotel was overboked with employees who didnt know so much…. The breakfast was expencive but nothing special… this hotel doesnt defend 4 stars! The picture is my bed, I could not sleep in this oldsoftly bed with a old madrass!! Sorry staff!",2,2023,04,02
128,Birthday Celebration ,"This was our second time visiting Montcalm At The Brewery. Once again we found the staff to be both incredibly welcoming and very professional.
Our room was spacious, pleasant, very clean and quiet. Shower room was massive loved it 👍. Have to say the best thing was the extremely comfortable bed “Best night sleep ever”
We will definitely be visiting again…. Thank you MontCalm for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,03,27
128,Excellent stay ,"I had a fantastic stay at the Brewery. 

Shahid, was excellent and went above and beyond to make sure I had a memorable stay. 

A hotel is as good as it’s staff, and The Brewery really is a fantastic hotel. ",5,2023,03,23
128,"Wonderful service, wonderful room","Wonderful service, wonderful room thank you so much for Kasi for incredible customer service. He was so thoughtful and considerate rate to my request for a bath. My room was simply beautiful and was a really fantastic stay. ",5,2023,03,15
128,Excellent Stay,"We have stayed at this hotel many a times,  The hotel is centrally located, with eating, shopping outlets and stations round the corner. We were there 1st week of February for 2 nights. As usual it was a wonderful stay. To our surprise we got an upgrade to our room which was beautiful and cozy. From the time you enter the hotel, you feel welcomed with professional and caring staff around. The Duty Manager Mr. Alius was very helpful and permitted us with a late checkout due to our late flight. We have never been let down during our visits at The Montcalm at the Brewery and would definitely recommend this hotel to others.

128,Advertised as five star but really a three star establishment at best,"Impressive courtyard & reception. Unfortunately the room was abit disappointing as a few things weren’t working. The USB charging port was broken / non functioning - wifi was non existent and the call button to get the room cleaned was broken so had to contact receptionist to get it done which was an obvious inconvenience. The mini bar being empty also wasn’t ideal. The worst part about my stay was the fact that if you wanted a continental or hot breakfast these were served  in 2 different restaurants meaning if you wanted a hot breakfast and your partner a cold one, you'd have to dine separately which is absolutely ludicrous. There is far too many hotels in London for me to revisit",3,2023,03,13
128,Not a 5 star,"Lovely hotel with great history but room had a few things not working. the usb port was broken. wifi was non existent and the button to get room cleaned was broken so had to contact reception to get it done. But the major thing was that breakfast was in 2 different restaurants. if you wanted a hot breakfast and your partner wanted a continental then you'd have to dine separately which is ludicrous. (This is what we were told) 
It’s hard to see how it’s classed as a 5 star hotel.",3,2023,03,13
128,Outstanding,"Outstanding hotel and service.

We were upgraded to a Duplex Siite which was lovely.

It's in a great location and is a really beautiful place.

I would advise anybody thinking if staying to book it.

Will return!",5,2023,03,11
128,Amazing  hotel,"Lovely customer service, extremely helpful when we arrived and helped with heavy bags. Great hotel location nearby shops and cafes. However, pictures of location needs updating on google as it made it difficult to initially find and better signposting to reception  (lift was temporarily unavailable at the time). 

All in all I would recommend and definitely come again! ",4,2023,03,05
128,Impeccable Service,"My initial room in South Wing is not up to standard and i informed Dragi and Raluca. 

They hear me out and they offered me a change of room.

I must say Dragi and Raluca provided impeccable service.  

Thank you.",5,2023,03,05
128,Not the 5-star stay I was expecting...,"I was staying a single night during the week, trying out places for corporate clients.  I had very high expectations for this place, being as it is a very high-end hotel chain.

Unfortunately I got placed in a room in the South building so not even in the hotel.  It's definitely not the most glamorous area and the room, once I found it, was tiny, just about big enough to accommodate the bed.  There was a very small desk which wasn't very comfortable to work at and 2 small windows looking out at a wall.

A nice, comfy bed but everything else I would say was simply adequate and the whole stay was a long way from a 5-star experience considering the high price point.

I checked out early. Very disappointing.",2,2023,03,02
128,Great hotel and staff,"It’s my second stay in this gorgeous hotel well located in central London. I would like to thank all the staff for their warm welcome and to look after us in a very professional way. Especially Vlad, who checked me in the hotel in a very professional way and always had a great answer to my questions about the hotel and the area, he is an asset to your front office team. Thank you again!",5,2023,02,27
128,"Great , central hotel","Lovely hotel , polite , friendly staff , would go there again.
Great rooms , shower, facilities.
Good location .
2 minute walk to tube station .
Tesco express and coffee houses within easy walking distance.
Taxis passing on the road outside frequently.",4,2023,02,26
128,"Lovely hotel, great staff team","Had a lovely experience at The Montcalm at the brewery. Really beautiful hotel,  amazing reception and welcome from Kasi at reception, super helpful. The room was fabulous and the hotel is centrally located for everything. Will definitely be back soon. ",5,2023,02,26
128,I Won't Stay Here Again,The rooms desperately need to be renovated. The furniture and carpet was old and worn. The window curtains had stains. The thermostat and some of the electrical outlets and lights didn't work. The maid service was poor: used coffee cups weren't replaced and wet towels were taken from the floor and hung back up rather than replaced with new towels. The hotel fire alarm went off at 3 am. The employees don't seem happy or motivated. This is a 3 star property with 2 star service.,2,2023,02,25
128,"Good location, value for money place to stay","It is located in Moorgate area, walking distance to Moorgate Tube station, connected to Liverpool Street Tube station via underpass which is passed by so many tube lines, including the new Elizabeth Line  and thus very easy to reach everywhere. And it is very near to Waitrose and Tesco Express. The   room price is quite competitive although the room size is a bit small. Funny experience when one of those nights we had to wake up at 3am because there was a hotel guest smoking in the room (as we were told so) and triggered the alarm in the building. Well, it showed that the alarm system works perfectly.",4,2023,02,24
128,"Amazing Hotel, very nice Staff","I stayed at the Montcalm for 4 days. I had a amazing stay. The staff gave me a welcome gift with fruits and a letter which makes me feel like visiting family! It was the perfect location, very close to Liverpool Street 8 min by feet, Shoreditch 15 min by feet. Perfect balance for work and exploring the City of London. I can highly recommend. Until next time! DJ",5,2023,02,21
128,An amazing stay,"We arrived at the hotel on Friday 17th Feb for our two nights stay. Upon arrival we checked our luggage into the concierge as we arrived a couple of hours before the check in time.

As we checked in we had a slight problem with our booking. I originally booked a room through the Montcalm app which I would be able to pay for on arrival. On the day of our stay the app showed no signs that the booking existed, so I then decided to book a room through Booking.com so I knew we had definitely secured a room.

This turned out to be a slight issue but James on reception managed to sort it out. I believe he is a credit to the hotel and we were both very thankful for his help. (I do believe however that the App needs a little attention as it’s not very clear to use or understand)

Our room was absolutely stunning, very clean and comfortable. It was a decent size too! Very reasonable price considering this was Valentines & Half-term week.

It’s close to a few tube stations and very easy to commute to all the tourist spots.

Overall we had a generally lovely time. All the staff were professional and friendly… and a massive thank you to James once more.",5,2023,02,20
128,"Great hotel, Next Level Staff Care","I've stayed at this hotel several times for business/leisure, All the staff are friendly and can't do enough for you, Kasi on reception was brilliant. The rooms are very good clean and tasteful large in size. Great location, had some nice touches with this hotel, hand written thank you card and a bowl of fruit dropped off to the room during the stay.

Thank You Montcalm keep up the good work!",5,2023,02,20
128,Mr,"I had an incredible experience at this hotel, from the warm welcome I received upon arrival to the exceptional service I received from the front desk staff. I recently ordered some food and was impressed by the level of personalized attention provided by Kazi, who took it upon himself to ensure that my order was handled perfectly and delivered to me without any issues. This level of dedication and care really made my stay at the hotel all the more enjoyable and memorable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a truly amazing hospitality experience.",5,2023,02,15
128,Just OK,Clean  - room was small - very narrow and 5 steps down from the corridor! Breakfast was disappointing- no cooked options - just bread /cheese . Salad location good for city and Barbican - close enough for work visit. Did not try the attached pub as it was packed probably before the theatre at the Barbican,3,2023,02,15
128,Good with minor drawbacks ,"A lovely hotel in a quiet enough location. Check in was painless, except I was asked for ID when I had only brought the bank card I had paid with - thats all that was mentioned to bring on the site. It was no problem but it was a momentary panic which was resolved.

Room was nice, bathroom lovely and modern. The taps for the shower and bath were confusing and did not correlate to the instructions. The bath tap seemed broken but I was able to get the bath full after a while water was hot, which is always nice.

Housekeeping were lovely, they gave us plenty of toiletries, including dental and shaving packs. They grabbed us some extra water and were very helpful.

I could not for the life of me find the hairdryer, which was a shame. Also the fridge did not work, and the plug socket it was plugged into was coming out of the wall,  even when I tried a different socket the fridge still did not turn on. A bit of a shame as I had some drinks I wanted to chill.

We had access to the club lounge, between 1730 and 1900. It was very nice, a selection of nuts, fruit bowl, shortbread and crisps were on offer and a wide range of alcoholic drinks. The waitress was not stingy with the drinks and we appreciated that. It set the night up quite nicely.

The bed was comfy enough, when you book your room you select a pillow type and room fragrance. We had one very squishy pillow and one very firm pillow, I'm not sure thats what we picked but we made do. I'm also not convinced the room smelled like grapefruit either! The mattress topper kept slipping down the bed, which was a bit annoying.

Tv was pretty standard, the clock was wrong and the TV guide was awkward to navigate but that's really minor.

Around 1am we were woken by a man and a woman having a very loud argument in the room above us. Not the hotels fault, but still concerning. We rang reception to let them know as it was getting very heated and could hear thumps and bangs. Around 10 minutes after calling reception it went very quiet, so I hope they were okay.

The rest of the night was uneventful. Woke up at 9, and unfortunately did not make it to breakfast in time, we tried the door at 0955 but couldn't get in. A little disappointing but our fault, ultimately. I always find hotels never do breakfast late enough so you can have a good sleep in. Ah well.

Check out was swift and polite.

All in all, a very nice stay with some minor drawbacks that individually were not a problem but put together was a bit disappointing, especially for the price. ",4,2023,02,12
128,Excellent service,"Excellent service especially from Kasi at reception, he was  very helpful and made sure that our stay was worthwhile. Nothing to fault, the room was pretty much self sufficient .
 We will definately be back! ",5,2023,02,12
128,Thank you Stephin John,"Outstanding service and hospitality by Stephin John, really appreciate it you finding my missing delivery items and arranging last min taxi etc

Montcalm is lucky to have you - may you continue to succeed!

128,EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!,"EXCELLENT service. Me and my girlfriend visited for the night as part of our anniversary celebrations and Kasi,Roxana, Carla and the team went above and beyond to make it a night to remember. We were greated by Kasi who set a great tone for the evening with his cheery greating and professional help.Our room got upgraded free of charge, They had made a lovely display in the room, with rose petals scattered on the bed and floor with the towels set up as two swans and balloons that said happy anniversary on them. Me and my girlfriend can not fault the service. 100% would stay again.",5,2023,02,11

128,Lovely hotel and excellent service,When we checked in Kasi was very warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. He showed us to our room which was very spacious and comfortable.

128,What A Dissapointment,"This Is Definitely Not A 5* Hotel
We Booked A Deluxe Double Room With City Views, We Were Shown To Our Room By The Concierge. When I Opened The Curtain It Was A View Of A Wall & An Air-conditioning Pipework.  I Complained to The Front Desk & Was Shown Another Room Montcalm Club Room Which Was Better But Still No City Views. Bed & Pillows  Were Terrible. No Tea Cups In Room Just Small Coffee Cups, Asked Concierge about cups He was No Help.
Nothing in the fridge/mini bar. No Bath Robes. No Information In The Room About The Hotel and The Area- Things To Do.
Wasn't told About Any Amenities At The Hotel If There Was A Gym.
Front Desk Staff Were Rude & Not At All Helpful or Welcoming. Asked About Carpark At Front Desk They Were Very Unhelpful.
This Was Meant To be The Final Few Days Stay Of an 18 Day Stay In The Uk So Wanted To Treat My Wife & Myself To Something Nice What A Complete Disappointment. Even When We Checked Out It Was Hard Work To Get Help With Bags, We Brought Our Own Bags Down From The Room & Even Out To Car. Staff Are So Disorganised.",1,2023,02,08
128,Cute,"We was welcomed by Kasi who was so very lovely instantly upgraded our room

128,Beautiful baroquian hotel with friendly receptionist,The baroquian design of the hotel is beautiful. The receiptionist Kiasi welcomed me very Nicely and was very polite. He offered me a beautiful room which i was very happy with. I enjoyed my stay and I will definetly come back!  ,5,2023,02,06
128,Theatre and hotel stay,"Upon arriving at the Montcalm hotel we was greeted by Kasi who was super friendly and helpful.
The hotel lobby was lovely and smelled amazing and our room was a surprise with a window connecting the bedroom and bathroom which felt very intimate. I would definitely recommend a night here for all the parents wanting a night away",5,2023,02,03
128,Great hotel,"We were welcomed by Kasi.  He is a credit to the hotel, polite, welcoming and efficient.  We have just checked in but if the rest of the stay lives up to our initial impressions, I would highly recommend.  Lovely room, clean and spacious.  Good location.",5,2023,02,03
128,Shockingly filthy hotel,"Wondering where are all those amazing 5⭐️ ratings coming from, must've stayed in the wrong wing, which was shockingly DIRTY from lift to corridors, carpets just horrendous. 

Don't get fooled by the concierge going to take you to your room this is not a five star 'fancy' thing simply you won't be able to find your way if someone won't show you around first time. 

Why leave shower gel...etc from previous guest I much prefer not getting any than knowing someone else used it before, shower broken, toilet broken, curtain didn't close, room beside an office buildings heating/air con unit which resulted zero sleep during my two night stay. 

Reception staff rather disinterested not helpful, I had couple of issues definitely didn't deal with them well. 

I'm sure they have nice rooms this wasn't one more on the vomit inducing side, luckily it was a work trip I would be very annoyed paying for this kip out of my own pocket. 

Never again!",1,2023,02,02
128,AMAZING STAY,"I just wanted to say how amazing my stay was at the Montcalm At the Brewery London City. Firstly i would like to say how impressive the hotel looks form the street, then when you walk into the reception you instantly know you are in a luxury London hotel. The check in staff were very attentive and the check in  process was done very efficiently, we were personally taken to our Room which was a WOW SUITE. I can honestly say the room exceeded expectations. We had a very regal looking four poster bed and an ultra modern luxury bathroom. The room was spacious and very very welcoming. As it was my wife's 40th birthday they gave her a bottle of prosecco and even some chocolate truffles, which she was blown away with, these little touches really make a stay special. Due to us getting to London late we were not able to use the spa facilities due to other commitments we had planned but we will definitely be going back to explore these services.  
All i want to say is a big thankyou to the hotel and especially Julia for making my wife's 40th birthday so special. If you are looking for a Gem of a hotel in London honestly try The Montcalm At The Brewery London City you will not be disappointed.",5,2023,02,01
128,Sleek check in to lovely hotel,Kasi was very courteous and polite. Attended to our check in with ease. He made our trip more enjoyable. Thank you. Hotel was lovely and an incredible building with so much history. I would recommend ,5,2023,01,31
128,Great service!!,Kasi was a fantastic help from the moment we arrived at Montcalm. He offered us a complimentary upgrade to the best suite in the hotel which just made our evening even better. Phenomenal service and would highly recommend and we will definitely be back. Thank you!,5,2023,01,31
128,Indira McCarthy,Exceptional customer service especially by front desk employee Kasi. All queries were answered in an extremely timely fashion and the upmost care was taken with personal belongs. Will definitely be back again!!,5,2023,01,31
128,Disappointing,"Not a great experience. Check in was slow. Concierge used my door pass to try and get me in my room but it didn't work so he used his main one. Didn't seem to go away sort out my card issue and come back though I had to ask. My door wouldn't lock, had to ask them to sort it. I've gone and got myself a new key card this doesn't work and I was told this is because it was the wrong type of card. They wanted me to wait 15 mins for them to sort it. I'm already half hour late joining my work colleagues for dinner so said I'd collect it when I got back. 
Inside the room, shower door fell off the rail and hit me.. managed to hang it back on. 
I sprayed some deodorant, this apparently set off the silent alarm? I'm then greeted by 2 people at my door that were rude. Not sure that I've ever stayed in a hotel where you can't spray.. 
I come back at 11pm and try to get my card sorted, queueing at the main desk another 15 minutes. The gentleman on the concierge desk was stood with nothing to do. Can they not chip in and help?
My other 2 colleagues didn't have any issues with their rooms so I'm not sure whether I just lucked out? But they weren't the friendliest in helping me get sorted. ",1,2023,01,31
128,Great Experience,"Great, Great, Great Experience, hotel was simply brilliant. Staff were super polite and accommodating. 
We booked late due to an issue with a different hotel and we are glad we did as it was such an excellent Hotel.

128,Excellent location in the Barbican area,"Excellent accommodation for both the structure itself and position within Inner London. Walking distance from City of London main attractions, I would strongly recommend to choose this hotel for your stay in London.
The room was right size, all comforts needed were present. Bathroom was good, furnished with bath tub and the room was cleaned.
Only mattress, in my opinion, is too soft.",5,2023,01,30
128,Friendliest hotel front desk in London.,"What a fantastic place by far the warmest and friendliest greeting I’ve ever had from a hotel front desk. 

Kasi was amazing. Checked and and shown to my room in a blink of an eye.  
Kasi was friendly and very knowledgeable about the area. Offered suggestions and recommendations on n where to go for a drink or bite to eat, even offered to carry my little rucksack !!
A credit to his company. 

The hotel is amazing. Clean, well laid out and very quiet considering the location. 
Would definitely recommend .

The place is stunning and great decor

128,"Wonderful staff, hotel just needs some updating","I love coming to this Montcalm, the staff is what makes it a brilliant stay. They are always attentive and carry themselves with great professionalism, the Montcalm brand should be proud of them, specially I would like to note Kasi and Ciprian as amazing, always on point and welcoming.

He only downside of the hotel I would say is that it needs updating, it is a little bit outdated, some rooms things work and some don’t. Like safes, tvs, water system or AC. It just needs a little TLC I would say.

But love staying here always coming back. Thank you",5,2023,01,19

We visited the club lounge and there was a chap looking after it, he did a great job in making everyone feel welcome. I didn’t catch his name, but I overheard him tell some other guests that he originally came from
Romania. He deserves recognition for his first class service.

The shower was good and very powerful. The internet didn’t really work very well. 

Definitely have no issue in recommending this hotel.",5,2023,01,15
128,Courteous staff,"The hotel is excellent and the staff has been cordial . The staff Kasi was welcoming and made us feel special . He had  patience to answer all our questions with a smile . I would recommend this hotel , nice location as well. Overall I’m very happy with what the hotel had to offer and the staff as well",5,2023,01,14
128,Excellent welcome,"The hotelnwas very nice, and the customer service was outstanding, Kasi treated me so well on arrival, really welcoming and professional, excellent! The room was large and quiet and the bathroom was very nice",5,2023,01,13
128,Barbican theatre visit,"Good value for money for the area. All staff were friendly and helpful, especially Catalina when she discovered our visit was a birthday celebration! The room was clean and tidy. There was plenty of tea and coffee as well as bottles of water.",5,2023,01,13
128,Reasonable hotel but definitely not 5 star,"“It’s hard to describe what makes a painting great, but you know it when you see it”, said someone. And the same could be said of hotels.

From the second you enter the Montcalm, it is abundantly clear that this is not a five star hotel. So why bother saying it on the website? 

The staff are okay, but not excellent. The rooms are nice, but lack the finesse of a five-star establishment. There is no hotel, restaurant or bar, only linked establishments that are related to, but not part of the hotel. 

But, unlike art, hotel standards are not based on opinion or feeling; there are concrete guidelines in the UK for what makes a hotel five star called “Common Quality Standards”. The Montcalm fails to meet almost every standard for 5 stars. No room service, no night housekeeping, no pool, no in house dining, etc, etc, etc. 

In particular, when my colleague and I wanted to have a quick drink and discuss work, the hotel had nowhere to offer us (the attached pub was rammed to bursting). They couldn’t even serve us a drink in the lobby.

Breakfast is served at the restaurant which is attached, but the staff made it clear that they were not part of the hotel. It seemed like they were doing the hotel a favour in providing breakfast. At 10.00 they cleared up without telling us, even though we’d just sat down. 

The Montcalm is a decent hotel (a bit expensive) but definitely not five star. My only question is, therefore, why bother claiming to be so? I can only imagine that this results in a lot of disappointed people.  It certainly did me.",3,2023,01,11
128,Unbelievable,So I’m not one to leave reviews however this is necessary! I visited the Montcalm brewery on the 07/01/2023 for my partners birthday & anniversary! I requested for anything to make the stay cute for the occasion! Sheila was amazing she dressed the room & gave us some lovely wine & chocolates! I honestly have never enjoyed a stay at this hotel more! Outstanding! we had a small issue in the evening which was swiftly dealt with by imran who was awesome! Room was beautiful nothing was too much for the team we really had such a lovely stay at the brewery! And I really hope this feedback is fed onto the team and staff members mentioned in this feedback! Hospitality is a hard industry to be in and for the level of customer service I received should be told! Whole team is fab!,5,2023,01,10
128,Very impressed by the service,"We was welcomed by warm and friendly reception team on our arrival, and checked in smoothly. 

A gentlemen called Kasi (Asfandyar) helped us with what we requested and was super polite and professional, I wish other hotels have staff like him, but it is what it is. 

We will be back for sure",5,2023,01,10
128,Utterly stunning,"A couple of gurt country bumpkins in the big smoke for a theatrical night out and we are blown away! It’s a big deal for us to splurge on a hotel and Kasi and the rest of the team have been superb. The level of service was impeccable, the welcome excellent and the little touches were much appreciated. Thanks for a memorable experience!!",5,2023,01,09
128,Filthy,"Filthy. 
I am not someone who regularly reviews hotels but this experience had to be shared. The hotel is tired, run down and very dated all of which I can accept but the hygiene and cleanliness is a disgrace. I have never experienced anything like it. 
On arrival there was a very strong smell of sewage in the ground floors and carpets to the rooms looked like they had been vacuumed for some time. 
Sheets had a couple of hairs on them so I further investigated the mattress protector underneath to find it heavily stained and soiled. I called reception to complain and housekeeping arrived promptly to change bed fully. As the housekeeping staff member removed the mistress protector to my (and her horror) the mattress topper underneath had a dark urine stain covering 1/2 of it. As the housekeeping staff member then folded it to remove it from the bed the other side of it was even more heavily stained. I was utterly horrified and this is a five star hotel! 
Terrible service followed from hotel staff ",1,2023,01,07
128,Great place to stay,"Lovely hotel, great location. The service and staff are brilliant. Kasi was very helpful and professional. Comfortable, quiet sleep. There are plenty of facilities. Decor is lovely.  Would highly recommend a stay here, short or long.  Would return. ",5,2023,01,04
128,Elegant hotel with exceptional staff,"I had a great time at The Montcalm, the wise building has been restored into a nice and cozy modern adaptation, I very much enjoyed myself, Alex Linean and the rest of the crew were wonderful, would stay here again.",5,2022,12,21
128,Must stay East’ish London gem,"Great location for work or pleasure on the East Side. Looked after from the cold wet rain reception of the weather and entertained by the great concierge team while waiting for a cab. Debating the outcome of the World Cup. Very comfortable room, underfloor bathroom heating was a nice touch.",5,2022,12,20
128,mr tj evuarhehe,amazing hotel it was worth the wait and i feel as though coming from dublin this is an amazing hotel that i would recommend to others in dublin to show their faces at if they are to stop by in london it is amazing.,5,2022,12,17
128,Not good,"The good bits:
Reception is lovely, cosy and inviting. They tried to get through the large number of people checking in efficiently.  We were showed to our room  across a courtyard excited to see where would be staying with with our teenage son.

The bad bits:
 The room was a Duplex with sofa bed downstairs and bedroom upstairs. Between sofa bed and bathroom is a glass screen with a blind. If the blind wasn’t closed you could see someone else on the toilet or in the bath. The blind was completely broken as were most of the switches in the bathroom. On closer inspection the sofa bed was broken - completely sagging in the middle. There is no way someone could sleep on it. We called reception and told them it was unacceptable and they agreed to move us, but why would  you think it’s ok to offer that as a bedroom in a supposed 5 star hotel? We were showed to another room which was better and the man who helped us was very nice. They agreed to make up the sofa bed for us.  Although not broken it’s really not good quality. However in this room the USB point was broken- again this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel?  There was no offer of room service at all. The shower was difficult to control and didn’t drain efficiently. Overall the decor is tired and unimaginative and really rather unwelcoming. No information in the rooms on the hotel or the area. 
Overall not a good experience. The staff are friendly But let down by the quality of the hotel.  A great shame.",2,2022,12,16
128,Helpful,"After having a major emergency last minute, I had to call to move my reservations. Eventhough I was aware of the no refund policy.  Mandip from backoffice was super empathetic and considerate. He managed to solve my query and went an extra mile to help me. Considering I stay at this hotel very frequently I am happy they helped me. Great service.",5,2022,12,14
128,Bad exerience,"Three months ago we stayed at the hotel  during four days.  We were assigned this hotel because there weren’t  bedrooms where we had reserved previously 
Without saying a word, we were sent to a disabled room.  We are from Argentina and nobody of the hotel staff was interested in finding a solution for us. None spoke Spanish, and none of them tried to understand our English.   Nobody except Andrea, who spoke Spanish and tried to help us all the time we stayed there. Thanks to her, we got a new room and had a best stay.",3,2022,12,13
128,Incredible service!,"I came to London for a job interview and had to book the Barbican Rooms last minute as I couldn’t get across London due to the snow. Imran gave me water and mulled wine while I checked in, and upgraded me to the Wow Suite ! I had only intended to get a very cheap room for the night. Im over the moon and looking forward to a great nights sleep before my interview! Thank you Imran! 😊",5,2022,12,11
128,Lovely room and wonderful hotel staff!,"Kasi on reception was so friendly and helpful, thank you! A wonderful welcome and a really spacious, clean and luxurious room with all the amenities. Rooms in London are often so small, but the Club Room was a great size. Super convenient for our Christmas event at The Brewery!",5,2022,12,09
128,Such a let down.,"The concierge staff and porters were lovely and professional. However, it was more like a 2 star experience for us. We stayed one night in a very small room, which wasn't a problem but the noise from the brewery outside the window was so loud that we didn't sleep at all! When we questioned this with a guest experience host she was fully aware of the noise. surely the management staff have a duty to inform guests? When I opened the curtains the next morning the office window was so close that the person in the window opposite could see everything. We were not told this otherwise I would not have opened the curtains. We have emailed the hotel but, as yet, have had not response.  We saved to have a lovely experience in London and this sullied our time.    ",2,2022,12,08
128,Great service,"Bar wasn’t open when arrived. Bed wasn’t made up, housekeeping took 45 mins to arrive after checking in. Haven’t seen the rest of the hotel yet but they asked us to leave a review after showing us the room. Here it is.",2,2022,12,07
128,Great Hotel Great Staff,"Excelent room service by concierge Fazil good location, check in is very Quick for sure i will visit again. 
Visit for a business trip. Nice location and nice service. Clean and confortable room 
Thanks Montcalm",5,2022,12,07
128,Another Great stay and lovely birthday break,"Having stayed at the Montcalm many times pre covid over a 10 year period we were looking forward to our first visit this year as part of my wife's Birthday  celebration and were as normal greeted by the welcoming and professional reception team and quickly shown to our lovely suite by Julia and Kasi. 

The room and facilities were all just as we recalled from past visits  as was the great service we experienced in the club lounge in early evening when we stopped for pre theatre drinks and for breakfast on both morning during our stay.

This Montcalm did not did not disappoint in any way, the room was clean and well maintained , all the staff attentive and professional with nothing being too much trouble for all those working during our stay.

A big thankyou to Mandeep , the  guest relation team , the reception staff and to those serving in the lounge. 

Another great stay and we hope to see you all again soon.

Kind regards John Hart",5,2022,12,05
128,Brilliant staff,"Cannot fault this place, in particular the helpful staff. Special metion to Sree who went absolutely above and beyond to help me out of a difficult situation. Spotless room, comfy bed and lovely shower too.",5,2022,12,05
128,Great service!!,"Kasi was very helpful when checking in! Very kind and easy going! Love the hotel, very excited to stay :) very nice and interested in where I am from, and gave some great advice for where to visit on my stay!",5,2022,12,04
128,Some might find charming but was dark and claustrophobic,"Stayed for one night. Was going to book Montcalm London House where I stayed earlier but happy to try The Brewery as it was the same price and only a short stroll away from our London office. 

On check in was told that I was upgraded. The room was 001. When I arrived it was dark, old and totally claustrophobic and depressing. Right next to the main road too. I was surprised that this charges similarly as The London House next door. The difference is totally night and day. 

Asked reception to see if I could get a brighter room and was behind another gent asking for a room switch for similar reasons. The usual explanation from reception is that it’s a charming hotel in a historic building etc etc. might appeal to some. Sorry not me nor I suspect to other business travellers. 

Offered a modernised club room above the Chiswell Dining room. Much better. Was a cold night and heating was poor though. Some stairs to navigate so just note if you have heavy luggage. No lift as on the same level. 

And the concierge guy (tall Asian gent in suit) just looks at you struggling with the luggage on check out.

WIR? Not to the Brewery but yes to London House.",3,2022,12,02
128,Sree is the greatest,"Sree - he was the most helpful member of staff I have ever encountered during any stay at a hotel. He went above and beyond to make sure my stay was smooth. He was kind, courteous, funny & really looked after me during my stay. I would return to this hotel simply because of him!",5,2022,12,01
128,Quick Stop in the City,"The hotel at the Brewery is a beautiful reminder of times gone by, and this Montcalm Hotel provides one the best experiences for those looking to stay in the heart of the City. Huge thanks goes to Catalina for looking after me so professionally, she is a real credit to the hotel staff.  

Highly recommended.",5,2022,12,01
128,Catalina Bodirlau,"A special mention for Catalina Bodirlau at the  Club lounge. She has been a perfect host and very efficient in her work. I noticed her efficiency not just with me  but with other guests too, whch was very evident from their response.

S Mathur",5,2022,11,30
128,A warm welcome from Catalina Bodirlau at the Montcalm at the Brewery,"In a world of often poor service, Catalina’s, Club Lounge Supervisor, warmth in her welcome to the hotel was a welcome change from the many other experiences I’ve had in other hotels. She was kind, helpful, smiling and the best example of why I will happily stay at this hotel again.

Catalina is a credit to tge establishment. Her attitude and professionalism, demonstrated through her expert treatment of any questions I had will be something I remember when choosing hotels in London again.",5,2022,11,30
128,5 Stars..  my A**E!,There is no way this merits 5 stars.  No gym.  No bar!!!!  The staff pointed us in the direction of the Jugged Hare which claimed to have no connection and shut at 10.45.  Staff seemed embarrassed by lack of facilities.  Room is tiny.  Stay in a Premier Inn ....slightly better at one third the price.   RIP OFF !  I have never felt the need to write such a critical report before.....Montcalm need to take a good look at themselves if they wish to survive.,1,2022,11,29
128,Montcalm at brewery,"Staying at Montcalm brewery, very helpful and friendly concierge Fazil helped me to the room and nice and clean room. Would recommend hotel for staying in city centre London for business or leisure. Breakfast was given complimentary today",5,2022,11,29
128,Imran is amazing,Free drinks to our room - fantastic service from Imran! Lovely white wine and ice and lemonade. We enjoyed it very much. He promised me free breakfast but I don’t know if we will get it - we will see haha,5,2022,11,28
128,"Not 5 star, extremely poor quality ","Came down for an awards ceremony, decided to make 2 nights of it.  Considering cost and quality, I was shocked at what you got for the price and the standard of service.  

Room was dated, bed was smaller than a double it was tiny.  Blinds were broken.

Went to get the dressing gown that is provided, to discover it was ripped and a hole in the back.  My husband had to clean the bath and shower himself it was filthy.

Morning 1 breakfast, for cost was appalling, food cold, not cooked well. The scrambled egg was a soggy tasteless mush.

Morning 2 breakfast, 30 minute queue for food, no space was put in an overspill room.  Waited 15 mins for good as everything was gone, I managed to get 2 slices if bacon, burned roast, no butter, picked up a crossaint to find it was raw in middle and just gooey.  No sausages or eggs everything  was completely gone.  Everyone was queuing to complain at reception, and many were getting money back, then clearly that was costing the hotel too much, so we were given the managers business card.

For the cost and considering it is 5* I was absolutely gobsmacked and so let down.",2,2022,11,27
128,Really nice experience,"Was an amazing journey in this hotel. We were 2 friends in London for fun. The hotel is very central, only 15 min by Uber from where you’ll need to see.
And IMRAN it’s the best man here. He will provide you everything! If you are young just text him.",5,2022,11,27

Highly recommend this place for stay in London City...!!!",5,2022,11,26
128,Overwhelming,The montaclm hotel presented the perfect location sevice and amenities for our visit. The lounge and service especially by Imran made the stay a memorable one for me and I would definitely stay here for my future London visits. Service by Imran was above and beyond.,5,2022,11,25
128,Imran is bae,"Imran took care of us regardless of how late it was by providing us food and drinks. A very sweet man and he genuinely has impressed me. I’d give him a raise! The hotel in General is a beauty, planning to return :)",5,2022,11,25
128,Recommendation for Imran,"Imran was fantastic, lovely guy - and smells impeccable. Excellent service. I will establish a cult, embellishing the name of Imran wherever I may tread, this man is an excellent addition to this institution, a limb akin to the left and right arms, necessary for everything and indispensible. In all seriousness, Imran was very sweet, and indulged our ridiculousness. All hail Imran.",5,2022,11,25
128,Imran best service,Fantastic service great location I love elondon but I love imran more good beds. I slept well and the breakfast was amazing. I came I saw I had a great time and loved every minute. The barbican was amazing and saw an amazing exhibition,5,2022,11,25

128,Beautiful and incredible hotel highly recommend ,"Kasi was really friendly and made me feel comfortable, he was polite, helpful and charismatic, made me feel very welcome and I have recommended already to friends.

128,November 2022,"Sree was the gentleman who greeted us at reception. He carried out bags, showed us to our rooms and gave us knowledge of the area. He was really warm and welcoming. It's the little things that make stays memorable.

128,London,Kasi is a great host. He helped changing the room and advised us on all nice things in the area. I would defenetiely come again. The location is very good if you have to work in the city and go easy anywhere from there. ,4,2022,11,25
128,Montcalm excellence,"Imran was fantastic in that he brought us our wine as soon as requested and was extremely courteous and serviceable.

128,Warm welcome,"After a very long travel day, Imran welcomed me in the best possible way ensuring an ideal accommodation. He reserved for me a very big and comfortable room and made sure I was well installed. The hotel is nice and the area is very lively. Good stay",5,2022,11,23
128,RTheLeo,"The highlight of my stay was Alex! He has gentle and comforting demeanour.

He’s such an asset to Montcalm and a secret indelible feature. 

He responsive and prompt and caring. 

He’s always a ring away and ensures the guests are well taken care of!

I’d definitely come back again!

Thank you, Alex!",5,2022,11,22
128,Not what I was sold,"I think from speaking to colleagues it depends which part of the building you’re in but I was majorly disappointed compared to how the hotel described itself online. 
Check in took forever and wasn’t a particularly warm welcome. Room is very small but bed really comfy. However lots of stuff missing compared to what is online (aroma box, pillow menu) and also no mini bar or room service. In room tea/coffee and biscuits not what you’d expect for 5 star. 

Shower was good but overall everything feels a bit tired. 

Just feels like they’re having to make do all the time, one person working on breakfast, had to walk back and forth to the hotel from the restaurant to pay cause the till wasn’t open, and it was quite expensive for what it was. 

It’s not an awful place by any stretch but I just think they need to change how they’re portraying themselves as it’s definitely not a 5 star",2,2022,11,22
128,Wonderful Service,"I just spent a wonderful time at Montcalm and it was due to the service and special attention we received from Imran, head of hospitality at the hotel. He made our visit so very special..  giving is the kind of attentiveness you would only expect visiting family, that I’m honestly sad to leave the hotel. I will most certainly return here every time I’m in London, which is often. Thank you Irman for a wonderful experience!!!!",5,2022,11,21
128,Just Memorable😊,"For a short trip to London my expectations were not very high about the hotel due to the reviews I had read. 

The hotel exceeded all my expectations and turned out to be a memorable stay. 

From check in Imran made me feel at home and made sure I had a good stay. 

The room was spectacular and very comfortable. 

Imram showed what customer service really means.

Well done and thanks a lot mate !!",5,2022,11,21
128,They sent me my favorite jacket back!,"After having a pleasant vacation while staying at the Montcalm, I packed up my bags and headed back to the United States, only to realize I had left a rather special jacket in my hotel room's closet! I  phoned up the front desk and spoke to a chap who said to email his manager. I assumed my email would go unresponded to, or that my jacket would have mysteriously been not in my closet, but much to my surprise, they told me they recovered it! They recommended I order a package pickup by Royal Mail. After I set up a pickup, I sent Montcalm the shipping label, they packed up my jacket in a box, taped the shipping label to the package, and handed it off to the postman when he came to pick it up the next week! An incredibly easy experience and I thank the staff at Montcalm for meeting me three quarters of the way in getting my jacket back to me. ",5,2022,11,21
128,The staff are amazing,"We stayed here for 4 days. 
And Imram made us feel so welcome. 
He is so professional. 
So attentive. 
Yet we felt like we made a friend. 

He notices everything and listens. 
We really appreciated the whole staff as well. 

My foot was broken. 
And they moved me to a more convenient room. 

Imram is a boss.",5,2022,11,20
128,Disappointed ,"Given the price and rating of the hotel. I was disappointed. I have stayed previously but not had breakfast.  The room was very small. Also, having paid for a full English breakfast, which was a  buffet style, tea or coffee not even served at the table, the bacon, mushroom and tomatoes were all like warm to cool. 
Sounds a bit petty, but it's not hard to serve a hot breakfast. ",3,2022,11,20
128,Best staff and hotel!!!!,"I stayed in room 207 at this hotel,  the room was amazing  and I have met one of the nicest and fabulous  staff Imran , young boy always cherishes with smile and made me feel I am home...

128,Amazing Service!,"There have been hotels with great service, and then there are those that go above and beyond. In this case, Imran went above and beyond making us feel welcome and appreciated.

Emmanuel is such a lovely guy and couldn’t do more for us. 

Great stay, thank you!",5,2022,11,15
128,Rude Staffer,"Hotel was as pictured. Staff was super friendly for the most part. 

I did have an odd interaction that rubbed me the wrong way during my stay. We had just arrived to London and check straight in here. 

The gentleman at the desk helped move our bags from the lobby. I only had under £5 cash on me at the time from paying a taxi driver. 

My son ( 5 years old)  gave the gentleman a  £4 tip. I didn’t want to insult him for 50 pence change. 

He looked at my son and remarked “What is this,change “. Not in a joking manner, he genuinely  seemed insulted. My wife looked at me because I was furious. Say “Thank you” and carry on with your job. At that point I regretted giving him anything. 

When he departed my son asked me if the gentleman was mad at him. Nice hotel but this interaction was classless.",3,2022,11,15
128,Wonderful customer service,"Husband and I came for a business trip to London. Booked the Montcalm at the Brewery as it is next to my office building. Asked for a quiet room as my husband suffers from insomnia so has trouble to fall asleep. We were given 010, which at the beginning was quiet. At about 10pm a noise coming from some kind of vent/energy generator started. My husband could not sleep all night. The day after we asked to move to another room and they quickly obliged. Kasi from the reception desk provides a very thoughtful and attentive service. Kasi made sure we got moved to a different room and as an apologetic gesture, he gave us a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. We had a wonderful experience at this hotel and we will definitely be back again soon!",5,2022,11,15

128,Poor for a 5 star,"Stale smell in the room, chipped furniture, broken phone charger, tiny bed, not really what I’d expect of a a 5 star. It has a very strange layout with tiny corridors and sometimes you have to walk up and down stairs to get to your room.",2,2022,11,14

128,Excellent customer service,"Fairly easy book in process and Imran was a  absolutel delight to deal with.
Very polite and excellent customer service skills. 
The only slight disappointment was the fact that the hotel advertised car parking facilities and it seems like it's a part of the hotel,but it's a private car park that charges additionally. 
Thank you",5,2022,11,12

Thank you to Julia Guest Host Experience",4,2022,11,09
128,Outstanding!,"When we arrived we were surprised as the photos did not show the exact location. So much better than expected. We were upgraded and breakfast was complimentary. The staff were well groomed, efficient and very helpful.  We were able to leave our bags securely after checkout. The room was clean and comfortable. The shower was powerful and hot and the toiletries were good quality. This is the first hotel in the UK that made coffee that I enjoyed. The location was perfect for what we needed and the tube station was very close so getting into Oxford Street and Covent Garden / West End was quick and easy. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

128,Great start to my stay,Down in London for a business trip and my first time staying at this location. I had a very pleasant stay and excellent customer service on reception from Sree who was very attentive and super helpful. Will definitely visit the Montcalm again.,5,2022,11,08

The best hospitality served by Mr Imran.

128,Underwhelming experience ,Underwhelming experience. Booked 2 nights room only experience. Room was very small with most seeming to be taken up by the bathroom. Mini fridge in room didn't seem to cool anything placed in it Very little information about facilities available except for a small paragraph on the keycard wallet.,3,2022,11,06
128,Definitely not 5 star!,"I really don’t know how this hotel can claim it is 5 star. There really is no comparison to other hotels with that grading. 

Check in was pretty mediocre and functional - the receptionist didn’t really look up from his computer or engage in any conversation. 
The hotel itself is like a rabbit warren with endless corridors and stairs - thankfully a porter kindly carried my bag for me when I was shown to my room, but I got lost several times trying to find reception / leave the hotel. 

The first room I was allocated was awful - small windows half way up the wall so you couldn’t really see out, tired and shabby decor / furniture and a totally bizarre ceiling to floor window between the bath and the bedroom that was covered by what looked like a projection screen! 

I asked for a different room and a really friendly guy called Mihai moved me to a Wow Suite. It was a lovely big room with a four poster bed. I’d say it was still very tired looking decor-wise, and the room scents, pillow menu, Hermes toiletries, and minibar promised on the web site were missing, as was a bathrobe. But it was a definite improvement on the first room. 

What I also found strange was that there was no lounge bar, cafe or restaurant on site. I was wanting a bite to eat in the  late afternoon while I did some work and was directed to the Cote Brasserie across the road. There was also no room service that I could see. There was a Club Lounge that I got access to when I moved to the suite but when I arrived the guy manning it was on his way out and told me the only food he could do for me if I really needed something was a bit of toast! Again, not exactly 5 star service! 

All in all I wouldn’t recommend this hotel and my advice to Mihai is to move to a different hotel as you’re wasted where you are!",3,2022,11,06
128,HERITAGE VIBES,"I visiting London and at the airport I was looking for the hotel”s in London city , I found The Montcalm at the brewery closest to the tube station. The moment I entered the hotel it gave a positive vibe, on top of that the reception guy IMRAN was very helpful, he helped me find the convenience  store at late hours and was very much helpful. Thank you so much Imran for your help the room was good with as fas as I remember It was room 308 in the main building. It was amazing. I would definitely come back again. Thanks montcalm Hotel",5,2022,11,05
128,Anniversary Get Away,"I had made arrangements to surprise my mrs for our anniversary and I have to say the service was absolutely amazing! Our room was decorated by the lovely Julia and she made sure everything was top notch! The experience was more than we expected it to be and we would definitely recommend it to someone trying out Montcalm at the brewery for the first time as it was our first time too. 

Huge thanks again to Julia for her help, she was so helpful and a",5,2022,11,04
128,Nice Hotel with a Human Touch,"If you are fortunate enough to find Andreea at the concierge desk you will be in good hands. She is absolutely professional and truly cares about guest's experiences and wellbeing! After 21 hours of travel I was unlucky enough to reach the hotel at noon. No surprise to hear my room won't be ready until 2pm. Not fun, but no surprise. Rather than just store my luggage away, Andreea asked for a couple minutes patience and had a room for me sorted immediately! That wasn't necessary and I wasn't demanding special treatment, but what a great way to make me feel good about the hotel. And yes, the room is quite nice.",5,2022,11,04
128,Busniness,"Fantastic staff, a lovely venue, situated in the heart of the city. Rooms are modern and clean.

Word of advice, always book direct - no need to use the travel sites. Dinesh was very helpful nothing too much trouble.",4,2022,11,04
128,AMAZING!,"Came in London for a business trip and all I can say is that I got so relaxed throughout the stay. The staff was amazing! Mihai greeted me and asked me how my day was and what type of business I am doing. So, he was really interested I answered everything to him until he got the check in done. His other colleague from the reception got me to the room and showed everything around the room (Really nice of him) and he wished me a great day. The bedroom was the best part it was just so soft that I just wanted to sleep directly on it. Housekeeping was nice to give me an extra pair of towels and slippers. The PUB next to the hotel also had great food so all I can say this made my business trip!",5,2022,11,03
128,Cool,"Sree was extremely nice as the rest of the staff, he brought me to my room and explained me how to reach it. 
The room is actually beautiful but a little bit noisy. 
Position is cool if you work in the city.
Nice hotel for a business trip in the complex.",5,2022,11,02
128,Great service,I have enjoyed my experience at the Montcalm. Great experience on check in. Particularly great service upon check in from Shree who made me feel very welcome. Thank you!! Look forward to staying again.,5,2022,11,01
128,A lovely place !,"A lovely place : beautiful building, amazing staff, very clean and comfortable room, great location to visit London (close to 3 underground stations). Loved everything about it and for sure,  we will be back in this Hotel ! :) ",5,2022,11,01
128,"Poor, shabby rooms, not 5 star","Used this hotel on numerous occasions pre Covid, it clearly hasn’t recovered. 
Check in was fine but unfortunately got a room of the east wing and the hotel is like a ribbit warren. Room was poor, broken sharp floor tiles, not just cracked actually broken with
Many sharp edges. Room was also dusty and blind mucky. 
They do not offer room service. This is no way a five star hotel. It is three at best. Instant coffee sachets in room, hardly luxury. 
Staff are ok, although I asked a member of housekeeping the way to my room and she couldn’t understand me! 
Much nicer hotels for less money which is a shame as it used to be good.",2,2022,11,01
128,No too bad stay - Great people,"Good stay at the Montcalm, the hotel is very well located.   Welcoming people, especially Sree who was very helpful and a good talk.

But nothing is perfect, I’ll say that for 1) my room was very cold no matter how much I tried and tweaked the heat monitor. For 2) there is a slight sense of  decay (e.g, a cracked tile in the bathroom, visible sealing glue etc.). The room was not exactly pristine, clean and comfortable though.

+ for the team
- for the room",3,2022,11,01
128,Wow,"Sree from the Montcalm checked me in. I couldn’t have asked for a warmer welcome. He was polite, courteous and friendly. Made me feel incredibly welcome and couldn’t do enough to help me.

Thank you and it’s made a really great first impression for my stay here.

On top of that the room is clean, spacious and really well situated.",5,2022,10,31
128,Great service ,"Rang hotel directly, got a better deal, most helpful booking service  by Pedro 
 The friendliest and  most helpful staff greeted us on arrival 
We stayed in a club room it was very clean if a little tired, fruit basket  drinks  and the usual extras when we arrived 
Drinks and nibbles in the club lounge, (no canapés available), yet again service was very good.
The  self service  cooked breakfast was good 
Couldn’t find fault for the price we paid  compared what else was on offered in London 
The friendly helpful service, far outweighed the tiredness of the room 

",5,2022,10,31
128,Oh dear,"Not impressed. Not 5 star. Premier Inn would be better.  

Things not working ie. 

Not clean enough
Stains on curtains
No shower gel
Bathroom door didn’t lock
Cups smaller than espresso cup for tea!
Nescafe instant sachets at a 5 star hotel?

Safe to say I wouldn’t return.",2,2022,10,30
128,So Disappointing,"I wouldn't rate this hotel as 5 star.  I've stayed in 3 and 4 stars with better quality.  The pillows are filthy yellow and brown, no pillow protectors.  The electrics didn't work in the room and not even their maintenance team could fix.  The bathroom was dusty, red horrible mark on the curtain and the handle on the bath peeling off and cut my friend's hand.  We heard another couple in reception questioning the 5 star status too.  The rooms are similar to a rabbit hutch, we asked to change as did another customer given the smallness.  The hairdryer in the room was repulsive too.  Other reasonably priced hotels are better and provide bigger rooms.  The hotel couldn't even ensure the lock on the room door was looking five star quality.",1,2022,10,30
128,Pleasantly surprised,A friend and I stayed here and he booked it on our behalf. Very pleasantly surprised on how nice and comfortable the room was. 2 things I look for in my stays - comfy bed and good high pressured warm shower. Both well delivered and very roomy room haha. Alex at the concierge also took great care of us from check-in to check out ! Big thanks to him and keep up the fantastic work for a perfect stay with such great proximity to public transport and eateries nearby!,5,2022,10,30
128,Very Nice Stay!,"Just AMAZING!  London is the best sight I have been seeing so far and everybody is just so kind and nice to you, I have been checked in today in the morning by a fella named Dimitri and he has gave me a map for the tube and all the attractions in London! The room was really nice, water was not working properly however maintenance came in help and they fixed everything for me and I thanked them really nicely, everything else the room was impeccable housekeeping did their job really well and thanks to Ciprian the nice concierge I was able to find my room. All I can say, the hotel is best suitable for business stays.",5,2022,10,28
128,dreadful on all levels,"a couple fighting in the room opposite mine that continued on countless times, a very noisy member of staff after that waking me again.  A wrong side of tepid cooked brekfast at a cost of £19.

Worse though was the smell of skunk continually coming into my room and making me feel nauseous.  No idea where it was coming from so dont stay in 251 unless you like that.  
Massively disappointing - i got virtually no sleep and no one apologised or even remotely cared",1,2022,10,28
128,Excellent customer service ,Excellent hotel. Staff brilliant also. Sree went above and beyond delivering excellent customer service making us feel welcome and looked after. Club room charismatic and decor of hotel great for the price range.,5,2022,10,28
128,Overnight stay post theatre,"A very pleasant night at the Montcalm. I booked the Barbican Rooms opposite where I’ve stayed before which are cheaper but was upgraded to a ‘Wow’ room in the main hotel. That was a good start. Nice big room with four poster bed, and I had a lovely relaxing bubble bath in the en suite bathroom. I came from seeing a play at the National Theatre - easy journey on Thameslink, one stop from Blackfriars to Farringdon, then a brief walk to Chiswell Street. I was very comfortable and felt very safe - there were plenty of staff around, even at 11pm. I don’t always feel safe at other London hotels where sometimes only one member of staff is on duty. I will come again.",5,2022,10,27
128,Pleasant hotel with some flaws,This is a centrally located boutique hotel (former brewery). It has quite a bit of charm. It has a very nice courtyard which hosts functions. The rooms are quite small though and unfortunately as I was on a floor without a lift I had to drag my bags up there. The staff were always quite courteous and helped with questions on London etc.,4,2022,10,23
128,nice hotel,"The location is very good, walking distance to the underground station and famous Barbican Center. The staffs are very kind and helpful. 
The room is tiny and the bathroom is small too. But the room is clean and bed is very soft. It's a pity that the gym is quit small and in the basement, which is not so good for doing workout.",4,2022,10,19
128,"Five Star? No heat, bathroom leaks, rude staff.","I had a terrible experience here and would not recommend. My room was small and dark, several lights did not work, and the water leaks out of the bathtub. There are lots of little switches and buttons in the room that no one bothered to explain when I checked in. Heat went out in my room and I didn't even get an apology when I called Concierge. They simply told me ""pack your bags and leave it by the door, we'll move them between 12-2"", which they did. On multiple occasions when I called Concierge to tell them to check the heat, they didn't seem to care. I'm shocked that this hotel qualifies as five star. Am moving to the Marriott, where I'm sure I will have a better experience. Am recommending against this place to my colleagues who travel here often.",1,2022,10,14
128,Great Hotel,"Great hotel and great staff. I had a warm welcome from Alex Lincon. He helped us with the luggage to our room as we had our 8 months daughter in her buggy.

The hotel is very central to the city and the tube is not far away from the hotel.",5,2022,10,11
128,Central Location,"very nice hotel , all staff helpful

wonderful room and quite 
enjoyed our stay 
will be returning 
great location for getting around London 

recommended 
any questions please ask  , note we didn't have breakfast",4,2022,10,05
128,"Small room, unwelcoming front of house staff","On arrival to check in, the male staff on reception were certainly not welcoming. First time I have ever been asked for proof of ID. I initially showed them a printout of the confirmation of the booking, but that was not good enough, thank goodness i had my driving license with me.

To gain access to our room we had to walk across a courtyard to a side door which led to a lift and a maze of stairs. We were thankfully escorted to our room, otherwise, I do not think we would have found it. The room itself was very small and dark for a five-star hotel, not even a proper window. There were many buttons and switches in the room, but nobody had the courtesy to inform us of what they were all for and there were no instructions to hand in the room to help you work things out. 

In addition, the room safe did not work and as there were no do not disturb/room ready to be cleaned signs to hang on the door, a cleaner came to the room to service and clean it whilst my wife was in the bath. We subsequently found out that two of the mystery buttons in the room were for ""do not disturb, or room ready to be cleaned"" but like the room safe, they did not work. I do firmly believe a five-star hotel should ensure everything is in working order before guests arrive.

I have said below that this hotel does not have a bar or restaurant, well it does have both attached to it, but they do not belong to the hotel. You can have an all-inclusive breakfast rate when booking, but as my wife is not a breakfast person, we did not, and I paid for my breakfasts separately each morning. This was fine, but watch out, they add on a service charge to the prices on the breakfast menu and one morning I was overcharged.  They had the cheek to charge me separately for my tea, which was already included in the menu price. Having said that, the serving breakfast waitresses were very friendly and efficient, as was the waitress who served and looked after us for our family Sunday Lunch. 

Yes, the hotel itself is kept very clean, as was our room, but I certainly would not rate it five stars.",2,2022,10,03
128,Find a motel for better amenities and service,"Stay at a motel instead of this place. Paid almost $300 a night. Was brought into a “Club room” by the bellman. Immediately after turning on the ac, it began making an odd loud noise. The bellman noticed but didnt say anything so I asked if the ac was working properly. He said yes. Well i left my room and came back later in the night and indeed, the ac was not working. The room was somewhat tolerable at first but as the night went on it only got stuffier and hotter so I couldn’t even sleep under the comforter. I had to sleep on top with no sheets or anything. Ut was not a good sleep. Certainly not a sleep I would pay $300 for. Anyway the next day I informed them of the issue and was moved into a different room after I spent about 15 minutes packing all my stuff. Oh, and the phone didn’t work so I was not able to talk to the manager. They moved me to a smaller room. Also, it turns out that moving into a SMALLER room with working AC was considered their “compensation” for my experience. Which i certainly would not have accepted if that were actually communicated to me. The bellman who moved me into the 2nd room could also barely speak english. When he was leaving I asked “what time is checkout tomorrow?” and his response was “You will get another day. Is this alright?” which I interpreted as getting another nights stay. But silly me. It just turns out he had no idea what I asked. I was informed today that my compensation for the awful experience in my first room was packing up and moving to a smaller room. Amazing experience. Cant wait to never come back.",1,2022,10,03
128,Friendly services from staff,"The hotel was 15 minutes' walk from the British Psychological Society where I was attending a conference and meetings. Efficiently checked in at the reception desk, pleased to find a Welcome card from the Guest Experience Team with a bowl of fruits and a small bottle of Prosecco in my room. All staff members were friendly and eager to help.",5,2022,09,28
128,can be improved,"Got a Club room  on Sunday till Monday  for the Queen funeral. No slippers  in the room,  No bathrobes .No fruits in the room as promised on the hotel reservation.  I booked on the hotel website. The snack bar empty ....Called the reception  , they told me I have to request them..Joke.   The brought me fruits and the slippers. The club room closing at 7 .30 pm...after it not access, opens late afternoon so just available for 2 hours or 2 hours 30. Breakfast was normal.
The worse part was about 10 am when returning from the breakfast I could not access the room. I left my friend at the door, went down to reception, got another card which was again faulty. 
Went again to reception they told me that they have a problem and sent with me an Indian man from the Concierge, a tall one  to open the door.
This horrible man started yelling at me :Where is your key a few times.....my key was with my friend who was not on sight....a cleaning staff let her in as I went to the reception...My friend opened the door so I asked the Indian man to give me the key as we needed light in the room...he was very reluctant and I told him to put it in the electricity so I can have light.....Returning to the hotel in the evening.to recover my backpack ..he was at the Concierge desk  giving me dirty looks.... the other staff were good, the provide us with two bottles of water...good quality before we left...also the Romanian staff at the breakfast room were very good, a lady provided us with snacks to take away...",3,2022,09,26
128,This is not a 5 star hotel,"They advertise for Club Room, bowl of fruit in room, dressing gowns, mini bar there was none.  Pillows with no pillow protected on.  Large stains on bedside lamp.  Paid in full well before my booking and they asked me for £50 deposit.  I asked why they said it's just something they do. It never dropped out of my pending till 5 days after I booked out.  They should update their website and make things clearer, or would they lose some stars , my guess is yes.  Positives, comfy bed and good continental breakfast.",3,2022,09,26

128,Poor Service,"This was one of the worst hotel experiences we have ever had.  Service at the hotel is poor; from the check-in process to the club room and house keeping.   I won’t go into the check in process, which was a disaster, but I will note that our room was never serviced.  When we requested service at 4:45 PM, the front desk informed us that we were supposed to let them know that we would like service.  I responded that is fine, if the front desk would have informed us that we needed to let them know that we would like our room cleaned.  I requested the manager, who apologized and said that they would send house keeping up.  I asked them to send them at 5:30 PM when we were leaving for dinner.  He assured me that it would be taken care of.  When we returned at 11:00 PM that evening, the room had not been serviced.  In general, not a big deal if it wasn’t for the poor check-in service and the poor club room service.  My recommendation is to stay away from this hotel.",2,2022,09,22
128,Great service,"The rooms are very clean and nice. The concierge service is amazing! They were able to accommodate all of my requests. I had trouble getting a taxi, and the concierge ran all the way down the street to flag one down.",5,2022,09,15
128,Nope nope nope,"Awful experience, rude, dismissive reception staff. Arrived to be told that we would have to pay for our already paid for room . Concierge happy to advise us he was paid £8/hour as he escorted us to our rooms. Next morning yet again had to debate with reception staff for breakfast that was paid for but they wanted payment again!!!! Eventually had enough and asked for management who took a copy of our payment confirmation and condescended to allow is the breakfast we had paid for. Wished we hadn’t bothered as breakfast was rubbery, tough, fatty bacon with similar poached/ boiled offerings of egg on dry stale bread. 5 star??? I think not. The place needs a good clear out of staff. Something very wrong here. Please don’t make your guests feel like you are doing them a favour by providing a ‘service’ they have paid for! And maybe provide reception staff with some reading lessons so they can read booking confirmation letters!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1,2022,09,14
128,Great hotel with amazing staff,"Really enjoyed our stay here. The property is beautiful and the staff quite helpful. One concierge in particular, Mr. Fazil, was a big help in a pinch. Would absolutely return here in the future when my travels take me to London.",5,2022,09,14
128,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE 😡😡😡,"I should have paid better attention before choosing this hotel.
The room I had : the fridge was not working and there was glitter on the floor: sign that it had not been vacuumed after previous guests. I called reception, very nice concierge offered to upgrade me to a bigger room .
We go to the 2nd room, it is indeed bigger but gosh I almost wished I had not changed.
- the curtains and the rail fell on my head when I shut them
- tried taking a bath : the knob stayed in my hand.
- took a shower instead: cut my toe when climbing out with their sharp window

At that point I decide to call it a night and go to bed: only to discover the sheets are completely STAINED and the bed looked like someone had sat on it! This bed was not professionally made. I had NOT touched that pillow !!!! Its all wrinkled.

It's now been 35 minutes reception said the cleaning person was coming to change the sheets.. still waiting.

40 minutes the housekeeper comes to change the sheets . Great. She doesn't even seem to see the BIG FAT stains when I show them to her. She called her superviser who obviously acknowledged the stains. They changed the sheets. Yippy. I thought I could FINALLY call it a night... But no no no, one of the lights did not swith OFF! called reception for the 4th time, they dared to ask me if I had tried to turn off the switch 😂🙄. They send someone, he tried turning off all the switches, lights DID NOT turn off!!
It's the one in the picture attached, with a very clean mirror as you can see. 😱

So I get moved to a 3rd room. I inspect the bed with the concierge, we both see hair that obviously is not ours. He took photos. At that point it's been 2 hours since moving from the 1st room so I decide to just call it a night and sleep. I did check the bed for bedbugs just in case. Soo at that point I thought it couldn't get any worse , I get into bed .
I hear people screaming, arguing. I put my earplugs in. Still hear them scream. I call the concierge AGAIN to complain and ask if he can talk to them, he says yes but the shouting continues. After 10 minutes I decide to go knock on neighbors door myself and ask if everything is ok (room 133). A lady comes out , I ask her if everything is ok, she apologized saying she was dealing with an urgent situation... I go back to my room. Screaming continues. Stay tunes for another horrible story from Montcalm brewery.

I get that they are refurbishing the hotel but in this condition, it's a 1 star at most. Even a hostel would have a better service.

I just want to cry and move to another hotel but it's 11pm and the 2 nearby hotels I called are fully booked. Needless to say I will be reporting this to the Montcalm managment. The concierge who took me from room 2 to 3 was nice but clearly lacked professional experience. I asked him if this was the 1st hotel he worked at and he said yes. That's ok , everyone starts somewhere but at least an apology would have been nice instead of ""I didn't know the room was like that"" 

This room was booked through my company, I'm going to make sure they get removed from the selection of hotels",1,2022,09,11
128,Class act,"Imran, my boy, is a shining example of hospitality. He graciously welcomed my colleague and I to the property and treated us with great respect. After being here for four nights, I know where to come back when I make my next business trip to London.",5,2022,09,11

128,"Over-priced, over-rated - If you want a 5⭐️ experience. Don’t waste your money here.","We stayed at Montcalm The brewery before and had a lovely experience, which is why we returned. It is in a good location if you want a quiet hotel
For a weekend in London, as the City is very quiet. Unfortunately, since we last stayed, the standards have fallen drastically.For a hotel that advertises itself as 5⭐️ , This was poor.
1. Bedroom was not cleaned properly.
2.  Wi-Fi was poor.
3.  Air conditioning did not work and room was uncomfortably warm.
4. No “Bespoke pillow menu” as advertised.
5.  No “Unique Aroma box” as advertised
6. No instructions or guest room service booklet/menu.
7.  Our key card failed after returning from a long day out.
8.  Our room was not serviced after our first night. Bed not made, dirty cups and milk/tea/coffee not  replaced. 
9. If you want to use the hotel
Lounge you have to pay a premium.
10. No Sky TV. Just Freeview.
11. No biscuits to have with tea/ coffee ( which is standard in most hotels)
This hotel is overpriced and overrated. We were very disappointed that we did not get the 5⭐️ experience we had hoped and paid for. We have stayed in far better Premier Inns!  Sadly, not a hotel I would now recommend or return to, unless they improve or manage to get a really good deal.",2,2022,09,05
128,Best hotel and a great city,"Travelling from the US and seeing this hotel how they greet people and make the most out of it is just.. incredible! 

The concierge staff was really helpful and I had a really nice talk with a eastern European concierge from Romania had a great stay here. Fully recomend!",5,2022,09,05
128,5 star price but 3 star room,"We stayed in room 116 for 2 nights. It was tired and in need of a refresh. We had booked a 5 star hotel for a special occasion but this did not live up to our expectations. In fact I was quite disappointed at the standard of decor in the room. For instance, I would have expected a walk in shower, not a shower head above the bath that didn’t work properly. Gaps in tile grouting and dirty walls.  On the positive side the, staff were  very pleasant and attentive. The reception area is very attractive and certainly makes the right impression. Overall I’m afraid it should have been much better and definitely wasn’t worth the price.
I also contacted the hotel prior to my stay asking if there was step free access to my room as I was on crutches. They confirmed that was the case but that wasn’t true. Luckily I managed but others may not.",2,2022,09,04
128,Lovely room but customer service lacking and sexist staff,"The room was lovely and as described. Good facilities and had been cleaned to a good standard. Unfortunately customer service was lacking on arrival, and I was charged for an additional night (thankfully this was quickly resolved). 

I was however extremely unimpressed with the sexist attitude of the male receptionist. When me and my boyfriend checked in, I made it clear the booking was in my name and had been paid for with my credit card. The male staff member acted as if I was not there and kept directing his questions to my boyfriend despite us both making it clear numerous times everything was in my name. When we were handed our keys he again ignored me, looked at my partner and said ‘have a good stay Sir’.",4,2022,09,02
128,Business ,Catalina bodirlau was very helpful to me and my daughter. Providing us with fruit for her to eat and great service :) highly recommended! Lovely calm space to relax or work. Right next to the Barbican! ,5,2022,09,01
128,Birthday Trip,"Had the most wonderful stay at this hotel with my daughter. Staff went above and beyond for us at all times. They made our trip to London thoroughly enjoyable and memorable for all the right reasons. Service was impeccable, staff were warm and friendly, public areas extremely clean and tidy and the rooms are comfortable. We especially enjoyed the Club Lounge and would like to personally thank the staff for making my daughter’s birthday one to remember…she felt like a princess 👸🏻!!",5,2022,08,31
128,Horrible experience,"I booked 6 rooms for 4 days and our experience was so horrible the majority left for home earlier. 

The shower in the bathroom was broken so only cold showers for 4 days. A machine outside the room made so much noise you could not hear the television or your alarm clock. Thankfully the fire alarm was audible as we found out around midnight ( none of the staff responded to it, so it's probably not the first false alarm ) 
Breakfast was extremely lacking and hard to reach. 

Actively recommending my colleagues to book elsewhere from now on.",1,2022,08,29
128,Absolutely loved my stay here!,"I had a great time at the Montcalm Brewery! The location is very central and in a very safe area. The personnel is the best, I had made a mistake myself and the manager did everything she could to make things work out which was super nice of her. I cannot wait until my next stay in this amazing hotel!",5,2022,08,29
128,Definitely come back !,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 6 nights and we were happy about the choice we've  made. Initially we booked a room in another hotel but weren't happy with it and decided to change place after one night . 
From the moment we checked in until the checked out everything ran smoothly. I'll admit we were a bit worried about the reviews we read on Trip Advisor but things turned out well for us .
Reception staff and  concierge were helpful upon arrival and departure as well. The room was always clean and we enjoyed our breakfast at Club Lounge.

We would like to bring a special thanks to Andreea from guest experience  who was very helpful , professional and kind for our entire stay. She showed us the way to our room and tried to cheer us up after we told her about our experience in the first hotel. Good luck with everything and all the best to her !",5,2022,08,26
128,Montcalm Brewery,Going to be upfront and blunt. Amazing establishment. Got an upgrade for my partners birthday. Room was decorated. Free Prosecco and we got free breakfast. Room was clean and Modern. Staff were polite and friendly. Cherry on the cake was being allowed to eat breakfast in my bath robe.,5,2022,08,26
128,The Barbican rooms,"Had a great stay, check out was super easy and Sabina was extremely helpful throughout. Will definitely be staying again in the future.
Rooms were clean and the price was fair for the amount of time we stayed too.",5,2022,08,26
128,I walked out,"I have deliberately left some time before leaving this review so as to not be so angry about my treatment that it was just vitriol. 
I booked a two night stay in July for myself for a pampering weekend. The website boasts of room scents, pillow menus, room service, in-room movies - all to be pretty standard for five star hotels. I had the intention of being able to laze about in fancy luxury for a few days, maybe popping to the club room for a cocktail. 
I am disabled and needed to check that the rooms were accessible by lift, so phoned ahead of arriving. First sign something was wrong was having to phone five times before being able to speak to someone - twice the phone rang out and bizarrely twice I was hung up on. I told the receptionist I was disabled and she assured me there were lifts to the room. A bit unnerved by the difficulties just getting them on the phone, I set off.
First thing I see when I arrive is the set of five concrete steps leading to the entrance. Looking around there is no accessible entrance anywhere, nor any temporary ramps. A concierge ran over but rather than assist me with the stairs, he just grabbed my bag and watched me struggle up with my walker. Upon checking in I was cheerfully informed they didn’t need an imprint of my card “since we don’t do room service anyway” - contradicting their website’s advertised features. Another concierge took me to my Club Room (meant to be the upgrade-type room) where I found no room scent, no pillow menu, no walk in shower (which I had requested due to my disability), freeview TV only with no Sky and certainly no in-house movies, an empty mini-fridge, no bathrobes, no slippers, a bed on WHEELS that moved halfway across the room when you sat on it, and some mysterious stains on pretty much all the soft furnishings. The worst thing for me was the hotel handbook still listed all the missing features - just running salt into the wound that these people are misrepresenting what they offer with absolute impunity online.
I went to the desk and told them I couldn’t stay in this room as I couldn’t use a shower over bath. After some stressed typing I was moved to another room which I was told was still a Club Room. It turns out it was the accessible room, which for some absolutely idiotic reason has a bed that is approximately four and a half feet off the ground. I had to jump to get on it. This room was even more tired than the first, dark and gloomy, and the bathroom grouting didn’t look like it had been cleaned in years. Whilst I was lying on the bed wondering how I was going to get down, a member of housekeeping let themselves in without knocking, giving me the fright of my life. Apparently no one had informed them of the room change - I imagine they hadn’t really cleaned this room hence the intrusion. After they left I started to feel really vulnerable and realised this was not on. I went to the desk and informed them I was leaving as none of the features they advertised were available nor was the hotel properly equipped to deal with disabled guests. At this stage I asked them to cancel the charge on my card and the duty manager informed me they would contact me when the pre-auth had been cancelled. Well, obviously not only did they not cancel it and charge me £450 for a stay I didn’t have, it took me three weeks of emails to the duty manager (which were ignored) then the general manager of the hotel chain and anyone else from the corporate office’s email
I could find to get this refunded. No one apologised for lying about what was on offer; no one apologised for the ignorance regarding accessibility - when I went to leave, back down the steps I struggled to get up, I had to throw my case down first because no one would help me - what kind of experience is this for a customer? I’ve honestly never had any hospitality experience like this in my life. It is a shambles and they should be ashamed of the way they treat their guests.",1,2022,08,25
128,Simply dreadful,"There is simply no way this can be called a 5 star hotel. Here’s my experience:  

-	The room was tiny; it was ridiculously small and cramped for the price. For a lesser rate I could have had a decent sized, bright and clean but functional room at a Premier Inn. 
-	There were two tiny little windows, and these faced a wall just a few feet away. Consequently, the lack of any natural daylight coupled with the size of the room made it feel like a dark and depressing prison cell. It was impossible to work in this space. 
-	The room was so small there wasn’t even space for a fridge. What 5 star hotel doesn’t provide a fridge?
-	The room was shabby and wasn’t clean. There were a lot of suspicious brown stains all over the walls, right next to the bed. 
-	Because the room was small and there was no air flow, it was hot. There was an air-conditioning unit right above the bed. So the choice was either boil at night, or put up with a noisy air-conditioner whirring literally a couple of feet from you.  
-	The final insult was breakfast. Due to lack of space in the inadequately small breakfast room, I was asked to sit on a sofa at a coffee table. Seriously? Having breakfast squatting over a coffee table is simply unacceptable. 
-	For the sake of balance, I would point out the staff were helpful and polite. 

I travel a lot for pleasure and business. I’ve been disappointed with hotels before, but I’ve never left a hotel feeling conned and angry like I did here. The very fact that you have to be shown to your room through a maze of courtyards, lifts, corridors and stairs demonstrates how many rooms they’ve managed to cram into the footprint. It feels like every inch of space was used to squeeze in rooms with the intention of maximising their returns, rather than thinking about the negative impact on the guest experience. I often stay at the Montcalm Royal London which is awesome and I was naively expecting the same level of experience here. 

If you have to stay here, my advice is this: when you check in, ask Reception to be very clear and specific with you about the room you’re staying in. If it’s one of the “prison cells” ask for a different room or go elsewhere. 
Personally however, I won’t be back.",1,2022,08,24
128,"Very average room, no after care","Hotel looked lovely and was in good position for family event the following day.  We’re told we had an upgrade when we arrived but not sure what from as room was pretty ordinary, nice enough apart from large stain on the carpet.  It was a very hot day, but the air conditioning was extremely noisy.   We turned it off but it came back on in the middle of the night sounding like a pneumatic drill.   I whiled away some sleepless hours reading reviews of others who had a similar issue in recent weeks.   We reported the poor night to the reception staff and they apologised and offered us a free breakfast but we were going on to food nearby, so they promised to report it to the general manager.   A week and a half later haven’t received a word from the hotel.  Wouldn’t have left a bad review if someone had been in touch as realise sometimes things out of control of staff but feel we paid over the odds for a very average room in which we could barely sleep",2,2022,08,23
128,Really do not bother,"Booked here for a London break for my partners special birthday in August. Initially was put into a smaller room than I had booked which reception would not correct. Within a couple of hours being in the room, we lost power and went to reception to report. They said they would send somebody to resolve the problem. We came back to the hotel at 10pm later that day to find room still had no electricity, which was a problem isolated to our room rather than the whole hotel.

After some discussion at reception, about 45 minutes later somebody came along and refused the fuse which brought the electricity back on. Shortly after this the air conditioning then went off so went back to reception and wanted to be moved rooms. We were apparently going to be upgraded but the room we got moved to wasn't much better than the one we were in.

The air con didn't work in the new room, but I'd lost the fight to go back to reception and request another move. Instead they gave us a couple of fans.

Couldn't wait to check out. Not a 5* hotel. I have attempted to resolve the matter directly with the hotel via a complaint to no avail (no response).",1,2022,08,23
128,What happened to this hotel?,"Stayed here a few years back. Checked in here last week to be shocked how tired the place and people have become. I tried three rooms, there was no air-conditioning, rooms were falling apart and clearly no love has gone into this place for a very, very long time. 

Even at the highly reduced prices don't be tempted, you will be sorry",2,2022,08,23
128,Downhill since last stayed !,"I used to stay here on a regular basis when working in London and it was incredible everytime. I was back in London for a concert, so decided to book here stayed in room 405. Wasn’t able to check in half hour earlier, so was told to wait in reception for half hour, previously greeted by the door but not this time around. Concierge was very friendly and professional and carried cases to the room, 5* service. The room was very clean but few issues within the room. The air con was broke so phoned reception and they brought up a fan. The bathroom has a curtain which you can remotely put up so you can see into the room, but even when down you could see through gaps into the room. The shampoo holder was also hanging off not screwed properly into the wall. Apart from that, the bed was amazingly comfy, robes were lovely too. Shame as it has the potential to be amazing.",3,2022,08,22
128,Nice place to stay in the City,"Lovely hotel in a nice quiet area, but easy links around London. Check in was efficient and the concierge service was very good. Club Room was comfortable and clean.  We didn’t eat in the hotel so I cannot make comment about the food. Overall a nice place to stay.",5,2022,08,22
128,Thanks Montcalm,"As a single mom and with a flight cancelled, the receptionist help me making a booking at 2Am and call me after check in to make sure that the room is comfortable to me and my son. In the morning the concierge help to find a taxi to the airport. The breakfast in the morning was amazing. The staff made my unexpected stay better. I will be for sure returning back to stay more time.",5,2022,08,19
128,Marvellous Atmosphere,"I stayed in the Montcalm at the Brewery just for one night and since I enter, the staff greet me so well that I feel like I have been here in this place for so many times. The check in procedure was fast and smoothly. The room was clean, and I find out that I forgot my toothbrush and the concierge Fazil brought straight to the room and the reception team help me find a bar in late hours. I will be back soon.",5,2022,08,19
128,Do not stay here. 3 stars would be too much for this hotel,"Avoid. Nowhere near a 5 star. A 3 star would be giving this too much credit. Teri el stay. Put in the wrong room. No minibar. No docking station. Shower doors didn’t close so water went everywhere. Curtains didn’t close so was woken up at 5am by sunlight beaming in. 
Made a complaint. Was offered to book myself to stay again and I would be given entry to the member lounge for some free snacks and drinks. The aftercare service when making a complaint is shocking. You could not pay me to stay here again.",1,2022,08,19
128,Nice service. Launderette locates nearby with 3-5 minute cycling. Cycle hire station nearby.,"I have a wonderful experience in here. Mr. Meadeu Dinev did a really nice service. I was pleased to stayed in here.

This hotel locates in the City of London. Santander Cycle hire station is nearby. Traveler were suggested to bring a large IKEA bag to carry their laundry to the near by Barbican Launderette to do it by themselves , or laundry in the hotel would be expensive and charged by per clothing.",5,2022,08,17
128,A 3 star posing as a 5 star,"I suppose I should have stuck to the adage that you get what you pay for. £223 for a club double room in a 5 star did seem too good to be true and indeed it was. This doesn't even come close to being a 4 star let alone 5. Reception staff were not particularly welcoming and nobody seemed to be particularly on the ball. We checked in to our room and went out almost immediately for the evening returning just after 11pm. We asked at reception where the bar was so we could get a night cap. No bar, not even for residents after 11pm. No room service either and although the room facilities said a mini bar was provided - it wasn't. In a 5 star hotel? Oh well, a cup of tea and bed it was then. Only then did we discover that one of the windows didn't shut properly so the aircon machine outside provided a loud soundtrack throughout the night. Some wag has designed the room so that the adjoining bathroom has a glass wall (why would you do that?). So that you don't have to look at your partner doing their business on the loo there is an electric blind provided to cover the glass. It didn't work. The kettle was broken and so was the hand rail to assist people in getting in and out of the shower (over the bath). A very limited continental breakfast was provided in the club lounge, which seats about 20 people. No cooked option. No milk jugs, so the milk for tea was delivered in a coffee cup, which ensured that it went all over the table when trying to transfer to the tea cup. The room was clean and the bed comfortable and it's a good location, hence the 2 stars. The friends we were traveling with had an even worse room, but they did negotiate a 20% refund. I don't like to be negative, but I found very little to be positive about with this experience and will not be returning. I've stayed at better Premier Inns",2,2022,08,17
128,Mont not so calm and club rooms non existent,"Well, what can I say for a supposed 5* hotel, i have never stayed anywhere like this. From walking in the reception and checking in, I wasn't greeted with a smile or even a hello, just what's your name. I booked a ""club room"" expecting complimentary fruit and beer, robes, nespresso, ipod docking Station but none of these were in my room. I selected a grass scent but all my room smells of is tobacco. Only on complaining did reception advise where the elusive ""club room"" was, hidden behind a door up and down numerous staircases with Private on it...seriously why not put Club Room on the door or even tell us about it when we check in? On asking about where all the club room extras were in our room, I was offered a supposed complimentary breakfast in the club room which we already had access to! Then the manager offered a bottle of prosecco which has yet to materialise and gave me his card saying if I book again, he will offer me a free upgrade! The nespresso machine arrived complete with pods tucked away in the man's jeans pockets. Just bizarre is all I can say and ummm having spent £215 on a room no thanks we won't be coming back here in a hurry. All I can say is the room is fine, the service really poor and nowhere near 5*, wish I had stuck with a hilton!",2,2022,08,16
128,50th Wedding Anniversary Celebration,"Our son phoned ahead of us getting to the hotel to tell them we were celebrating our 50th Wedding Anniversary.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by reception and informed that we had been given a double upgrade.  Upon arriving in our room the staff had put balloons in it.  Later that morning we were taking photos in the courtyard and the hotel manager offered us coffee.  We explained that we had just eaten our complimentary breakfast and we were celebrating our 50th.  When we retuned to our room that evening, to our delight,  The Manager had sent to our room, Prosecco, fresh fruit, a hamper and hotel teddy bear.  Thanks to all the Hotel Staff The Manager for making our special day even more memorable.  Mr & Mrs Fox",5,2022,08,16
128,Lovely hotel near the Barbican,"Lovely duplex suite, friendly staff, excellent breakfast in a beautiful room with original features only downside was the sofa bed that our 15 year old son slept on, it was not fit for purpose and gave my son a bad back, it had seen better days, the staff tried to make it better by putting a quilt over the very thin matress, but the bed sagged badly in the middle.
Fruit, bottled water and wine greeted us as we entered the room, which was a lovely touch, however nescaf decaf coffee did not meet with the standard of hotel, its the worst instant coffee available and is what you would expect in a 2 star establishment. 
Would stay again as a couple, would bring our own coffee for the room.",4,2022,08,16
128,First year anniversary stay was excellent.,Very lovely stay at the brewery. My husband and I celebrated our first year anniversary in London and was given extra special treatment by the kind staff at the hotel. I could not fault the staff they are all so polite and lovely. The room was very nice too. Thank you.,4,2022,08,15
128,You’d be better off at the Premier Inn,"We originally booked two nights via Booking.com as the prices for this supposed 5* hotel were comparable to the nearby Premier Inn. The day after booking, a train strike was announced for our return date. We messaged the hotel via Booking.com to ask about extending our stay and am still awaiting a response to this day. We tried to call the hotel but the line rang out. We therefore booked a second stay for the third night via Booking.com and sent another message to the hotel explaining. They replied they would link the bookings so we didn’t have to change rooms. Long story short, they didn’t. When we checked in they then said they’d link the bookings again. When we got to night three and tried to get back into our room, they key wouldn’t work. We had to go back to reception and check in again. When we entered the room housekeeping had done half a job, taking away some of the towels but not replacing them, replenishing some of the toiletries but not all (including toilet roll) but by this time we were ready for sleep so we didn’t bother reporting back to reception. 

The room we stayed in (325) certainly did not look like the photos!  It felt designed specifically for ‘cheap’ booking sites, tucked away on a mezzanine level which was awkward to get to. When the fire alarm went off at 03:38 we noticed there were no fire safety directions on the back of the door. Given the positioning of our room we found that quite alarming (no pun intended). Luckily it was a false alarm but had it not been…..

The electronic housekeeping button was broken, the safe didn’t work, the shelf in the bathroom was loose, there was a rip in the bedsheets, the towels were frayed, the monikered coasters were reused (along with some of the toiletries) and the staff were ambivalent. We reported the broken safe twice but although the staff nodded and smiled and said maintenance would repair it, we ended up having to carry our belongings around with us the whole time.  The aircon was ambient the first two nights but on our third night it was like sleeping in Antarctica, without touching the controls it seemed to change of its own accord. No matter what we did we couldn’t adjust it and ended up turning it off (on one of the hottest days of the year). 

We’re all for ambient lighting but the lighting in this room was terrible for practical use. There was nowhere that provided enough natural light to apply make up, all of the lighting is focused around the bed apart from a tiny desk light. The room we had didn’t even have proper windows just two small almost port holes high in the wall (which looked out onto another building in very close proximity). 

The website advertises the deluxe double rooms as having robes, slippers, iPod docking station, pillow menu and fresh fruit on arrival, none of which were available/provided for us.  The ‘double’ bed was tiny and extremely high, although it was comfortable). 

The public areas were lovely, and I suspect the more expensive rooms are better than the one we had, but overall we would have been better off at the Premier Inn with much larger beds, safes that work, and staff who care.",2,2022,08,15
128,Good Services,"Staff was very nice and helpful, special Thank you to Stephin for assisting.  Place is also at good location and restaurants near by , 

Imran thank you for managing breakfast session and being super cooperative",5,2022,08,15
128,Awesome Hotel & Service,"The stay was pleasant, welcoming and accessible location.

The staff was cooperative and helping out in their busy time as well. 

Stephin John was very supportive and all ears to us. Definitely will plan here next time.",4,2022,08,15
128,Holiday to london,"We stayed for 6 nights, every thing was perfect.
The staff was great.
Stephen helped and and gave advice during our visit. Great location close to all the attractions
We will return with our family.
It’s the hotel for families and couples",5,2022,08,13
128,The perfect stay,"We stayed 2 nights in the Montcalm hotel in which the staff went above and beyond to make sure our anniversary stay was perfect. The hotel couldn’t be in a better location. Our room was gorgeous, clean and extremely comfortable. Could not recommend this hotel anymore and will most definitely be returning upon our next stay in London. Thanks for everything team!!",5,2022,08,10
128,Quite poor for a 5 star hotel,"Poor service. Receptionist at the front didn’t know what he was doing and was confused with even the simplest questions and didn’t understand when we had to explain to him. Saw another person get mad at another receptionist as well so first impressions wasn’t good. The room given was poor. It was next to a generator and was really loud (throughout the whole night) bathroom drain was broken there wasn’t a blind from the bathroom window looking into the room/bed (it was broken and not even replaced). My family and I had to check out at 12, but due to reason we didn’t come back until 1 and we let the receptionist know and they were fine with it but when we came back they locked us out. Went downstairs to the reception and had to get a staff, who said they should’ve gave us another key to get into the room, but we never got another one in the first place. 

Overall the service and room was quite poor for what is considered a 5 star hotel.",2,2022,08,08
128,Great staff. Great location. Decent rooms.,"I had a great experience at the Montcalm for the most part. The staff were friendly and helpful, particularly a Mr Stephin John. Rooms were well appointed and clean. The hotel having rooms on both sides of the road was a bit confusing, some of the rooms are in the main property, while a few are in a row of converted houses across the street. Spending an evening in the seating area outside the houses was a fantastic experience and one i doubt you’d get elsewhere in a London hotel. 

My one gripe was wrt to the AC not working on the last night of my trip. A decent fan was provided, however at a hotel of this stature, this was quite disappointing.",4,2022,08,06
128,Up to usual standsrd,Now our preferred brand when visiting London. Only a flying overnight visit and the hotel and room was to its usual high standard. One hiccup was  quietly and efficiently resolved by Stephin John to ensure a good experience.,4,2022,08,06
128,Excellent stay at the Montcalm,I had a great stay at the Montcalm. All the staff are very friendly. Especially Catalina who was always helpful. She was able to clarify my concerns very quickly and always polite. With her team she made my stay totally relaxed. I will be very happy to come back to the Montcalm.,5,2022,08,05
128,5 star hotel ?  - You’re ‘avving a larff !,"Stayed here for one night after being booked through work.

Check in was a slower than you’d expect from such an esteemed and luxurious establishment - with just a single person manning the three-person reception desk,  but a full five immaculately dressed concierges moping around in the entrance area - the reason for which wasn’t immediately apparent. 
Curious I initially thought - Inefficiently managed was my final conclusion, but alas we shall hear more of these gentleman and their sartorial elegance shortly.
 
Once provided with a room key, I was quickly put in my place when I asked where breakfast would be located, as apparently this had not been booked by my company.  This I knew to be a cruel jest, and so after the receptionist performed a brief recheck of the system to confirm that the “computer says no” it transpired that miraculously I was right - I had never doubted our company travel booking team for one second!
 
For the next leg of this journey into the unknown I was then requested to go speak to one of the many concierges, who would take great delight in showing me to my resting place for the evening - and was bizarrely denied directions to the room when I pointed out that I’d probably be able to find a room situated only on the 1st floor.
 
Nevertheless I scanned the lobby, seeking out one of the aforementioned concerierges, only to my dismay discovering that 4 of the 5 concierges had disappeared and the one remaining was unable to take me there?
 
After time inexplicably marched onwards, perhaps only for a couple of minutes, (during which time i’d been asked twice why I was hovering aimlessly in the foyer - but was still refused to be granted directions), a concierge appeared to take me to the elusive chambre numbered 128.
 
I was summoned into the lift, whose doors opened immediately at the merest touch of a button. It boded well, I was excited to reach the room, for which I’d also been told by my booking team would be an upgrade, after complaints from previous members of my company about their stays.  
Alas my intrepidation stalled as I stood there with my attendant, for a good 30 seconds watching as the lift door repeatedly kept jamming and refusing to close, at which point we got out of the lift, and swapped to the other elevator.
 
We arrived only seconds later on the 1st floor, and took the 15 second walk from the lift to room 128, I was shown inside, given instructions as to how to make the lights work (put the card in the slot), and was left to my own devices.
 
The room did not seem like an upgrade, but seemed adequate, not something I’d spend £200 of my own money on mind!
The room was a little tired, but had a nespresso machine, alas no pods - if you don’t count the used one left in the machine itself.
 
Regardless, reception would no doubt sort that on my way out to dinner.
Alas as I drew the curtains- to protect the outside world from witnessing my change of attire- it transpired that the curtains did not close- there was a gap where there should have been a curtain- the rail seemed to have broken- either that or this was a curious and ill-judged design feature
This was the final straw, no room upgrade, no nespresso, and now a room bathed in bright summer sunshine - fine for now, would be less fine at a 4.30am sunrise in the morning.
 
Off I marched to reception, time for my wrath to be felt.  Alas, whilst there were now three people on reception, there was also a queue of disgruntled guests busy complaining, and being provided with room upgrades.
 
I arrived at the front of the line, my complaint regarding the lack of curtain coverage was not understood- but nonetheless- they would provide me with a room on one of the top floors- Room 411.  
Excellent, all was forgiven.  Again, a concierge would be required to show me to my room, but then they would also collect my bag from the original room, and deliver it to me.
 
Upon arrival at the new room - it was very dark, “Yes!!!” I thought, the curtains actually shut in here.  Alas my excitement was quickly curtailed as I realised the original room was clearly an upgraded room, this one was definitely not.  On the plus side there were no discarded used nespresso pods, but unfortunately there was also no nespresso machine either.

Regardless it was now 7pm, as a (relatively) young man let loose in the capital- I thought I’d go out and obtain a beverage or two in a local free house and enquire about a spot of dinner.  The man would be back shortly with my case, and with a quick change and a 5 minute phone charge, the night would soon be my own.
 
Alas after half an hour of waiting, I was required to make a call to reception to enquire as to whether my luggage would indeed be joining me for the rest of my stay. 
 
With any luck, everything else would go swimmingly, I would enjoy a decent dinner, and I should have the best nights sleep a chap could wish for in this dark, tired, old room.
 
I returned from dinner, to what was in fairness a very comfy bed.  What was more of a shame was the noise level coming through the window.  It would seem that room 411 faces directly into another building next door about 2 metres from the window- this building also must have some sort of giant aircon unit on its roof as the noise level was ridiculous, which in turn resulted in an appalling night’s sleep.

Finally I have come to the end of my review, I could not face the argument at reception in the morning when I left, it was booked as a corporate room anyway.   However to be clear I won’t be visiting this establishment again- a combination of the strange check-in process, badly maintained rooms, indifferent service, and expensive to boot.
It’s not the 5 star hotel it advertises itself to be, nor do the rooms reflect what it claims on its website.",2,2022,08,04
128,Weekend break at Montcalm,"This hotel is ideally situated for the Barbican Theatre and most of central London. We had a great stay here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and well appointed with all of the trappings of a modern hotel. Our room was overlooking a small courtyard on the first floor. Overall the hotel represents very good value for money, and I would highly recommend.",5,2022,08,02
128,Good Hotel at a fair price,Booked through booking.com and saved a bit of money. We had two single rooms and both were clean and reasonably spacious. Air con worked well and the shower was powerful. Comfy bed and a quiet undisturbed sleep. No breakfast included but plenty of places nearby to eat at. Only complaint is that it would have been nice to be told to press a little button to ask for your room to be serviced as I couldn’t work out why I had no new tea or shower gel or bed made! I’ll use this hotel again when I plan a solo trip.,4,2022,08,02
128,"Don't be fooled by the ""image"" but does the job as a cheap ""motel"" at best","Average hotel, cheap with an expensive image (reception). All in all it served it's purpose but felt like a cheap motel. Half the lights didn't work, the bathroom fittings were poor quality (drain was broken and shower head disgusting). Room was alot smaller than advertised on booking.com and the air con was noisy as hell (could not turn off). location is handy but I would have preferred to stay in the Hilton doubletree which was cheaper per night and much better rooms. This motel would be great if your on a bender in the area and can't walk home but if looking for what's advertised there is alot better in the area for cheaper.",3,2022,08,02
128,"Not a 5* experience, deceptive advertising","we stayed at Montcalm Brewery City of London hotel having booked a twin Montcalm Club room for one night at £171. On arrival we were booked in by a somewhat impersonable man who spoke to us very little. He did not explain any of the room options to us and when we enquired about the 'Club Lounge' we were told that was for breakfast which we hadn't booked. Other than taking our money he offered no service whatsoever other than to point to the concierge for leaving our bags and say we needed to leave a £50 deposit 'for extras'...when we pointed out we weren't going to have extras and if we did we would pay as we went he said 'ok, you don't have to pay it'.. We asked about the Club Room (for those booking club) and were told this was for continental breakfast and we hadn't booked that! He didn't explain if anything else was available to us .We were going out for the day so we left our bags (as we were unable to get into our room until 2pm, even though we had phoned ahead and explained we couldn't be there for 2pm and requested an earlier check in) and didn't return till about 9pm. On return there was no concierge and we were kept waiting for quite some time for our bags. We struggled to get the key card to activate the door and once in we found we had no dressing gowns as promised in the website room description. I had to contact housekeeping and waited about 20 minutes for these. There was no Nespresso machine, no mini bar, no fresh fruit, no pillow choices and no room aromas - all as described in the room amenities online. Unfortunately we were somewhat pressed for time the following day so had no opportunity to raise this with staff as reception was very busy. On top of this, as it was my birthday, my friend had asked ahead and on the day whether anything to mark the occasion could be left in the room. She was assured that there would be but this never materialised either and she felt very let down.
I am extremely disappointed that we were treated so shabbily for a supposed 5* hotel and that the promised amenities were not provided. 

The only saving grace of our entire visit was a lovely young lady called Andreea who was friendly, helpful and welcoming.",2,2022,08,02
128,Enjoyable stay,"We recently spent a week at the montcalm at the brewery,  staying in two Guestrooms. The rooms are very well appointed. The bathrooms were updated and the staff were always very helpful. The location of the hotel was good with easy access to the tube and taxis. 

The only negative was the weekend noise from the events at the brewery and the noise from the staff moving about equipment and bins in the wee hours of the morning there. 

All in all , this is a good hotel.",4,2022,08,01
128,Than you Geanina,"Thank you for nice welcoming us, Geanina, it was a five star experience

It was really nice meeting everyone, everybody was really friendly!!!!!!

Coming back soon

128,Beyond atrocious,"I’d read bad reviews but chanced it for a one night stay on business given price and location. Wish I hadn’t. Nonchalant and rude greeting at reception and given a room that needed to be unlocked manually by the concierge. Quite evidently because the electronic lock was broken. This meant once unlocked the door could be opened from the outside so was entirely unsafe and insecure. 

Furthermore the room was like a sauna with two temporary and ineffective tower fans in the room in an attempt to cover for the fact the A/C was broken. I was told no alternative rooms available initially but upon further discussion was moved to another room. This one had a lock (hurrah!) but was  equally as hot and awfully tired in decor and furnishings. It’s rare that I complain about hotels but given the atrocious staff attitude coupled with terrible rooms this hotel warrants a poor review. Easily one of the worst in the City.",1,2022,07,25
128,Brilliant Rooms & Fantastic Customer Service,"Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Fantastic location, price, clean and comfortable. 
Really helpful staff providing a high standard of customer service, especially from Catalina who was extremely helpful, polite and professional.
Definitely good value for money, highly recommended.",5,2022,07,25
128,A disaster,"It’s a disaster. No heating in room for three days (we stayed in December). No housekeeping, even if explicitly requested twice, and very difficult to get soap or fresh towels. Plenty of staff doing nothing except for laughing at your face when you complain. Got a 100 pounds refund after having sent multiple e-mails to the management.",1,2022,07,22
128,Decent rooms for decent price,"Location, price and super comfy bed - if you look for a clean place for a proper sleep in London and don’t want to spend too much money for accommodation, this is probably one of the best hotels to stay. For this price it’s definitely worth it.",4,2022,07,20
128,Never again.,"In need of a complete overhaul, from the rooms to the decor to the staff. 

Check in was slow, with guests kicking off about a variety of issues when I arrived, which is ever a good sign. My room wasn’t ready despite arriving bang in check in time and I had to wait an hour.

The room itself was OLD. The curtains didn’t fit the windows and the furniture is covered in stains from years of use. I didn’t want to go bare foot on the carpets as they were still covered in glitter from whoever partied in there before me…

I was staying for 14 nights, which felt like a sentence rather than a stay. Having tested positive for Covid, I informed the front desk and was essentially ignored thereafter, having to call numerous times just to get towels, toilet roll etc dropped off outside my room. 

No one from the hotel checked in on me for the 6 days I was shivering and sweating in the drab room, without so much as an offer to bring me up some extra water.

I didn’t think it was possible to be classified as a 5* hotel if you don’t offer room service, but these guys have somehow managed to pull a fast one in that regard. 

Once I’d recovered, I just wanted to get the hell out of there and changed my flights to head back to Dubai early. Check out was a similarly poor show. Staff didn’t ask how my stay was or provide a bill; which I then had to spend a week chasing via email once I got back. 

The Montcalm Royal London House is a totally different experience and I’ll be going there again next time I’m in town.",1,2022,07,18
128,Fantastic,"I stayed here the night before my wedding whilst my bride stayed down the road in a different hotel. Originally I booked the Barbican rooms, which I was a bit worried about staying at after reading the recent reviews on Tripadvisor and had considered switching to the Montcalm at the Brewery instead but the recent reviews for the Montcalm at the Brewery were bad too so I decided against it.

When I arrived at my hotel I was told that I was being upgraded to stay in a double room in the Moncalm at the Brewery rather than the single room at the Barbican Rooms that I had. So immediately I was impressed.

And I have to say it was a fantastic stay. The hotel is in the perfect location. The room was modern and clean. The aircon made the hot weather outside a lot more bearable. The staff were absolutely fantastic. I had blisters on my feet from wearing new trainers and the hotel came and gave me some plasters. The staff congratulated me on my wedding and I even walked past one of the staff in the street in the evening, who said hello to me - which I thought was a lovely touch. A very pleasant stay. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,07,17
128,"Great location, but tired hotel","We were originally booked at the Barbican Rooms but apparently moved to the hotel. First night was in a room without AC and we were offered two fans to compensate… we were moved to a better room next day, with AC, so they did help us. All in all a tired hotel which tries hard, but again too old bones to be recommended. But the location is great!",3,2022,07,17
128,Amazing localization,"our second time in this hotel, an extraordinary location, super clean and elegant room, both times we were attended by a girl at reception called sheila, she is very nice and helps us with all our doubts, and as it was a special weekend me and my partner He gave us a bottle of proseco and upgrade our room, thank you very much sheila for making our weekend more special",5,2022,07,11
128,"Good hotel, poor Wi-Fi",This is a well appointed hotel with good rooms and facilities. Being in an old brewery building the layout is a bit quirky but nothing of concern. It’s an easy walk to several nearby shopping and dining areas such as Broadgate circle. Our only negative would be very poor in room Wi-Fi. The connection kept dropping out and when connected the speed was very poor.,4,2022,07,11
128,What a decline in standards and service,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times before and have always been impressed. The last time was March 2020.

I arrived this week and fpr some reason was given a disabled access room and which overlooked a noisy courtyard, packed with rowdy daytime drinkers.

The air-con was broken and the room resembled a sauna. Tried to ring reception and guess what  - the phone didn’t work!

£350 a night!. What a bargain.

I had to go down to reception. I did get moved but no apology at all.

Breakfast service the next day was poor too. I had to repeat my order three times and it was still wrong. Virtually no choice either. No cereal, yoghurt included just a full English. Everything else was extra.

This is meant to be a 5 star hotel and yet I am staying in a modest 3 star on Basingstoke as I write this, and which puts the Montcalm to shame.

What has happened to this hotel?",2,2022,07,09
128,Gesture of goodwill greatly appreciated,"Would have given 5 stars but had to wait some time for our room at check in.
However I left my jacket in my room and contacted the hotel with a request to send it to my home address. The duty manager sent it and as a gesture of goodwill did not charge for the postage and service. This good customer service was greatly appreciated.",4,2022,07,07
128,The bed was like sleeping on a cloud.,"The bed was incredibly comfortable, it felt like sleeping on a cloud. I would have thought that the television would be a Smart TV though, considering it's a five star hotel. Hotel was in an ideal location for easy access to the tube and local establishments. Staff were very helpful and friendly, they even offered to look after our bags after we'd checked out so we could go sightseeing on our last day in London without being encumbered.",4,2022,07,04
128,"Shabby, tired hotel. Not a 5 star, do not fall for that !","A tired, run down hotel , that is 3 star at best. 
DO NOT BELIEVE that this is anywhere near a 5 star or any of the website pictures etc 
The hotel is an old rabbit Warren of mixed up rooms, the staff don’t know which room is which, the air con is terrible, there is no mini bar, no scent hype thing they offer, no fruit , no tea and coffee in room. 
Clean enough but not immaculate. 
Staff all have terrible body odour - I’m truly sorry to say this and it’s not something I like to have to say but it’s true and not at all welcoming. 
This is a bit of a dive to be honest, I’ll not stay as for the money I would prefer a simple clean premier inn etc. 
for “ 5 star” I’ll pay lots more money ( not that I didn’t pay quite a lot of money here unfortunately) to get 5 star . There is a reason this place is Cheap ish - it’s rubbish . So glad I didn’t book needing romantic get away or posh night etc as I would have be gutted.",3,2022,07,03

* Empty fridge, no coffee or tea.
* One bathrobe/pair of slippers for two guests.
* Bare bathroom products/accessories.
* No onsite amenities to speak of.
* Tired/basic room decor, dodgy common space decor.

Good location, nice staff..",1,2022,06,30
128,One star,"Let me start by saying that I am paying £470 per night for a room in this hotel. That's a lot of money. A basic hotel room is never really worth that, but this hotel takes bad value to a new level.

It is also worth saying that I am not a serial reviewer of things, but sometimes the experience is so bad that you feel that not sharing would make you complicit, and this is one of those occasions.

Also I don't usually stay here, I usually stay at the sister hotel, The Montcalm Royal London House just round the corner, which is always very pleasant but it wasn't available. I thought ""well, the Montcalm at the Brewery will be ok too"". That was a gross miscalculation.

I will spare the readers of this too much detail but here are the highlights

- Arrived late, two large suitcases, a bit of a rabbit warren to get to the room but no help offered to get up and down flights of stairs

- A/C not working, its not too hot but the windows don't open much and its stuffy, reported the problem - we will send maintenance

- next morning, no maintenance, A/C still not working, report to front desk, ""maintenance don't work in the evenings, we will get straight on it""

- Return that evening, A/C still not working, report to front desk, ""this is the third time I've reported it"" - ""we will send maintenance""

- next morning, no maintenance, A/C still not working, report to front desk, ""maintenance don't work in the evenings, but we will get straight on it"" - ""this is the fourth time I've reported it - no one is actually coming are they?"" - ""we will get straight on it""

- Return that evening, A/C still not working, report to front desk, ""let me check my notes"", *silence*, ""no one even tried did they?"", ""I'm sorry"", ""you're not really though, are you?"", ""we left a fan in your room!"" *shrug*

For the hotel management who eventually read this, the problem with your Daikin BAC2C51 A/C is a U4 error, a communication error between indoor and outdoor units/outdoor and BS units – A mistake with the interconnection wires, or an indoor/outdoor PCB fault. I'm not an A/C engineer, I just Googled it and it definitely requires maintenance.

I have now had five calls to the room since I explained that I was going to leave this one star review, they are now offering to ""see what [they] can do to resolve the problem"", perhaps another fan?! In any case its too late.

The reception team appear tired, poorly trained and apathetic. I don't blame them at all, working in a hotel is hard, and you need the tools and training to do your job, I get the sense they have neither.

I'm checking out tomorrow, and will lose four nights at £470 per night as a result but on balance, I think that will be the best decision I've made with regards The Montcalm at the Brewery.",1,2022,06,28
128,Where do I begin?,"This is not a 5* Hotel 🏨 more like a 3* at best but without the service, polite staff and normal civilised hotels things! 
Upon arrival with friends (4 of us) they had lost a room, that took 20 minutes to resolve and then they couldn’t check us in as the system had crashed. Our friends were given a hot room with no air conditioning and no fridge items, we were given a room with no robes, no extractor fan in the bathroom, a shower that barely worked and a bed so high you required step ladders to get into it! 
We’re convinced that the owner is named Basil the whole place is a farce, they agreed to move our friends to another room the next day but upon us returning after a busy day in the city they couldn’t locate our friends or their room or luggage that they had moved! In the end it was resolved after proof of the booking and proof of ID, they gave us a complimentary breakfast worth £3 they normally charge £26 for.
The whole place is a farce, I have stayed in better 3* Hotels that at least cared about your comfort and wellbeing!
I would never stay in this place ever again, there is no communication between staff shifts and they don’t even seem to care anyway, awful,awful experience!

They claim it is because of COVID, but one would think that a few months after the pandemic someone would have been capable of stuffing a few cans of soft drinks and some nuts into the room fridges?

128,Two televisions but only one remote,"TL/DR: It'll do if you need a place to crash after a late night in the City.  For us it proved expensive for two nights of hot, uncomfortable sleep, so we'd look elsewhere next time. 

My partner and I stayed for two nights in the Montcalm London City in June 2022.  We had a split level room with a sleeping area on a mezzanine and a lounge section below.  

*What’s good?* 

Location: The Barbican is literally on your doorstep, and Moorgate, Liverpool Street, and Shoreditch are all within 10 minutes walk. 

Characterful property: the Brewery courtyard is a popular events space, and there’s some lovely double-height windows in some of the rooms. 

*What could be better?*

Rooms – at first glance they seem tired but ok.  They’re clean enough, feature ample amounts of toiletries and towels. It doesn’t take long to notice a lot of wear.  Our room featured:
 - Curtains that were unable to fully close
 - A large stain and discolored area on the wooden desk 
 - A Nespresso machine that featured used capsules still inside and a large coffee stain on the floor beneath 
 - One of the LED bedside reading lamps flickering rapidly like a strobe light. 

Room Temperature gets a special shoutout as the air conditioning was present but not terribly effective.  It was hot in there. 

Missing and damaged parts of the room – Our room featured two televisions, but only one remote between them: while the same remote worked on both TVs, it wasn’t useful to have to run up and down between the mezzanine sleeping area and the lounge to change the channel.  Other room features had pieces missing (e.g. chrome covers and pieces missing from shower knobs and the door lock) or damaged beyond use (e.g. missing adjustment knob on a temperature control unit, smashed power switch on one of the shaving mirrors).  The fridge was also not functioning: a drink I put in at the start of our stay ended up warmer when I took it out two days later. 

Allergy requests – we requested hypoallergenic pillows due to a feather allergy. This was acknowledge on check in, however we still ended up with two feather pillows in the room. 

Bed - the bed in our room was really high, requiring more of a leap of faith to get on even for the taller among us.  

*Other things good to know*
 - This is actually the same hotel as the Barbican Rooms across the street, so it is best to check in at the main reception at the Brewery rather than going straight to the Barbican Rooms.
 - Navigating from reception to the rooms is tricky, and involves a lot of small staircases.  We were actually shown to our room through a staff door, which unfortunately our room keys wouldn’t unlock.  If you’re on the side nearest the Barbican, it’s actually easier to go through the Jugged Hair pub or through the courtyard rather than from reception.  
 - When booking the room you're offered the option of a room scent. If this was present in our room we didn't notice it. 
 - Rooms feature an extensive AV panel: RCA/Component, S-Video, HDMI, and VGA inputs all present so you can map whatever onto the television screen. 
- Breakfast is offered in the Jugged Hare pub, and was £15 for continental buffet or £22 for full English.

All in it feels like a place that's good enough to crash in, particularly after an event taking place on the property or where the time you spend in the room isn't the most important part.  While not the worst hotel in the world, we found the hot, worn feel to be disappointing - especially considering the price we paid for it.",2,2022,06,25
128,Terrible Stay,"I stayed at the hotel last week. All of the staff on reception were really unfriendly, the gentleman that served me was not welcoming at all. Check in is from 2pm and I arrived at 3pm, but I then had to sit and wait in reception for over half an hour before I could go to my room.

I was taken across to the Barbican Rooms (the gentleman that assisted me with my luggage was extremely pleasant). I had booked and paid for a club double room at the Montcalm, not the Barbican Rooms. The room I was presented with was tired, smelt of damp, and was not clean. It was more like a hostel, and again the lady on reception here was also extremely unwelcoming. When booking your room, you can choose your pillow type and what scent you would like in your room. I don’t know why they bother asking you this when they clearly don’t provide this service. It became quite apparent that I had been shoved in this room at the last minute. 

I called reception and advised that I wasn’t happy with my room. I explained why and I was asked to go back over the The Montcalm reception to see what other rooms they had available. I advised that I just wanted what I had booked and paid for. 

One of the female members of staff took me to see a club double room which I agreed to take as this is what I had booked and paid for. The room was still tired, the bathroom was not clean, the bath plug didn’t work and the room also had a damp smell. I was told that the damp smell was due to the age of the hotel ..

I had stayed at the hotel previously pre covid and had an enjoyable stay, hence why I booked again. I was disappointed to see that the customer service is now appalling and that the hotel itself is really run down. I will not be staying again. It’s not a 5 star, calling it a 3 star would be a compliment.",1,2022,06,20
128,Our best stay in London city,"We stayed here when attending an event in Kings Cross. As we arrived to the hotel we took in the brilliant architectural heritage of the buildingwhich was a brewery. Greeted by very polite staff who assisted us to reception. Check in was easy and an enjoyable experience. We booked the WOW Suite and it was very WOW. spacious, Morden and clean modern features, four poster extremely comfortable bed. The large bath with a window to the bedroom and electric shutter was a lovely surprise. Many more features in the room made it very enjoyable.
Continental breakfast was delicious. high level of service from the staff. The supervised and the head of cleaning visited our room on the first day and ask if everything was ok very friendly staff all round.
I highly recommend this hotel if you visit the city.",5,2022,06,20
128,"Warm welcome, phenomenal customer service - thank you Geanina!","Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly concierge staff who directed us to the lovely Geanina, who checked us in. From the moment we met her she was warm, friendly and engaging offering us a warm welcome. Geanina offered us suggestions for our stay and upgraded our room with complimentary prosecco at no extra cost. This was a truly lovely encounter and we thank Geanina for her hospitality. A true asset to the team at The Montcalm at the Brewery in London. We will definitely be back. Thank you Geanina!",5,2022,06,17
128,Nothing positive,"The idea that this is a 4- star hotel is laughable. The room was small, looked very tired, outdated equipment and furniture and it had a strong smell of damp. Carpets were in a sorry state and wet. The wallpaper has certainly seen better days.

Check-in was very impersonal and not very organised and certainly not what would one expect from a decent hotel. Other than the location, i cannot say anything positive about this hotel.",1,2022,06,13
128,"GOOD HOTEL, BAD EXPERIENCE","The hotel was very comfortable. Kind treatment  by tbe personal. But we had a problem and one month later we are still waiting for a solution. We forgot an item at the room that wished recover. We asked for the best way to send it back, paying the expenses of the courier of course, and no solution from the manager even we sent them several e- mails. Very disagreed.",1,2022,06,13
128,Terrible experience not 5 star!!,"Booked this for a Birthday celebration. Terrible experience!
Checked in at 10pm, the room had hair in the bath, water stains in the bathroom. dust on surfaces, water stains on glass rims, cup marks on tables, dirt on tables. Absolutely disgusting for a supposedly 5 star hotel. Having complained I was given another room, which also had hair in the bathroom and was just as unclean with dust and stains in various parts of the room. This is a big building, so a lot of walking was involved with luggage, various parts of it smelt like drainage. Having complained again for the second time. I was upgraded to their “best suite” this was an old dated room with a four poster bed and old cupboards, it was ghastly to say the least. The room smelt like drainage, was cold and you could hear the sound of the drainage randomly in the bathroom. At this point it was past 11pm, an hour after checking in and still I hadn’t been given an adequate room. Let’s not forget this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. I was told nothing could be done because housekeeping left at 7pm and they have no other rooms available. Somehow they managed to give me an accessibility room, which had a pole in the middle, smelt, hairs on the bed sheets and pillows, stains on the beds, dust in various places. That wasn’t the worst bit, the toilet bowl had feces.  I’d also like to mention for an accessibility room the bed was way too high. Enough was enough, I made a serious complained and cancelled my stay having to leave at almost 1am to find another hotel. It does make me question, how is this a 5 star hotel? Are chamber maids being overworked? Is that the reason all 4 rooms I was shown were in terrible condition? I am left with no words, this is my worst hotel experience ever and one that will not be forgotten! Having visited many 5 star hotels including The Montcalm itself I am shocked and extremely disgusted. 

With a limit of 10 photos only for a review, it’s a shame as I have at least 30 photos including a video of the drainage sound in the “best suite”",1,2022,06,13
128,Had a great time great service ,The hotel was great the room we had was big and beautiful. We had a wow suite! The service was friendly would definitely recommend and go back to myself. The location was really good right next to two tube stations about a 5 minute walk to them. Had a great time. ,4,2022,06,08
128,Not 5*,"Terrible experience. Allocated very small dusty dirty  room with no natural light despite paying for a better room type. Arrogant concierge/porter who returned to our room to give us the coins we’d tipped him back! Better rooms available online but receptionist insisted the hotel was full and we couldn’t have another room. This was untrue. Safe battery had not been replaced so jammed shut. We had to wait til next day to recover our possessions. Black hairs in the bath, towel rail not working, extractor not working, dirty coffee cup marks on window ledge. Moved to a better room the next day but still issues with lack of maintenance- reading lights not working, parts of shower broken etc. very over rated and over priced. Definitely would never book a Montcalm place again.",2,2022,06,06
128,Cutting corners in all the wrong places.,"Not a 5 star hotel. I’ve stayed at nicer hostels. Sheets didn’t fit the beds and there were no mattress covers, so we woke up on bare mattress. There were no Nespresso machine, aroma therapy, personal pillow selection as advertised. “Included” breakfast was not  available any morning, as no chefs in the kitchen. Rooms not cleaned properly or restocked fully; had to request tea, coffee, shampoo, water, etc. We found previous occupants dirty laundry in the wardrobe. Overall a stressful and disappointing experience, which was supposed to be a luxury special weekend.",1,2022,06,06
128,Perfect stay,"We arrived at the hotel ready for the jubilee weekend , we were greeted with smiling faces and very quick check in with someone who insisted in carrying all of our luggage and showing us to our room , I can’t remember the guys name but he was lovely . The room itself was amazingly tidy and clean , the room beautiful with all the amenities we needed the bed was super comfortable also . We will definitely stay again ⭐️",5,2022,06,04
128,"Not a 5 star hotel, terrible experience","I recently stayed for 5 nights on a business trip. Upon arrival from a 14 hour flight, the gym (shower facilities) were under renovation which was not mentioned in advance, so there was nowhere to freshen up or get changed.

When I checked into room 002 later that day, my keycard did not work to open the exterior block door, I had it reset a total of 4 times none of which worked and meant I could only access my room with a staff member. I was constantly told to not keep the card near my phone/wallet, something I hadn't ever done.

When trying to call reception I realised the room phone was not connected to the wall nor was there anywhere to plug it in, very odd.

Breakfast was meant to open at 7am and while the food was excellent it was never all ready until 7:20 which is not good for those with early meetings.

Finally, on my last night the fire alarm went off at 130am, none of the staff explained what was going on. It was then reset and we were told to return to our rooms, with no apology. A few minutes later it went off again and I did not get back into my room until 2:10am. While I accept systems malfunction there was no acknowledgement or explaination of anything. Even when I checked out at 6am it was not mentioned.

I'm very disappointed with this experience and hope the Montcalm will strive for better. When I complained online I received a copy and paste response about a guest setting off the alarm with no mention of my other problems.

Currently I would not stay here again. This is not 5 star service.",1,2022,06,03
128,Not the standard expected,"I really didn’t want to be but I was really disappointed with this hotel. The details on the website and its position in London were perfect for us as we needed to be at the Barbican for an event. It started poorly… the room had been used and not cleaned prior to our late arrival. So, to another room we went. The decor in the rooms is starting to look rather dated. The brown bedroom furniture is stained and tired as are the facilities in the bathroom.
Specific issues include the bathroom controls which came off in my hand, the air conditioning unit being incredibly noisy and insisting on turning itself on at 3am, both nights despite being turned off and the ill fitting windows which result in the noise starting quite early.
The final issue was the hotel layout. I would suggest a hotel where the concierge team need to have crib notes in their pockets telling them which door to use to get to the correct room on the right floor may have a problem. Quite frustrating when you are trying to find your room on your own for the first time. 
As I said, I am disappointed that my stay was not better especially at the price. This is NOT a 5 star hotel and should be avoided if you do not wish to be disappointed.",2,2022,06,02
128,Needs better management to make it great again,"Empty promises. I booked an upgraded Montcalm Club Room as I wanted to use the “Club lounge” facilities during the day. It was advertised as being open all day with tea, coffee, Wi-Fi and large tv. In reality it was only open between 5.30pm and 7.30pm when free refreshments were available. The promised canapés turned out to be three types of nuts. The Montcalm Club Room also boasted a Nespresso coffee machine and we could choose our preferred pillows and preferred room aroma. Sadly the Ladies Dainty Pillow, the Lavender Aroma and Nespresso machine were nowhere to be seen. The room was nice apart from the empty promises but obviously not worth paying a premium price for nothing extra available. When we entered the building through the courtyard to go to our room there was always a group of staff smoking by the doorway so you had to go through a sea of smoke. Even the chefs were smoking in their whites!
I understand the problems in the hospitality trade but I stayed in the Canopy by Hilton the following three nights and the staff were fabulous, unlike the untrained staff at the Montcalm at the Brewery. There was only the competent Valentino who stood out like a beacon. 

A Club Lounge is important to me for working away purposes.",2,2022,05,30
128,ok hotel but can't get the basics right,"Hotel itself is ok but can't see why it gets all the positive reviews. They make a big think about being able to select your pillow of preference when booking which I did selecting a foam pillow as I'm badly allergic to feathers. I arrive at the hotel and find feather pillows on my bed. On my way out to dinner at 7pm I ask reception to have foam pillows delivered to my room. On returning - no foam pillows. At 10pm I phone reception and again ask for foam pillows when I'm told the hotel doesn't have any and someone has gone to a sister hotel to collect. What kind of hotel doesn't have spare foam pillows? At 10.40pm I phone again and suggest that a full refund would be in order if I don't get foam pillows as I cannot sleep on feather pillows. At 11am foam pillows finally arrived but they were the worst, lumpiest foam pillows you've ever seen. At that point I gave up and slept with no pillows or rather didn't sleep!! In the morning I complained at reception but have heard nothing since. Really poor guys!!! Focus on the basics.",1,2022,05,27
128,Stay Elsewhere,"Despite being a member of the Montcalm loyalty programme, and having stayed here and at their Marble Arch property, this was very poor.

No room service, no cooked or hot breakfast, only explanation was “it’s due to Covid”! Pathetic. Small room with a bathroom basin tap that even on full flow let out barely a trickle of water. 

Overpriced and simply not coping. Stay Elsewhete.",1,2022,05,21
128,Needs renovation… and new lights,"I’m not quite sure how this hotel rates so well. My room was dark and pretty dirty, the shower was a bit of a horror show (see picture). The whole room was rough around the edges and need of renovation. I had to walk through a courtyard and enter a pin to get to my room, not great in the rain.",2,2022,05,20
128,Big praise for duty manager,"Apart from a nice stay at the Montcalm, the staff, in particular the duty manager, Alius, was very very helpful after I left a set of car keys in my room. He even went to the extent of posting them back to me cutting into his own time to do so.

Would highly recommend and big praise for Alius!",5,2022,05,18
128,Wedding Anniversary,"Our daughter gifted us a 2 night stay at the hotel for our 27th wedding anniversary . When we went to our room we noticed that one of the light was not working in the bathroom so we informed the reception and were informed that it will be sorted out.
When we returned back to the hotel in the evening nothing was done, therefore we informed the reception again and they sent the maintenance man who couldn't even speak English properly and could not fix the problem with the light.
We were allocated another room, but this room was even worse than the first one, therefore another call to the reception and yet again another room allocated.  This room had the similar light fault as the first room and now informed the duty manager,  but as it was very late and we were tired so we slept in the room
When we checked out we informed the receptionist and she said to email the manager regarding our complaint,  which I did the next day
To date we have not received any reply from the hotel manager,  therefore please do not stay at this hotel",2,2022,05,17
128,A huge amount of staff training needed,"all looked good apart from the aircon unit outside the window. then the fire alarm sounded at 1.30 a.m. on evacuating the room we found laundry baskets in the stairwell plus an open storage cupboard full of paper towels and toilet rolls with the door propped open. Fuel for any fire!!
No staff organising guests in the courtyard, no staff stopping people entering the hotel entrance, no place of safety organised, no fire brigade called until a guest did so. absolute chaos. I will not stay there again if they paid me. unless their systems are sorted somebody will die.",2,2022,05,15
128,Avoid room 139 (and presumably other nearby),"Just checked in, room 139 is pretty noisy with an air-con unit (apparently) right outside the window. Presume they can do better than this. Also not any sign of a room service option, which is pretty disappointing after a 14 hour day of meetings.",2,2022,05,11
128,"Very disappointing, not 5-star","This is not a 5-star hotel. It might have been some time ago but it is more like a good 3-star hotel these days. The rooms are small, the decor is tired and in need of updating, and don’t even start me on the pathetic excuse for a shower. How is it possible that even a self-purported 5-star hotel can have a “shower” where the water trickles out at best?! It was so difficult to wash my hair with such little water pressure and so disappointing after a long day of meetings. 
On my first night the shower drain was also blocked and there was some humour in the shower potentially overflowing from the pathetic trickle of water. The staff did fix the blocked drain but absolutely no improvement was observed on the water flow/pressure despite a complaint. Also no one followed up on this with me despite asking for every kind of contact detail from me at check-in. What’s the point of asking all these details if you don’t use them to actually communicate with your guests?
The good things? The bed is comfortable for one (probably not for two as it is not very large) and the location is good for City/Moorgate meetings. They provide free bottled water and the front office staff are kind and polite. 
Will I stay here on my next business trip? Absolutely not. In fact, I am staying on additionally in London to enjoy some time with my family and THANK GOODNESS I chose to book elsewhere.",2,2022,05,04
128,Will be definitely staying again when next in the area,"The service was impeccable the best I have ever experienced. The hotel is very well located and warming. Rooms were spacious and well maintained. Faultless.

Elisa Lima went above and beyond to ensure my everything was perfect!! 

Thank you!",5,2022,05,04
128,The Montcalm London City,"I never normally leave review for hotel stays but staying at the Montcalm London city on Friday evening was a fabulous experience. The hotel was stunning, but the service from the concierge but particularly the reception desk staff was of the highest order, friendly and always available to help. I will definitely be coming back",5,2022,05,03
128,Business stay whilst attending a luncheon event at The Brewery,"Re-visiting a hotel used several times over the years, but not been back for a few years. Despite the effects on the hospitality industry over the last few years and issues with retaining and attracting new team members. 

This Montcalm did not did not disappoint in any way.  

From quickly changing the original room allocated to somewhere more central within the Hotel, At all times the hotel teams were extremely courteous and helpful. 

Due to the next door function the check in was very busy, but everyone was unfazed, whilst making the experience enjoyable.",5,2022,04,30
128,Nice Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a company offsite meeting. Staff were very attentive,  in particular Steff (Guest Relations), went out of her way to make sure we were all looked after. Hotel is nicely decorated and clean. My room was well equipped with everything you would need and the fruit bowls dotted around the place are a nice touch. Breakfast was a bit of a disaster. Not busy, but very long wait times, overcharged and average food. If I wanted to host any executives here, I would hesitate for that reason only.",4,2022,04,29
128,Disappointing,"We have to share our disappointment with our recent stay at Montcalm The Brewery.

The experience deteriorated  in many ways:

The control power panel in the room did not work and so the charger did not work and we could not charge our phones. 

The TV pixelated on the very limited channels that we were able to view (satellite channels advertised)  and in the morning did not work at all. 

We were without water for over an hour in the later evening due to a plumbing issue. 

Once we went to bed we noticed halfway down the bed was a room key that wasn’t ours. This understandably did not make for a good night’s sleep as we were worried our room hadn’t been cleaned properly or the sheets replaced. 

The blind between the the room and the bathroom did not go down.

The rooms sound insulation was questionable as the neighbours kept us awake for a lot of the night. 

We had mentioned certain issues as they arose but once it got late we needed to try to sleep and therefore gave up. The night had been ruined enough. We had been offered a club breakfast but this had no bread on offer, two limp pieces  of cheese, a couple of ham slices and the remembers of a fruit salad, not the full English we had been led to believe. 

Ultimately, we had chosen the Montcalm due to an excellent previous stay at the one at Marble Arch, it’s reputation and it’s location but unfortunately we feel let down by the lack of basic needs-electricity and water at the very least. 

On checking out we made our points and we’re unable to speak to any manager with the necessary authority to offer no more than 30% discount on a future stay. A few other items were suggested e.g champagne, which was changed to Prosecco and and room upgrade next time which was dependent on availability so not guaranteed. We are slightly confused as to why Montcalm are unable to provide us with the stay we should have been due, without us having to pay for another night which may or may not result in an upgrade. 

The final straw is that after emailing customer care and the info email addresses we have not received a reply. We also note that the many reviews on here are not replied to by the management in the usual way of a reputable service based establishment.",1,2022,04,24
128,not worth 5*,Firstly we arrived check in was between 2-3 we didn’t get into our room until 4 because it “wasn’t ready” so waited in the lobby for 25 minutes before going back up too ask when our room would be ready for us only then to be told “soon” then we asked how long and they said it would be another half hour. So we asked if there was a bar that we could wait in whilst our room was still being prepared they took us too the club lounge where We got given what I think was lemon tea when we asked for normal tea. Then we went back and our room was ready. Online we booked the room with the 4 post bed which we did not get because they said “every room is different with it being a Victorian building” so they couldn’t guarantee we got that specific room. The staircase in the room was very wobbly and a part of it was broken. The light switch in the bathroom was broken could see wires through it. There was a long black hair in the bath too and neither me or my partner have black hair. Considering this was meant to be an amazing weekend for my birthday I was very upset with this. There was no room service. No drinks in the mini fridge in the room and there was no remote for our tv so we had to change the channels by pressing the buttons on the actual tv itself. Not a 5* At all.,1,2022,04,23
128,Not worth the money,The hotel appears to be a 5 star hotel at the web but It is really not in quality. Situated with noise from the street and noise from the Ground floor bar which er could hear clearly from Oure 4th floor rooms. I cannot recommend this hotel. The service was not a 5 star experience at all. .the decor was low quality  and brownish colors all over.bathroom was not High quality. I really felt cheated. And I also felt undlade since People from the bar and the street could easily access the hotel flora. Not worth the money at all.,1,2022,04,22
128,Excellent staff and always a pleasant stay,"I frequently stay here as I work late and the hotel is situated near the office. The staff are always very kind, quick at checking me in and helpful. The rooms are clean and the stay is always relaxing; all this at a reasonable price.",5,2022,04,21
128,Never a five star hotel,"Where to start... A mini fridge that didn't work, phones that didn't work, a shower door with a huge gap in the join which meant the bathroom flooded every time the shower was used, an inability to take a breakfast order correctly, an inability to serve breakfast in a timely manner (I sat there for ten minutes watching my plate go cold after the chef called for service), an inability to provide even the most basic things one would expect at breakfast - sugar on the table, a spoon to stir said sugar etc, a radio clock that I later discovered had the wrong time, and worst of all a lack of tea in the room (I had to walk down to get some because the phones weren't working, standing there like an idiot for a considerable amount of time because the front desk kept calling the concierge away).",2,2022,04,20
128,Terrible experience - charged double and I am still waiting for a response and refund,"While the staff at the hotel itself were pleasant I have had a terrible experience from start to finish. I made a booking online via the Montcalm website and made full payment, I was then asked at check-in to pay an additional amount for no clear reason. When I showed my booking confirmation and evidence I had made full payment I was told this was an error and an additional payment needed to be made. I was made to feel like I had made a mistake and I was holding up the line of waiting guests, all of us weren't able to check in at 2pm as advertised and had to wait until 5pm. I was then charged an additional night with no explanation despite checking out when originally booked. I have made multiple calls to both the Reservations team and Reception trying to resolve this and get a refund, been left on hold many times, up to 52 minutes. I have been repeatedly asked to repeat myself and email different email addresses with evidence of the complaint, all showing clear  evidence of the additional charges and amount the Montcalm has taken incorrectly. I am yet to have a response or any indication the hotel are taking this seriously. I keep calling and asking for a refund and acknowledgement this issue is being investigated. I am extremely frustrated, disappointed and inconvenienced by the whole experience - you expect more from any hotel, especially one positioning themselves as a 5-star, first class experience representing London. I feel scammed having paid double for absolutely no reason and have been treated as if this issue is of no concern at all, clearly guests aren't valued aside from wanting your money.
Do not book on their website, or even consider staying at this hotel.",1,2022,04,18
128,Not as expected,"The hotel really was not as expected. It is pitched as four star, but has no facilities . The gym was pretty disgraceful. Access was via a cupboard door, that led to a narrow staircase littered with tools and rubbish (see photos). No machines were switched on, there were puddles on the floor that had been covered with towels and ignored, fire extinguishers held doors open, and the door to the female changing rooms was off it’s hinges and perched on the floor. We booked a club room and were promised a stocked mini bar and Nespresso machine. The mini bar was empty, and there was no coffee machine. When I enquired at reception, I was told the mini bar is never stocked, and that the coffee machine was in the club area, which was closed. There was no where to get a drink, coffee or any food, as the hotel doesn’t offer room service. It has put me off ever staying with Montcalm again. The customer service was awful too, no one has responded to the email I sent complaining, whilst still in the hotel.",1,2022,04,15
128,Really bad - never a 5 star hotel. A poor 3 star at best.,"When i checked into my room i was fairly surprised to see empty bottles on the floor, used towels lying around the room and the bed already slept in! I went back to reception and queued to speak to someone to explain the situation. I was then'upgraded' to a different room - when i went in the smell of damp was awful - the windows had been left open by staff obviously to try and mask the smell. 

The room didn't have double-glazing so i was wakened up by the bottle banks getting emptied beneath my window at 5.15am - not great. There is no bar, no restaurant and no room service which isn't made clear on the website.

Bad points:

- damp in the rooms (you and your clothes will therefor smell of damp)
- rooms are really dated and poorly cleaned
- nowhere to eat or drink
- poorly trained staff
- confusing and unclear signage (lots of guests wandering around lost)
- no double glazing so very noisy

Good points:

- i got to check out this morning.",1,2022,04,12
128,Great front of house,"Regularly stay here for business and front of house particularly Sonny has always delivered in making sure I have a pleasant stay.

Thanks Sonny!

Would recommend for business stays. Very good central location.",4,2022,04,11
128,Shocked & very disappointed,"What a disappointment. It’s very sad as this could be a beautiful hotel. Seriously tired in all but reception areas and poorly run, trading on what can only be a historical reputation. From check in to check out, just too many things to mention. From not being able to find the booking to the rooms being not the ones booked, being locked out of our rooms on the second day and finding the room not serviced by the late afternoon when we did get in. From the shocking attitude of the male senior manager who we asked to help us - him openly laughing when we said how unhappy we were with this.
The photos show the state of the gowns we were given for the room - they really epitomize the current poor standards and lack of attention to detail . There are better places to stay for this money in london. What is going on there ! 
Some staff such as reception and the senior concierge are trying hard but they cannot make up for all this…",1,2022,04,10
128,Disappointing experience for a 5* hotel in London,"The most uncomfortable bed I have slept in a hotel! The bed was small for a double bed and there was an extremely soft mattress that you could not sleep! The room was very warm and you could hear noise from the elevator every night!
The cleaning was average.
Location was positive and near Metro stations. 
The value considering the price I paid and that this is a 5* hotel is low!",2,2022,04,04
128,Disappointing,"I chose this hotel after having an amazing night at Montcalm East last year. I couldn’t have been more flummoxed. When we arrived we were told we’d been ‘upgraded’ how lovely we thought especially as we had a special celebration. I had already chosen what I thought was a perfect room - handpicked our pillows and strangely enough a ‘scent’. We were taken along to another building a floor above the pub ‘The Jugged Hare’.

Some upgrade! The ‘tired decor’ along with the room smelling stuffy, the carpet felt sticky, the bathroom shambolic with tiles hanging off. All the printed instructions advising how to work the tub and shower were in fact the exact opposite. The bedroom was dark with  bizarrely the only one curtain unsuccessfully covering a window. Hidden lighting above a coving showed holes where someone had drilled. Unfortunately,  we only had a limited time as we’d booked an evening meal and basically the whole chore of going back to change rooms seemed daunting. We thought wed go and cheer ourselves up and having a light meal. We were met by the waitress who immediately told us that the kitchen closed (it in fact closed 50 minutes later). I noted that other customers coming in after this weren’t given this information - not the best welcome I have ever encountered going for a late lunch. 

I could bore you all but I’m going to leave it there.",1,2022,03,31
128,URINE in toothbrush holder. Disgusting place.,"There was a black toothbrush holder glass with URINE IN IT. 
Filthy.
This disgusting glass was left in the bathroom on the edge of the unit.
The manager did nothing to fix this horrific experience in any way..: infact asked why I didn’t take a photo.
Place was generally dark and dirty.. AVOID.
Filthy",1,2022,03,28
128,Ruined our stay and weren't even sorry.,"We arrived to check in late at night after being out in London all day. When we arrived in our room, there was no toilet paper. I had already changed into loungewear and had to go out and find someone. I found a member of staff near the lifts and he did bring us toilet paper, but a few minutes later we realised there were no pillow cases on the pillows. We were too tired to go find someone else. My daughter was already falling asleep, so we slept on the pillow protectors, which were old, pilling and stained. We complained in the morning and waited half an hour to see the duty manager who never arrived. We had a table booked for brunch so we had to leave. No one ever apologised for the issues. I've complained by email and after 3 weeks have received no response. I will never stay with this hotel chain again. They ruined my birthday.",1,2022,03,28
128,Very nice,"service and the  was just out of this world. One of the best experiences we have had. Thanks to the team and recepcion, location its perfect. rooms are very clean and they recoment few dinning option also really nice",4,2022,03,24
128,Worn and tired,"I have stayed at other Montcalm’s and this one has to be the worst. The only reason for 2 stars was the friendliness of the staff on checking in. 

The rooms are in serious need of refurbishment. The room didn’t even look like it was cleaned properly. The hotel is just worn and tired, please invest in making it the 5 star hotel it once was. Definitely wouldn’t recommend anyone stay here at these prices!",2,2022,03,18
128,Not value for money,"The hotel is very centrally located, but it had NO facilities. No fitness centre, no business centre, no restaurant, no bar, nothing. Also, the service was nothing to write home about, and their rooms and layout is also very age old.  The breakfast was the same for the entire length of the stay - no variety - no eggs, nothing warm except for toast.  Not value for money in my view. ",3,2022,03,13
128,Such a letdown,"I have stayed at this hotel about five years ago and it was amazing, hence booking again …. Oh no 🙈. The staff are friendly but many are new ( never a good sign). Check in was good to be fair but once I got to the room things started to go downhill. Strong smell of bad drainage in the bathroom. Rainfall shower did not work at all so had to use the other handheld one. No mini bar or room service. Room seemed clean to be fair but everything needed updating. Such a shame as could be a great hotel. definitely only a 3 star at best.",2,2022,03,08
128,Never again!,"We stayed here over the weekend as a friend was getting married at the brewery. Location was excellent but everything else about the hotel was horrendous. Upon checking in we were told we had two reservations in the same name for two nights so we would have to move room after the first night. I said we are not doing that and we were then taken to our room. The room stunk, it was stuffy and had a weird smell and the window had been left open so I can only assume the staff knew that the room was smelly. We were then told we would be taken to a more modern room. The more modern room couldn’t have been further from modern if it tried. There was a weird noise in the bathroom so we asked to move again. The third room we get to, the room hadn’t been made when we were taken in. At that point I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The bed was a mess as if someone had just got out of it. We were late for our dinner plans so told them to send housekeeping in while we were gone. The next morning my husband went to ask where breakfast was, we had paid for breakfast but he was told he couldn’t have breakfast because we didn’t have a club room. Our room was a club room so I don’t understand what the problem was. The staff were just incompetent on so many levels. Money down the toilet staying there!",1,2022,03,07
128,No natural Light or View from the Room,"First impressions of the hotel are great.  The staff were welcoming and polite though waiting to book in was a little slow.  After a long day, I was keen to get to my room and take an overseas call I had scheduled.  There were two people booking in and three staff but I still had to wait 20 minutes.  

However, got to the room, had a quick shower, fresh change of clothes, got my mobile ready for the call and thought I’d let some light into the room.  Opened the curtains and a dark, grey wall, a few feet from the window covered in pigeon nets, feathers and birds mess.  

I understand that in London, buildings can be close but this was awful.  Maybe not booking direct you get the back-end rooms. It would be nice to be informed there's no view or natural light in the room and get some sort of compensation

After my call, I rushed out to an event, came back and wanted to get my head down.  A rumbling of an extractor fan right under the pigeon nets all night meant my sleep was continuously broken.  Nice hotel, nice, clean room, terrible view and rubbish nights rest",2,2022,03,07
128,"Misadvertised, unhygienic and in places, unsafe","I'll start with the positives - this hotel is located in a historic building, and is located perfectly if you're doing business in the City of London, or if you are visiting the Barbican Centre which is very close by - and the reason for our trip.

However, the good points stop there. This will be a long outpouring of my frustration and dissatisfaction - but to summarise: the hotel is NOT a 5 star establishment, it is tired and in disrepair, there are areas of basic hygiene and safety which are lacking, and I suspect mis-selling by using pictures of rooms in other Montcalm establishments.

Check-in was a slow, but enlightening experience. The staff appeared inexperienced and fairly intimidated by guests, and needed to check almost every transaction with a senior colleague. As the queue built up, the male concierges and duty manager would swoop on younger, attractive women in the queue to provide them with quicker service - actually delaying them as they needed to wait to use the terminals. On check-in, I was asked to provide photographic ID. I queried this as it was not mentioned in the booking or check-in documentation. The response was 'to scan it for our records'. I refused the request.

We were then allocated Room 211 in the East Wing. On entering the room was dark, until the keycard was inserted to provide power - however there is a curved, flight of shallow steps into the room which were impossible to see in the very low ambient light of the corridor. That hazard navigated without disaster, we entered the room. It was absolutely not as described in the booking. The room size was far below what was stated, and the luxury amenities which provide the 5 star rating here were entirely absent: no coffee-maker, no minibar, no 'pillow menu' or 'scent box', no room service, and no information on how to access the facilities which came with the 'Club Room' booking. Furthermore, the room was filthy - furniture stained, and the desk covered in a sticky goo which I don't want to imagine the source of. Marks on the bedlinen, splashes of toothpaste on the mirror and sink, and a fairly well-established coating of dust. There were however two apples and a rather sickly looking tangerine - that must be the 'fruit basket'?

We telephoned reception and reported our issues. After a while we were called back and told that the room tiers 'could be very confusing to some people' and that we were not in a club room. Odd - the booking said we were, and the fancy sign on the door to the room did too. I asked about the other amenities and was told 'coffee makers are not in all rooms'. Reluctantly, it was agreed a concierge would attend to show us another room for approval.

The young concierge was helpful and friendly, and showed us Room 007 in the East Wing, accessed via a confusing range of staff lifts and keycard doors meaning it was hard to find our way back later. He also confirmed that we could not access the 'Club Lounge' with a 'Club Room' booking today as there was an event, and that there was no room service, but we could get a Deliveroo and collect it from reception.

The second room was larger and appeared to be in better repair, on first inspection. We gladly moved from the previous room, but soon found even more issues. While some of the amenities WERE in place (bathrobes, slippers) others were still missing (no coffee machine, etc. as above) - and moreover, some basic items were missing: no slip mat for the shower, now bathmat, incomplete sets of towels. 

Other basic functions of the room were in disrepair: the light switches did not operate correctly, the air-conditioning would begin operating then fail seconds later with a grinding crunch from the ceiling, and the panel of USB sockets failed to work, falling off the wall on inspect and appearing to be held on with sticky pads rather than screws. The desk at which it was located was also severely bent - like someone had sat on the centre of it - and not usable as a result. The bed, while large was a fold-down bed which was incredibly uncomfortable, with a huge gap at the head where pillows disappeared into a dusty, grimy cavity.

The second room was also unclean - the marbled floor of the bathroom was on inspection, very badly splashed and stained. The dust in the coffee area was again thick - with a distinct 'clean patch' when I moved the box of tea and coffee sachets. We resolved not to to try to change rooms again given my wife's limited mobility at present, and intended to raise these issues again in the morning.

The final straw was when, on waking up we found wedding confetti inside the bed. This confetti was crisp and fresh, and therefore had not been laundered. We realised with some disgust that the bed-linen had likely not been changed between stays and decided to check out at once, a day early.

Even this was not simple - check-out was as convoluted and slow as checking-in, and again the predatory concierges would swoop on 'chosen' guests for preferential treatment. The receptionist listened and was visibly shocked a the confetti we showed. We were asked to wait for the manager. We sat where indicated until one of the concierges swept us away at an area out-of-sight and earshot of other guests. The manager, Giles, was polite and pleasant - but clearly did not want us to check out early. His customer service technique was to suggest he wanted us to be happy, and that we needed to go away and think about it for awhile until he called us back. We were firm: we were leaving at least did not expect to pay for the second night. ""I'll give you a suite"" said Giles, ""I'll make it worth your while"". We politely refused - we were tired from poor sleep on a fancy camp bed, overheated from an uncooled room and fed up with the hotel's idiosyncrasies. ""Well, just think it over. I'll give you a call later. Let me know"".

We left immediately, intending to take this up with the chain directly. Giles was good to his word though. He called us back: ""Are you still in London? Can I suggest you come back? We'll make sure you leave with a smile on your face"". No thanks Giles, but I appreciate your tenacity. He finally, grudgingly agreed that we'd receive a refund for the second night but that he couldn't do more unless we came back to the hotel.

Overall, we could have had a much more friendly, comfortable experience in a budget hotel chain for a fraction of the cost, and known we were in a safe, hygienic environment. The website and booking engines for this hotel promise amazing amenities, but deliver few or none of them. They claim that the hotel has enhanced cleaning routines in place, but fail to show evidence of even normal basic hygiene, and the place is clearly operated by a group of young, inexperienced people who have little commitment to customer service. I can only suggest you book a nearby Premier Inn and spend your savings on a luxurious meal somewhere nice.",1,2022,03,06
128,Do not stay here!,"If you are thinking of booking this hotel, save some money and have a better stay at the local Travelodge instead. Check in time was 2pm on booking confirmation, at 15.30 our room was still not ready, we was expected to sit in the reception until it was, after some pressuring they supplied a different room so we could freshen up to head out and promised our stuff would be moved over as soon as our suite was ready, this was not done, I had to do myself. Staff don't know their way around the hotel, took us to 2 wrong rooms before finding ours The room (which had apparently just been cleaned) had previous peoples rubbish on the cabinets. This is no way a 5* hotel! Have emailed requesting comments for our nightmare stay as when we checked out staff didn't want to know and laughed it off. Listen to the reviews and stay away from this hotel!",1,2022,03,02
128,Shocking,"This hotel is a health hazard, how this hotel has a 5 star rating is beyond me . Faulty shower with knob installed incorrectly so you get burned when you first enter shower, water does not drain properly so overflows on to the bathroom tiles which my friend had an awful fall luckily didnt cause any harm . Room was tired and outdated, filthy net curtain and curtains themselves, only 1 USB port in whole room didnt work, the clock was set to the wrong time, bathroom mirror light didn't work, bathroom telephone broken, pen graffiti on the wallpaper the list goes on, the front desk reception employees were rude and unpleasent, even the concierge was clueless to where our room was and we got lost in the hotel and ended up on a 20 minute wild goose chase.  I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here, absolutely unacceptable. 5 star is obscene, travelodge have better rooms",1,2022,02,26
128,"How they have 5 star status, I’ll never know!! A week later and still no response from the complaints department.","Me and my partner stayed here for our valentines weekend away, was quite exciting to see the supposed 5 star hotel as photos looked amazing, but as anything, if it sounds too good too be true, it probably is.. I’ve stayed in better 2 star hotels.",1,2022,02,19
128,Rooms were OK. Breakfast was HORRIBLE,"Honestly, we booked the hotel because of a convention happening next door that we were attending. 
To be honest, don’t think we’ll come back next year although it was convenient. 

Rooms were ok, bed was comfortable and room was clean. No bar at the hotel, and we would have definitely liked to gave a coffee at the lobby but I guess that’s a nice to have. 

However, hotels that cost way way less do a much better job on breakfast. 
First of all, it’s not actually at the hotel, it’s at the pub a few doors down the road. 
I guess they are understaffed (because on the first day it took a normal continental breakfast 45 min to arrive) 
The breakfast in of itself (that was included in the price) was very mediocre and lacked any options. 
No juice, charged extra for coffee. Missed a lot of small and big touches. 
Probably won’t return, and overpriced imo.",2,2022,02,16
128,Very nice hotel ,"I have seen some poor reviews for this hotel but not my experience. The room was very nice and spacious, fabulous bed and all very clean. Can't fault the staff either. I didn't really use the bar so can't comment on that but I really enjoyed my stay and would come back here",5,2022,02,04
128,Wedding Anniversary less for more.,"We have checked into the hotel. On booking I looked at both booking.com and hotels website. Opted to book a upgraded suite as it’s our 10 years anniversary, spend the night in london. 

Needless to say I was very disappointed that the going rate for the same room is 25% cheaper on both sites on the day than booking in advance. The response by reception was dismissive. 
Even after I pointed out 25% less and would include breakfast according to the website. 

Yea hotel is nice , but that’s what you expect from a 5*. I must admit I expected to pay a competitive price. Lesson learnt. Won’t be staying at the  this cabin again.",3,2022,02,02
128,Booking cancelled at the doorstep,We booked this hotel through booking.com and emailed them before the date of stay but had no response.  We turned up at the hotel at date of stay and was not allowed to enter the hotel.  The security people told us that our booking had been changed and gave us a name of a sister hotel some 17 minutes walk away.  We asked to speak to the reception but they would not see us.  We walked and tried to find the sister hotel but could not find it.  In the end we walked into a Travel Lodge.,1,2021,12,28
128,Stay away from this hotel,"Outside ground unkept/untidy with sigarette stumps everywhere. Smokers and non smokers in the same outside area. Food not edible. Mangement very unhelpful to the point of being rude. Very disorganised with check in and check out.
Definitely would not recommend this hotel.
Alot of stairs and not suitable for people with limited mobility",1,2021,12,18
128,Quarantine,"Arrived to a cold room, asked for portable electric heater twice as they didn't know how to work therostat, they finally brought up a kettle instead! Ask them repeatedly to not give me breakfast but four days running I still got breakfast, eventually I wrote a massive note on door and finally they got the message. Windows grim and cracked sink DEFINITELY NOT a 5 star. No communication between staff and their organisational skills zero. Do not stay here!!",2,2021,12,16
128,Our disappointing stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery Hotel,"The Hotel states that it is a 5 star Hotel but currently does not offer a 5 star service. Having driven over 200 miles to reach the Hotel I we were looking forward to something to eat and drink in the room only to be informed there was ‘No Room Service’!!
The Restuarant is not open so breakfast is served in the dining area at the rear of the attached Pub. We were told that we could not order the English inclusive breakfast because we had not pre booked it?
We left the Hotel late morning to explore Shoreditch and returned to our room late afternoon to find the room had not been cleaned despite leaving the notice that it was available to clean.
At checkout we informed the Receptionist of our dissatisfaction with our two nights stay and we were given the email address of the Manager. I sent 2 emails but I have not had the courtesy of a reply.",1,2021,12,13
128,A 3-star hotel with no control,"Having 5 employees in the lobby doesn´t make it a 5 star hotel. And the people working there is the primary problem: They have no idea what they are doing. On arrival we had to wait 3hours for a cleaned room. When we finally got one they gave us a room that someone else was living in, so we had to wait for another hour. If they say: ""I have to check that, I´ll come back to you, no problem"", then nothing will happen. They don´t come back to you. They don´t know what the breakfast cost, or the difference on English and Continental. They don´t bring your lugggage to the room as promised, they don´t clean the room, and they don´t bring new coffee replacements. The only employee having control was the doorman with a bowler-hat. He was 5 star. 
The lobby is small, no cosy places to relaxe. The wallpaper in the corridor is teared here and there. The bathroom had no warming, the heating cables not working. But the hotelroom was big, and the beds were comfortable.",3,2021,12,12
128,Certainly not five star !,"We have just stayed two nights at the Montcalm Brewery to meet up with family. 
Don’t let first impressions fool you. The initial meet and greet was good and the architecture of the hotel is lovely. 
That’s where it ends unfortunately. The rooms are dated and tired. Our room was a deluxe double.  It had gouges in the wall paper and the shower cubicle had a broken door. The furniture is showing it’s age the heating cooling didn’t  work. Service was poor as we had to call three times to get breakfast tea to the room.
Talking of breakfast,  there is no onsite food or restaurant. You have to walk to the nearby Jugged Hare pub for food. This is not what you expect from a 5 star hotel. There is also no bar. Guess what….. you have to walk to the Jugged Hare again for a drink. Don’t do it after 1030pm though. Like another reviewer we went for a drink after a show and they had just closed the bar. 
In a 5 star hotel I expect there to be an on-site restaurant and bar, which is also open for use. We were actually told by the staff to get an Uber to collect a drink from the pub and get it delivered to the room. Really !!!!  5 star…….. I think not.
We will never stay there again and certainly would not recommend. I have stayed in London previously and payed less for much better service and accommodation. Avoid.",2,2021,12,08
128,Don't go anywhere near it,"Used to be a good hotel now it is a 3-star hotel on a good day
 heating doesn't seem to work properly corridors and rooms smell of a sewer 
club Lounge is an absolute joke and five star breakfast I would give one star at best tea is in a flask
 plenty of staff but none of them seem to know what they're meant to be doing
 hours that facilities like breakfast, have all been altered but doesn't tell you anywhere so people were going down to breakfast to find it already been finished and shut
Socks over smoke detector in our room",1,2021,12,05
128,Not up to par.,"Considering the times we are in this Montcalm is shockingly lacking in cleanliness.
Our club room had noticeable grime - begging the question how is it actually being missed day in/day out? 
One would expect the rooms to have been deep cleaned and sanitised before our arrival or certainly at the start of the pandemic what with new regulations and measures etc but it was very evident it had not.

Whilst having the safe battery changed before going out mid morning housekeeping called at the same time so they went away but never returned again.
We had no turn down or HK service for my entire stay so annoyingly had to call for tea and coffee replenishment and fresh towels in the mornings. 
New guests were continuously pouring into the reception and there were constantly long lines for check-in so the hotel is clearly attracting a lot of business however it seemed to be at our detriment.

Apart from a slightly haughty check- in all staff we encountered were charming and engaging. We were regular visitors to the concierge desk as every time we wanted to go back to the room our key card did not work so our few days had us going up and back down the stairs countless times. Good exercise I suppose!

Compared to previous Montcalm stays this one was sorely lacking.",3,2021,12,05
128,Good 3 star - shocking 5 star.,"As the hotel claims to be a 5 star that is how I will judge it. Please look at the photos as they show that it is nowhere near a 5 star. At best a 3.

No resident bar - great after returning from the theatre !!!
No resident restaurant - yes they do send you to a pub down the road ????
If this is for residents why does the landlord call last orders at 10.30pm and throw everyone out at 10.45pm whether drinks are finished or not.

Nowhere local to have a drink and the only shop - Tesco Express closes before the pub.

Service is shocking and run by students. The receptionist had to wake one up at 11pm to show us to our room.

In our club room which we had paid a 5star cost for ....
Tatty old carpets.
Very small tv - in a 5star this size tv belongs in the bathroom.
2 chairs that dont match.
An empty mini bar.
Warm water left on a table.
Cups and saucers that don't match.
Full fat milk only - wake up even Weatherspoons offer you soya and semi skimmed milk.
The bathroom with a shelf falling off the wall, shower controls not fitted straight, damaged tiles replaced with different ones, poor grouting, dirty corners of the room.

Overall very disappointing and the management should be ashamed, but I doubt they will even reply to this if the service at this hotel is an example of their standards.

On a positive the concierge on Saturday was excellent and the corridors do look very smart. Oh and a great xmas tree.

I would be interested in the corporate mgt view of things.",2,2021,11,30
128,A 5 star health hazard...,"I stayed here for a work event on Wednesday 24th November 2021. Everything was amazing at first, gorgeous reception, lovely door steward and great staff. On first inspection the accessible room I was placed in was lovely (just to point out I’m not disabled but was placed near a colleague on the same floor). On closer inspection, the rooms are NOT up to standard for a 5-star hotel, the bathrooms certainly need a lot of work and that’s where my issue lies.
During the night I got up to go to the toilet and slipped on a very wet floor in the bathroom. It conspired that when running, the sink leaked considerably all over the floor and made the floor and carpet very wet. Now luckily I am able bodied, but if this had been a disabled person I dread to think what would have happened considering the help cord was on the other side of the room. 
The next morning when I went to reception to tell them about this I was met by a very rude receptionist who simply said – did you report this during the night. I did not, simply because I didn’t hurt myself enough to do so, and it was 4 am and I needed sleep. I didn’t want to mess round waiting for hotel staff at 4am. She then proceeded to tell me I had to go to my room and wait for a member of staff to come and see me – at this point I was made to feel like it was my fault the sink had leaked. 
I went to my room, waited for 45 minutes while packing but no one came. So, I went back downstairs as I needed to check out for my hotel, the same very rude reactionist simply replied – he’s been busy, he is standing there. So I waited a further 10 minutes until I had the rigmarole of retelling the story for the hotel accident logs. 
If it wasn’t for work paying for this night I would have refused to pay based on the room quality, and the tone of this receptionist. Not in any way a 5-star experience. But to be fair, the gentleman I spoke to after this was lovely and did all he could to help (he gets my 1 star), but a word of warning to disabled guests. Stay away. And if your after a 5 star hotel, look elsewhere.",1,2021,11,30
128,Binmen at 4.30,Woken up at 4.30 in the morning by rubbish people moving bins at the brewery. Went on for 90 minutes - rang reception twice but they couldn't do anything.  Complained when I checked out and they apologised profusely and said management would contact me.  They haven't.  Do not risk a break being wreaked by this kind of activity.,1,2021,11,30
128,Worst hotel we’ve stayed in,"We found the service here pretty poor. Staff were not knowledgeable enough and very dismissive. 

Our room was not clean enough. There were hairs and toothpaste in the bath. Our tea bags had been opened and used before we arrived in the room.

We had booked a double but found that we had two single beds. When we queried this, they said they could push the beds together for us. When we asked again if we had been given a double, we were told that this was what all hotels did for double rooms.

We had the worst night’s sleep. Our single duvets were stuffed into double duvet covers. It was unbelievably noisy all night and we were continuously woken up by banging, squeaking, heating coming on and off. 

Another couple we were with, who were also staying at the hotel, had to ask to move rooms because their room smelt so badly of blocked drains. The smell hit you as soon as you walked in the room. The maintenance team claimed there was not a problem. Their lights did not work and they had to take a lightbulb out to turn one of the lights off. 

They also found a half- eaten samosa had been left in their fridge by a precious guest. 

To be honest, we couldn’t wait to check out. Couldn’t recommend it less.",1,2021,11,29
128,Nice place,"Came here for the Pearson National Teaching Awards. The staff were amazing very friendly and helpful.  The room was beautiful and very tastefully decorated the food we had was lovely too. 

The building was nice too and situated close to its sister hotel Mont Calm Royal London where we stayed for the evening after the awards.",5,2021,11,28
128,Disappointing.,"The member of staff on reception had some issues understanding us. Check in took a long time as our friends had booked us in. Also, couldn’t understand the room number. No explanation of the facilities. Concierge was ok and have a tip. The room 029 was large but dated. It wasn’t very clean. Wallpaper was damaged, not vacuumed thoroughly and dirt on window sills, skirtings. It needed a thorough clean. Not enough shower gel and no robes in the room. Got back to the hotel at 11pm and fancied a night cap. There was no bar. No drinks in the room. Concierge and room service calls not answered. I can’t see how this hotel could be classed as 5 star. At £188 for one night it’s not good value. The location isn’t well suited to a weekend as everything is closed at the weekend. I’d avoid this for a weekend break and pay more to stay central.",2,2021,11,28
128,Disappointing stay,"This hotel is old and tired. Check in was slow over 10 mins with no queue ahead. An alarm
Was going off while checking in. The couple in front of us were sent to another Montcalm as they had over booked. The double deluxe room was tiny and cramp. 3* hotel and I would have been happy. I won’t be staying here shin.",2,2021,11,27
128,Exceptional chic understated perfection,"This is second time staying at the brewery. It is a glorious modern hotel in probably the best location directly next to the barbican. The rooms are insanely quiet, divine beds and a wonderful welcome. The staff are elegant polite and basically make you feel liké royalty . If you get lucky your check and general concierge will be a gentleman called Hassan Ahmed who is a class act. Seamless attention and five star service. Thank you Hassan and his team. I will make this my go to place to stay in london. Sublime. This really is a special place to stay. Hassan will also direct you to the most incredible pub which is part of the hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2021,11,27
128,Whats happened?,"Stayed here before several times . Booked in june only to be moved to another montcalm hotel the night before as the brewery was either being renovated or had covid whichever of the 2 reasons we were given you wanted too believe. Booked a deluxe double room for the 26th November. Arrived and was given the smallest room in the entire hotel. Complained and was upgraded to the smallest club room in the hotel . Sitting in room now. Very dirty,dirt and something that might be finger nails in the bedside table. Horrible oatch of dirt or something on the wall. This place is supposed to be 5 star. It probably was 7 or 8 years ago when we first used it. But now its nowhere near 5 star standard. Feel very let down and certainly will notbe staying here again.",1,2021,11,26
128,Wish I could not even rate 1 on review!,"Had the worst hotel experience ever last Sunday. Had to move rooms due to our original room having maintenance issues and not being clean. 
Second room, still not clean but had a dinner reservation to get to so had to make do. So underwhelmed by the hotel rooms (this was a birthday present from my partner to myself as we would never usually go 5 star), not clean and certainly did not have the 'wow' factor I would expect for the standard of the hotel they advertise!  
Not to mention a member of staff trying to check other guests into out hotel room near midnight, while we were asleep in our bed! Which I slept extremely poorly after and did not feel safe. Actually opened our door and took our key card, meaning that we then had to go down to reception to get a new one to be able to use the lights in the morning to get ready! 
We spoke to the manager the next morning, who requested we send an email to voice our complaints, but that was sent Wednesday afternoon and yet to receive any reply or acknowledgment. 
Looking through previous guests reviews, seems a lot of people are of the same opinion of my partner and I. Really not a luxury hotel, i have stayed in better hostels!",1,2021,11,26
128,Awful,"Not clean, old out dated fixtures and fittings, horrible small room with a window looking out onto a wall, tv didn’t work, no hairdryer in room and had to ask 3 times for one to be brought to room, the hotel pre authorised my card the day before our stay and also charged upon arrival so 4 days later I still have twice as much money being held by the hotel than the cost of the room, weird breakfast location in a pub around the corner. Awful stay. It was supposed to be a treat for my partner and I had to apologise to him for taking him to this hotel.",1,2021,11,23
128,Pleased to be back,"We arrived back at this favourite for the first time in a couple of years with some hesitation given recent reviews. And enjoyed a splendid stay. The hotel is clearly recovering like most of us from the effects of the pandemic (new staff, some small things not working) but it’s excellent fundamentals are all in place - including the splendid doorman. Excellent.",4,2021,11,22
128,Worst stay of our lives,"We love to stay with Montcalm so when booking one of their London hotels I never worry. Sadly our stay this weekend has been appalling and we were away for my partners birthday celebrations too. Not only am I on my way home from a disappointing stay I’ve just checked my bank to notice they have also charged me twice for our dreadful stay.  We arrived around 4 pm to the hotel , check in was busy and we were told where our room was however it was like a maze and I had to stop to ask and that member of staff didn’t immediately know where it was either . We finally arrive at our room and it looks nice enough until we start to want to get ready and use the functions of the room such as extractor in the bathroom doesn’t work and room is very hot so put the air con but alas that doesn’t work either ! We are forced to open the window and realise we have a very noisy generator outside our room . To make things doubly worse we go to put some items in the fridge and we find an almost finished bottle of wine that was absolutely not ours !!! This is disgusting given Covid regulations and the fact the room cost me £229 this is completely not ok and I will not be staying here again . I’m thoroughly disgusted with this hotel after years of using Montcalm and spending good money with them , I shall not be returning !!!  I have attached a picture of the wine left in our apparently cleaned and sanitised  room ! This was an upgraded room too called a Club room this hotel is run down , over priced and not worth the rating or money I paid",1,2021,11,21
128,Not 5* more like 3 at best!!,"After arriving at 11:30 to drop our bags off, we got told our rooms would be ready when we returned, which was fine; however; 6hrs later we arrived back to be told our rooms weren’t ready!!

After numerous discussions our rooms became available 30 minutes later! Now considering the cost and the descriptions, the room was definitely not 5*, poor lighting, dirty bathroom, missing grout, extremely uncomfortable bed, no on-site restaurant or room service and very poor and tired decor!

Staff not friendly or helpful so we certainly won’t be staying again - also the location is not a good base for exploring the sights of London and especially the WestEnd - in summary, choose a hotel that is a true 5* - The Brewery certainly isn’t and shouldn’t market itself as one!!",2,2021,11,21
128,"Dirty, grubby, staff don't care, not a 5 star hotel.","We spent the weekend in London and booked this hotel based on the website. Elegant, 5 star, etc etc. 

Essentially our room was dirty, not cleaned properly, previous guest charger on floor, wall paper torn , mould in the bathroom , mould and dirt on the windows. The curtains on the window reminded me of my student days dirty and worn. I went to reception and explained next morning,  asked for the manager, waited 15 minutes and only after prompting the receptionist again she discussed the issue. I suggested that the manager should visit the room and if he/she felt it represented a 5 star experience, then I would be happy with that. She told me she would arrange it during the day and to drop on later. I called later, the receptionist has forgotten the complaint and no one had checked the room . I suggested again to meet the manager and waited another 15 min. A gent arrived and I suggested to him also to inspect the room, however he invited us to the club lounge, a large cold room where we got served warm prosecco. It was clear he had no interest. 

Not good, bad experience, don't stay there, look at the photos",1,2021,11,21
128,Overpriced,"Stayed as going to an event next door.  Check in was slow, but I guess they had a lot of people checking in for the event.  The overpriced (£272 for room only) twin room was a double which was slowly put right. No kettle in the room but one was supplied.  The room itself was a good size but generally a bit tatty and worn. There were some pieces of sharp metal just left on the window sill  so not sure how well they had cleaned the room. The staff however were polite but this is not enough,  I expected more for the price tag.",1,2021,11,18
128,A Once Characterful Place in Dismal Decline,"Our trip started with a 'lost' booking, so check-in took the best part of an hour, and they couldn't even offer a coffee while I waited.  The Clun twin room was small, the beds put togetherlike one double bed. The furniture was stained and marked, paint was peeling off the windows, everything looked old and tatty.  The bathroom had no bathmat, so we had to use towels when the floor got wet.  The toilet roll holder swung miserably off the wall.  We couldn't empty the bath as the control mechanism fell out of the wall as soon as it was touched.  There was no kettle, and it took 2 phone calls and over an hour to get one.
The hotel website includes recommendations to use The Jugged Hare for breakfast as the hotel doesn't have a dining room in use at present.  The breakfast was dreadful.  A pot of tea took over 30 mins to arrive and was tepid.  The food was also not hot and not good.
A manager did change our room and give us a bottle of Prosecco, but this was no compensation for staying in such a dismal, downmarket place.  I have never felt so misled or ripped-off at any hotel.",1,2021,11,18
128,Avoid like the plague,"Please do yourselves a favour and avoid this ghastly hotel! 

Came for a “relaxed night away” with my partner and left more stressed than we arrived! We arrived at the hotel at 2pm for check in, as we agreed with the hotel and we had to wait until 4 hours later to given our keys and let into our “suite”. 

Staff at check in were rude and just lied to customers, it was actually like a comedy sketch show. Several reasons were given to customers as to why the line was so incredibly long and why no rooms were ready, even the manager couldn’t explain the reason! 

Moving on to the “suite”... Don’t bother. It was a large room that was outdated, had cracks in the floor and below standard levels of cleaning. No robes, slippers or mini bar and don’t even think about ordering room service - there isn’t any. 

No club lounge as advertised and no compensation instead of, just breakfast that we had paid for included in the room rate. We called reception in the morning to ask for the breakfast times and were told last breakfast was at 10:30, we arrived at 9:55 to be told it has already closed! What a joke! 

Stay away, save your money. It’s shocking that this hotel can call itself 5*. You’d be better off staying in a hostel.",1,2021,11,16
128,Don’t stay here not a 5 star more like a bottom end 3 star,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my 50th birthday. What a let down, we arrived and the queue for check in was flowing out the front door. I took a seat while my husband queued, I could over hear raised voices by the concierge a couple had already been waiting a few hours for the room to be ready & we’re not happy to be told it might be another few hours. It was just before 3pm when we arrived most people in the queue had been sent away and told to come back a few hours later, I totally understand most hotels don’t allow check in until 2pm but we arrived at 3pm the reception was carnage with lots of people complaining about rooms not being ready or the rooms being awful. When we finally got to the reception desk the member of staff proceeded to tell us the system had gone down so our room wouldn’t be ready for a few hours. This is a ridiculous lie because if the system went down that wouldn’t stop the rooms being cleaned and ready as house keeping would just manually keep a list of what rooms were ready to occupy. We told the member of staff this wasn’t acceptable as my husband had booked this for my 50th birthday and he had a surprise that we had to attend and we needed to get ready.  He said let me speak to my manager he never left the reception and said your in luck we have a room you just need to pay the full amount. My husband did as we needed to get ready as my husband had arranged for all my friends to surprise me at a restaurant around the corner from the hotel so we couldn’t be late.  One of the staff members then offered to take us to our room well I honestly couldn’t believe how run down this hotel was, the carpet was dirty and coming away everywhere, walk paper ripped, food and dirt left in the lift. Then the room well so dated and dirty, food left on the carpet, toothpaste up the bathroom walls, blinds that linked the glass wall to the bathroom didn’t work open so you could be seen going to the bathroom. Been with my husband 17 years and I have no desire for him to see going to the toilet. Curtains had stains on them and furniture all marked and bashed up. My husband had upgraded to a club room don’t bother it’s as bad as the deluxe rooms. All you could hear was complaints from other guests.  I could go on but just be aware although I’m very sympathetic to the current climate and how difficult hotels have had it in the last 28 months and also aware of staffing issues this was not acceptable. I felt gutted for my husband who had planned this weekend and felt let down by this awful hotel.  Had we had more time we would of asked to speak to the manager but we had to get to my surprise dinner but we will be taking this up with Montcalm head office. Anyway save your money and stay at a clean travel lodge you would get more for your money.",1,2021,11,16
128,AWFUL SERVICE - Avoid,"This hotel advertises itself as 5 star - nothing we received was as promised. Firstly the service was appalling - check in was advertised at 2pm which I confirmed with them on the phone prior to my stay along with asking for the room to be decorated for a birthday. I arrived at 2pm, then waiting in a 45 minute queue to be told to come back at 4:30pm. When I returned I was greeted with another queue of over 30 minutes to be told my room was still not ready. Waiting in a queue of disgruntled guests, no one was being told what the issue was. After complaining to management a room was finally given at 6pm - 4 whole hours after advertised check in. All staff including management were extremely dismissive and seem as though they couldn’t care less. 

The room we paid for was advertised as a ‘suite’, however what we were given was just a large room with a sofa branded as a suite. There was no decoration for a birthday as had been requested over the phone before our stay. Disappointingly the standard of the room wasn’t great - cracks in the tiling and finger marks on the mirrors and taps. The room was advertised as inclusive of club lounge access providing canapés and drinks however this was unavailable. Nothing was done to compensate. No in room service/mini bar was available, which for a 5 star hotel is unacceptable. As standard the room should have come with bath robes and slippers, which were not in the room upon arrival. We requested these - then about 30 min later we were told they had none left.

The next morning we rang reception to ask about breakfast, we were told it was served up until 10:30am. This was provided at a pub around the corner. Once we arrived at the pub at 10am, we were told the kitchen had closed and they had no idea as to why the hotel told us 10:30. We were not the only guests with the same issues. We will never be staying at a Montcalm ever again.",1,2021,11,14
128,Avoid like the plague,"If I could give the hotel zero, I would. Booked to go to The Packaging Awards as it was the most convenient luxury hotel. Booked numerous rooms for our employees and guests. It all went downhill from there:

1. First guest arrived the day before, but they couldn't find the booking. They then charged him for 2 nights despite the fact we had already paid. They had to refund our guests card.

2. Second guest arrived on the day of the event and it took over 35 minutes to book them in.

3. Then system went down. They couldn't book anyone in and the queue went right out of the door. This was at 2:30pm

4. System  back up at 3:30pm. However they did not know which rooms were clean, so while you could check in, you could not be allocated rooms. After arriving at 3:30pm we managed to get 2 rooms for the ladies to get ready in. Out of 20 rooms booked, we only had 4 rooms by the time the event started.

5. After the awards, before the After event (around 11:30pm) guests went back to get thier room. Waited over 40 minutes!!! This is over 7 hours since booking in!!

6. One guest was taken to her room, walked I and there was a couple in bed. She came down and complained and was given another room. She walked in and once again it was occupied. Finally given an unoccupied room very late.

7) I came back to my hotel room at 1am. The door was wide open, with all my belongings out for people to steal. I assume someone has been given the wring card and after realising that the room was occupied left it open. When I went to reception to complain they didn't believe me, despite the fact that I had gone to my room with a female colleague to make sure that there wasn't anyone skulking around.  Really poor.

8) rooms are poorly maintained. Hot water didn't work. Marks up the wall. Items not working.

This has to be the worst experience ever. Ruined the night for everyone.",1,2021,11,14
128,Not the best,"Booked a club room for ourselves and our daughter and son in law. 
Very disappointed to be told that the club room package was not available due to covid. They refused to budge or offer any form of apology / refund even though the website said it was available and we paid accordingly. 
Next morning went to have the club room breakfast to be told the club room breakfast wasn’t available and there were no club rooms. My daughter said we had paid for club room and we had club room on our door and she was told that didn’t mean anything. My husband complained again and eventually we were taken to a room which was set up for breakfast. We were the only four people in there and it wasn’t great , but was clearly available. The toast came out white and I had to ask twice for coffee. This is not 5 star service. 
So false advertising, no effort made to rectify that situation. Covid should not be offered as an excuse for poor service. They did actually state the club room service was available from next week but that didn’t help us. This is not worthy of 5 stars.",2,2021,11,07
128,Kind attentive staff who go above to make your stay special,Had the pleasure of staying at the brewery with my wife for a end of term weekend staycation in London. The staff were friendly front the team at reception to concierge. Special mention to the Manager Sakar for a room upgrade and bottle of bubbly to make our stay even more special. Loved the comfortable bed and rainfall showers. Would stay again with no hesitation.,5,2021,11,06
128,Lovely hotel,"What a lovely hotel and staff especially the manager Sagar who met all I needs and more...we hope in the near future this hotel will restart room service, look forward to staying here again really soon",4,2021,11,03
128,"Incredible service, beautiful setting","I'm blown away by this hotel. The customer service from the moment I turned into the courtyard was second to none. Everyone went out of their way to do whatever they could to make my stay special. 

When I arrived in my room I called reception to see if there was a portable mirror I could use, and instead I was given a bigger room, complete with a lovely big mirror!

Sakar, who I believe was the manager on duty, really went above and beyond. Kind, courteous service from every member of staff and really beautiful rooms.",5,2021,11,03
128,Avoid this hotel,"No residents bar or restaurant (hotel says a v v busy local pub a block down the road is part of hotel) after 3 days trying to get thru to their customer service (after 15 mins on hold someone would answer and hang up really annoying) confirm a change of booking from 3 weeks previous ( no email received)

 I was offered free breakfast for both mornings but the food was almost cold on first morning so we didn’t bother with the next morning. Would have been v annoyed if we had paid the 25 pounds per person. 

It’s a self service brekkie with tall flasks for hot water and instant coffee and no table service which for a five Star I find incredible. 3 staff just standing around could be put to better use. 

Beds are v small. V large single would be a good description. We got upgraded 🤔 to the wheelchair friendly room. Staff while friendly are all just hanging around lobby. 

No door tags for a request to clean room so we had to ask for clean towels at 10pm after a days walking London. 

Oh no mini bar nor video on demand. Power had gone when we arrived so couldn’t get into room to freshen up after flights. 

My advice. Don’t bother with this badly managed place. Should be a 2/3 star.",1,2021,11,01
128,Nowhere near 5 stars,"Arrived on Sunday night. Prompt check-in. 

Room 211 has a damaged carpet, stained chair, damaged shower tap and peeling off shower hand rail.

Bedding was fresh but there were bits of small hair under the cover. 

Monday - room didn’t get cleaned. 

Tuesday - cleaner came, didn’t change towels, didn’t empty the bins, left door unlocked. You need to apply some pressure to shut the door properly. Luckily nobody walked in otherwise they could have stolen stuff. 

Breakfast. I went downstairs expecting to have a nice breakfast given it costs over £25. Breakfast selection was soooo small that I just walked out and went to Fast Break caffe not far away. Your value proposition regarding breakfast is ridiculous. 

I have checked out a day earlier, lost some money but won’t ever be returning here. 3 stars at a push.",2,2021,10,26
128,Montcalm,"Sakar, the manager deals with every problem with tranquility. Aside from that the bathrooms are clean, the showers are really good. Also the bed is very comfortable and there is plenty of space in the room, which has water for free, a lot of cable and a comfortable desk.",5,2021,10,25
128,Made our anniversary ,"Lovely hotel, good location, very quiet, very clean with polite, attentive staff. Stayed for two nights for our anniversary. We had a couple of issues in the room, the manager Sarkar listened to us and accepted it in good grace, and upgraded our room, which was a lovely gesture, making our anniversary even more special. Would certainly stay there again. Thanks to everyone who made our stay so memorable.",5,2021,10,24
128,Amazing!!!,"Amazing hotel, great location, tidy and the customer service is out of this world Sakar on the reception was amazing he really went out his way to help us! Would 100% stay again deserves it 5 star rating!",5,2021,10,24
128,Great staff... poor Wifi and breakfast,"I stayed at the Montcalm for an awards night at the Brewery. The staff at the check in desk and the door man were really helpful and lovely.

The room was comfortable, the shower was warm and powerful, and they had thought of some of the little things like loads of towels. Plug point next to the bed.

However, for a 5* hotel there were some glaring omissions:
1. The wifi to my room was either barely there or not working. Not enough bandwidth to download emails
2. The hot items at breakfast were cold and there was no fruit or herbal tea option. You could only have earl grey, green tea or breakfast tea. The orange juice was the cheap made from concentrate type.
3. The shower door strip was half detached
4. The air conditioning was noisy and the street noise was clearly heard from my room",3,2021,10,22
128,Montcalm The Brewery,"Really disappointed with the standard of Montcalm the Brewery, we booked to stay here 2 nights for a trip to London (Anniversary) on recommendation from someone.
The hotel staff are amazing and this review is absolutely nothing to do with them, I want to make that clear, they can't do enough for you and try their hardest to make your experience 5 star, just as the hotel is graded.

The problem is that the hotel is tired and in need of refurbishment, away from the reception area you see this straight away. 
Our room was ok, again I was expecting more for the money I had paid, the shower had been cleaned with something that had blocked the head, so when we first put it on the water was coming out of the ceiling we had to turn it off and use a towel to unblock the shower head nozzles.
The beds are very comfortable, TV is freeview and works well.

I'm not saying dont go to here, just wanting you to know, if you are expecting 5 star throughout then this will jot be the place for you",3,2021,10,19
128,Cancelled on us rude 35 hours in advance,"I had this hotel booked for my wife and her friend to have a night away in London. We did it through Booking.com, where only people who actually stay get to write a review and sadly we did n’t check Tripadvisor before booking. I wish we had. So of course they cancelled on us at 9:30 pm on Thursday before a Sat night stay. Something about it being needed for quarantining, but that’s no excuse. The guy who rang me up was rude, and did n’t appreciate our frustration. They offered us a room at the Hackney one, which was n’t ideal because it was further away from where the girls wanted to be, but I said we’d take it if he sent us an email confirmation. He said he’d try to do it twice, but it never came through. What did come through though was a message saying my card had been declined, which he admitted it had n’t. So that’s just  untruthful and I thought this was a real cheek. In the end I said if he could n’t send us written confirmation we’d need to cancel, he just said fine and put the phone down. During the course of our discussion he tried to threaten me with “this call is being recorded”, which was hilarious given that I’d not been rude to him in spite of the situation we had been put it. Hopefully his managers will use the recording for his re-training. Customer service at it’s worse. We’ll never entertain staying in one of these again. I booked my wife in an alternative, it was more expensive, but now’s she’s on her way I feel happy knowing that’s she’s going somewhere that actually gives a damn.",1,2021,10,09
128,DONT BOOK - THEY WILL CANCEL YOUR BOOKING LAST MINUTE!!!!,"Booked this hotel 2 months ago for a stay on 25th September 2021. Three days before we were due to travel they cancel our booking and advise they cannot accommodate us at another one of there other hotels in London as they are all full. BUT what they didn't tell us was that this hotel has been a quarantine hotel for months so they knew this when we booked!!!! But yet they waited until 3 days before we were due to come to tell us and ruined our whole trip to London. Appalling for a 5* hotel, disgraceful service, so so so disappointed, id wanted to stay in one of there hotels for such a long time.",1,2021,09,28

We were pleasantly surprised with our experience. The food was above average (thank goodness, based on other reviews) , and we were well looked after.

128,Awful customer service avoid like the plague (ironically),"We have had this hotel booked for a very special occasion for months and yesterday when we are due to arrive on the 31st September they have decided to inform us that it is being used as a quarantine hotel. They offer us a sub standard accommodation in another venue at no cost reduction and when we ask to be moved to an accommodation with the same category of room that they did have availability at they flat out refused. The reservations director Phyo is as useful as a chocolate fire guard. Congratulations Montcalm on ruining a cancer patients birthday trip! We have long been loyal customers to this brand hence booking it for such an important occasion, I wouldn't touch them with a barage pole going forward and would strongly advise my clients of the same! It's far too late for us to book a similar grade room at such short notice.",1,2021,08,24

I got a club room which is the disabled one although I'm not a disabled person. The room had space to breathe, a high ceiling, individual A/C, walk in shower. 

The positives

- Check-in was very smooth and I got into the room fairly quickly
- The security staff was all very respectful and polite
- The food was delivered at my doors and was always very hot 
- I had regular check up calls from the hotel reception to make I was OK and if I needed anything - a special mention to Gina who was very friendly and helpful
- Any issues raised was dealt with quite promptly
- I got supplied with lots of water, tea & coffee, biscuits and juices
- Since the hotel is well centralised in London, it was very easy to order in from a lot of nearby places so very convenient and the security staff will bring to your doors very promptly

The negatives 

- The AC wasn't working all the time so in those moments the room felt very warm. You could open the windows but not by much. I talked to one of the maintenance staff and he said he'll try to find a fan but never came back to me on that. 
- The sink in the bathroom was quite small so not so easy to brush your teeth or wash your face and it was leaking. Since no staff would enter the room to fix, I had to use a towel to absorb the leak meanwhile
- One of the curtains started to fall out of the hooks one by one to a point there was only one left and luckily it was still hanging by the time I checked out
- The mini fridge didn't work at all but I didn't bother reporting it to the hotel

This is my own experience of staying in quarantine and how I was treated as a guest. I don't consider myself as a particularly difficult guest so I tolerated the negatives. Other people might not have at all.",4,2021,08,08
128,Excellent  Service from Hotel,"I am currently quarintine in this hotel and i am thankful that i am staying here.  My friend was not feeling well.  I called reception and informed that manager Mr Valent and Mr Sakar and Mr Alex went out their way to ensure we were comfodtable.
We are feeling like a home and service is excellent.
Thank you Sir",5,2021,08,07
128,Very Supportive Manager Mr Sakar during our quarantine stay,"The staff were incredibly helpful and supportive especially Mr Sakar from the management!!! And Mr Deepen and Mr Alex who always made sure to drop-off my breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and all necessities in the room that we requested. 

They all are both incredible staff and management who made the quarantine stay so much better and stress free . 
A complete asset to this establishment. 

Mr Sakar helped us with every questions we had during our stay with amazing caring attitude and excellent professionalism. We are very thankful for that , very grateful. 

Every hotel in the planet should have a staff like Sakar , Alex and Deepen . One of my favourite experience in a hotel so for regardless  of quarantine stay .",5,2021,08,04
128,Great hospitality ,"Great hotel location. Very neat and clean rooms with all modern amenities. Spent my 10 days quarntine period there. Foods needs to be improve. Zarina from front office and Peter from kitchen manager, both are very helpful and very supportive.

I highly recommend excellent service from management Mr Valent and Mr Sakar who went out of their way to assist us . 

I would also like to thank Alex for bringing us sugar , coffee and water regularly.",5,2021,07,31
128,Thank you for all the help at organising this quarantine for my parents . Eternally grateful and thankful to Giles duty!,"This is a review mainly to say ,Giles has been a tremendous help to my parents who are in 10 day quarantine there .Thank you so much 
We are so so grateful for all his help and kindness. 
And the food has been great, the room was clean, for quarantine really a good  experience .",5,2021,07,26
128,Quarantine stay at the Montcalm,"I stayed here during quarantine and must stay its enjoyable. All staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable and nice . I never enjoyed the food it’s disgraceful food. I am feeding myself from deliveroo and Uber eats . 
Alex , genina helped me so much with things and manager Mr Sakar and Mr Giles and Mr Valent helped so much that I cannot be asked . 
Thank you so much guys .",5,2021,07,26
128,Quarantine on arrival from red list,"I was over all happy when I was allocated this hotel as my quarantine hotel I read good reports online. The bed was very comfortable, shower was big enough for a small man like me and had a good water power . I had a phone call ever day from the Manager Mr Sakar who sounded caring , polite and was checking if we needed anything, looked after me well . It did seem as they really care for their guest comfort during our enforced quarantine stay . They provided more or less everyday needs . I know it's difficult to make people happy but Sakar and his team pulled it off pretty well . 
I don't want to comment on food , you can read feedback from others. I was ordered all my meals from outside. I am particular with food taste . I do love Indian and British food but !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   
I was allowed 15 to 20 minutes walk at a time and I managed to go out two times a day . The exercise area is part of parking back of the hotel ... I guess , no view just brick walls . Every time I wanted to go out I had to call reception and security would fetch me from my room . 
During this unusual circumstances, hotel staff and manager looked after me well . 
Absolutely amazing and I couldn't thank enough to Mr Sakar who I would like to thank him personally , l will be back with my wife once this pandemic is over to express my gratitude, his hospitality is next to none , truly English gentleman . I would like to thank Alex who used to deliver my request, Emanuel who I used to speak during nights , one tall gentleman from Romania who was at night , sorry I forgot to take a note of your name . thank you all and recommend them highly enough. Thank you for lovely quarantine stay .",5,2021,07,20
128,Quarantine stay,"Quarantine stay with my family in this hotel  for long ten nights. 
Staff are doing the best , friendly and helpful so credit goes to them . But the food has been absolutely appalling. 
Just chicken 4 days in a row , worst food ever , icleand frozen meal  . Curry and rice was disgusting 🤮. Only bananas, orange and apple and veg options is appalling too , burnt and over cooked pasta. Tried to order coke or any fizzy drinks, not available., Breakfast was served in one plastic box ! Grossly unfair for an enormous cost and other hotels are providing amazing food . 
Room was descent, had a massive window, can easily go for a walk twice daily. Staff were very polite and helpful. Spoke to restaurants staff one afternoon, they don’t understand a word of English. lunch was disgraceful , Cold and frozen with no life . We bought from outside.  
Complaint to the manager on duty. 
Sakar was very polite , he hear me out and satisfied my request, tried his best . He made sure we had plenty of other things which kept us going till we were out .
Emanuel and Dragos at night are very polite and helpful  Well done guys but do something about food crisis.",5,2021,07,18
128,"Summarising our visit overall, good stay.","I stayed at this hotel for 10 days with my wife during quarantine. The room was very nice and the facilities very good. The food was disgusting and we had to start by buying our own food online. We called the reception during the day but no one answered the call or when they answered they were not helpful. When we asked for something they said they were going to send it and they never did. My wife decided to call only during the night as the night team was always very helpful to us. Thank you Dragos for always being so helpful. We sometimes spoke with the night manager Julian and he would apologize to us for the situation and always offer fruit and biscuits for us to eat.
In the check out the receptionist Emanuel asked us about the stay,very understanding and considerate to us and apologised for the situation and apologised on behalf of the hotel.
Overall good and probably we thinking of coming and staying when everything will be over.",5,2021,07,16
128,Spend ten nights 🌙,Food wasn't good at all. Security people don't know English mostly from India always talking on phone they didn't even care what's going on around some time reception don't even pick the phone only room were good,4,2021,07,15
128,Terrible food but helpful  staff,"Me and my wife were one of many people who are forced to quarantine. 
We both were happy when we were  put to central London ,  but  the food which was part of the package was absolutely shocking and big let down.
Cold poor quality and badly cooked which meant food was greasy , tasteless and soggy  and terrible presentation, it was like everything shoved into one container ??? I don’t even understand what food they are serving half of the time ???Seriously…Restaurant staff were very rude when we asked for substitute? Or tea time snacks or quick bite to eat . 
We both requested for INDIAN NON VEG dinner  but we both received VEG . 
My wife spoke with kitchen during late afternoon to ensure they get it right but NO ?
We both complaint our concerns to reception and request manager to calls us . Mr Sakar who’s was the manager  returned our calls , understood our frustrations, send correct order immediately and he sent water , milk , fruits, crisps  and tea bags to ensure we had something to eat for later  . we did enjoyed  our food but only that night.",5,2021,07,15
128,Quarantine,"I  quarantined in this hotel with my family last month, the staff were fantastic and go out of their way to help you to manage your quarantine while you locked in your room. The only complaint I had wifi very slow, food was not up to standard. The courtyard was good facilities to stretch legs. All staff were excellent accommodating my request, having a little one, myself and my wife in one room was not easy task, but staff kept all of us happy and satisfying as much as possible. It was lovely speak to the management Sakar every alternative days for guest satisfaction. 
Location was surprisingly quiet, 5 mins walk from moorgate station. Very centrally located. 
Thanks to Sakaf, Alex, Dragos and Geina, me and my family deepest gratitude.",5,2021,07,15
128,"Excellent Quarantine hotel in London, Staff are excellent","I was overwhelmed staying at this hotel during my quarantine stay . Staff were very helpful and were very friendly and accommodating. They called me each day to ensure I was doing well , if I needed anything? The manager Sarkar was extremely helpful with all my requests. He ensured I was ok each day and I was doing well . Quarantine for 10 nights is surely not an easy task . It’s very frustrating that everything is limited. But Staff and manager like Mr Sakar makes a big difference and it takes to new different level . I felt that I had someone who was caring about my well-being , I felt safe and I promised to be back to this hotel for leisure in future. 
Thank you Montcalm and big fat thanks to the manager Sakar . I will be back with my family soon .",5,2021,07,10
128,Fabulous stay for our 10 day managed hotel quarantine,"On our return from India we stayed at the Montcalm with our 2 month old infant for the 10 day managed hotel quarantine. I have been amazed to no extent by the hospitality of the hotel staff. They have gone above and beyond to make our stay absolutely delightful and comfortable, especially with an infant and not being allowed to step out of the room. We were given their suite (upon request) to ensure that we had sufficient space with the baby. On the second day when the air conditioning was not working, they immediate moved us to another suite. The managers Nitish and Valent ensured that we were comfortable and all our needs were taken care of. Can't recommend enough the hospitality and staff warmth that we received during our 10 days. Absolutely a must stay if you're looking for good rooms, prime location and exceptionally helpful staff!!",5,2021,07,10
128,COVID Hotel,"Tried to check in and stop in the door by bouncers. We had a reservation and confirmation. Rude hotel manager stepped out saying that the hotel was closed as was being used for COVID isolation. Smirked and grinned and said I can’t find your reservation 

After 15 minutes of waiting and sweating, we were then told they did have our reservation but at their sister property, another 15 minutes walk with heavy luggage…no help offered.

Wouldn’t have been that bad but had called in the morning to check everything was okay and they confirmed it was!",1,2021,07,09
128,Very comfortable staying experience like home.,"Stay 10 days qurantine with 2 adults and 2 kids. Got spacious ""Wow Suite"". Inclussive 3 time meals for 3 people, 2 COVID tests on day 2nd and day 8th excellent service, celebrate 5 years old little one birthday with baloons. This means alot in this pandemic crucial time. Highly recommend specially families with kids.",5,2021,07,09
128,A five star hotel with no breakfast tea to serve with breakfast,"Coming out of lockdown we were keen to support our hospitality and tourist industry and also properly celebrate our thirtieth wedding anniversary which was at the end of April.

Having read this hotel’s excellent reviews on TripAdvisorI made a booking on the 29 April 2021 for the night of the 22 May 2021 and, because it was a special occasion, and we were so excited to be staying in a hotel again, I paid the extra for a Montcalm Club Room based on the following description ‘The Montcalm Club rooms .. offer guests complimentary access to the Club Lounge where they can enjoy snacks and beverages in a relaxing and private ambience.  They feature premium beds…  Exclusive amenities are a nespresso machine and minibar providing complimentary soft beverages and beer..’

We arrived at the hotel at 4pm on the Saturday.

We then discovered that the lounge was not open.

We then got to the room and discovered the ‘nespresso machine and minibar providing complimentary soft beverages and beer’ were missing. There was not even a kettle.

Calling reception I discovered that not only were these items not provided in the room / lounge (which I could understand) but that, although I had paid for them, they were not provided at all and no alternate room service option or discount in a hotel restaurant was provided. The gentleman I spoke to did offer to take 15%, circa £20 of the price I had paid.  However, if I had known that there was no lounge / snacks / minibar/ beverages I would have possibly booked elsewhere and if I had chosen this hotel I would have booked the ‘Deluxe Double’ which was £50 cheaper than the price I paid.
  
As pre-payment had been taken on arrival we decided to stay. 

We came down for breakfast at about 9.30am.  Not immediately able to find the room the receptionist took us across the courtyard to the door opposite. Against the door and pooling on the ground was a puddle of vomit.  The receptionist pointed this out to us and suggested we stepped around it.  As the breakfast had been served for 2.5 hours already, surely someone could have poured a bucket of water over the offending item.  On leaving the breakfast room we discovered a side door which we used to avoid the vomit and which we could have been directed to earlier.

Although there were only adults in the breakfast room a children’s tv programme was playing loudly from the television which no one knew how to turn off.  This did not give a peaceful ambience.  We ordered breakfast.  I asked for a cappuccino but apparently this was not possible in a five star luxury hotel. My husband ordered breakfast tea and we both ordered a cooked breakfast.  The food arrived and my husband asked again for his cup of tea.  More time elapsed and my husband again asked for his tea.  The waitress then said that they had run out of breakfast tea. Even though there was a Tesco almost opposite it was deemed acceptable to not have any tea to serve in a 5* luxury hotel. 

We returned to our room and collected our bags to check out.  We asked the receptionist where we could leave our overnight bag for later collection as we had booked to visit the Tower of London.  We were told this was not possible as the hotel was to be locked up at 12 noon so we had to take them with us and pay £12 for left luggage at Liverpool Street. We then went and had tea and coffee at the Tower of London who did have these items in stock.

These are tough times and this was such a shame.  

Wanting to give the hotel the right of reply, and the opportunity to make things better, I wrote to both the hotel manager and the group MD on the 24th May listing these issues.  When I had received no reply from either of these people by the end of June I chased via email.  This has also not been acknowledged, or replied to, so   it would seem that they are unbothered by my experience. I do not recommend.",1,2021,07,07
128,Engagement Celebration Trip,"I chose this hotel after a previous weekend away to Montcalm Brewery. Upon arrival I wished I’d booked the Brewery again. However lovely the staff are it just isn’t the same experience. The hotel is quite basic in comparison. We had specified on our booking that we were travelling for our engagement, nothing was mentioned. Although we didn’t write it on for a freebie, it would have been a nice touch to be congratulated at check in at least.
The lady at check in had said she would call the room to let us know if there was any availability during our 2 night stay for the spa - we never heard anything.
Our room was really dusty. The electric clock by the side of the bed was extremely dusty and didn’t even have the right time on it. Sounds picky but I’d promised my partner I’d booked a fabulous hotel - thinking about the standards of the Brewery. We won’t be returning for a ‘luxury’ stay again. Average at best.",3,2021,07,03
128,This Hotel is closed for renovations but still taking bookings.,"I booked last week and just received an email saying due to ongoing renovations they have accommodated me in another Montcalm hotel. 

I checked the website just now and they are SILL advertised as open and selling rooms. Very dishonest.",1,2021,06,24
128,No communication whatsoever ,"Myself and my wife booked this hotel and were looking for a wonderful place to stay for our first London date night in ages.

However, we turned up at the hotel and we were told the hotel was shutdown and not open for stays. This was not communicated to us through booking.com not the hotel. As you can imagine, we had a state of panic thinking where were we going to stay!?

The employee at the hotel said our booking has been diverted to Montcalm Royal London House which was a 5 minutes walk away. This was the only reason I have given 3 stars because they had said we arranged a room elsewhere.

We attended the Montcalm Royal London House hotel and the lady at reception had said that she was not sure if they even had a room and took over 15 minutes to find out if we could get a room. To her credit, she found us a room and did everything she could.

All I would ask for in future is some communication regarding cancelled bookings or diverted bookings to another hotel.

",3,2021,06,11
128,"A beautiful, stylish hotel in an impressive historic building.","This is a beautiful hotel with attentive staff who are really keen to ensure there is customer satisfaction as the hotel reopens post Covid. The rooms are stylish, clean and well appointed in an impressive historic building. The room could not be faulted. Of course, things are not running quite as swiftly and smoothly as they did precovid, but these are small teething problems that in no way impact on an enjoyable stay. For example, the kettle in our room did not work, however, it took two minutes for the staff to arrive with another. For us it was the perfect location, right next to the Barbican and so close to St Paul’s.",4,2021,06,03
128,Just not a 5* hotel,"Similar to other recent reviews, genuinely surprised how this hotel can be considered 5* in any way. Perhaps Covid goes some way to explaining it, but the overall levels of service, quality of the hotel and rooms, as well as experience just isn't up there for what they charge. 3* would be more appropriate.

This was my second stay - check in was again painfully slow. How can something so simple take 10/15 minutes plus?

The room was fine, but despite requesting a room that didn't look on to the main road outside the front of the hotel, we were given a room that looked out on to the main road. Also had very low supplies of toiletries (one bar of soap, two toilet rolls) - again, you'd expect more from a 5* hotel. For some reason there always appeared to be the smell of cabbage in the corridors too - perhaps from the nearby pub.

Key cards kept being inactivated as held next to phone/wallet which resulted in 3 separate trips to have them reactivated. On all 3 occasions I had to wait for other people checking in which didn't help.

On leaving we had planned to have a walk around London before heading home, and asked to leave our bags, but were told no as the hotel was closing - again, disappointing and would have liked to have known beforehand.

Overall I can't recommend the Montcalm - they just haven't got the basics right and I'd encourage you to spend your money elsewhere.",3,2021,06,01
128,Hotel remains closed but they are still taking bookings. Take care!!!,"Booked 2 rooms for weekend of October 3rd 2020. At no point was I told that the hotel was closed. My family arrived outside to discover that it was all locked up with a ‘Dear Customer, we regret that....’ notice on the gates. We decamped to the Montcalm London City and was told that they had expected more bookings at ‘The Brewery’ but there had been insufficient to merit re-opening. Apologies were forthcoming about the lack of notification but it was a very unsettling experience. They really shouldn’t take bookings that they cannot honour.",1,2020,10,04
128,Lovely hotel,A lovely hotel in what was once an old brewery - lovely décor throughout the building. Received a friendly welcome on arrival and all the staff were helpful during our stay. We had a problem with our room when we arrived and were unable to get the air conditioning to work but it was dealt with efficiently and we were moved to another room. There is a pub attached which also does meals but we were staying when there was a wedding reception so it was impossible to get in there on one evening. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again.,4,2020,09,26
128,Not what you’d expect from 5 stars.,"This is certainly not a bad place to stay just a bit disappointing. It’s 5 stars but I have stayed in nicer 3 and 4 star hotels.
Location is good and staff are very polite.
Restaurant looks nothing special, wouldn’t discourage people from booking here but wouldn’t recommend.
Staff where left a nice hand written card in our room to wish myself and my girlfriend a happy anniversary which was a lovely touch. 
",3,2020,08,06
128,Lovely stay at the Montcalm,"Attentive staff, nice rooms, a bit of a walk from reception.to the room, good location.
Adjoining pub The Jugged Hare good atmosphere despite Coronavirus scare.
Restaurant food was lovely. Staff made a big effort to be welcoming",4,2020,03,18
128,Mixed feelings,"Majority of the staff were very helpful and professional. Room was small and layout not great. Bed was comfortable and the room service cottage pie was amazing. However the first night I was disturbed by a  noisy group of people partying right underneath my window. When I went down for breakfast I waited 5 mins for someone to appear to seat me. They don’t do a hot buffet and I couldn’t risk how long it would take to bring me breakfast so I left. When I returned in the evening my room had not been touched. I rang to complain and was not offered an apology just what do you want. I said I would settle for clean cups so I could have a hot drink. What l got instead was extra milk, coffee and tea so they had to go away again and get me a cup. Somewhere their procedures are off. When I checked out and I was asked about MT stay I said it could have been better but the staff member did not ask how. Don’t think I’ll stay here again.",2,2020,03,14
128,Really shocked,People had said what a great hotel. Arrived and reception took forever to check in and then there was a hair in the bed. Food average at best and just an overall poor service/feel. Spoke to the duty manager who was very helpful but then on check out they gave me the wrong bill. Overall would not recommend especially as an expensive stay for what it is.,2,2020,03,11
128,Superb service and quality,"Have stayed here on more than one occasion and every time I have been spoilt and looked after by professional and attentive staff but with a friendly and familiar attitude that makes you welcome . 
On two occasions I have been assisted by Nigel during my stay and he is an absolute star , and a great asset to the hotel . 
Will definitely be seeing you again",5,2020,03,11
128,This will be our go-to,We looked for a semi-budget hotel in a handy location and hit the jackpot here. The staff were great and the friendly concierge helped to make our visit so easy. Lovely clean and spacious room. Ideal location as it is a 5 minute walk from Moorgate station.,5,2020,03,11
128,Lovely overnight stay,"Stayed here in a Club Room for Valentines and it was amazing. Check in was at 2pm however the room wasn't ready so had to wait around 30 mins. This was made up for when we walked in the room as it was beautiful; very spacious and was decorated with rose petals and a card, complimentary bottle of wine too. Staff were extremely helpful and did their upmost to make our stay so welcoming, including a staff member taking us to our room. Hotel is in a central location with easy access to all of London. Would definitely return.",5,2020,03,10
128,Brilliant overnight stay,"I was at a sales conference at The Brewery so decided to stay over at The Montcalm on the 9th March. From checking in to checking out I could not fault this hotel or its staff. The staff are polite, friendly and helpful. Carolina was on the desk when I arrived and also when I left. She was extremely helpful. The room was very modern and comfortable. Plenty of electric sockets. A very comfortable bed. I was also offered a complimentary glass of wine. I had dinner in the restaurant and was treated to the same excellent service and really appetising food. Didn’t avail of breakfast as I had a number of business calls to make. Special word of thanks to the concierges. Think this hotel provides value for money and a lovely ambience. A lovely experience. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2020,03,10
128,Time with the mrs,"The mrs and i really needed a little time together and this break was so needed. Staff were really helpful. The facilities were perfect. Really had a great time and the spa facilities were good too. 
I",5,2020,03,10
128,Excellent ,"Very good, clean and quiet. There are a load of switches in the room for different lighting which took a bit of working out how to turn it all off! 

Location excellent for city. Service especially porters very helpful ........

",5,2020,03,06
128,"Brilliant, brilliant stay!","We stayed at this hotel for two nights in a Club Room - the room was spacious and the bed was super comfortable!

Our check in was smooth and we were greeted well by all staff including the Duty Manager Giles who couldn’t do enough to make sure our stay would be a pleasant one. His greeting was warm and friendly and immediately made us feel relaxed and looked after.

We spent most of our time out of the hotel exploring London - it was brilliantly located only a ten minute walk from Liverpool Street Station and in the other direction, Barbican. 

We had breakfast on both mornings and it was by far the best hotel breakfasts we have had in London - the food was fresh with plentiful choice.

We will most certainly be returning and look forward to our next stay :)
",5,2020,03,04
128,Great Stay!,"We stayed one night for our tenth wedding anniversary. We originally booked a club room but on arrival the team led by Valen upgraded us to a suite which was lovely. They also provided a free bottle of Prosecco which was brought to our room. All staff were professional, friendly and really helpful, it really was a nice place to be and well located near to Barbican or Moorgate for travelling around London.  

We would recommend staying in a club room for access to the club lounge where you can get a continental breakfast, alcoholic drinks from 5.30pm - 7.30pm and also teas and coffees throughout the day. Well worth it!

We will definitely be back.",5,2020,03,04
128,Beautiful hotel with first class service,"Great value on a Saturday night in the city. Not much going on so get a good price. Beautiful hotel with lovely service. Tip: ask for a room in the back of the Barbican rooms opposite which is part of the hotel. Very quiet, no city noise.

Ate in the Jugged Hare which is part of the hotel building.

Only a 10 minute walk from Barbican tube. ",5,2020,03,01
128,Good except for booking,This is a good hotel in an excellent location for the Barbican. Only 4 stars though. Been here 3 times. On each occasion there was confusion over the booking. Sorted each time but was tedious. I suspect their booking software does not work properly. ,4,2020,02,29
128,Barbara,We had a delightful stay. The manager and his staff went out of their way to be helpful. The room was large and well equipped .The reception area is beautiful. Parking is easy just a minute across the road. It was Shrove Tuesday and we were greeted with a complimentary pancake with a choice of topping. Delightful,5,2020,02,27
128,Great customer service ,"I originally posted a review complaining that we were put in a room which was for disabled access with a bathroom which wasn’t great as a result. To be fair, I didn’t complain on the day. 

I’ve posted many reviews on several social media sites and never been contacted by the businesses that I’ve complained about. To my great surprise I was contacted by Alice at the hotel. 

I gave her my number and she called me for twenty minutes to understand my feedback and apologise for the misunderstanding. She could not have been nicer and has turned an initial negative into a very strong positive. Additionally she refunded half of the cost and said she’d manage our next visit. 

You rarely see this level of customer service and attentive marketing. 

Impossible to fault that. ",5,2020,02,25
128,Lovely hotel close to the Barbican ,"The hotel is just steps away from the Barbican, which has overnight car parking, places to eat and entertainment. The room was very smart, in a quirky building - the old brewery. Staff were helpful and friendly. We were in a club room so we had free use of the club lounge. This was good because there was free alcohol and snacks from 5.30, and continental breakfast in the morning. The room was nicely decorated with an enormous bed. The bed linen and duvet were a little tired, but otherwise all was very comfortable. Nespresso coffee maker in the room was useful. It was an enjoyable stay. ",5,2020,02,24
128,Amazing hotel with outstanding staff!,"Booked this hotel for me and my partner for a special getaway. It was one of the best hotels I have been to hands down! The rooms were amazing, the hotel was amazing and the staff were fantastic! 

The whole experience was made even better thanks to Nigel. He helped with ensuring the room was set up to the highest standard for the special occasion. Going above and beyond to make sure we had the best stay. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for that special experience. 

11/10 we will definitely be back!",5,2020,02,24
128,I expected high standards and received much more!,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Location is quite which suited us perfectly and there is plenty of transport hubs around.
The staff and hotel were both excellent with one particular staff member making our stay much more enjoyable than expected.
We received outstanding service and the room was lovely, large, clean and modern.
We will be returning again at some stage and would highly recommend it to all our friends and family.

Well priced for this experience and again the staff were superb with how they conducted themselves for any of our queries",5,2020,02,24
128,Weekend in London,"Clean hotel and room, romantic environment, good locality for walking through the city, near from underground stations, daily served fresh fruit on the room, great stay and excellent service by personal",5,2020,02,24
128,Good option for business travellers,"It is centrally located in the city. It is also easy to reach from Heathrow (Heathrow Express to Paddington and then with the city line to Moorgate). The room was fine (of expected quality); breakfast was ok too. I'd only suggest more 'vegan' and 'vegetarian' options for breakfast. The wifi signal was sufficiently strong and the speed of connection reasonable. Most probably I will book in the future again; it is affordable, it is fine, but not of the 5 stars league.",4,2020,02,23
128,Stay at a different Montcalm property,"I’m a fan of the Montcalm brand, having stayed at the Royal London House and the M hotel very regularly over the past few years on business and personal trips. Due to a special deal for the weekend we were visiting, I chose the Montcalm at the Brewery location for a trip for my husband and I. I’m sorely disappointed by this hotel in comparison to the brand’s other properties. First, we were told it would be only a 15 min wait until our room was ready. 40 minutes later, I checked with the desk and the room was ready, but I don’t know how long they would have had us sit there otherwise. The room is ok, but much smaller and finishes not as nice. It definitely had a tired look to it. The bed was very hard and small. The other properties have UK king beds, but this is, at best, a queen. Overall, wish I had paid a bit more to stay down the street at the Royal London!",3,2020,02,22
128,Excellent stay. Duty manager did a great job.,"I stayed for one night on 14th Feb night. I arrived a bit early. the duty manager was happy to give an early check in and was very warm in helping out in every way.
the break fast was very good. the room was very good.",5,2020,02,17
128,Nice but definitely not 5 star! ,"We spent 1 night at the hotel and upon check in (which was very efficient) were told we'd been upgraded to a club room. Not sure what the difference between a deluxe and club room were but thought it was a nice gesture. Turns out club rooms are slightly bigger, have a better shower and you can use the club lounge.  The room itself was nice, very clean, comfortable bed, good supply of tea and coffee etc. The bathroom was also clean which a good supply of towels and toiletries. We couldn't find the switch to operate the privacy blind for the bathroom, thankfully it was closed as I'm not sure why you'd want to watch your partner on the toilet if you didn't have to!  We spent most of the day out and didn't arrive back until late in the evening. This was when we discovered that our room was directly above the Jugged Hare pub! You could hear lots of loud female voices and laughing, doors closing etc. Thankfully this did stop at midnight so didn't really bother us too much. The Aircon was a little noisy, a bit like a low rumble continuously. Both showers were great, however all the paint on the ceiling around the rainfall shower had blistered and begun to peel, assuming there had been a leak for a while at some point. The bathroom door was really quite noisy to close fully, probably needs some new hinges.  

Breakfast was fantastic, great selection of food and beverages, friendly staff and nice surroundings. 

The hotel is nice, but it could do with a little freshening up in places. Some of the corridors were a bit tired and scuffed in places. 
It's not a 5star in my expectations, but still very pleasent. ",4,2020,02,16
128,amazing stay!,"We booked this hotel last minute as our train had been cancelled and the staff made us feel so so welcome, they upgraded our room on arrival and our stressful day at the train station quickly evaporated. the rooms and the bathroom were gorgeous along with the hotel reception and all of the staff were so friendly and welcoming - especially Giles! thanks again.",5,2020,02,11
128,Miss Womack,"Wow what can I say, this has been the best hotel myself and my partner have stayed in around London . We will definitely be staying here again 
Staff are really friendly, very clean, good atmosphere and they will do everything to make things possible for you",5,2020,02,09
128,Poor poor poor,"I had a special booking for my partners 30th
I got very sick which meant i could not travel
I asked to MOVE THE DATE they said no problem 
I emailed who the receptionist told me to email
Then i get a come back of Sorry you were a no show we cant refund
I wasnt asking for that! I wanted to move the date....nothing back!
Absolutely rediculous....quick to take my £250 
Will never stay at this chain of hotel 
JUST A WARNING TO EVERYONE IF YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR BOOKING THIS IS WHAT SERVICE YOU COULD GET",5,2020,02,04
128,Amazing Hotel,"The MontCalm Brewery is one of my favourite places to stay in London. Especially in the City. 
As a solo female traveller I feel looked after and safe.
The team are always welcoming and the rooms amazingly comfortable. Food options are excellent also.
Have been staying here for seven years now and could not recommend it highly enough!",5,2020,02,03
128,Perfect hotel,"From the moment we walked into this hotel the customer service was outstanding. We were staying as it was a birthday celebration, they recognised this and gave us an upgrade and complimentary drinks. A special mention to Sorina and Giles for their outstanding service. 

Room was lovely and modern, with the best rainfall shower! Location was good, about a 5/6 minute walk from the tube station. We will definitely be returning!",5,2020,01,26
128,Business hotel with character ,"This modern hotel in the City has lots of character, as the building was previously an old brewery.  The artwork in the hotel brings the building’s history to life, as do the areas of exposed brick in bedrooms.  Centrally located close to Moorgate and Barbican tube stations, and a short walk from Cass Business School.  I loved the see  through bathroom, so you can have a bath or shower while watching tv.",4,2020,01,26
128,Fantastic!,"I have stayed at Montcalm At the Brewery in the past and this trip I experienced unparalleled service...truly outstanding, making it an unforgettable stay! 

It is very near the heart of London's financial district and going to business meetings is very convenient. This is the main reason for booking the hotel. However, as a plus the service provided by the staffs is what makes this property truly unique. 

The staffs are truly professional, empathetic of the guest's every need and accommodating. In all my business travels, I have yet to come across such hotel staffs. 

Kudos to Valent and his team!",4,2020,01,25
128,Brilliant as always - Perfect Birthday celebration,"I think this must be our 7th stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery now! Whenever we come to London we always return, we wouldn’t want to go elsewhere. Why?...Because we always get such wonderful service, nothing is too much trouble. You are treated like vips from the moment you walk up to the door, your bags are taken from you leaving you to check in comfortably. 

We always mark special occasions here, our engagement, birthdays and anniversaries. This time we visited to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Our room was upgraded and there were balloons, fruit and chocolate in the room for us, as well as a welcome card from management. 

Relu was extremely helpful, he took our bags to our room and chatted to us on the way, paying a genuine interest. 

We had access to the club lounge which I would highly recommend upgrading to. We were able to have complimentary drinks and canapés. 

In the morning Relu greeted us again and introduced us to Alice the manager who was lovely too. Relu helped us with directions and a map to get us set up for our day.

Thank you, we will be back,

Sarah and Ryan",5,2020,01,23
128,an excellent location,Very professional  & courteous staff from the moment that you arrive at the front door until you check out...nothing was to much  for them !!....a  very comfortable bed....climate and a/c was easy to control....however please note that if you book room only...and decide you want breakfast next morning...you can only pay by Card...no  cash accepted...not a big deal....but a point to be aware off....,5,2020,01,22
128,Outstanding ,"This was our 3rd visit to Montcalm at the Brewery and by far the best. We had the warmest greeting I have ever had at any hotel. 

The front of house staff were just spectacular! Alex, the doorman, was great in getting us help with all our luggage, of which there was ALOT due to a party we were hosting in the Jospehine Room of the Jugged Hare.  

Ralu greeted us with a great 'Happy birthday' for my mum. After check in he showed us around her suite and explained how everything worked in the room. 

Joan, Vlad, Julien, Ralu, and quite frankly all of the staff working on Saturday 18/1/2020 went above and beyond to help us throught the day and the night. All of the gentlemen were kind, curteous and so efficient we would've struggled terribly without them. (Sorry if we've gotten any names wrong or missed anyone out)

Alice, the Customer Services Manager, was also an absolute delight and a massive help. She made sure our stay was perfect and did her best to enhance my mum's birthday. Her communications before our stay were amazingly helpful and ensured we had no concerns before we arrived.

Even though we only stayed the night, everything at the Montcalm so amazing it genuinely feels like we've had a week's holiday. It is always a pleasure to stay there, but this visit was an absolute delight! ",5,2020,01,20
128,“Home away from Home”,"This is the 2nd time we stayed at this hotel. It is centrally located, just a walking distance to venture out for your needs. Right from the hotel entrance, the staff are very welcoming and friendly. Rooms  are spacious, extremely clean and well equipped with what you would require for a stay away from home. English Breakfast was great and the staff on duty were so very welcoming and would cater to our request. We requested for a late checkout and we were very much delighted to have it. Overall our stay was very comfortable and of course without any hesitation we will come again to stay, as you feel CALM. at Montcalm!!
To conclude we wish to say our special thanks to a few of the many staff
The Duty Manager at the Reception, Ms. Victoria, who efficiently and quickly completed our checkin formalities
Mr. Nigel from the Concierge Desk who was always there to assist us
Mr. David Janko at the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms, who was very courteous in welcoming and professional in his approach. 
Finally, we wish to place on record our sincere thanks to the House Manager, Mr. Valent Fernandes for his assistance and hats off to him for having an amazing and professional team to render their professional services to the guests. 

Vera, UAE",5,2020,01,20
128,Lovely hotel,"The best welcome into the hotel, so friendly and attentive. Rooms were lovely and comfortable.  The club lounge was worth a visit. Would definitely go back to the hotel. The building is really lovely. The breakfast was ok. I told them it was a birthday treat and the put balloons in the room which was lovely. The nicest staff in any hotel we have ever been in.",5,2020,01,19
128,6 Star service in a 5 star hotel,"We travelled up to London for an 80th birthday party on the north bank and a family lunch on the south bank, and so we could enjoy ourselves, we opted to book the Barbican Rooms for the night, which were equidistant from both venues. We had to be at the restaurant on for 12:15 and we were running late, so we phoned the hotel to warn them we needed a quick check in. Imagine our surprise when we arrived at the Montcalm Brewery to find the concierge waiting for us to take our bags in so we could park up and get a taxi across London. We ended up being only a few minutes late, which really took the stress out of the day. Lunch over we headed back to the hotel not sure what we were going to find. 
To our delight we were greeted by a gentleman in a bowler hat and suit who opened the door for us and guided us to the check in desk. We were then told we had been given an upgrade to celebrate the birthday, and we were greeted by the Customer Experience Manager, Alice, who took us to our room personally followed by a porter with our missing bags. We were amazed to find she had arranged for a suite, the WOW suite no less, to be provided for us. We explained it was also our 30th wedding anniversary so eth upgrade was extra special for us, and before we knew it a bottle of prosecco appeared at the door. Well the room was certainly a WOW. The room was beautiful, with a four-poster bed a mattress so comfy you never wanted to get up. Our bathroom was huge and had a window which looked out onto the bed. It came with an electric blind so you could have privacy if you wanted it. Fresh fruit and a fully stock mini bar with wall units which lit up. (We couldn’t find the light switch until my husband pulled out the card!). The suite was immaculate, and I felt we had won the lottery.  We felt like royalty and after charging round London all afternoon it was the perfect way to unwind.
The Montcalm Brewery truly made our stay to London fabulous, and a big thank you to such a caring lady In Alice. We will return for a proper visit.",5,2020,01,17
128,Just perfect!!,"We are parisian, and freshly married, we chose the hotel for our night of weeding and we are very happy of that!
We had a very warm welcoming from the manager and all the staff, we had a wonderful room, veey cosy and well equipped, and also had great attentions waiting for us :) the room was designed for the night of weeding :) with rose-leaves, offered fruit basket, a cocktail of welcome...
The staff is just amazingly nice and accommodating...
The location is very central and is 2 subway stations far from the Eurostars station! 
Everything went perfect! Thank you for everyone of having made our experience that memorable. We will be back, undoubtedly!",5,2020,01,17
128,Wonderful hotel,"My friend and I have just spent another wonderful weekend at this lovely hotel. We were so fortunate to see Alice and Nigel again who greeted us and looked after us so well, as they always have when we’ve stayed, it’s always a delight to see them and all the staff are so friendly. We didn’t have time to use the lovely lounge bar facilities there this time but the breakfast was lovely. We’re already looking forward to our next planned stay in the Spring. This is a lovely hotel and we have always been very well looked after  xx",5,2020,01,17
128,Outstanding hotel and service,"After my flight being cancelled I very easily managed to book a room last minute at a very attractive rate. Booking was including breakfast but given fact I had to leave very early to catch my rebooked flight and breakfast starts at 7am they prepared for me a breakfast. At check out there was a bag with coffee, plain croissant, choco croissant and 2 toasted sandwiches. Taxi arranged by hotel the night before at arrival was there 15 min before agreed time.
The room was outstanding, super clean, fruit and water complimentary.
Have stayed here numerous times and the quality is very consistent and high end. When in London for business or leisure and staying in the city I can strongly recommend to book this hotel (or the other Montcalm just down the road at Finsburysqaure.",5,2020,01,15
128,"Not Perfect, But Incredibly Convenient to the Business Traveller","In terms of location, the Montcalm at The Brewery in the heart of the City of London is hard to beat. A close walk to Moorgate station, it’s about half an hour to get from the hotel to offices located in any of London’s primary business districts.

However, having come from the Montcalm Royal London House (RLH) down the road just prior to checking in at the Brewery location, there is a clear difference when it comes to quality. I have an allergic sensitivity to dust, and always request feather-free bedding in whichever hotel I stay for this reason. As a ‘hotelier’ myself, it’s always a thing of curiosity for me to see whether or not the hotel makes note of and abides by my request.

To this end, the Montcalm RLH accommodated my request, whereas the Brewery location did not. Furthermore, the housekeeping department at the Brewery location left something to be desired. There was consistently a thick layer of dust covering all appliances in the room. Not only is this disgusting, but also caused me a head cold (inclusive of cough) which could have easily been avoided.

Apart from falling short of accommodating my request for a feather-free room reasonably free of dust, the staff of the hotel were extremely hospitable. I realise the Brewery property is substantially larger than the RLH location, however the hotel lacked the level of facilities upkeep reasonably expected for a hotel of its calibre. This includes not only the presence of dust, but various other areas I noticed where facilities maintenance would be beneficial. the remainder of staff did not abide by what would be expected for a 5* hotel property.

In all, I’d say the Brewery has excellent potential, but there are still a few kinks which must be resolved before the hotel can become what it endeavours: ‘excellent’. If the housekeeping and facilities maintenance staff upholder the same standards of service as members of the F&B and Front Office teams, the Brewery would be a force to be reckoned with.",4,2020,01,12
128,Tucked out of the way on for table hotel ,"I arrived here with two colleagues on 8th January .
After a long journey from Cornwall just wanted to relax .
The room had a well stocked mini bar mini toiletries no face cloth tho 
Very comfortable bed room was a deluxe double room was quite small but had hairdryer tea/coffee making faculties 
The room was clean and bed linen smelled fresh 
Dinner was ok very slow service tasty dessert 
After a decent nights sleep and nice hot rainfall shower breakfast was a good choice with artisan breads and the nicest scrambled egg I’ve ever had in a hotel smoked salmon was of a good quality 
Checkout was quick no issues and the staff very attentive and helpful especially hotel manager and concierge 
A well run hotel perfect for London city business

128,Great Service by Eli (Club Lounge),"Stayed here in December 2019 and January 2020. Every morning, i look forward to seeing Eli during my breakfast in the Club Lounge. She is super friendly and someone who assists and serves guests with a great attitude. She is an asset to the hotel. I wish to also take this opportunity to say a big thank you.

Stan",5,2020,01,11
128,GREAT PLACE TO STAY WHEN YOU ARE IN LONDON FOR BUSINESS,"My flight from New York to London delayed so I was running late for my meetings. The head Concierge and his team got my shirt and suit ironed in record time and sent me off in a cab just in time. The Concierge staff were just superb with their vast knowledge of the city. That was helpful for a first time visitor in London looking for the addresses of my scheduled meetings. 

The room was spotless clean with a comfortable bed. 

I enjoyed my stay. This is my place in London on my future trips. 

Keep the good works.",5,2020,01,09
128,Amazing stay,"Stayed here as a birthday treat and wasn't disappointed. The staff are fantastic, friendly, professional and nothing too much trouble. They really made my stay special. Room was gorgeous. Personally for me the only thing I didn't like was the breakfast but that's a personal thing as my partner thought it was great.",5,2020,01,09
128,Great service,"Nice hotel, a little out of the way for the main attractions, but close to underground links
Hotel was nice and quiet
Rooms were clean and nicely decorated
Staff were very friendly and helpful, really couldn’t do enough for us",5,2020,01,06
128,Birthday Stay,"Another lovely and perfect stay. We stayed from 20th dec to 24th dec 2019 in the wow suite. Thank you to everyone at the Montcalm especially Alice who always goes beyond expectations to make it a superb stay. Alice also made my partners birthday extremly special from the moment we woke up till we checked out on his actual birthday. 
This hotel is very peaceful and close to get around London. ",4,2020,01,05
128,Great stay in a brilliant hotel,"Visited London for a couple of days with a friend and stayed at The Montcalm Brewery. The hotel is lovely, the staff are helpful and the price is affordable. There are a few issues with the rooms that you wouldn’t expect at a 5 star hotel but nothing that caused any issues. The rooms could have been cleaner- a thick layer of dust on the bathroom extractor fan, marks on walls and a stain on the curtains. The ‘shutter’ on the bathroom window is broken and permanently down (which was fine for our stay) but not a great look. The speaker in the bathroom also didn’t work. 

Joan, the concierge, was amazing and really made our stay special! Nothing was too much trouble and we have a good laugh with him every time we saw him. What a guy!

All in all we had a fantastic stay and a brilliant time in London. Will definitely look to visit again soon!",4,2020,01,04
128,Fine,"This hotel is in an excellent location, well served by underground stations and buses, walking distance to galleries, museums. Short underground to Covent garden, leicester Square etc. The hotel itself is architecturally interesting and has a grand entrance. There are loads of courteous staff. However, the room we were in was an accessible one, and sort of strange for that reason. Bathroom had no where to place towels, the shower was nice though. The room was small but high ceilings. It was a bit dusty, and the mini fridge, which we used for our own food was quite dirty, the kind of thing I guess happens if you don't clean it our very often. It was a bit gross. I found the place fine, but anything we needed, despite the number of staff, we couldn't really get done. And as a person with dust allergies I was quite allergic there, it aggravated my asthma and it was hard to sleep.",3,2020,01,02
128,Best Hotel of The Year,"Stayed for a single night and was made to feel like royalty. My requests were adhered to completely and complementary by Valentin. Overall an incredible New Year’s Day. The room was immaculately clean and the staff were incredibly friendly. All the love, all the vibes, thank you guys.

128,Perfect stay ,"I can not fault this hotel, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the lovely warm welcome from every staff member we met to the large room with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The building is full of character and the location is close to several tube stations. The continental breakfast in the Club Lounge is fresh and plentiful with attentive staff. We will definitely be returning to celebrate my husband’s birthday in a couple of weeks’ time. Thanks for a great stay! ",5,2020,01,01
128,You don’t get the room you booked,"We stayed last month at the Barbican Rooms. The room was ok but a bit small, so this month we decided to pay a little bit more and book at the Montcalm at the Brewery instead. They moved us across the road into an exactly identical room. Very disappointing. They should be more clear about it, pictures are misleading.",3,2019,12,29
128,Good not great ,"For a five star hotel I expect everything to go smoothly.   The shower was cold and not draining properly and no alternative offered.  The door to the club lounge wouldn’t let us in.  On the plus side the rooms had plenty of space.  The beds are comfortable and the pillows are just right.  There were complimentary fruits in the bed room and the Nepresso coffee machine is a great addition.  Would I stay again, yes but only if there’s a good deal.  If you’re looking for a proper five star go to the Landmark.",3,2019,12,28
128,A 5 stars hotel? A joke!,"I booked this hotel because of its location and it is a 5 stars hotel, but my bad experience for 3 days in this hotel proves it is a joke to call this hotel a 5 stars hotel.

First of all, it was poorly decrorated from a old factory workshop. All services scattered everywhere, not as a proper hotel services are well organized. The decorations were not completely so that for example, celler is completely undecorated with Gym. In raining days or a cold days, guests have to run from taxi into different block units with their luggage in the rain. Garbage and laundry are collected in early morning by truck in center Hof, in every room guests can hear the loud noise. There is no service lift, sometimes guests have to go together with dirty bed covers, towels and etc inside the only lift. Room is small as well as corridor. 

Service staffs in reception are absolutely not friendly. I booked a double room and I asked for a quiet room with 2 separate beds if possible. When I checked in, staff asked me to pay GBP30, 00 per day so that they can put 2 beds in the room, since my business trip budget, I could not accept it. The staff was not happy, then put me into the room just besides the elevator. I called reception, they just cut off my call several times, but put the call direct to concierge. There many other things were far below a 5 stars hotel quality level. I just attach a few photos taken from the room to show how bad condition the room is. I will never come back. 

A trevaller from Hamburg, Germany.",1,2019,12,23
128,Exceeded the great expectation,"Outstanding service from start to finish, easy and pleasant check in, great communication with guest experience team, food was amazing, a definite place to stay for any London trip, we'll done to all involved in making our time such a pleasant and welcoming stay xxxXxxx",5,2019,12,23
128,Spacious room and good location,"I stayed for a business trip and can commend the staff who were very welcoming and helpful upon arrival. The room itself was very spacious by London standards, well-equipped, comfiest bed I've had in a hotel (if you like soft bedding) and very clean. 

The breakfast was simple as I only had club lounge continental breakfast, so if you want something more substantial check which option you have booked. 

The layout of the hotel is also a little unusual, so be sure to pay attention when you're shown to your room!

I did report a couple of small issues (no gluten free bread at breakfast, some missing/broken light bulbs in the room) and all were handled brilliantly by management. 

Looking forward to returning to stay again.",4,2019,12,23
128,Best week in London,Had an amazing experience staying the week in the hotel. Rooms were spacious and had alk the amenities. People were very good specially the concierge I met was very mannered and behaved nicely. Helped a lot and yes I made a friend. Thanks Relu for being such a nice person. Glad I met you. Hope to see you soon. Will surely suggest my colleagues and visit the hotel again.,5,2019,12,22

128,Great hotel and amazing service,"Had a fantastic stay here. Hotel is set within what used to be a brewery and so has a lovely charm about it. 

Room was spacious for London, clean and modern. The bed was so comfortable to sleep on that you didn't want to leave it! 

Rositsa in guest relations was outstanding. She looked after us from start to finish and nothing was too much trouble. Personally showed us round, checked in on us during the stay and arranged for lovely extras in the room. Her care and concern to make our stay memorable made us feel like celebrities. Rositsa is a fabulous asset to the hotel and words cannot thank her enough.

Thank you also to Charles (duty manager) and to Ismail & Eli (club lounge) for great customer service. All staff including house keeping were friendly and helpful.",5,2019,12,21

The hotel is in a perfect location with plenty of things to do within walking vicinity. 

The hotel room was clean, tidy and immaculately presented, making our stay one to remember.  We last stayed their 10 years ago and can honestly say it’s in very bad good condition without showing it’s age. 

I will definitely be staying their again! 

Valent and his staff were really welcoming and showed a lot of enthusiasm when interacting with my children which made the stay even more special for our family.

128,"It was OK, but not worth the £189 (room only)","Check in was a bit of a queue - I guess that's normal for 16:00 on a Saturday.
The desk lady was efficient but had a lot of form filling for us to do.
The chap who took us to our room was super-friendly and very professional.
The doorman was always there with a friendly smile.
The room was a bit ""meh"" - we thought we'd get more for the money - see pictures.
The noise from the aircon ducts outside our window was not pleasant.
We tried to get a table in the bar for drinks but it was too busy.
Breakfast was silly money so we headed out to find somewhere else.",3,2019,12,19
128,Incredible stay.,"It was our first time staying in the Montcalm at The Brewery, and it definitely won’t be the last. The staff were fantastic from start to finish. There were some personal touches I wouldn’t normally expect from a big hotel chain which made us really feel appreciated.
The room was spotless, and very very comfortable, our only regret was we were not staying longer. 
Location was great for us too, and to top it off the bar staff at the Jugged Hare were equally as impressive.",5,2019,12,16
128,Great team,"Made to feel very welcome - from arrival to departure the staff were superb. I’m always made to feel special when I stay here. Will be staying again - the location is great for the City, Barbican and St Paul’s ",5,2019,12,16
128,5 stars unworthy,"There is a lot to be improved at this hotel, currently not making it worthy of the five stars it claims to have. The check-in procedure took more than 40 (!) minutes as the line in front of the check in desk was enormous with the number of people at the desk too few and the speed of working very slow. After getting the key, our superior double room appeared to be on the third floor which could not be reached by elevator but required climbing stairs. The room itself was small, which is not unusual for London. Unbefitting the 5 stars is however that there only is a very tiny window and thus hardly any daylight inside, and that this dark space is not clean with dust along the bed carpet,. The tiny window does not open and this top floor is very hot, requiring you to use the airconditioning. The AC is also very dated and  makes a lot of noise, very uncomfortable while trying to sleep . Needless to say I am disappointed and dissatisfied with this hotel and would definitely not recommend it. I have stayed in much better properties in London (for less money).",1,2019,12,15
128,My favourite hotel in London,"This is my favourite hotel in London - location is perfect - near to the tube stations and in the heart of the city
The rooms are tidy, clean and comfortably. Prices at weekends are fantastic for a 5 star hotel - great value for money
A visit to ‘The Jugged Hare’ the resident pub is a must. I particularly like the Sunday Roast - need a plate and a half to fit the portions! 
The staff are all very friendly and attentive- always a warm welcome on arrival
A special mention for Vlad - best concierge in London - knows everyone and all the top places to go - try him!
I visit London many times for both business and pleasure - this hotel is always my first choice - always look forward to a visit here!

128,Good hotel ,"After my assessment and because we are in the center of London this is a great hotel - had a 120 £ price which was a good one thanks to a special discount in hotels.com 
Room are big for London and the hotel is nestled in an old whitbread brewery! Charming place.  The breakfast was nice but not exceptional 
Overall I was satisfied by the stay ! ",4,2019,12,10
128,Some room for improvement ,"We did enjoy our stay in this hotel, but the ventilation noise in our room (201) didn’t make a good nights sleep possible. I did mention to reception in the morning and did receive an apology; although they should have offered more given a good nights sleep is the whole point of staying. 

Check in took far too long (10-15mins), given we were they only ones in the queue and had prepaid; how can it take so long per room?

The room was ok, we booked a club room with club room access which was well worth the money. It gave us free continental breakfast, nibbles and drinks. Full English was £25.95 per person extra; which is crazy pricing. 

The bar was closed at 23:45 on a sat night, which was odd and there is nowhere to get a drink nearby. 

An ok stay, not sure if we will return due to the noise issue.",3,2019,12,10
128,Mr Mike,"Great hotel with Very reasonable pricing. 
Polite atmosphere, fresh environment, superior service - this is Montcalm. 
Concierge , Vlad or Alex, will provide you with football/theater tickets. Guaranteed delivery !
Beer at downstairs will relax you after busy happy day in London. 
Stay there and enjoy your life !

Best Rgds, Mike Grachev.",5,2019,12,08
128,Check in is woeful - deluxe rooms really small,"I’d stayed here previously and clearly forgot some idiosyncrasies.  To start with, check in is a disaster!

I came through the doors and instantly joined the long check in queue.  The doorman had held the door open for me (which was OK) but then told me to join the queue, when I had already joined the queue.  The reason for the queue was clear quickly.  All three check in desks took ages to check people in.  Some chap being served was filling about 4 forms in at one point, although he may have been applying for a mortgage to cover his bill…..

The check in staff took ages explaining the whole breakfast set up and locations for various things as they handed the key card over.  In all it was about 25 minutes before I had my key card in my hand and I was being shown to my room by one of the porters.  Upon entering my room I had forgotten again how small the rooms were.  I had ‘upgraded’ to a Deluxe Room but I was struck on how little space there was that wasn’t taken up by the bed and furniture.  There wasn’t enough room to pull the chair out fully from the desk before it hit the bed.  The small bedside cabinets touched the wall AND the bed.  I was at a black tie dinner in the adjacent Brewery event centre and getting changed into the black tie suit required some level of contortionism with the limited space available.

The bathroom was OK but strangely the main wall in the bathroom had a window in it, meaning you had full view of the bath and toilet from the bed.  Not sure who though this was a good idea.  There was a roller blind on this window which was down when I checked into the room but had been lifted by the cleaner on the second day and it was not obvious how it could be pulled down.

So, in summary, the check in process is a disaster (all of my colleagues had the same issue), the rooms are tiny and has some odd features.  Oh, and it was over £300 per night when booked well in advance.  Only London hotels can get away with this!",3,2019,12,07
128,"small window, smell of sewage - disappointing for the price","I stayed here twice when travelling for business since it's very close to the London office of my company. The first time I though I was just unfortunate. Tiny window, zero view, damp smell, very soft bed, poor sleep. Same on the second trip. 

I'm surprised the hotel tries to position itself as a luxury place because it just isn't.",3,2019,12,07
128,Luxury in London,"unfortunately only one night at this spectacular hotel. Nothing was to much trouble and one of the best nights sleep I have ever had in a London hotel.

The room was away from reception and I had to step outside to get to it which meant a little exposure to the british winter. 

Room facilities included excellent free WiFi, a nespresso machine, great shower and bath.

Good breakfast

Only gripes a little disorganised in reception. I’ll be back though.",5,2019,12,06
128,Very Disappointed,"I have stayed  this hotel on a number of occasions previously and had been very satisfied with the service and room quality.

However,entering the room on this occasion there was a smell of damp and whilst not over powering was unpleasant. As we were in a hurry I did not have  time to investigate or report the issue initially (I did report  this to the Duty Manager Victoria later). I also reported a health and safety issue with the carpet at the top of some stairs. I received an apology from the Duty Manager together with a number  or of promises for when I visited the hotel next (Dec 20/21 2019)

Why am I disappointed? None of  the promises made by the Duty Manager have been kept. Unfortunately it would appear this reflects the value the hotel management place on returning customers.",3,2019,12,06
128,Disappointing hotel,"I've waited a week before writing this review because I want to make sure it is not too reactionary - basically, this hotel was just not for me. Firstly, it took ages to check in with just one receptionist but numerous front of house staff were available taking luggage and wishing everyone a good day. The reception area is cavernous and very dark, but of course the nature of the old building doesn't help. We were shown to our room - 138 - by a very helpful guy; I'm sure he must have seen the look on my face when we entered it. There was a really small window, about 400 mm wide right in the corner of the room so the appearance was one of darkness and claustrophobia. It was blacked out because the wall of the building next door was literally right outside. There was no daylight at all at any time of the day - really horrible.

The bathroom has a clear glass wall between it and the bedroom, luckily with an electric blind so your partner doesn't have to sit and watch you on the loo - OK, baths in a bedroom are great but this was certainly a very strange set-up. We eventually found the safe didn't work, and after reporting it 3 times during our 3 night stay nothing happened; no note, for instance to say it couldn't be repaired. The main bedside light didn't work, and it wasn't a blown bulb - so instead the bendy reading light had been forced into it to make it look like it worked. Again, telling concierge resulted in - nothing. Whoever decides to decorate a bathroom with rough, non glossed black stone tiles? Result - off putting white dribble marks from taps and showers.

Breakfast was rather disappointing as well, served in the dining rooms on chipped and worn tables - some table cloths would improve the atmosphere totally. Very much a pub experience rather than that of a 4 star London hotel. On day 2 we went to Cote over the road - excellent and just over half the price with decent coffee included.

We had looked forward to our 3 night stay in London, as the hotel experience is an important part of it, but next time we'll stay nearer the centre of things. Finally, I would say that the front of house staff are the biggest asset to this place - attitude and appearance more suited to a better hotel.",3,2019,12,06
128,Another Amazing Stay... Can't wait to go back!!,"Having stayed at the Montcalm London Brewery once before I was unsure if it could possibly be as good the second time... it was in every way!! The service we received from the moment we arrived was superb. We arrived early so our room was not ready which was not a problem, we checked in and headed out for a few hours, leaving our bags at the hotel. When we returned at 2ish the room was ready and we were shown up by a very friendly member of staff. When we arrived we saw balloons on the bed which was a lovely touch considering it was my girlfriends birthday weekend. On top of this, there was a fruit bowl in the room and the gentleman who showed us to the room continued to offer us a complimentary bottle of prosecco to help celebrate the occasion, which was a lovely surprise and helped make a wonderful trip!! The room was very spacious and clean and nothing seems to be too much trouble here. We can not wait to go back and are already planning our next visit!!",5,2019,12,04
128,Happy customer!,"Second time I.ve recently stayed at the Brewery.  Whilst my first stay was a little so-so, it didn't stop me booking a second stay, and this was delightful.  Room exceeding comfortable and well equippd; service totally on the ball!  Well recommended.",5,2019,12,04
128,Excellent hotel,The Montcalm Brewery is a lovely hotel where your stay is made special by the attentiveness of the staff. They are always on hand to help and make sure your stay is special but it also feels very relaxed. Well worth a visit.,5,2019,12,01
128,Mr Ings,"Yet again another series of superb visits to the Montcalm hotel London City Brewery. The staff are always so polite and highly professional.  Nothing is ever to much, making my visits enjoyable.

I will be back throughout December and looking forward to many more comfortable and enjoyable stays",5,2019,12,01
128,Very comfortable and superbly located (esp for business) hotel,"I'm perhaps influenced by the fact that I got an unasked for upgrade to a very comfortable suite but staying in this hotel was a very good experience. I had a very nice meal in my room and was pleasantly surprised by the mini bar prices, which are often prohibitively high but here didn't seem to be any higher than you would expect in the bar. I had a half bottle of perfectly drinkable red wine for £10. Breakfast was buffet style but very well presented. Friendly and courteous staff.",5,2019,12,01
128,Slightly mis-sold... ,"I stayed here with my partner as a birthday getaway. I specifically booked this hotel, for the sauna and steam room only to be told on arrival there is no such facilities. Even though it is advertised on Montcalm’s own website? Either mis-selling or misinformed staff?
I paid extra for a club room which stated Hermes toiletries would be used, I was so disappointed to see Elemis which is used on all rooms. 
The club lounge had a good selection of drinks, alcohol and soft, coke in actual bottles but the snacks advertised were poor, they had 2 fallen-apart-sorry sandwiches left and the staff member said they may make some more within the hour. So we had to leave this. 
Overall, concierge very helpful and charming. Room decor was good and clean. Poor shower/bath tap this needs major improvement or atleast a proper instruction on how to use. I would return, but I would book the cheaper option as this is what we received anyway. 

",4,2019,12,01
128,Room 012 has very noisey air con units outside window,"Stayed last night in ROOM 012 for business party. Arrived with usual last minute shenanigans. Staff upon arrive very attentive. Took us to room..(should have taken this as hint).  Showed us the fridge and ironing board etc....Other half got ready and watched terrible news on london attack.
Could not draw a bath as complicated shower bath set up. Tap forn bath needed pushing back in place only to have a  poor flow which ruled out bath.
Got showered  not very hot . Went to function.
Arrived back 1am to notice the noise from chinnock landing pad outside room being used. Partner was suffering from recent mystery ilness vino related...had hit pillow and went out.
I on other hand was not affect by paralysis caused having not consumed the  vino...
Noise prevented me getting anysleep and partners terrible suffering prevented ghastly exit.

Would have packed up and collected car and drove home then. Having consumed a glass of fizz this was ruled put.
7.30am when safe to rouse then leave the afflicted. Proceeded to inform management of situation.on constant droning noise directly outside room.Spoke to sebastian who when asked directly if he had this reported before produced an expression of mild enlightenment.. offered discount  free breakfast room upgrade..
Normally a short session of discord would  take place to provide amicable solution.
However the last six and half hours of weighing up which of the two, noise from outside which would end when I left room vs untold factors and protracted unknown duration of affects from disturbing the afflicted.. His resulting response to direct question about this being known to staff. Required me to advise that I have a need of a walk to cool off this sudden feeling of rage I was experiencing.
Thanks must given to the healing powers of the bed as partners recovery was miraculous.
Partner discussed with new manager who from my over tired state mentioned maintenance may need to look at this and sheepishly offerd 50% discount. 
I directly asked new duty manager if this matter has been reported and was known . Was again met with similar raised eyebrows and promises to investigate.
Hotels do this all the time and we paid the same as other guests they gamble on getting away with non complaining brits  move to other room and then stick another  unsuspecting visitor into this torture chamber.
DO NOT STAY IN ROOM 012. IT IS NOT FIT TO BE SOLD AS A ROOM FOR SLEEP",1,2019,11,30
128,Special Weekend ,"I write this as I stay so it’s fresh in my mind, from the moment we arrived we have been so well looked after.

The standard of care given by the front of house team is of an exceptionally high standard, I originally booked a club room but we were given an upgrade to a duplex suite which was absolutely epic! As we were here to celebrate. 

The ladies from the Guest experience team and especially Alice who was very accommodating to all the requests I made were absolutely amazing. The bath butler service was something else! An absolute must.

The building itself is beautiful and the waterfall wall in reception is pretty cool, I’ve not seen anything like that before.

For me the hotel and Montcalm have now redefined what I consider luxury. I give this hotel my highest recommendation and also look forward to a return visit and also trying the other Montcalm hotels.

Thank you for making our stay special ",5,2019,11,30
128,"Overall amazing experience, would definetly reccomend!","It was my first time at this hotel, and I will definetly be returning. All the staff were really friendly, especially Alice and Valent whom made the trip even more memorable. I would reccomend this establishment to a friend and cannot wait to return.",5,2019,11,29
128,Great customer experience,"It was my first time staying at this hotel and I have been really impressed by the incredible focus all the staff and in particular the guest experience team put in place to provide the guests with the best service possible, from room upgrade to complimentary drink. I cannot recommend enough this hotel. ",5,2019,11,27
128,Stay OK but not a 5 star - wouldn't return,"I booked this hotel for one night for my husbands birthday, I booked direct and made sure the hotel was aware it was his birthday after reading some of the lovely extras given to guests when they were celebrating a birthday. When we entered the room, there were no personal touches for the birthday, not even a little card saying Happy Birthday, which I thought was a real shame.

We had booked a club room specifically to have access to the club lounge and upon arrival (after waiting around 15 minutes to be checked in) we were told the club room didn't include lounge access. I told the receptionist that it stated on the Montcalm website this was included so she asked me to prove this, which I did.

Upon arrival to the room it was very warm so we put the air con on. It made a very loud buzzing noise but was working. We left it on while we were out but the room was very warm during the night and the air con was too loud to have running.

In the welcome book, it stated there would be an I-Pod dock, pillow menu and aroma box present in the room. These are all little touches the hotel mention a lot on their website making them unique but they were not present in our room. Only a little thing but I was a little disappointed as the little touches make a real difference.

The drink selection in the lounge was really good as was the selection for breakfast the following morning. The ""canapes"" that were advertised as being on offer were a few crisps and nuts and some sandwiches which ran out around 10 mins after they were put out and it was over an hour before any more were made. This was very different to lounges we have used in other hotels where the selection of food is top notch.

Overall, the hotel was OK if a little dated, but I don't think this is a 5 star compared to other hotels in London we have used. I would not stay here again.",3,2019,11,25
128,Served it's purpose,"We stayed here for a 2 night stay while watching the 02 tennis finals. The check in was quick and easy, luggage taken to our room, the room was big, clean, & comfortable. Lots of water, tea, coffee etc. Excellent comfy bed too. The bar attached to the hotel serves nice drinks & the restaurant looked nice even though we did not eat in it. Overall i have stayed in better cheaper hotels around the world, but this is London & will always be expensive. The hotel is very close to the tube station & bus connections.",4,2019,11,21
128,"Great Hotel, Great Stay","We have visited london on many occasions. I decided to book this hotel for our stay and it did not disappoint. The staff were friendly, very helpful & could not do enough for you. We were greeted by a lovely gentleman on arrival. Check in was very easy, bags were taken to our room

Room was clean & tidy. Everything you needed for a stay in london. Located in a nice quiet area with bars around and food, also a short walk to the tube station. We drove to london, there was parking around the corner. Easy to locate

Would definitely recommend and we would definitely stay at this hotel again",5,2019,11,17
128,"Poor service for the price paid, but this is what you get in London. Unable to supply even a corkscrew","Eight minute wait whilst two people check in three guests, in the meantime three concierges stand around doing nothing. I suggest they help with the booking in but it's not their assigned job. Later on I request a corkscrew to uncork the wine in the minibar - twice! Ignored both times by someone on the desk who promises they'll look into it, then clearly just forgets. Very poor service for the price paid, but that's London for you.",2,2019,11,17
128,Weekend,"The staff at the hotel are truly amazing from the doorman, check in, concierge,  
Waiting staff. 
We apparently had an upgrade ? Nothing apparent in the room itself ? A few things let it down for me - the privacy blind in the bathroom was jammed - oops !! Only 1 robe and a few things in the room rather shabby.  Not sure what a basic room would have given us ? Breakfast was fine but we had to ask for bowls for cereal, more hot water for tea, more pastries. 
Maybe a bit picky over a few things but expected better.  Generally a nice stay 👍",4,2019,11,16
128,An excellent stay (wish we had longer!),"Our stay in the Montcalm could not have been better- though we would have loved to stay longer!

All the staff we encountered made sure we were well looked after and nothing was too much trouble. 

Our room was most comfortable with quality toiletries and tea / coffee provision. And the bed was soooo comfy! 

We will definitely stay here again if in this part of London.",5,2019,11,16
128,Excellent Customer Service,"I am a regular visitor to the Montcalm range of hotels. Customer Service is something the Group have been focused on - I have had a few gripes in the past. On this occasion the service was excellent from the moment we arrived at the hotel. Everyone was friendly, professional and caring. We stayed in a Montcalm Club Room. It was a generous size, spotlessly clean and well maintained. For breakfast my wife and I used the Club Lounge. Really good selection of cereals, breads, cheese, meat and fruit. Again the service in the lounge was perfect. 10 out of 10 for every aspect of our visit.",5,2019,11,16
128,A Relaxing Night in London,"What a wonderful hotel. A warm welcome at Reception, a free upgrade from the Hotel Manager, a complimentary drink brought to our room - what's not to like. The staff were friendly and professional throughout, and the room was very clean. We spent the night in one of the duplex suites - very comfy bed and a lovely, quiet room.

The hotel is a two-minute walk from the Barbican Centre, so we can highly recommend it!",5,2019,11,15
128,Mini moon,"Our stay was amazing and just what we needed after our busy wedding on the Friday! The staff were all very attentive and went above and beyond for us and we were always met with a smile.  The concierge were amazing, flagging down taxis for us, showing us around and making sure we were well looked after, even coming to check on us to make sure we had all we needed!

But at the same time left us alone to enjoy our mini moon.

The bed is dangerous, as it was that comfortable you didn't want to get out! The room was ideal and there is nothing we could have asked for to give us a better stay.

The only critique is the pre authorisation charge not being made clear about and a few issues with the key card not working.

So for our overall experience it would be a 5!",5,2019,11,15
128,Perfect Weekend Away,"We had the perfect stay at this hotel and will definitely be returning very soon. From the moment we arrived we were treated with incredible hospitality by all the staff. Especially the gentleman who brought our heavy bags up to the room. Champagne on ice was brought to our room upon arrival which made our check in experience even more delightful. We stayed in the Deluxe Club Room which was beautiful and the bed was very comfy, the room was decorated with rose petals and heart shaped towels on the bed. We stayed for two nights at the hotel and wished we could have stayed longer. A special thanks to Alice who was very helpful in organising this weekend for us. Any questions we had, or any bookings for restaurants or the spa we needed she did for us. Also the complimentary prosecco brought to our room on behalf of our celebration was very much appreciated. Overall our stay at the hotel was fantastic and we look forward to staying there in the near future.",5,2019,11,14
128,Very smart if not a little confusing,"Staying here juts one night. Check in was fine. Lovely looking building. Very pleasent staff. We were directed to a room out of the main building and across the courtyard. We entred a rabbit warren but did find the smart room in the end. We were also told that, as i had stayed before, we could enjoy the memebers area. My son and I had a few sandwiches and a soft drink. Breakfast was kinda odd with a self service sorta continental style thing. All in all good location and worth the £",4,2019,11,14
128,Lack of attention to detail takes the gloss off this luxury hotel,Treated myself to a luxury hotel. Lovely touches like fruit and water. Room clean Very comfy bed & quiet room. Alice (cust svcs) very helpful. But! one person on checkin & four people waiting. A simple “be right with you” until 2nd receptionist logged in would help. No offer to take heavy backpack & long walk to room. Room furniture chipped/stained & bathroom looking tired plumbing needs attention. Checkout. No “did I need a taxi” Had to manoeuvre heavy reception door on departure. Doorman/concierge looked on from concierge desk. AND STILL NOT RECEIVED £50 ROOM HOLDING CHARGE BACK!!,3,2019,11,14
128,The Dream Stay,We had the perfect stay at this hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated with incredible hospitality by Alice and all of the team. Nothing was too much for anyone making our whole stay fabulous. Our rooms were perfect and staff were fantastic.,5,2019,11,13
128,Great location and great facilities,"Perfect for business or pleasure, I’ve stayed here a number of times and it’s always been great. 

The only slight improvement I’d make would be to make the check in faster. After a long day I don’t want to stand around waiting then to fill in documents to get my key. ",4,2019,11,12
128,Certainly not a 5 star experience,"Had a dissapointing two day stay at the hotel. On the first night, left the breakfast form on my door and was waiting for breakfast at the indicated time. Called the reception and they told me they never received the form. Later I found the form on the floor and realized that it was dropped by accident by the gentleman who brought my room service the night earlier. I decide to try again and place the filled form on the door for breakfast the next day. I get a call in the morning telling me that if they were to bring breakfast to my room, that they would have to charge me. My fare included breakfast (it is not only in my booking confirmation, but it was also mentioned during check-in). I only selected the items for breakfast that did not result in additional charges and which were included in my tariff. The receptionist started telling me some story to which I told her I didn't have time for this (the reason why I wanted breakfast early in the room is because I didn't have time to go to the restaurant). Aside from the very poor service which I have never experienced in a 5-star establishment, the shower was leaking and made noises. There was also something broken in the drain and what looked like brown paint. The room was freezing cold even when I put the heat on at 35C. Overall, pretty terrible experience and have had better stays at 4-star hotels in London. Highly recommend business travelers to avoid this one.",2,2019,11,11
128,Mary Poppins show and hotel of choice for visit,"We previously stayed at this hotel several years ago when we saw Motown.

As a result of our experience on that visit we chose it again but this time had the club room upgrade as you get the use of the club lounge and a larger room and better facilities.

On arrival we were very early so we were able to leave our case and pop into the city, the staff as before were very accommodating and attentive making you feel like a valued customer.  The man on the front desk was concerned our room was not ready even though we were early and offered us a standard room until ours was available, the Manager (forget his name but when we spoke to him he was from Mauritius originally) took us personally to the club lounge and gave us complimentary g&t’s (club lounge alcoholic drinks don’t start until 5p.m).  He was happy to chat to us for some time which was nice.

On returning to get ready for the show we were escorted to our room by a lovely chap (from Romania originally and again forgot his name!) who again was very happy to chat to us as if we were almost friends and I found out he used to work for the same company as me some years ago.

The room was lovely and the glass partition between the bedroom and the bathroom that you could close off using an electric blind was a nice if somewhat surprising touch.

The complimentary snacks and drinks during the day and alcoholic ones after 5pm were all top quality brands/foods.  The complimentary continental breakfast we had in the morning was also part of the club room deal and was as good in terms of quality and choice as one would expect.

The location, staff and value for money that this hotel and room option offer is nothing short of outstanding.  

Now our hotel of choice when staying in the capital and deservedly so, well done to the staff for the whole experience.",5,2019,11,10
128,Almost!,"Yes, this is a 5 star hotel.

Well above the standards of your Central London offering. Old school good service, plenty of details, premium rooms, premium toiletries, good mix of technology and old fashioned facilities...

You cannot fail it!! Unless...

You realise how much you pay for staying in Central London and how much value for money you get in a 5 star hotel in London compared to a 5 star hotel elsewhere... this is where things lose a bit of momentum.

Cannot fail the hotel itself, it's the fact of London being one of the most expensive places on this planet right now.",4,2019,11,10
128,Agree... 1 Star not 5 star ,"Underwhelming.

If you read the hotel website, you are led to believe that this is a ‘5 star hotel’. Nothing could be further from the truth for the following reasons:

We requested to be moved away from noisy room next to lift. 

The process to move proved challenging as we waited for a call back from management which never came.

We were eventually moved to a room with broken air conditioning and no window!

The controller for blind in bathroom was exposed - surely a health and safety risk?

Confusion and crossover by inexperienced staff with limited understanding of how to deal with the unexpected.

These delays impinged on our weekend reservations.

We were eventually moved to a third room.

On check out we were confronted by the duty manager who appeared to take issue with our online review, with his intention to try to ‘manipulate’ our opinion.

In no uncertain terms we explained why this review was factually correct.....

......We were surprised however to see a contrasting positive review posted immediately after.... coincidence?.",1,2019,11,10
128,Great place to stay,"Cannot fault our stay, the room had a full selection of toiletries, water, tea and coffee and snacks and it was a very quiet room so we slept very well. The blind that went up to reveal a view of the bath from the bedroom was both weird and cool. I certainly would not want to take a bath or shower in full view of the hubby as he watches telly from the main room but that’s just me.",5,2019,11,09
128,1 star not 5 star,"This place is an embarrassment. Moved room twice. The second room without an actual window. Broken bathroom buttons, air con making a horrendous noise. Staff not empowered to resolve complaints. Do not stay here if you think anything about this place even resembles the ‘marketing’ on the site.",1,2019,11,09
128,Club? No club,"Nice enough hotel. Our room was comfortable and well appointed, however the staff and website need training and much improvement, respectively,  to clarify what is and what is not included when you book a Club room. Put a slight dampener on an other wise nice weekend.",4,2019,11,08
128,Amazing Service,"You are very well looked after from the moment you reach the reception door.

Great location, double rooms very comfortable and the price was amazing considering the location.

Rooms clean, not to much noise and decor is great.

All amenities would be as you expect ... and has a gastro pub attached.",4,2019,11,05
128,Connecting,"Internet connection very poor ( have now turned it off entirely)
Good staff on door but feeling that quality of fittings isn’t up to scratch for a 4 star hotel - the stairs from reception to first floor feel like they were installed by a trainee carpenter ...",2,2019,11,04
128,Birthday weekend for my partner,"The customers service here was amazing, they went above and beyond to make our weekend special and I really couldn’t have asked for any more. They were so accommodating and friendly, we’re definitely coming back very soon!!",5,2019,11,03
128,"Phenomenal hotel, brilliant staff","Fantastic hotel with amazing staff. Will certainly be back for another stay when working again in the City.

Was upgraded on arrival which was a nice gesture gratefully received.

Converted from the oldest brewery in Europe (according to the manager), great character and feel.",5,2019,10,31
128,Top class service and fantastic staff,"My wife and I booked at short notice to grab a quick birthday night away.  We stayed at this Montcalm not long after it had opened and as it was perfectly located for the party we were heading to we thought it a good idea to return - and we're delighted that we did!

Following the warm, attentive welcome from the reception staff we were shown to our 'room' by Alice from Guest Services - to call it a room is doing it a huge disservice: we found ourselves in a wonderful suite with four poster bed, heated bathroom floor (and incredibly deep bath!), Sky Sports, birthday balloons and a glass of bubbly each!  In the early evening we were shown to the Lounge where we were able to chill and have a beer without having to go out in the pouring rain... all the staff we met were polite, friendly and incredibly helpful.  They really made the stay feel like a treat.

After our night out we got back to the hotel around 5am and didn't check out until well after 1pm with no issues at all (side note: we had the in-room breakfast and it was spot on too)  

We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would like to thank all the staff we met at the weekend for making it a really great stay.",5,2019,10,28
128,Great hotel will go back again,Was a very pleasant experience to stay at this hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful and the room was lovely clean big with very comfortable bed inside bath room was amazing big bath and I'm 6ft2 so need that thanks again for your accommodation many thanks Scott,5,2019,10,28
128,Absolutely fabulous ,"We had such a lovely stay. It was our anniversary and we were given a Wow suite which definitely had the Wow factor. Towel swans and rose petals on the bed plus fruit chocolates a card and glass of Prosecco on arrival. 
The staff couldn’t do enough for us we will definitely be going back. ",5,2019,10,26
128,Birthday treat with an upgrade,"I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a friend for my partners birthday. I had booked a Club Room and was very impressed with the price I paid. We arrived earlier than check in time and our room wasn’t yet ready.  We left our case safely and went out for lunch which we’d booked. On our return we were shown to our room by a very nice gentleman. 
WOW we had been given an upgrade to a Barbican Duplex Suite. This room was amazing. 
There were balloons in the room, complimentary chocolates and fruit and a bottle of Prosecco was brought to the room on the house. 
We have stayed in several hotels in different locations in London and have paid much more for nothing like this standard. Room was very clean, bed comfy with lots of extras.  Full English breakfast did cost a little more but was very good and in a lovely location. 
I can’t recommend this place enough! 
Thank you Montcalm at The Brewery we’ll be back x",5,2019,10,26
128,Mr O,Excellence in action; most comfy room and the lounge is classy. Above all staff are courteous especially Mr Vikash kooblall... they were helpful and the reception desk were on point. Will recommend this hotel to everyone looking for comfort with great service.,5,2019,10,25
128,Another Lovely Visit,"We were met at reception by the Manager once we had completed our check in. He mentioned the 007 room (which sounded impressive, which we walked past) as were were taken to our room also & mentioned we were back there again for a stay in December, 2019 to which he advised he would check availability which was so nice as we didn’t expect anything extra at all so a pleased surprise. 
 
Our room was lovely, a two tier room, and we had a bottle of Prosecco delivered shortly after. 
 
We then headed out but once back, had an excellent night’s sleep. As always, the staff were superb & we’re already looking forward to our next visit in December",5,2019,10,24
128,Luxury redefined...,"I stayed for 2 nights. Indeed, the pleasant experience begun right from the check-in, super smooth and very courteous staff. I booked a club room, decent in size, all the amenities and great selection of complimentary items plus fully loaded mini bar. Cleanliness is top notch, lighting was great while bed was really comfortable. Full English breakfast options, wide selection of beverage and dining area overlooks the road outside which was very comforting while having our morning meals. Overall, I have decided to return to this property whenever I am in London.",5,2019,10,24
128,They went the extra mile,"After visiting this weekend for the first time for a special occasion, these guys really went that extra mile to make our visit extra special. 

They upgraded our room and gave us some complimentary wine and chocolates upon arrival to the room...  The place is stunning and would highly recommend it to anyone needing a hotel in that area. We will definitely be visiting again at some point. ",5,2019,10,20
128,Disinterested staff and poor room,"Have stayed here a number of times over last few months and keep hoping it will return to previous standards but it seems to get worse every time which is a real shame.
Last couple of times I’ve stayed in rooms that have had peeling paintwork and very loose windows so lots of noise from outside. I tend to spend limited time in my room so just get on with it.

This time I made a simple request when booking and on arrival to not have a ground floor room only to then be shown to a ground floor room (after dealing with a very disinterested team on reception who couldn’t seem to have any eye contact).

I then got changed to an accessible room which is fine but surely everyone needs a sink they can actually wash in and a shelf to rest their toiletries on? Truly the most bizarre  ‘accessible bathroom’ I have ever tried use. Could barely wash my face in the tiny sink that kept overfilling with water.

I must learn to tell my corporate booking service  not to book me in here again 

The Royal London Montcalm is much better. As are the local premier Inns  - staff far more genuine and polite. And better nights sleep. 

Also should mention that the smart TV services didn’t work. 

Club room breakfast is also very basic.",2,2019,10,17
128,Ms,"The Montcalm at the brewery is a fantastic hotel, very clean, and at a die-for location with two restaurants offering tasty breakfast, dinner, and everything else in between. 
The staff are helpful and very professional. And the manager, Alice Cubostrojeva, is amazing!",5,2019,10,15
128,Always happy to return,"Our recent trip was the fourth time that we have stayed at the Montcalm, always bringing different friends with us on our sight seeing trips to the capital.  We find the hotel very convenient, being only a brisk 12 minute walk from Liverpool Street. A friendly welcome and beautiful reception area to walk into.  My second birthday visit in the past year and what a lovely touch, a chilled bottle of prosecco and chocolates to greet us was very much appreciated. The hotel has real character being formerly a brewery...just love looking at old photos and paintings around the place, showing it's previous business.  Rooms are very comfortable.....varying greatly which adds to the excitement as it is an old building... so upon returning it never feels exactly the same.   On a couple of visits we have dined at Coq Argent in Poultry, just an 11 minute walk or a short taxi ride away...have always enjoyed it.  We are looking forward to returning again very soon.",5,2019,10,15
128,Weekend break in the City,"Great location and spacious room (419). Nice and clean hotel with friendly staff especially the porters who were very welcoming.
We had an issue at check in as the reception staff said our room rate didn't include lounge access, but this was sorted in 5 minutes in the back office.The club lounge was a big disappointment though with very poor selection of food for our visits for breakfast and early evening.",4,2019,10,14
128,Montcalm Brewery knocking shop?,"I recently stayed here with my girlfriend , I expected good things considering its verbose claims and 5* attachments. It turned out to be below par in my humble opinion.

The room we had would have been considered inexpensive compared to others on offer and was at the back end of the 4th floor, you could tell this was the kind of room they stick couples who ‘only’ spend a couple of hundred a night compared with £350+ it most certainly wasn’t 5*, the bed was a small double and the room was dated. Other than a few pieces of fruit in the room there were no classy touches.

To really add insult to the stay on the final night between 3.30 and 5am a bedroom in the close proximity was opened / closed (door slammed) in excess of 10 times every 5 or so minutes. I can’t imagine it was guests coming and going so can only assume that staff were using it for one reason or another and heaven knows what was going on but kept us awake.

The best part of the stay was dinner at the famous Jugged Hare and that isolated would have been a 4/5. The candy bacon for the table was delicious and so was the ribeye steak. 

To surmise unless you are paying premium rates for a room £350+ then the only way this hotel is 5* is if it was rated out of 10*",2,2019,10,14
128,Nice hotel but with a fire !,Really enjoyed most of my time here. Lovely welcome from the doorman. Reception pretty friendly. Guy who led me to the room v professional. Room was lovely. Bed pretty comfy. But at 245am we were all turfed out for a fire alarm. And yes it was a real fire in the basement. Firemen turn up and accidentally spray the assembled guests.  We were out in the rain until 4 am. Eventually we got umbrellas and blankets. But no fire register taken. Couldn't get back to sleep. Breakfast was a good continental. But lack of sleep left me rough the next day !!!,3,2019,10,13
128,First time stay - very impressed,"This was our first time in a Montcalm hotel as we normally stay in the Hilton Hotels. We had a lovely welcome from the doorman and the concierge who took the time to show us to our room. We stayed in a Club room which we found superb. We also visited the Club lounge where we had some complimentary drinks and snacks, what a treat! The bed was amazing and we really didn’t want to get out of it! When we came to check out we were greeted in the reception and generally made to feel special. Looks like we might be converted! ",5,2019,10,13
128,Average at best.,"The reception area is stunning, as is the courtyard and I found the staff all very welcoming. Unfortunately the room was not to match, the room had a constant hum in it which I would describe as a low flying helicopter or a stationary truck with its engine on. The shower worked but only extremely hot and the plug was stuck in so we ended up with a bath as well as a shower. The bed was extremely comfy so that made up for the flaws. When the staff were informed upon us checking out there did seem to be a genuine care to get these issues resolved for future guests. So all in all it was a pleasant experience but not as you would expect for a 5 star hotel.",3,2019,10,10
128,Weekend away,"Wonderful stay in the new 007 suite.
We stayed in the new 007 suite and WOW it lived up our expectations .
Fantastic Crystal chandelier over the very comfy bed.
Amazing huge bathroom with rainfall shower . 
Cant wait to return when the new Bond film comes out next year .
Alice wonderful as always with her little touches .
 Also mention goes to Vlad who always looks after us.",5,2019,10,10
128,London birthday,"I stayed at the hotel over the weekend double celebration in wife’s birthday and 10 years clear of the big C so booked 6 rooms. My room was so small it was uncomfortable and claustrophobic....

Took an age to check-in some IT problems? 

There is one positive if you want to stretch your legs outside the room visit the pub in the hotel Jugged Hare",1,2019,10,09
128,Wonderful customer service....,Excellent stay at this hotel. Staff were all excellent and made the stay very special for a friend who was celebrating her 60th birthday. The room we stayed in was starting to show some signs of wear but nothing that would distract from the stay. Highly recommended.,5,2019,10,09
128,Fabulous!,"We stayed in one of the hotels WOW suite rooms which was wow !
An enormous room with everything you could ever need . The mattress was super comfy too .

On arrival we had some of the best customer service I’ve ever received from lovely staff . We were on a special weekend and they had put complementary champagne in the room . A lovely touch.

Breakfast is in a lovely room just down from reception. There was everything you could want from a breakfast , lots of continental delights to good old full English ! 
We will definitely be back to our new go to hotel in London.
Thank you Alice ( guest experience manager ) for making our weekend special . ",5,2019,10,09
128,A fine hotel in a great location,"This Montcalm is located in The Brewery, which has Olde Worlde charm in the heart of busy London. The staff was very welcoming, including the gent who helped us with our bags and the lady who cleaned our room. The breakfast was quite varied and included muesli, which is good. The food in the dining rooms was well made and plentiful.",4,2019,10,08
128,London weekend ,"Stayed here for two nights 4th-06th
After reading a few bad recent reviews I was nervous to say the least ! On arrival we were greeted   by a doorman dress in a bowler hat (novel ) ! 
I must say the staff were all great and could not do enough to please . 
The room was small , clean but had everything we needed and more . Bathroom was lovely and a very good shower (important ) 
Two very minor hiccups that were sorted in less than 20 minutes and caused  is no inconvenience whatsoever. 
The door key wouldn’t work and the lights were not working . Sorted quickly . 
The only other problem was the room was on the main road and slightly noisy through the night . 

I would go back and would recommended this hotel to anyone .

",4,2019,10,07
128,Best customer service I have ever had!!,"I booked the room as I was in London to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday- I noted this in my booking when asked if we had any special occasions, not expecting anything to come of it. The team gave us the most incredible room, and treated us as though we were royalty from the point we entered the door until the moment we left. We had great room service, and the reception team were so welcoming and attentive.

I genuinely have never experienced such fantastic customer service and it really was very much appreciated after a full day of walking around London. The room was beautiful, we had the best sleep we'd had in months and we couldn't fault a single thing. Location is also fantastic- just five minutes from a tube station.

Thank you for making sure our stay was so perfect!",5,2019,10,07
128,Birthday weekend ,"Absolutely amazing weekend stay at the Montcalm. 

I called ahead the week before and arranged something special for my wife’s 40th. 

Visited the shard and a lovely meal in Marco Piere Whites London City Steak house.

Met by Alice on arrival who arranged everything for us.

Beautiful room, fresh fruit, wine on arrival lovely comfy bed. Very old quirky building.

Breakfast in the morning was extremely well priced and very enjoyable.

Over all experience was 5 Star.

I would highly recommend.",5,2019,10,06
128,Fantastic stay,"We stayed here for my birthday. The hotel couldn’t have done anymore to make our stay any more enjoyable. Balloons, chocolate and fresh fruit were laid out in our Club room. The staff were amazing, extremely friendly and helpful. Can’t wait to stay again!",5,2019,10,05
128,Another very poor experience ,"Very disappointing experience after trying the Montcalm again after 4 years.

A long queue at reception. None of the reception staff knew how to direct me to my room so another wait at the concierge desk.

The walk to the room involved multiple short staircases. The club room was OK (although I discovered in the morning that the shower was broken) and I called room service - despite saying on the menu a full a la carte was available from the restaurant the only gluten free option was a salad.

At £291 for a club room this hotel is just not adequate.",2,2019,10,01
128,VERY VERY uncomfortable! ,"Booked a “deluxe” double room, it was TINY but it was clean and everything seemed fine, it was quite warm in the room so we turned on the air conditioning and soon after left to go out for the evening. Upon returning it was absolutely boiling in our room, we turned the air con on again but nothing seemed to happen, we rang the concierge who said they would fix it from their end... nothing, the window wouldn’t open either and we were getting hotter and hotter, we were literally dripping with sweat in the end! it became absolutely unbearable in such a small room, we rang the concierge three more times over the course of 4 hours and they finally came to our room at 4am and said the air conditioning was broken and it was 27 degrees in there! They moved us to a bigger room which was much cooler but it was 4am and it had somewhat ruined our romantic evening. In the morning we complained to reception about how slow they were at accommodating us but their response was “we moved you to a different room” which was correct but it took them 4 hours to do it and us repeatedly calling them to come and sort it out. No apology was offered or any sort of reimbursement for our very uncomfortable night. They really didn’t care! I won’t stay here again. ",1,2019,09,30
128,Best stay at the Brewery,"This was far and away my best stay at the Brewery. The room was a club room and was beautiful inside. I was perfectly happy having a chill out night in the room after a long day at work. 
The staff were excellent and could not have been more helpful from check-in to check-out. Room service was first class and the breakfast was a great way to start the day. They even managed to cook poached eggs without the vinegar taste and ste the toast to the side rather than the eggs on top - it's the small things that count !  
Any downside ? The air con unit was a little noisy and the double duvet arrangement took a bit of getting used to.",4,2019,09,28
128,"Noisy, average, poor breakfast",This is not a 5 star hotel.  Room was average in terms of cleanliness.  Broken tiles in bathroom.  Room was hot and air conditioning made no difference.  No sound proofing and had to listen to the tv of room next door until 2 in morning.  You could hear every visit to the toilet from the room above - not ideal.  The manager will not respond to this review as he only appears to respond to good reviews which is probably why the hotel is in such a poor state.  As I was checking out a guest beside me was also complaining about the same issues as me.,2,2019,09,24
128,"The most amazing, most memorable stay!","This hotel has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The customer service was nothing less than exceptional, all staff from reception to housekeeping make you feel of importance. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure that my surprise for my partner was 100x more than what I imagined. It is the perfect couple getaway, the staff and hotel is nothing less than amazing. This was my second time staying and I don’t think I will stay anywhere else when celebrating my anniversary in London. Absolutely amazing! I would 100% recommend to anyone who ask for a romantic hotel.",5,2019,09,22
128,Anniversary treat,"Decided to treat ourselves to a show and a trip to London for our 25th anniversary searched round and found this lovely hotel and friendly staff with excellent facilities including a good breakfast and it’s own pub too, perfectly positioned to get away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy bit of London but within easy reach of it all, thank you, we will be back soon!",5,2019,09,22
128,Perfect!,"I booked a double room and when I arrived they told me they reserved me a Suite at no extra charge :) The suite was as good as one can imagine: a bottle of wine complimentary to the service was offered, bed and sofas were splendid and clean. In the morning we were told that we had complimentary breakfast. It absolutely worth the price.",5,2019,09,22
128,Amazing stay,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my partners birthday. We were greeted immediately when walking through the door. We arrived at around 11am and were told our room was already ready (unexpected we hadn’t paid to have early access). The gentleman who showed us to our room was great giving us information about the history of the hotel. On arrival to the room he informed us that he was able to get us a free upgrade to a deluxe suite which was fantastic. The room had two floors had the most incredibly comfy bed and even had two separate bathrooms. We then went out for the day. On return to the room we had been greeted with a complimentary bottle of Champaign in celebration of my partners birthday and the bed had two towel swans and rose petals on it.

The location was also great only being a short walk (around 5-7 minutes) from Moorgate station.

It was truly and amazing experience and we shall definitely be coming back in the future.",5,2019,09,18
128,"Exceeded expectations, very good value for the area","The entrance is just inside an access road, so a bit hard to find when you are tired and it is dark. But what a great hotel, excellent service, great value, and I got upgraded to a double deluxe. Shame I was only staying overnight, I would like to come back and stay longer. Very well located for my meeting in the Finsbury area.

I was carrying a lot of technical equipment as part of my trip (5 suitcases), the concierge service (George) handled this all for me, unloading it all in the evening, locking it away, and calling and loading a taxi whilst I checked out.",5,2019,09,16
128,Please Read Carefully Before Booking: Couples And Business,"1: The Doormen Were Fantastic. Very attentive, welcoming, professional and friendly.  Each one provided exceptional 5 star service from door opening, help with luggage.  
2: CHECK IN STARTED WELL: The customer service at the front desk had our reservation, was friendly. We arrived at around 7:39am and the room wasn’t ready.  They called to ask if an exception could be made but it wasn’t possible. We checked our bags with the hotel and were told we they would be brought to our room as soon as one was available. 
3: CHECK-IN didn’t end well. We were advised that unless we pre paid a breakfast package for the entire length of our stay we would have to pay the restaurant directly and it would cost more.  We didn’t buy the package.  Didn’t bother to eat the breakfast at all.  It seems the Chiswell dining room is not owned or managed by the hotel. We were not informed of this before the trip nor is the information posted or easily found (if posted) on their website. 
3:We gave the lady at the front desk our phone number to call when the room was ready.  We left the hotel at about 8:15am.  We returned twice between that time and 1:30pm.  The first time we returned we couldn’t even approach the front desk as the lineup for check-in was very long and only two people serving.  It is interesting to note that we observed the concierge and doormen trying to manage everybody and help because if the lack of people at the front desk.  
***After the first visit, we later returned at 1:30pm to be told by a gentleman who works the lobby floor that our luggage was in our room.  The line was again long and he proceeded to get our room keys.  The keys were not ready nor did we get a call that the room was ready. In fact, the lady who checked us in didn’t remember us and tried to do the check- in again. 
***It is understandable that the check in policy is 3pm. However, if a guest comes in early morning, even if the hotel is full- check out is 11am (assuming no one checks out earlier). Surely the reception can find a room by 1pm and also flag the guest and let them know the room is ready. That is FOUR STAR service. 
4: Unbeknownst to us and not advertised,  there are rooms situated in a location across a courtyard other than the main building. No lobby, no staff except housekeeping.  Therefore, we did not see the lobby nor ate anywhere in the hotel. No ambiance and we felt as if we were in a motel. 
5: THE ROOM IS NOT SOUNDPROOF. You hear every flush and every door opening and closing.  The bathroom isn’t very private/soundproof either. You also hear all the noise from the courtyard. There is a way to get to the location through the hotel but they roll your luggage outside and we hear them going back and forth frequently. Garbage trucks arrive early in the mornings.... Cigarette butts are everywhere near the door. The staff are always seen smoking or on their phones in the courtyard. We can also hear them from the room. 
6: NO DRAWERS or CLOSET SPACE. There are no drawers or enough closet space if you plan to have a stay for more than a night or even if two people occupy the room. Only one person can unpack and we walked over suitcases the whole week. 
7: COFFEE IS INSTANT. BEWARE the mini bar may not be full when you get there and they will assume you had what is missing. No one keeps track of it. 
8: NO HOT WATER, RUSTY FAUCETS and BATH PLUG that come off in your hand and were never fixed properly. 
**The beds are soft but comfortable-  however one day we didn’t have sheets! 
9: Very hard to communicate in English with most staff including the front desk as many do not speak English. It is a hotel in LONDON, ENGLAND. 
10:HORRIBLE CHECKOUT.  Everybody at the front desk didn’t speak fluent English. They refused to give an invoice, reconcile on paper any charges and/or confirmation for the deposit and refused to provide a copy of the actual Hotel bill as the room was Prepaid.  The manager was belligerent. HORRIBLE SERVICE. We had to literally walk out so not to miss our travel times.
***Again, the doormen and the people who worked the lobby were the most attentive. 

Short walk to the Moorgate Tube station. Bus stops close by. Not much to do around the hotel. There is a good pub/restaurant attached to the hotel.  
Good location for business travellers because of its proximity to the City of London but lengthy travel times and walking distances to most attractions as it’s not very central to most attractions. ",2,2019,09,14
128,Interesting Conversion,"The building is the old Whitbread Brewery and as such is not the usual corporate slab.
Greeted warmly at reception although there appeared to be a slight mix up on the booking which was quickly resolved. Our room was in the West Wing which did require a bit of walking and negotiating the lifts and stairs - a ball of string might be handy 
Room and ensuite were fine - complimentary tea coffee water fruit and a stocked mini bar, also slippers dressing gown and the usual cleaning equipment. Bed was higher then normal but very comfortable
Getting the air conditioning to work was a bit of a puzzle an instruction sheet would have saved some time.
We had a continental breakfast in the Chiswell St Dining Room and two things let the hotel down - Tea was served by the staff from large pots so one could not have a pot of tea to oneself and the 4 slice Dualit toaster was slow other than that breakfast was fine",4,2019,09,11
128,Very disappointing ,"I come 2-3 times to London every year and I must say this is my most disappointing experience. I stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago and it was ok. I chose it again for location perspective. The room is very small and absolutely sub-standard for a 5 star. Water pressure is non-existing in the shower, view facing a wall etc. I will not only not recommend but have it removed from my company list of hotels in London. I never ever pressed the non-disturb button and find my room undone when I come back after a day of meetings. Obviously unable to prove that. Last time for almost GBP 300.— a night. ",2,2019,09,04
128,Comfiest bed ever!,"Beautiful entrance and reception. Attentive staff and only waited 5-10 mins for check in. No up grade available and breakfast wasn't I cluded in the £130. No bar on site but one round the corner.doesnt feel like a hotel as you walk to another building with your luggage taken for you. Found the room rather small and basic and no view but the bed was the comfiest ever. Lack of plugs and can't turn all the lights off. Bathroom door is glass so you get light from the bathroom window which woke me early.
Bath was chipped in various places and the handle grip was loose. Apart from that a great night's sleep and very quiet.",4,2019,09,03
128,A birthday treat!,"We booked this hotel for an overnight stay following a theatre trip to London! 
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they all went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable, with added extra touches making my birthday special.
A beautiful room,with great amenities in a fabulous building close to the Barbican and Holborn station for easy travelling. 
Thank you!",5,2019,09,03
128,Delivered more than expected,"Beautiful building in a great location. Staff very welcoming and helpful, especially the Duty Manager Victoria, who went out of her way to make our stay very special for my wife's 50th birthday. We stayed just one night but wish it were more, we'll visit again.",5,2019,09,03
128,Anniversary Celebration - One to Remember!,I can't thank the staff at the Montcalm enough for such a wonderful time during our two night stay. The Hotel Manager Alice very kindly upgraded us to the WOW suite on account of myself and my partner celebrating our anniversary. The name of the room did not fail to live up to the hype with its glorious 4 poster bed and all the trimmings that came along with it. The friendliness of the staff and attention to detail made this a really memorable stay and one I will be sure to repeat whether I am returning to London for either Business or Pleasure.,5,2019,09,02
128,Room 250 - what the?!,"Peeling/blistering paint above the shower. 
The cosmetics mirror is installed upside down.
Lots of black mold in the shower tile grout. 
Beat-up moldings around the edges of the room. 
USB/5V charger doesn't work. 

I'm currently staying in this room for another 4 nights. I'm not sure how this hotel has the star-rating it has earned.",1,2019,09,01
128,Birthday Celebration,"I've been to the montcalm at the brewery several times, its always such a welcoming place to the minute you walk in, all the staff make you feel so special, the rooms are so amazing and really comfortable, have everything you need, nothing is too much trouble, big thank you to Alice Cubostrojeva and her team for making our birthday celebrations so special, cant wait to return",5,2019,09,01
128,Absolutely amazing,"Stayed here as a surprise for my partners birthday and we couldn’t have asked for more. We were given a free upgrade and lots of extra little touches including balloons in the room. All of the staff we met were great and we couldn’t have asked for a better stay. It really is all about the guests here and we can’t wait to stay again. Cleanliness was of the highest standard, the bed was comfortable and room had everything we needed and more. Thank you to all of the team for making it such a wonderful stay!",5,2019,08,27
128,Lovely hotel ,"Great location, lovely comfortable bed, very modern and clean with that touch of luxury for a special occasion. 5 minute walk to the train station. Staff very polite in and welcoming, we would definitely come back here. ",5,2019,08,26
128,Disappointed overall,"Check in was disappointing, took ages and the queue was massive. Yet there were plenty of free ppl wanting to take my case and show me to my room and give me a tour of it which was unnecessary.
The room was tiny, STANK of sewage from the bathroom which they had a number of plug in air freshners to try and hide. This resulted in a massive headache and still being able to smell sewage.
The bed was far far far too soft and gave me back ache.
Definitely not five star and the only good thing I have to say about it is the location is amazing. Really handy for the tube and barbican centre.
Won't be staying again. ",2,2019,08,21
128,Excellent stay,"My partner and I had a wonderful two night stay in this hotel I could not fault anything. The staff were all very polite and extremely helpful. Our room was a deluxe double. It felt a bit warm the first night but left the windows open next day to cool it down. It does have air con but that takes a while to cool. Bathroom had shower over the bath but a choice of ceiling rose or hand shower.  Elemis bathroom complimentaries included.  We saw a show at Barbican theatre which was literally round the corner. 25 minute walk to the tower. 15 minute walk to St. Pauls. Great location. Breakfast was buffet but loads of choice or you could ask for what you wanted if it wasn't there. Although breakfast wasn't very warm the second morning.  Tea and Coffee facilities in the room. We sat in the bar after the theatre and at least two of the cast came in for a drink. For us it was a great experience. 
A safe included in the room",5,2019,08,21
128,Best hotel in London for tourism,"I have been for 3 nights with my sister in a short trip to London. From the very beggining the romanian girls from reception welcome us with a smile on their faces, ready to help and very well trained as well. The room is gorgeous, clean, bathroom very clean and you have all the needs necessary: bathrobe, slipers, towels, hairdryer, minibar, fruits from the house, water, AC, TV. The breakfast is fresh always and delicious and the personal from there very polite and help you with any request you need. Location of the hotel is 2-5 minutes from Underground Morgate and it was easy for us to access all the main touristic points in London.  Yes, for sure we will return for short trips like those in this hotel. I recommended 100% without any doubts.",5,2019,08,20
128,Weekend away ,"Lovely welcome from the consierge.

Room looked nice but no shower gel for our first night but not a big deal.

The bed was extremely uncomfortable and upon inspection in the morning at least 12inches on one side was overhanging the base but it appeared level the other side. Mentioned to reception and the bed was rearranged. Still some overhang.

A reasonable hotel in a good location but would probably look for something else. ",3,2019,08,19
128,Disappointing Club Room Experience,"Stayed here as having an evening out in London.  Checking in was a real drama. We booked Club rooms through Hotels.com only to be told that we were not getting club rooms or access to the club lounge. Confusing.  After extensive messing around and delays we were eventually allocated 2 Montcalm Club rooms.  One was quite modern (102) and the other (101) was tired.  It didn't have a headboard and the bedding was stained. The Club room is pretty grim.  The entrance has torn carpets with lots of stains.  The Club lounge is quite frankly depressing.  Too many staff milling around and holding doors open while queues formed at reception.  I thought that a Montcalm Hotel would have delivered a better experience - but not this time. 
Average at best.  Such a shame as in a reasonable location and a great old building.",3,2019,08,19
128,Weekend In London,"Just returned from two nights in The Montcalm at the Brewery for my partners 30th. Very attentive staff at the front desk, can't comment on house keeping or restaurant as we didn't use either. Great location for us to get around on the tube from Moorgate station.
Downsides- Bathroom had some mould on the ceiling and we found the door to our room wasn't particularly soundproofed as you could hear others leaving/returning their rooms, which could disrupt your sleep",4,2019,08,18
128,Weekend Trip!,"Visited London for shopping, sightseeing and food! 

We decided to go to The Montcalm after seeing the pictures of the room online, although we initially thought we were booking a Superior Double room in the Barbican Rooms on arrival we were taken into The Brewery to a Club Double. Whilst this wasn’t disappointing it was a little confusing but we kept quiet as the room was lovely!

The hotel itself has a very luxurious feel to it and the staff are always smiling! The room was comfortable and cosy, we settled right in. The bathroom was sleek and modern but could be a bit cleaner! By all means it wasn’t filthy but there were marks here and there that made themselves aware the more you used it. One thing we loved about the hotel was the size of the bath, whilst it wasn’t huge it was quite spacious and managed to squeeze two of us.

There was a small problem shortly after arriving in the hotel, however the staff managed it professionally and were quick to solve my issue. So I shan’t complain any more! 

Overall a nice quick visit and we will definitely consider coming again on our next trip to the City of London. ",4,2019,08,18
128,Lack of soundproofing renders hotel pointless,"Booked a couple of nights here after seeing reviews about the good soundproofing of the rooms, hoping for a couple of nights of peace and quiet.  Unfortunately they failed to do anything about the old sash windows, meaning that the room suffered from an incredible amount of noise from the bar and music in the courtyard outside.  This was after moving from a room on the other side of the hotel which had the same issue meaning ridiculous noise levels from the road.

The only plus side were the staff who were very friendly - but it's not like they can do anything about the noise levels.  

Definitely not a 5 star hotel - maybe a five star lobby and staff, but the rooms were maybe a 3 star, and the soundproofing was a zero.",2,2019,08,17
128,Staff Are Great !,"Who ever recruits staff for this hotel, is getting it right - its staffed my very hospitable & kind staff mainly from Bulgaria & Romania; they always go the extra mile. Boris, unfortunately left but Plamen & the ladies who know work front of house & the club room carry on his tradidition. The Jagged Hare, the hotel bar - is a 'proper' pub which makes it a much nicer place to be than a bland hotel bar - upstairs is 5 star downstairs is interesting.",5,2019,08,16
128,Perfect,Came on a Wowcher deal and couldn’t have asked for more attentive service. Upon hearing it was our anniversary we were offered free drinks and petals on the bed which was perfect. Alexander on the concierge was particularly helpful and breakfast was lovely. Thank you so much!,5,2019,08,14
128,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel in London City is located about a 4 minute walk from Moorgate station. Upon entering the hotel, my husband and I were warmly greeted by reception and concierge. The hotel itself is quite quirky in its layout as it used to be a brewery. It was our first wedding anniversary and the staff kindly upgraded us to a suite which was absolutely lovely. The room was extremely clean, very spacious and the bed was super comfortable. It was quiet on the room and we had a peaceful night’s sleep. Breakfast was included in our stay and we opted for the full English, which was nice. We would definitely recommended the Montcalm hotel and would certainly return in the future. Thank you for making our stay here pleasant.",5,2019,08,12
128,Nice stay in London,"The hotel is located 6 min walk from Moorgate tube station (Northern Line) The staff is very courteous and friendly. My room 311 was very decent, nice bed and kept very  clean. The hotel is located in London City area therefore not too busy neighbourhood. I have nothing to complain about except that there is not much to do in the hotel itself or aroung given the area.  But would definitely recommend",4,2019,08,11
128,Lovely,"Lovely hotel, very welcoming and helpful staff. It was our pearl wedding anniversary so they very kindly upgraded our room and gave us a compliments bottle of wine.  Our room was absolutely lovely, with complimentary robes and slippers, plus a coffee machine. Great location. Had the best nights sleep ove had on ages. Good breakfast. I thought worth the 5* rating. ",5,2019,08,11
128,Business and pleasure ,"Wow! to the Wow Suite, such a beautiful room, so comfortable that when we returned after finishing work we couldn’t bare to leave it and ordered room service, delicious food from the Chiswell St dining rooms. The four poster bed was devine! ",5,2019,08,10
128,Best service ever,"Excellent service, good rooms, perfect location for business travel. Good value for money. Forgot personal items of sentimental value in the safe and concierges went out of their way to ensure I received them safely home - I do not live in the UK. Will be going back!",5,2019,08,10
128,Ideal for the Barbican,"Lovely clean tidy hotel, staff are friendly and helpful first hotel in this country in my experience, who offer take your cases to your room. My only fault with the hotel is the bacon offered for breakfast, just streaky bacon done to a crisp. My daughter who had stayed about two years back advised me before hand, said go somewhere else for breaky. The scrambled eggs cooked really well sausages looked nice, I never tried those as I am intolerant to gluten. Please find another supplier for bacon. except for that the hotel is perfect for Barbican so close to the Moorgate station too, just really short walk.",4,2019,08,08
128,Not the 5* experience expected.,"I wouldn’t normally write reviews but the phone call we took the day after our stay has inspired me to do so. The call from the hotel staff falsely accused myself and my husband of writing a negative TripAdvisor review.

We checked into the Montcalm at the weekend as we were seeing a show at the Barbican and the location of the hotel is ideal.

When we checked in we were taken out of the hotel and across the road to the suites - not something in my opinion that is clear enough when you book. 

The room was in need of some general repairs; tiles missing in the bathroom, light fittings that have slipped, marks on the walls, etc, not what you expect from a 5* hotel.

However, when the room upstairs showered, dirty water streamed through the ceiling waterfall shower head straight into our shower pan. Clearly this had been a problem for a significant period of time as we noticed the shower pan was stained from previous leaks when we first entered the room. There had also clearly been a number of attempted temporary fixes with mastic around the edge of the shower head. 

We complained and asked to be moved. The hotel’s response was not to apologise and accept that the problem was unacceptable but instead they chose to fob us off telling us just an hour later the problem had been fixed.  

We were eventually moved and the next morning on checking out we spoke to the manager. The manager was patronising, very quick to blame his staff rather than take any responsibility (surprising given I assume it can only have been a management decision to okay the room for use long after the fault had been reported) and he came across as disingenuous. 

On the positive side the location is perfect for the Barbican, the bed was very comfortable and the room quiet - unfortunately none of which make up for the hotel’s blasé approach to customer service and nothing short of a complete change in management could convince us to stay there again.",1,2019,08,07
128,Brilliant For The Barbican,"We booked this hotel for one night as part of a trip to London to see a concert at the Barbican Hall.
The hotel is situated in a quieter part of London (heart of the city). Located slap bang inbetween Barbican and Moorgate tube stations, making getting here very easy.
The hotel itself has a lovely reception area. It is the old brewery and yet has been modernised without losing some of that charm.
Our room was in the west wing. Lovely and spacious with good amenities. You will find an ironing board, coffee maker, mini bar (extra charge), free bottled water and free fruit bowl.
The bed was lovely and comfortable and guaranteed us a good night sleep.  The room was amazingly quiet. We could not believe we were in the centre of London on a Saturday night with a room two floors above a busy pub and yet we could not hear a thing. Honestly do not be put off, when you walk in your room it was like putting noise cancelling headphones on.
The location is spot on for the Barbican. I dont think I exaggerate when i say the Barbican main entrance is 150 metres away from the hotel, absolutely perfect.
All in all we had a really pleasant stay.  We have already said we would like to go back and spend a weekend doing a bit of sightseeing and staying at this hotel.
I would recommend it.",5,2019,08,06
128,Anniversary getaway,"We booked a night at the Montcalm to celebrate our wedding anniversary and from start to finish the Montcalm made our stay wonderful. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Wow suite (Wow doesn't do it justice), a complementary bottle of wine was provided and we were made to feel very special from start to finish. The staff couldn't have been more polite and helpful and I would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2019,08,06
128,"A brilliant, 5 star experience.","We had not stayed with Montcalm before and as we were attending a concert at The Barbican chose the hotel for its location, which was perfect. The staff were superb, from the moment we arrived by taxi to the time we left, they were excellent. Because of their friendliness and efficiency, we chose to eat at the Jugged Hare Gastro pub which was amazing. Both meals were just the right size, reasonably priced, and much better than we expected from a 'gastro pub' - The smoked haddock and cauliflower curry was incredibly tasty. We were upgraded on arrival, which of course helps, but did not detract from the service given by each and every member of staff. We will stay there again whenever we need a hotel in that area and will also now actively investigate other hotels in the Montcalm portfolio.",5,2019,08,06
128,"Lovely location, but not quite a 5 star hotel. We felt","Stayed here for the first time and was disappointed and will not return.. The hotel purports to be a 5 star establishment but does not quite reach those standards. Service was very uneven and staff seemed inexperienced and young (one of the concierges could not find the hotel on the map he gave me! Reception could not locate manager when requested, etc, etc) . The hotel  is in a great location but lacks the finesse of other hotels of this category. It was also very loud: there was a party in the courtyard when I stayed there and cheap thumping music all afternoon. There are better places to stay for this kind of money..",3,2019,08,06
128,Disco Until Midnight,"This is a good 5-star hotel in the City of London. Nothing really to write home about it, but quite correct in the amenities, price, space, service offered.
The circumstance which was quite unacceptable in this business location was the loud music played at ""The Brewery"", which is the adjacent property, until midnight. The porter Florin tried his best to relocate us in a different room, but by the time time we were considering an uncomfortable move, the music stopped.",3,2019,08,06
128,Birthday celebration,"Had such a wonderful stay last night.  The staff went out of their way to make it a great birthday celebration for my boyfriend.  From the upgrade to a suite to balloons, wine and a fruit basket in the room.  Delicious breakfast too.  Thanks Montcalm, you are 5*",5,2019,08,05
128,Very disappointing,"We stayed for one night due to the location, as we had tickets for a concert at the Barbican.

Arrived promptly at 2pm for check-in only to be told that our room wasn't ready for us. The receptionist asked if we could take a seat for 10 minutes while they finished cleaning. We sat for 50 minutes before having to remind the staff we were still here. Clearly they had forgotten about us. As we were only staying for one night, we wanted to make the most of the day, not sit around in a hotel reception.

The suites are located across the road from the main reception, so we carried our bags over there to yet another mini-reception area, before being taken to our room. We were located on the ground floor, opposite a fire exit next to the school. Our room was dark, due to having high, smaller windows. On opening the bathroom door, we were greeted by a mouse sitting in the middle of our bathroom. It disappeared into a hole behind the toilet. By this point we were rather fed-up of our brief Montcalm experience and complained. 

Their staff moved us to a smaller room on the third floor. It was brighter, but appeared quite dated inside. The bedding was stained, the mirror light in the bathroom was blinking and the rainfall shower dropped water in every direction apart from straight down.

For our troubles, we received a complimentary bottle of wine and a half-apology. We won't be back.",1,2019,08,05
128,Anniversary experience to remember,"Booked the hotel through booking.com.  The location suited and price for standard room was competitive.  I didn't expect much more than that.  Wow! is the first word that comes to mind, such a clean hotel with beautiful rooms.  The whole staff team were so welcoming and happy to go out of there way to make us feel comfortable, and really made our anniversary feel special with small treats on the way.  The hotel felt so comfortable, one off the days we decided to stay in the hotel rather than tour London.",5,2019,08,05
128,Great location,"Room was beautiful, staff was professional and knowledgeable... concierge coordinated a show including transportation. Rooftop bar was a lively scene! Room service was efficient and delicious.  Location was convenient to everything including Moorgate (underground).",5,2019,08,04
128,Stunning hotel,As I booked the hotel through wowcher wasnt sure what it would  be like. The hotel us stunning and the staff were superb. We visited with friends and our room was upgraded which was s great treat. Both rooms were fantastic. Found a lovely Mediterranean restaurant near by and plenty of places for a drink. We would highly recommend and would definitely return.,5,2019,08,04
128,A Flawless Experience!,"My husband and I stayed here for the 1st part of our Wedding Anniversary, the reason we chose this hotel was because we were attending an event at the Barbican. 

What an amazing experience from check in to check out!

On arrival we were greeted with the lovely staff in the lobby and checked straight in. We were delighted to have been offered a room upgrade from the one we had booked. When we were shown to our room we were greeted with a card, some chocolates and a fruit basket. We were also asked if we would like a glass of prosecco brought up to the room!
We had to leave for lunch so mentioned to reception not to worry about the Prosecco but on our return to a hotel they had left us a chilled bottle in our room!
We had some down time in our lovely room, which was spacious and well equipped with Elemis toiletries, Nespresso machine, iron and mini bar. 
We made use of the Club Lounge which was complimentary with our room before we went to our event at the Barbican. Here there was a good selection of drinks and food. 
Upon our return our room had been turned down and decorated which was a lovely touch.

This hotel may not have a fancy spa, bar or Michelin Star restaurant like some other London hotels but they really know how to make you feel special as a guest and that is something that money can't buy.

It was all the little touches and the amazing staff that really made the whole experience wonderful and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. 
We would 100% stay here again the next time we are in London!",5,2019,08,03
128,What a wonderful place to stay ,We stayed for one night as a treat for our anniversary. We couldn’t have stayed anywhere better. The room was amazing and the staff extremely drained my and helpful. We were given an upgraded room and lounge access with breakfast which was such a lovely treat. I would recommend to anyone and I will definitely be back. ,5,2019,08,03
128,One of the very best Hotels,"At my age you will have stayed in many hotels around the world and the Montcalm ranks as one of the best.

Attention to details is superb and the little touches that makes one feel at home are always a pleasure.

We will definitely be returning.",5,2019,08,02
128,Ms K Poxon,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a lovely gentleman at the entrance who escorted us to reception and assured us we were at the right place. We didn’t know what to expect as we had never heard of the hotel and booked late notice that day, circa 5pm. We stayed the night before at the London Hilton Park lane hotel and didn’t receive the same welcome at £600 per room. We were immediately welcomed by Vikesh, hotel manager who reviewed our booking, upgraded us to the wonderful deluxe suite, offered a welcoming drink and was extremely professional and friendly. We wished we stayed here the night before. The rooms, service, staff, restaurant, bar, cleanliness and quality of the decor, location is first class, we are so happy we found this hotel and no question will be staying here as first choice every time we visit London, it really is 5 star service.",5,2019,08,01
128,Flawless visit.,It not very often I use cliche adjectives or superlatives or in total honesty even review a hotel however this experience was extraordinary. Being fortunate enough to stay in the best hotels from the Armani Hotel in Dubai to the Four Seasons in Marrakesh this hotel stay was amongst the best. From the warmest of welcomes to the sincerest departures the hotel and staff went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. Regardless of the occasion my next London stay will be with the lovely people of The Montcalm Hotel At The Brewery. Thank you!,5,2019,07,31
128,Wonderful stay!,"I booked one night stay at the Montcalm to celebrate my partners birthday, we had such a lovely stay and it was all thanks to Alice (guest experience manager) she went above and beyond to make our stay extra special and we can not thank her enough!! The hotel is in a great location, and definitely has the wow factor as you walk in to the reception our room was decorated lovely with everything you needed and we had such a comfortable stay! We look forward to returning.
Thank you again Alice!",5,2019,07,29
128,The Best Trip,"The experience here was amazing. I felt like a king as soon as i walked into the doors and the staff were very helpful. It was my birthday and they arranged free champagne and decorations in the room which was super nice. I would recommend coming here, as I will be to in the near future.

Regards,
George",5,2019,07,28
128,Great comfort and good value in central London,"I stayed at this hotel during the recent London heat wave, for two nights, and I can attest to the excellent air conditioning in this 300 year old building. From the moment I checked in, the staff was lovely and attentive and warm and helpful. My room, 115, was well-appointed, clean and cool, and just above the reception by lift, and is outfitted for someone like me, who walks with a cane and is somewhat handicapped but very mobile, meaning I could take a shower without taking my life into my hands. I had a delicious dinner of hake and cold tomato soup for dinner with truly perfect cafe americano, before I walked across the street to London's Barbican Center, where I saw Jesus Christ Superstar with friends. I had more cafe americano at my full English breakfast, with salmon with capers and delicious cheeses and Greek yoghurt. Later I walked to the Moorgate tube line a few blocks away and returned home, the heat wave over. I will return to this hotel to dine when I go to another theater production at the Barbican.",5,2019,07,26
128,"Hotel Okay, Reception Staff Rude","I stayed in this hotel-week for work. The concierge carried my bag and told me where the nice restaurants were which was fantastic service.

Room was small but clean. Hotel itself is a maze - like falling down a rabbit hole.

Air con was loud and the previous customer had set an alarm for 4am on the room alarm clock which had not been turned off! This is something that should have been checked. 

At checkout when asked if I enjoyed my stay, I complained about the air con and 4am wake up call. The receptionist shrugged it off. She couldn’t have cared less.

In summary, concierge was great, hotel average at best, and customer service shocking.",2,2019,07,19
128,Great hotel,"This is a great hotel! And got everything you need for visiting London. Close to moorgate tube station, great staff from reception to housekeeping very clean and welcoming thank you!!! 
And see you next time",5,2019,07,15
128,Not 5 star - a poor cousin for the Montcalm brand,"Very little to recommend this hotel. Building faded and tatty , rooms small, rude and unhelpful staff, average restaurant. 

Just felt like we were an inconvenience rather than valued guests.  

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a 5 star hotel.",2,2019,07,11
128,Lovely hotel with a free upgrade,"Nothing not to like about our stay at the Montcalm Hotel recently.   A warm welcome, lovely spacious room with a HUGE bed and wonderfully comfortable duvet and pillows. We received a free upgrade which meant that we were on a B&B basis. Would recommend and would definitely stay again.",5,2019,07,08
128,Weekend in London,We stayed at this hotel over the weekend. From start to finish our stay was amazing. This was down to the professionalism of the staff and the Amazing Alice who made our stay so memorable. The hotel is in a great location just a short walk to St Paul’s. ,5,2019,07,08
128,Lovely stay with a free upgrade,"We booked this hotel to stay the night on Saturday and were very pleasantly surprised by a free upgrade, a complimentary breakfast in the hotel's club lounge and a bottle of prosecco - what a wonderful way to start a weekend in London!  The staff at the Montcalm were all very friendly, helpful and attentive to our needs and requests.  The hotel itself is very clean and with nice interiors, the room had absolutely everything we needed.",5,2019,07,07
128,Above and beyond ,"Amazing trip and looked after like royalty. The team couldn’t do enough for us. Surprise after surprise the who weekend. Free upgrade, complimentary Prosecco, complimentary breakfast, complimentary Club Lounge, complimentary fruit basket. We felt very lucky and would def stay again. The only thing the team could review is the carpet leading to the club lounge and a bit of dusting. Had a really good stay, I never sleep right through on the first night but such a comfy bed. Brilliant ",4,2019,07,06
128,First impressions equaled true disappointment; Shining stars helped guide the way back.,"First visual appearances of the Montcalm were lovely (the courtyard, entryway, lobby). First guest service impressions were not. We arrived a few hours before check-in with another couple, booked 2 adjacent rooms for vacation. Their room happened to be ready (and extremely ""cozy"" to the point the 4 of us could not comfortably fit in it at the same time), ours was not ready which was understandable due to the time. 

We went for an early lunch, then returned to front desk for room status. Front desk team told us to come back in an hour, but room still not ready. Told to come back in 1/2 hour, but room still not ready. At that 3rd conversation, it was after check-in so  wanting to unwind after a long journey we chose an available alternate room. Was fine until a few hours later when staff came to inform of a leak in the room directly under us & a call would come in the next few minutes to advise if we had to switch rooms. Call never came so off we went to enjoy our 1st night in London. Upon returning, we found a note advising that due to this maintenance issue we would have to switch rooms in the morning. We immediately spoke to night manager to switch rooms right then as we had plans in the morning. With no vacancy that night, we could not. We were also advised that if we absolutely required a shower, to make it a quick one. Not exactly a ""5-star"" comment. A call came around 10 the next morning advising a room was available. We re-packed & 2 apologetic managers helped us move into a well-earned, lovely, upgraded room. We had been in the hotel for 24 hours & had our room changed 3 times. Bad luck? Maybe but upsetting.

Aside from continually getting disoriented in the maze of staircases/hallways, we had an average stay. A few shining stars on the staff (Vlad the Head Concierge, Victoria a Day Manager, Room Service) were very courteous and did truly help turn things around after the accommodations debacle that greeted us on our first trip to London.",3,2019,07,04
128,Stunning hotel - perfect for romantic break,Absolutely stunning hotel. We had the nicest room topped off with complimentary Prosecco! The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a bit of luxury! The bed was super comfortable and the simple touches of complimentary fresh fruit and water in the room make all the difference.,5,2019,07,04
128,Weekend away,"Wow such a good experience at this lovely hotel. 
The staff are so very helpful and everything was perfect. 
The room was elegant and had such lovely finishing touches.
Thank you to all staff who made our weekend wonderful.
We will be back.",5,2019,07,01
128,Poor showing,"Booked 2 nights in Deluxe double room on Booking.com due to reviews it received.  To say we were disappointed would be an understatement.  The room was tiny, the bathroom was tiny and nothing like the pictures on the website.  There was only a queen sized bed in the room.  We left for a day of sightseeing around 1030 am and returned at 1830 to find the room had not been cleaned, the bins hadn't been emptied and the bed not made.   For a so called 5* hotel it was an appalling oversight.",1,2019,07,01
128,Amazing stay in a historic building,"Very attentive staff, fantastic room. After a long day exploring London there is nothing better than retiring to a super comfy room, a few drinks and watch some TV on a large screen tv just at the bottom of the bed. The fantastic building, 2 x restaurants and 2 x bars, we will be back. ",5,2019,07,01
128,Amazing hotel 🏨!!,"I have never wrote a review but just had to say how amazing this hotel was ! 
We were upgraded as it was my birthday to a club suite and also had free bottle of Prosecco sent to our room 
Staff were attentive and was just absolute pure luxury 
Will never stop anywhere else when we stay in London !
Truly amazing thankyou xx",5,2019,06,30
128,An amazing place ,"The history of this place in itself is reason to visit but the minute you walk through the doors, the staff cannot do enough to ensure you feel welcome. Vikash and his team stopped at nothing to make this ‘date night’ visit one we will never forget. Thank you Montcalm team for the special part you played in making a memory.",5,2019,06,30
128,Another Fantastic Stay,"Once again a fantastic stay.  All the staff were very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble.  Alice pulled out all the stop for my husband birthday stay fabulous suite. Thank you all 

The Sharps",5,2019,06,29
128,Birthday celebration,"We visited the montcalm brewery for my birthday celebration .
We were upgraded to a WOW suite which was fabulous . 
This is our sixth visit to the hotel special mention to Alice who always goes the extra mile champagne and chocolates in the room . Not forgetting Vlad the concierge who always remembers us .
Cant wait to return for our next celebration .",5,2019,06,26
128,Family weekend,"We had 2 nights stay in London to celebrate our son's 18th birghday. Must say all was just perfect! All hotel management is very helpful, specially Consignee Vlad. He is the best!
If you plan to stay at this hotel I suggest book club room. Then you have access to Club Lounge. There you can have light brekfest and also snacks and drinks all day long. Even some alcohol available who wants. Help to save lot of money... 
Overall very nice and luxurious hotel for good value of money.",5,2019,06,26
128,"Outstanding stay for our anniversary, 5* in every way","I travel around a lot and work at and visit 5* hotels regularly, therefore I am familiar with high standards, and this hotel met and exceeded all expectations I had with the high standards set by all members of staff. The reception team were fantastic, welcoming and couldn't do enough for you. I also had the pleasure of meeting the manager, who made everything run so smoothly for us and made sure we were taken care of. Our turn-down service was beautiful, house keeping are doing a fantastic job as our room was spotless! Overall our stay was perfect, will definitely be visiting again.",5,2019,06,25
128,Fabulous hotel where nothing is too much trouble,"This is my second visit and both times have been mirror-images of each other. Superb level of personal service from the staff who are both friendly and efficient. Located near the Barbican Centre this is a quiet area during the weekend with lots of places to walk to and visit without even needing the tube or a bus. The hotel itself was a former brewery and it's kept many of the original features. From arrival to check-out you were made to feel like a valued, individual customer. We'd booked a standard room but were very pleasantly surprised to find we'd been given an upgrade to a suite along with complimentary fruits and a breakfast. The room was immaculate and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. 

I'm big on fitness and there's a very well equipped gym which has been empty on both my visits (yay). It's not easy to find so I'm not going to spoil it for my next visit :)

Noise from outside is negligible, and I've not heard another guest from the other side of the walls in both visits which is a rare and lovely thing. I have PTSD and noise for me is a big deal as I perceive it in very different ways that amplify it.

Service is discrete, but highly efficient, and I'd unhesitatingly stay here again - and again. Without doubt the best hotel I've stayed in - anywhere in the UK.",5,2019,06,25
128,A perfect hotel experience!,"Our recent stay at The Montcalm was a fabulous experience from check-in through to departure.  The location suited us perfectly, having a much less frenetic feel than the West End but still easy to get around London from. The hotel itself has a great ambience and character. The service was friendly and attentive; little touches like the hand-written card welcoming us back to the hotel (I stayed the previous month for a corporate event) showed a great attention to detail. The bed was so incredibly comfortable we even took down the details of the pillows and duvet to try to source them for home! All-in-all, a perfect hotel experience; thanks to everyone at The Montcalm.",5,2019,06,24
128,Adequate stay,"Had a great sized room which was above the Jugged Hare pub. Only a tiny arched window in the room so felt very dark with not much natural light, my partner said he felt like he was in a bunker but as we were only using it as a base it wasn’t much of an issue, however the bathroom wasn’t great as the shower leaked all over the floor & as my partner is 6ft it was only a very small space with no head room. The bathroom floor tiles were loose & now we know why if the bathroom gets flooded.
Didn’t use any of the hotel facilities so can’t comment.
Check in was painless & the staff welcoming.
Good location for our visit to London meeting up with friends in the area, however, would we stay here again, probably not.
",4,2019,06,23
128,Best London Hotel I’ve Stayed In,"I’m not a prolific traveller, but I haves stayed in a number of London hotels, a all different price points. This was probably the best of them all, regardless of cost.
The room was spacious and had character to it, which you rarely get in central London. The quality of the fit out was exceptional. It was so quiet in the room and I had a great nights sleep.",5,2019,06,23
128,"Great Ambiance, fantastic staff","Excellent service from the Montcalm, stayed in one of the WOW suite, room was splendid, staff very welcoming and the hotel is ideally situated in the Barbican area. Will happily go back and can't recommend highly enough.",5,2019,06,23
128,5* Staff & Accommodation,"Visited the Montcalm London City for my girlfriends birthday. Stayed in an amazing suite, which was formerly the Club Lounge. The staff were truly fantastic and were invaluable in making our experience such a positive one. We were greeted by Alice, the Guest Experience Manager, who kindly showed us around and took her time to explain all off the features of our room, of which there were many.

Knowing that it was my partners birthday, there were balloons and a bottle of Prosecco on the house, as well as an invitation to the new Club Lounge, prior to our evening in the West End. It just made our time away even more special.

There really was a genuine warmth to Alice and her team, who can’t do enough for you. It really adds something to the experience and we hope to stay again in the near future.

The room was spacious and luxurious, with a sympathetic combination of modern fixtures and period charm.

Thank you to everyone at the Montcalm London City.",5,2019,06,23
128,Beautiful Hotel with fantastic customer service,What a wonderful hotel and experience! We had fantastic customer service from the booking process and right throughout our stay. We arrived to a lovely warm welcome and were told we had been upgraded to the Wow Suite! The suite was amazing and all the complimentary extras made us feel very special. Thank you very much to all the staff and we can't wait to stay again soon. Can't recommend highly enough.,5,2019,06,22
128,Fantastic hotel,"Excellent service from the Montcalm - they made our stay very special and nothing was too much trouble. We were in London for my birthday and they arranged reception drinks for us, chocolate and a card - very nice!",5,2019,06,22
128,Disappointin,"I was really looking forward to staying at the hotel as from the website it looked wonderful and had such great history, I was bitterly disappointed. Check in by Anastasia went well and having never stayed there before she explained where everything was, and there it ended in terms of staff! She rang the concierge to take me to my room, the guy wasn’t interested, so much so when he spotted what was a regular custoner , he left me and went to make sure the other person was looked after, he then came back didn’t speak showed me to my room and off he went. I was meeting friends in the bar as I was attending a function which was being held at the hotel, in the bar it was busy we were served well enough but the waiters serving drinks to the tables were just down right rude. Post function there was then no where to have a drink and of course we had to just use room service, so if I could get a drink via room service why couldn’t we have one in reception. We then get to breakfast, staying in a hotel like this I would expect to have breakfast served, oh no it was a buffet style they didn’t even take a tea order you had to help yourself with a tea bag and hot water came from hot water jugs, there were so many staff milling around in the restaurant that you couldn’t move, this is meant to be a 5 star hotel, I think not. My room had chips in the bathroom on the bathroom furniture, the tiles on the floor were cracked and the shower, if you were taller than about  5ft 7” you wouldn’t get under the shower! The furniture in the room was very tired looking and had seen better days. Overall a very disappointing stay.",3,2019,06,20
128,The bubble has burst,"I've stayed at this hotel on two previous occasions and I thought it was excellent. My recent visit was my first in two years and wow have things changed.  It took me 15 minutes to check-in as the lady on reception seemed new. This was followed by an additional wait for the concierge to show me to my room. He was a very friendly chap to be fair, but to have to wait around after a long day, was frustrating. In my bookings notes I clearly asked to be in a quite room, away from lifts etc. I was put on the 5th floor which is the highest I believe, but as you can see from my pictures, the window latch was broken, letting the noise of London in until the early hours. I wouldn't expect this from a budget hotel in London, let alone one that is branded as a luxury hotel.",2,2019,06,20
128,Upgraded my first 2* review to 4* due to excellent mgmt of issues and because it turned into a really nice stay.,"Stayed here 14-17th June. Booked on booking.com. Superior double with bathroom, street view and the size is specified too. Received room - 247 - with a hole in the carpet, wallpaper peeling and handprints on bed-headboard. Room not as advertised and not what you'd expect from a 5 star property. I was really unhappy.  I talked to reception, that evening, they were mortified and immediately put me in another room. Same class as the one I had been in - a double - 2x bigger window into street and huge bathroom with bathtub. Exactly as advertised on booking.com. I  spoke to the duty manager the next morning - which I recommend, she told me the room I had been in was now shut for refurbishment and that they would look into all my other feedback. The large room was wonderful, the bed very comfortable, good quality linens, excellent hairdryer quality, they welcome you with complimentary water and fresh fruit every day and also provide a mobile phone with a UK SIM for use in the city so you can avoid roaming costs. If you get the great rooms you would always give a 5 star review no question. room size especially was excellent. For me I had a lovely very personal experience chatting with the customer manager, the team did everything to address my concerns and were very engaging and so I upgrade my experience to 4 stars. If you book with the hotel they give you a discount if you book with booking.com I recommend you specify that you want a room with a bath etc etc to ensure you get what you expected. If you have issues reach out to customer relationship manager Alice and she will do everything in her power to make you happy. I got a great rate for my stay so overall I'd recommend it and I will be back proximity to Barbican Spitalfield market etc is great. Is the hotel on a par with other 5 star places I've stayed in worldwide? No but do they make an effort? Yes. And they care about their customers.",4,2019,06,17
128,Lovely stay!,"Such lovely, friendly staff!
Most comfortable bed i've ever been on in a London hotel!
Booked for my boyfriend's birthday and they brought up a bottle of wine and left some chocolates and decorations for him, such a thoughtful touch.
They also upgraded us to a club room and it was lovely

Have stayed here twice now and just cannot fault it",5,2019,06,17
128,Expensive for the quality ,"Stayed in a club room. For the price paid £300+/nite , it wasn’t worth it. The room is in need of an upgrade as there were paint peeling off the walls, hand prints on the walls, missing tiles in the bathroom, very dusty windows and carpets. 

Breakfast was good, staff was alright although sometimes they feel a bit cold. ",2,2019,06,17
128,NICE HOTEL BUT NEEDS TWEAKING,"Stayed for 2 nights on a trip to London to visit friends. Lovely hotel entrance and nice ambiance, we were upgreaded to a club room , without the club room amenities, and it was a nice room, bed very high and felt a bit seasick when partner turned, also not king size which I would expect from a room like this. Bath was good but screen ddid not save floor from, eccellent, showere! Worst thing was breakfast, quite appaling for a hotel of this class, charged £15 each for bacon which just looked dreadful, eggs were watery and lukewarm, even the tea was not brought steaming hot to the table, it weas a dispender flask and did not impress. Said to reception and cancelled the next days breakfast but, although husband ate only the continental and my full english was awful still charged £30. would not stay here again. The beer in the Jugged Hare, their own was very good",4,2019,06,12
128,Great stay,"Had a lovely stay. Great location for us. Lovely stylish boutique type hotel. Free upgrade to suite with complimentary breakfast. Professional, courteous and helpful staff. Will hopefully stay there again should I get the chance!",5,2019,06,11
128,Fabulous birthday stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm for one night when we were in London celebrating my birthday. The room was very nice, big and clean. Bed was really comfy too. Staff were lovely and made our stay very enjoyable. Thank you so much ",5,2019,06,09
128,Peep show,"This was a Friday night stay in the City. Room good and adjacent Jugged Hare pub fun. However, take care when selecting a room. A novel glass panel divided the bathroom from the bed, giving a glorious view of the bath and toilet. Not for the demure or faint hearted. I was impressed to find a modesty screen descended from the partition meaning one’s ablutions could be taken privately or with an audience depending upon inclination. The screen itself had hints of the peep show about it which may have been by design but made me guffaw nonetheless.",4,2019,06,08
128,OK stay,"I have stayed here due to attending an awards dinner at The Brewery. Check in was very slow, no real queue - i have stayed here previously and it is a regular issue, mainly the time it takes to check an individual in (eg receptionists taking calls when checking people in).

i was offered a free room upgrade, which was appreciated. The room itself was of an average size. Wardrobe had limited space, and very little space in the bathroom to put the contents of my washbag. The bathroom was also small - the door stop was in just where you step out of the bath/shower, resulting in a stubbed toe. When sat on the toilet my knees touched the wall in front of me. 

I could only locate one plug socket close to the desk, an issue these days given the various appliances one has when on business.

The room smelt strongly of air freshner - a personal preference, but not something I like.

The hotel provides concierge escort to your room, due to the hotel layout.

Sleep was comfortable. Breakfast was good food with reasonable choice.

As previously mentioned, I have stayed here a number of time previously, and the standard of rooms seems variable.",3,2019,06,07
128,5 Star,"We've been there a few times now and the staff are always friendly and efficient. The rooms are as you would expect, 5 star and the atmosphere is just chic. It's connected, quite literally to the Jugged Hare restaurant which serves great food. Not in the West End, which is good, but close enough with a cab or the tube.",5,2019,06,05
128,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at Montcalm at the Brewery for a long weekend, it was for a mixture of business and pleasure. We loved this hotel. The staff were attentive and friendly, the location was excellent just a short walk away from the Barbican tube. Lots of restaurants within easy walking distance. The rooms comfortable. Great little touches such as ‘travel buddy’ phone, umbrellas, dressing gowns, slippers. We would recommend it and will be staying again. ",5,2019,06,04
128,Superb stay,"We celebrated our 44th wedding anniversary at the Brewery and could not have been made to feel more special. Alice, the Guest Manager, was wonderful. We received an upgrade to a beautiful room. We are very fussy but the room did not disappoint. It was fabulous and spotlessly clean. Alice had organised Prosecco and chocolates for our celebration and when we returned to the room from a superb meal at the hotel’s bistro the Jugged Hare we found the bed had been decorated with rose petals in the shape of 44. To Alice and the other wonderful staff we met at reception, thank you so much for our most memorable stay. We can’t wait to return. ",5,2019,06,04
128,If Carlsberg did Hotels,This really was on a whole different level. The level of service is up there with the best. The staff could not have been friendlier.  They couldn't do enough for us. The room was stunning. The food was excellent and not at all expensive especially considering the hotel standard. Had the most amazing desert or pudding as the brits like to say. Honestly can't ask for better ,5,2019,06,04
128,Stunning Service and Amazing room!,"I work a lot in London and The Brewery is the hotel to stay at. The rooms are stunning and offer you everything you need but the main lure is the service. The whole team couldn't be more friendly and helpful and nothing is too much for them. It really sets them apart from other hotels and brands. 

Just a perfect hotel and experience.",5,2019,06,03
128,Another enjoyable visit to this great hotel,This is probably our 10th visit to Montcalm at The Brewery and we have enjoyed it every time. We won't hesitate to come back again. Our upgrade to a Club Room was much appreciated and the welcome was friendly and efficient as always.,5,2019,06,03
128,Warning you wont get what you booked,"The room (#325) was small and the bed even smaller. The ""double bed"" was not more than approximately150 cm! We also booked a double bed in a room with a ""street view"", but ended up in a room with no windows but some ""hatches"" that didn't even open. 
The AC did not cool down as it did not work (but it was noicy enough to give us no sleep). Also we left one of our keys to keep it running but this was taken away by the cleaning staff. We also asked for extra sheet so that we would not have to share the one in the small bed. This was also taken away every day (for three nights in a row). 
The overall rating comes to that not having what we booked (street view) and not having the posibility to sleep without noice from the AC destroyed most of the week end due to bad sleep.
We are not at all satisfied with this stay! and, we warn visitors that want to have a good night sleep after a nice day in London to stay in this hotel.",1,2019,06,02
128,Great hotel!,"The lovely welcome and ease of check in was great. The room was lovely, we even had a small “kitchen” area which was a bonus. Facilities in the room were fantastic. And the price was incredibly good considering prices of other hotels in the area on the same dates were higher even with less star rating. Would definitely come back again.",4,2019,06,02
128,Will stay in Montcalm hotels again,"After looking at hotels in the vicinity of Tate Britain and the City.   
I finally booked The Montcalm Brewery which has good reviews and very nice looking rooms.  
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and although our check in was fairly drawn out because of a family four all checking in individually using all 3 receptionists.  They were helpful and we even received an upgrade to a club room.    
The room was very smart / elegant and contained everything you may need.    We spend well over 125 nights a year in hotels so do understand what we want from a good hotel.     
Only the tv was a disappointment as 1&2 channels were ok as BBC1 and 2 but after that it jumped to 9 BBC 4 so we had no ITV or Channel 4 or 5 so hard to understand why.   
However everything else was excellent and we even visited the other Montcalm in the area to visit its rooftop restaurant & bar.   
Will use Montcalm hotels in future, very satisfied customer.  Could be a little Lower in rate maybe £150 rather than £180.",4,2019,06,02
128,Fantastic 5* hotel in the heart of London for a decent budget,"Great hotel, super comfortable, with friendly staff very accommodating. Connected to a pub (without the noise pollution from it), and within walking distance to 2 metro stations. In the heart of London, this is probably the best quality/price hotel I ever stayed in when in london.",5,2019,06,02
128,Nice hotel in City of London,"This hotel is in a two story brick building which from the outside is not that remarkable but they have gone to a lot of trouble to make the inside nice.  

Good reception, bar and restaurant.  

I was given a Club room which had everything you need.      A bit noisy from road traffic. 

Supper hot shower in the morning 

As per other reviews , it is next to the Barbican centre so great for that or exploring city part of london. 

",4,2019,05,31
128,Top Class Hotel,"We absolutely loved this hotel. You are treated very well from the moment you arrive until you leave, It was our anniversary and wife’s birthday and I asked if they could source a gluten free cake for us which was in the room as well as a nice bottle of wine. When we came back later there were nice towel art swans and rose petals on bed with chocolates. Lovely touches which were greatly appreciated. If there was one gripe it was that our room had a cleaners cupboard outside the door and it started rattling relatively early and people chatting outside the door, not the best after a late night. All in all though an excellent hotel.",5,2019,05,29
128,Beautiful hotel ,"We had booked a double room at the hotel as a celebration for our 20th wedding anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lovely staff, upgraded to a queen size suite, offered complimentary breakfast and given a bottle of fizz. Wow we were treated like royalty. This hotel is the best. Great staff and location. Will definitely be back.",5,2019,05,29
128,Lovely Trip,Great service from all the staff and they went above and beyond for a birthday. Check in was smooth and the room was very clean and nicely decorated. Would highly recommend as a location for visiting St Pauls.,5,2019,05,28
128,Can't fault the hotel or the staff,"Wonderful stay at this hotel. Can't fault the hotel or the staff. We stayed with our 1 year old daughter and can't recommend highly enough. The hotel is in a fantastic location, and the facilities are excellent.

The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for us. We will certainly return in the future.",5,2019,05,28
128,back again,We've stayed a number of times now - The Montcalm is a lovely hotel in a great location for us and the staff always really look after us so well.  Am looking forward to coming back on a regular basis!!,5,2019,05,26
128,A first class stay at a first class hotel,"We’ve stayed at this hotel many times. It is consistently first class. The location is amazingly convenient for anyone visiting London but also very peaceful and quiet. The rooms are spacious and beautifully furnished. The hotel is in a period building of real character, with lots of winding corridors and soft lighting. Above all, the service is impeccable: warm and welcoming, efficient and consistently helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who served us. 
In short, this is a first class hotel and extraordinary value for money. ",5,2019,05,26
128,3 star in 5 star wrapping,"This is not a bad hotel, but it is not a great hotel.  A great hotel is made by a number of little things that come together for big things: the greeting at the desk, the trip to the room, the room size and comfort, the friendliness of the staff, the availability of staff to help - a smiling staff...-all of these contribute to a 5 star.  And the Montcalm is just not there.  The check in was crazy because the front desk can’t make reservations - really?! As she stands there an tells me there are rooms available and reservations are not ready, I can’t have a room? Really?  As I show them the reservation I have, it is acknowledged, and they can’t give me a room because she can’t make reservations?  You should change your name to United Airlines!  Your policies are ridiculous.  Thanks goodness the manager intervened and figured it out, got me a drink and then got me a room - finally, 5 star service.  The room was ultra small and right in the street with a bath with half curtain - sad.  The pictures showed an Nespresso machine in every room - nope, coffee was instant.  It wasn’t bad, really, it was just my expectations were for a 5 star experience and they met them at a 3 star level... ",4,2019,05,26
128,Chelsea Flower  Show Visit,"We have stayed before at the Montcalm at the Brewery and selected this for our annual trip to the Chelsea Flower Show. We were asked on arrival if it was a special occasion and I mentioned it was my 60 th birthday  coming up so we’re delighted when we arrived back that we had been upgraded to a suite. The room was beautiful and we were offered a free drink so asked for a glass of Prosecco and were given a bottle!
The staff were lovely and so friendly, can highly recommend the hotel to anyone thinking of staying there.",5,2019,05,26
128,Amazing upgrade and complimentary everything!,"What a gorgeous place! We were upgraded to the best suite in the place and given free drinks, fruit and chocolates. The staff couldn’t do enough for us. Huge bed, two bathrooms and a mezzanine. We will be returning!",5,2019,05,24
128,Stayed here for work,"It’s an outstanding luxury hotel in the heart of North London. I especially enjoyed the fitness center, comfy beds, delicious hot and cold selections at breakfast and the beyond exceptional service staff! Some rooms are more specious than others but that is to be expected with an old European building. One cool feature is that the architects preserved the original ceiling of the old brewery in the second floor rooms only — you can see the exposed “wavy” bricks! My only gripe is that the ground floor rooms are very noisy even with the extra window pane added in the modernization process. (Well, you can see that the old window can’t shut properly.) Some rooms have some serious pub noise from the adjacent Jugged Hare restaurant. But that’s also part of the charm of being in London and a central location ... 
The rooms come with large bath tubs so if you need to chill in a long, hot bath, this is a great place for it. ",5,2019,05,23
128,I would return again and again,I love this hotel its cleanliness and helpful staff.  The guest experience lady Alice was fantastic... she made me have the weekend of a lifetime..... the setting is perfect. The rooms huge... love it. We have stayed here 3 times now and practically there is no where else in London that compares to the price and facilities and helpful staff.,5,2019,05,21
128,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff","I’ve just had my third stay here and overwhelmed by the treatment myself and my friend were given, especially from Alice and Nigel, they are amazing and made us feel very special and for me, as a returning guest, it was like coming back to stay with friends! This hotel is wonderful, All the staff are so lovely and friendly, the rooms are lovely and clean and the breakfast is one of the best I’ve had in a hotel. I cannot fault anything with this hotel or the staff and would recommend anyone to stay here, I will, again and again...... xx",5,2019,05,21
128,Very good and would stay again 8/10,"I would go here again but if I'm being really picky:
Reasons why I didn't give full 5 stars:
*There was loud talking outside the room at around midnight (sounded like porters) we were placed near lifts
*Leaking pipe/tap like sound which kept us from sleeping 
*Shower head/pipe minorly damaged but meant when used in different positions it would not work",4,2019,05,20
128,Amazing staff!,"I stayed here on Saturday with a friend who recommended the hotel and staff. A beautiful hotel and wow,I couldn't believe how lovely all the staff were. Especially Alice and Nigel. Thankyou so much for looking after myself and Theresa! I will definitely be recommending you myself! Hope to see you all again soon Abby x",5,2019,05,20
128,Exceptional Staff and THE Perfect Place to Stay,"From arriving at this 5 star hotel to checking out, we could not fault any part of the experience we received at The Montcalm.   Being met at the reception door by a perfectly dressed gentleman with a warm smile, we checked in and were asked if we were visiting for a special occasion.  Our room upgrade was greatly appreciated as was a chilled bottle of prosecco delivered to our room and certainly helped start our weekend of celebrations.   The room was clean, with crisp white bedlinen, a decent sized TV, a gadget to help guide us around the city if we needed it and everything you would need from a hotel for an overnight stay.  Alice goes above and beyond to ensure Montcalm at the Brewery guests feel exceptionally well looked after.   The reception team of staff clearly support Alice and each other very well and this comes across by making guests feel like royalty.   I have travelled extensively and I have to say that this is THE best hotel for guest attention to detail I have ever come across.",5,2019,05,20
128,Fantastic hotel in central London,"Our favorite hotel whenever we visit London. Based in the financial district, its quiet at the weekends but still with excellent transport links to see all the sights, although we normally walk! Lovely comfy rooms, with nice bedding and all the facilities you need, even a free mobile device to use for local calls and internet. Free WiFi is also available throughout. Staff are lovely and always look after us very well.  
Access to the club lounge is good if you wish it, with free cocktails and canapes in the evening, and a good continental breakfast included.  Overall a great place to stay if visiting the capital, we never stay anywhere else :)",5,2019,05,20
128,Great place to stay,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in, in London.
The staff are lovely, a really nice welcoming team and the hotel is of a high standard. 

The room is a decent size, in great condition, it was quiet, highly equipped, bed s and pillows really comfortable. My wifey was really pleased about the illuminated bathroom mirror too poor her makeup on with. 
There was a mini bar, coffee making facility, dry cleaning available, a gadget like an I phone too take with you a map. 
32 inch TV, great complimentary WiFi which was actually usable. 

I could go on, but it's a nice place, nearest tube station is barbican about 500 metres walk. 

So highly recommended! You won't be disappointed!",5,2019,05,19
128,Another Great Stay and exceptional welcome,"The hotel is absolutely perfect for those who are working at the University of London's business school you simply stroll across the road and you’re there. It’s a also a perfect location for the Cities financial district and a stones throw from the Barbican and Shoreditch.
However, why we return to the hotel four to five times a year is because of the genuinely warm welcome we receive from Alice who is front of house. All customers like to be treated like friends particularly when you visit as often as we do, it inspires loyalty to the brand. Alice always ensures a special meet and greet which is legendary and looks after us during our stay. Whether you’re a business customer or tourist this engagement is vital. Professional, efficient and genuine.

The rooms in the hotel are clean, housekeeping excellent and the Jugged Hare pub attached to the hotel is one of our favourites in London. Staff are all very good and a quick phone call will remedy any issues. We particularly love the ambience of the club lounge. It’s a really nice touch and benefits range from complimentary breakfast, special canapés, spirits, wine, beer and soft drinks are available from 17:00 until 20:00 and teas and coffees are available throughout the day.
The perfect combination of conviviality and calm. This isn’t the most expensive five star in London but for value and service it delivers every time.",5,2019,05,18
128,All good.,"I am just back from a business trip in London. I was in this hotel which is very elegant, especially the entrance. I enjoyed the club lounge breakfast and the position, very close to my office in London. At 4 minutes walking from Moorgate metro station and 10 minutes from Liverpool street. Even the room was fine, with all the comforts, especially the handy initiative (they provide you a smartphone for free to get out visiting the city)
In the end it was a positive experience.",4,2019,05,18
128,Exceptional generosity and service ,"We have stayed at this hotel twice in the past month, while visiting our daughter, but also celebrating a big birthday and a significant anniversary! On both occasions we were treated with unusual generosity and kindness. The hotel itself has a lovely ambience, elegant but welcoming. The room was spotless with thoughtful extras like fruit and magazines, and complementary drinks. The bathroom was probably the best designed of any hotel bathroom that I have experienced. We breakfasted in the peaceful club lounge with high ceiling and beautiful chandelier, and the ingredients were of fine quality.
However, what made the stay special for us was the competence and warmth of all the staff, the doormen, the receptionists, the concierge staff, the room service team, the waiting staff and the customer service manager Alice, who, without exception, made us feel that it was important to them that we enjoyed our stay. Amazing! We will always remember our visits as a wonderful experience and hope to return. Thank you. ",5,2019,05,18
128,Very disappointing,"I went to this hotel on recommendation of an international investment bank and paid more than 300 EUR for a room.
The experience was very disappointing. Although we reserved well in advance, they gave me a very small room with view on a wall in an annex building. It was a 3star-room, which you usually get for 100 EUR. In addition, the shower did not work properly and it was very noisy as some outside machines were working all night.. Although I asked the reception, if this is really a ""superior double room"", I did not get anything better.",1,2019,05,15
128,Must Stay Hotel,"There are so many positives about my experience that it's hard to pick just a couple.  The service it to die for, everything is spic and span, food is great, location to the financial district cannot be beat.  I faced a major street and NO road noise.  I'm looking forward to staying here again on my next business trip to London.",5,2019,05,13
128,My regular visit,"I have been staying at the Montcalm regularly now for 4 years and the hospitality of the staff is always of the highest standard. I’m always treated impeccably, with a willingness to assist no matter what the request.

My Simon Ings",5,2019,05,11
128,Amazing!,"Absolutely loved it here, as we were celebrating our anniversary the staff went out of their way to ensure that we had the most pleasant stay and I can definitely say I will be coming back! Our suite was clean and amazing throughout and got amazing surprises each time we got back to our hotel- also bed was comfy didn’t want to get out",5,2019,05,09
128,"Without a doubt, when in London, you MUST stay here!!","Amazing and very, VERY friendly place, would certainly recommend, and defiantly stay again here! 
From Alice on reception, and all the staff, very attentive, happy, smiley, and nothing to much trouble.
Location 2 mins from Barbican tube",5,2019,05,09
128,"Beautiful Hotel, Brilliant Staff, 5*?","We stayed The Brewery over the weekend. There were plenty of highlights from the stay, from being price matched when I booked directly, the genuinely brilliant reception/concierge staff, lovely looking room (at first glance) and beautiful club lounge.

Given this hotel is listed as 5*, I'm being more overly critical than I would have been had it been listed as a 4*. The bed has a very soft mattress with the odd experience for a luxury hotel of a mattress topper. Unusual!

The retractable screen in the bathroom was also faulty and would only go down 80% of the way. Thank god we're married!

Finally, just a few small little things you wouldn't expect from a luxury hotel, like a missing dial above the bath and a few imperfections here and there.

Like I said, being super critical given it's a 5* hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay again if given the chance.",4,2019,05,09
128,Excellent customer service!,"We had a very special and memorable stay at the Montcalm. Ahead of the arrival I informed them that it was our wedding anniversary weekend and I was also running London marathon. They congratulated us on arrival and had a lovely handwritten note in the room with a small box of chocolates and also received a complimentary bottle of wine. The staff was very friendly, we had a nice chat with Alice , who was lovely and they really made us feel very welcome. The room was quiet and we ordered in room breakfast on one of the mornings , it was a set continental breakfast, it was huge!

The bed was a bit too soft for our liking and the telephone in the room didn't work. We informed the reception of this but it didn't get sorted. Shower in the bathroom was not the most suitable for tall people as it was in the bath and there wasn't much space but these things were far outweighed by the general experience.

It's a great hotel in an old interesting building, walking distance from St Paul's and lots of opportunities to dine and have a drink, highly recommended!",5,2019,05,08
128,Business travel,"Great hotel for business travel being only minutes away from many places of work.
The staff are very attentive. The room very spacious. 
One of my bug bares with a lot of hotels there is no decent mirror to use for applying make up, well done Montcalm you do supply a well placed perfect mirror for this purpose.
One of my other big bares is a proper shower, rainfall showers are all very lovely but you don’t feel like you’ve had a shower, they certainly don’t wash away a busy day.very modern and I’m sure they may save water but....
I have one thing -  Caesar salad, romaine or little gem lettuce, anchovy’s, crispy bacon, croutons, Parmesan shavings and Caeser dressing, with chicken. 
I had the lettuce, croutons, chicken, grated cheddar cheese, egg and mayonnaise.",4,2019,05,08
128,Disappointing experience,"My experience at the Montcalm the Brewery was quite disappointing. While the reception desk and the concierges are very friendly, I was negatively surprised by the general state of the hotel. The room needs to be repainted and the carpet close to the main elevator had a very unpleasant smell. In addition, throughout my entire 5 day stay I had recurrent issues with my hotel room keycard, which the reception seemed to not be able to resolve. The keycard didn’t work for the room in which breakfast was served either. Every single day I had to pass by reception and a concierge had to come with me and open the door. It seemed that some of the other guests had the same issue, while others didn’t encounter this problem. Overall, I don’t think that I would book this hotel again.",3,2019,05,08
128,Another Fantastic Stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm last April for my wife’s birthday and had a such a great time, she wanted to stay again this year too.. We have stayed 4 times now and every time the experience just gets better, this time Alice was an amazing host, very attentive and friendly, made us feel very special, remembered us from the previous stay which is alway very nice.. We ate and enjoyed birthday drinks at the Jugged Hare, again a superb range of drinks, excellent service and delicious food.. We were also looked after Nigel, he was very keen to make sure we enjoyed our stay, going the extra mile to help us.. We saw Alice again on our last day and she was as wonderful in our departure and she was our arrival, she’s a fantastic member of the team and a real asset.. Thank you for our stay Alice and thank you for your help Nigel, we will see you again soon.. My favourite place to stay in London!! ",5,2019,05,07
128,Weekend break,"What a great hotel, from the moment we arrived sewer looked after, the staff in the hotel were excellent. We were upgraded to a split level suite with a nice bottle of wine as we were celebrating my wife’s birthday. The hotel has an added attraction of having its own pub attached to it. The jugged hare is a comfortable and trendy pub with an attractive restaurant. Although I never ate there I spoke to people who did, they loved the food!
Although only a short break I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it. Great decor, friendly and a great area of the city to stayin.",5,2019,05,07
128,City of London Evening,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this brilliant hotel!  From the moment we arrived   everyone was very welcoming and went out of their way to make our stay very special.  A big thank you for upgrading our room to a suite, which was fabulous!  We enjoyed a lovely breakfast in the beautifully decorated club lounge.  The hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance of Liverpool Street Station.  Looking forward to staying here again, thank you for spoiling us!",5,2019,05,07
128,An amazing hotel with fantastic staff,"I stayed at the hotel last week for an awards ceremony being held on the premises.

The room was fantastic - huge and really well fitted out.  It had absolutely everything you could possibly need and was genuinely luxurious.

Every member of staff was incredibly attentive, friendly and helpful.  

Will definitely stay there again.",5,2019,05,07
128,Superb!,"I absolutely love this hotel, they always go out there way to look after me and make me feel welcome, and as for the manager Alice, she is a wonderful person always caters to my needs and always makes my stay very pleasant.",5,2019,05,06
128,Great stay,Luxury hotel with excellent customer service. Beautiful rooms with large comfy beds. Great hotel all round. Very clean and welcoming. We stayed for leisure reasons. Everything is local to the hotel. Would of loved to have parking but there are car parks nearby.,5,2019,05,05
128,30th Birthday Treat,"Another superb stay. 3nights 26th- 29th April. Room 228 wow suite. Welcomed with bottle of champagne and strawberry in the room. Perfect room as always. We used the spa at the sister hotel again lovely treat to start a relaxing 3night stay. Deepak and Alice always goes the extra mile to make our stay so special and everytime it has been- truely an asset to the company- many thanks to you both.
Breakfast each morning- buffet help yourself or ask for something to be made for you, all staff are willing to help.
Club lounge- was nice to chill have a few drinks and snacks.
Decor of hotel is lovely to take a few pictures. 
House keeping everyday and a turn down service in the evening so you will always have clean/ fresh towels.",5,2019,05,02
128,Derrick,"The Montcalm is a great hotel. Service is exceptional. The room is well resourced, clean and very comfortable. Great facilities. And a convenient location. I could not fault the quality of the hotel and the exceptional quality of customer service. Very much good value for money. I would recommend the hotel to anyone without reservation. I would definitely stay at the hotel again.",5,2019,04,29
128,Outstanding,"I recently spent 4 nights at this hotel and loved everything about my stay. My room was spacious, spotlessly clean, loved the Elemis toiletries and had everything I needed and more. It's location is superb and it's worth pointing out that the neighbourhood (as far as I was concerned) was very safe for a single woman to wander about in. The hotel has so many fabulous points I will have to list them but what really stands out for me is the service. I have NEVER enjoyed such exceptional hospitality in any other hotel (and I don't say that lightly) it really is a joy to experience. From being greeted by name by the hotel manager, to the hugely helpful concierge staff, to ordering a coffee to the room and it arriving piping hot within the minute, everything about this hotel is first class. It has a characterful proper pub on site and i felt perfectly comfortable sitting having a drink on my own just taking in the surrounding street and atmosphere. (This is not something I would usually do) I ordered breakfast and one evening meal at the hotel and both were delicious. One evening I had a dress collected from my room, dry cleaned and returned to me within half an hour. That's pretty amazing. I'm already looking for an excuse to return. It's going to be my special treat every now and again.",5,2019,04,29
128,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel. Stayed in Club room which gives access to Club Lounge (includes drinks, snacks, breakfast & papers). Taken to room. Comfortable bed. Nespresso machine and kettle. Dressing gowns, good quality slippers. Nice toiletries. 

There were four small negatives (I mention as so easy to put right). Check in was very slow, one room key did not work, magnifying mirror in bathroom was fixed too low down and although late check in had been agreed, housekeeping knocked on door at standard check out time.

Apart from those small issues, we enjoyed our brief stay and hope to get the opportunity to return.",5,2019,04,29
128,Excellent All Round,"Big room with proper big bath & excellent service particularly from the Bulgarian staff in the club room.

Boris, is the embodiment of professionalism even when having to deal with rowdy guests .

10 out of 10 - food in the Jugged Hare, part of the hotel is good but not cheap neither is the wine there . 
But again excellent service.",5,2019,04,29
128,Best Hotel in London,"From the check in, to the room, what a brilliant team and what a brilliant hotel. Was upgraded to the Barbican suite and was not disappointed.  The bed was comfortable and the room was phenomenal over the two floors. I look forward to returning to London and will defo be staying here.

Thank you for the balloons and 30th decorations as well :)",5,2019,04,29
128,First and last ever visit to a Montcalm - 4 star at best ,"We stayed here on business for a conference at the Brewery. 

Confusion started at check when asked about about club room and what this entitled. 

The club room itself whilst a wonderful room is full of contradictions. Reasonable level of drinks - poor choice of snacks. ‘Chef’s special canapés’ are simply sandwiches - and not good at that. Breakfast options very limited. The club room as a whole is miles behind the 4 star Crowne Plaza. 

Issues with the room key technology. Twice we returned to reception to have the card reset after reaching our room with little apology and met mainly with indifference. 

Our room on the second floor was shabby. Scuffed and torn wallpaper, frayed carpet edges, thin/poor quality towels, broken chair (which was replaced when reported to reception) and poorly fitting windows. We’ve had a better fit out at the holiday inn express. 

It’s in a good location. At a push this is a 4 star hotel. It is not luxury as described on the website. Far from it! It doesn’t deserve its 5 stars that for sure. As others have commented, it’s a good price for a 5 star hotel but there are very good reasons why. ",3,2019,04,28
128,Another fantastic stay at a great hotel,This was the third time we have stayed at the Montcalm.  It is an affordable hotel that offers true 5 star luxury.  The staff are attentive and the facilities are first class. You will pay much more for similar hotels in London.  We will come back again.,5,2019,04,28
128,This is NO 5-star establishment!!!!!,"I am staying here 6 nights on a business school conference. I travel a lot so I have stayed in many many hotels all over the world and this is the first time that I am writing a TripAdvisor review.

Night 1: I was booked into room 012. Outside my window is a huge very loud machine that looks like a central air controlling system of some sort! It makes a humming noise the entire time, I hardly slept!!!
It’s ridiculous that they book guests into this part of the hotel!!! They should use these rooms for storage and the like! I have asked to be moved. I will provide feedback on the new room once they have moved me.

This morning I asked for an international adapter as I need to do some work on my laptop and my adapter is not working. They one have ONE (literally ONE) EU/UK adapter!!! NONE for the USA or any other country!!!! That’s insane considering that this is a hotel in a business area! Definitely not 5 star! My colleague that is staying at a 3/4 star Holiday Inn express managed to get one from her hotel.

Also, there is a very foul smell in some of the passage ways.

I will be back with further reviews as the week progresses.",1,2019,04,28
128,Lovely hotel and the best team ever!,"We visited London during April and had the pleasure to stay at The Montcalm hotel at The Brewery. We were there for 6 nights and all I can say is that we loooved everything about our accommodation. From our room, to the location of the hotel (very good location, walking distance to British Museum for example, but a very quite area) and most importantly to the personnel (everybody was so nice and helpful and we really appreciated this, especially as we were traveling with our 1 and a half year old baby). All in all, it was more than we expected to find there.",5,2019,04,27
128,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff","This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and it certainly won’t be the last. 
The staff are all so attentive from the moment you arrive at the entrance to the moment you leave. 
Alice and Nigel were particularly amazing. We remembered Alice from last year so it was lovely to see her again and both her and Nigel were an absolute joy! They looked after us so well. 
The little garden opposite and the pub are a lovely addition to the hotels’ facilities and we thoroughly enjoyed spending the afternoon in the sun, sat in the garden. 
I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London for a visit. 
Jon and Theresa (East Sussex)",5,2019,04,25
128,Mr Patrick Skerrett,"I had the most amazing stay here in London, and it was made extra special by being given a free upgrade and free bottle of Prosecco by the guest manager Alice! Her hospitality skills were impeccable! I will definitely be returning and thankful for the amazing stay!",5,2019,04,24
128,Mrs Warriner,"This was my first visit to the Montcalm Brewary & I have to say it won't be my last! After along train journey the staff were fantastic & couldn't be more welcoming & accommodating. They go over & above to make sure your stay is enjoyable.  The room was spacious, well lit & absolutely immaculate. The bed was so comfortable. Needless to say I will definately be booking this hotel again on my next visit to London. 5 stars all round.",5,2019,04,23
128,Fantastic stay.,"First time at this hotel and I was upgraded
to a suite when I arrived. All staff from
receptionist over doormen to girls in
lounge and the older lady at evening
check who gave me a handful of
choclates - and every time I left or entered
the hotel - there where smiles and hello’es
from every staff.
My strongest recomandation.

",5,2019,04,23
128,Absolutely Fabulous,"For the money, there is no better hotel in London.A five star experience, for not much more than the cost of a Premier Inn.
Great attention to detail and help from staff, fantastic club lounge, and great at making our young daughter feel welcome.
We wouldn't stay anywhere else in london",5,2019,04,23
128,Top notch hotel,"Well received and cared for by the friendly and professional staff at The Montcalm at the Brewery, London.  I cannot honestly find many faults with this hotel. The rooms; dining areas, corridors and kitchen cutlery  were exuding high standards of hygiene and cleanliness. There is sufficient lighting in all areas of the hotel.  We had a lovely sleep on the comfortable huge bed. Our overall customer care and experience was excellent.  The price was just right and I believe it was value for money. Only minor dent was that we could not watch  TV as the instruction kept saying we press “menu” which we did but could not take us anywhere to the channels.  We were not desperate for TV anywhere so we quickly gave up. I would encourage anyone to book this hotel when visiting London.",5,2019,04,22
128,Best place to stay in London,"The rooms are neat and well done, the service is 5 star and the staff are the best!  Always going out their way to make your stay comfortable.  Please try the newly redone rooms.  They are large and spacious, well lit and with great bathrooms and dressing area.  Simply lavish.",5,2019,04,19
128,Birthday treat,I had an absolutely amazing birthday at the Montcalm Brewery Hotel. The staff were friendly the service fantastic. They made such an effort to make me and my daughter welcome. I felt thoroughly spoilt. Thank you so much! I would definitely highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,04,17
128,Amazing Service - last minute change of plans for hen weekend,"Alice Cubostrojeva and her team were the most impeccable hosts when I visited as part of a hen weekend on 30 March 2019.  We had last minute problems at the venue we were going to stay at and managed to find availability at The Montcalm.  The staff were so welcoming and pleased at our arrival.  They upgraded my niece (the bride to be!) without hesitation and kindly gave us some Prosecco as part of our stay.  They were highly attentive despite our various and many requirement and showed a genuine interest in our trip.  The facilities were excellent too.  I would highly recommend a visit to this team and hotel - I intend to make this my hotel of choice on any future trip to London.  Well done, Alice!",5,2019,04,16
128,Husband’s 40th Birthday,"I can not recommend this hotel or this chain of hotels enough. We booked a standard double for one night for my husband’s 40th birthday. I sent a not explaining this and requesting any special treatment and upon arrival was upgraded to a suite free of charge. Concierge showed us to our room and offered us complimentary prosecco and a fruit basket.

The hotel was located in the heart of the Barbican and within walking distance of St Pauls.

The service was second to none and i will definitely be coming back.

Thank you

",5,2019,04,14
128,Nice ambience but a few hitches,"The hotel has a classy British ambience. The staff was really very friendly and attentive. The breakfast was lovely and plentiful and the service in the restaurant great. The nagatives: my check-in took some 45 (if not more) minutes - there was some confusion regarding my booking and after a tiring flight ar about 1:00 a.m. in the night I had to wait a really long time until the lady at the reception finally checked me in. And still even after that she was not able to find out the correct price for my stay and issued a document/confirmation with a wrong name of another guest on it. Given that the hotel is not cheap and has 5 stars I would expect much more flexible and effective approach. As regards the room: my room was really very dark. It did not have any proper window, just something similiar to a window located almost at the bottom of the wall and the artificial lights were not sufficient. I did not mind this that much though as I was travelling for business and did not stay much in the room.",3,2019,04,14
128,A gem in the heart of the city,Stayed here for our anniversary for two nights. Met with a complimentary bottle of wine and a lovely large room. The bed was really comfy and the room had everything you would need. Staff were wonderful and helpful. Would stay again!,5,2019,04,13
128,"Great Location , beautiful building","Stayed for business event and various meetings in area - ideally situated for that but also for looking around the heart of the city . Clean , well maintained , really friendly and helpful staff  - rooms are good but not huge . Facilities for the function I attended were superb .lots of good and varied pubs and restaurants within easy walking distance , for the location is not expensive  - only slight downside was noise coming from courtyard at night",4,2019,04,12
128,Consistently Excellent,"Having stayed at this hotel many times over recent years I can thoroughly recommend it. The staff are exceptional, always friendly, polite and helpful.  The rooms are great, particularly the club rooms and room service is always prompt and good quality.  Adjoining bars and restaurants all very good.  
Location is excellent for the city and beyond. ",5,2019,04,11
128,Outstanding visit to this beautiful hotel,"Myself and 3 friends had a weekend in London and had the pleasure to stay at this fabulous hotel.

We were travelling for one of my friends special birthdays and I emailed the hotel ahead to see if we could pay for any extras in the room to make it more special, ie balloons, wine etc.... Alice was straight on the ball and continued to email me on the run up to our stay with a few questions. 

When we arrived we were actually greeted by Alice and another of her colleagues who escorted us up to our rooms with our luggage, they had upgraded us which was such a lovely touch. 

As we made it into one of the rooms I could see that they had decorated the suite with balloons, banners,, there was a bottle of bubbles chilling and they had even written a birthday card. No bill was presented this was all purely customer experience and it was customer experience at its best.

Alice was there when we left also and she made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay.

As a group we have all stayed in many hotels, some standard, others luxury and we all agreed that this was by far the best customer experience we had ever received.

Personal touches, attention to detail and fabulous staff, all the personnel we spoke to were outstanding. I can’t wait to go back, the location is perfect just 2 stops from kings cross.

The rooms were immaculate, really comfortable beds, a turndown service was offered, all in all a really lovely treat. 

Well done Alice and team for a remarkable stay and Thank you once again we will definitely remember you!. Xx",5,2019,04,11
128,Fantastic Stay,"I booked to stay at the Hotel for my partners birthday and the staff And hotel itself really exceeded my expectations. 

I had contacted the hotel before our stay to let them know of the special occasion and on arrival we was informed that we had been upgraded to a suite and the staff had decorated the room for the birthday!

Service was exceptional, the room perfect and in an ideal location. 

Fantastic hotel.",5,2019,04,10
128,Warm and very welcoming,"We have stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery twice now, and both stays have been excellent.  It is the staff that make this hotel special, but also the location.  It is a quiet part of such a busy city and yet only a short walk to sights.  There are lots of restaurants near by and the Barbican theatre is directly opposite.",5,2019,04,08
128,London Trip,"I can’t praise this hotel highly enough the staff were amazing and made us so welcome the hotel was very luxurious and was amazed at the value for money
I wouldn’t hesitate to use this excellent hotel again",5,2019,04,08
128,Fair priced hotel lacking that personal touch,"Late night Reception do not exactly greet you with open arms. Lack a bit of personality and very slow upon check in. 
Said we had a room with a bath..then didn’t.
Had a key problem that twice wasn’t sorted and never was so had to go to reception each time to get us in.
Room fine but they charge you for everything, no personal touches but fair price for London",3,2019,04,07
128,Excellent Service,"Booked the room for my husbands birthday. When we arrived we were waited on and always asked if there was anything we wanted or needed help with. All staff were friendly, polite and well mannered. 
The room was decorated with balloons and a welcome gift of chocolates and a card for my husbands birthday. They really went the extra mile to make our stay special.
The room was lovely, with a nice view of the Barbican centre. The bathroom was very unique, being able to watch TV while showering is a novelty. 😁 
The mini bar was reasonably priced, and breakfast in the room next morning was definitely worth the price. 
Housekeeping restocked our coffee/sugar etc when asked and also having the free turndown service was new for us too. 
Our only regret was not being able to stay for more than one night. 

Can’t recommend The Brewery enough. Will hopefully stay again in the future.",5,2019,04,07
128,Superb service and good location hotel,"We were greeted on arrival by Yulian who took our luggage to reception followed by Dilyara checking us in, she was extremely professional and very helpful. 

Our Head Concierge, Vlad was again polite and provided information on the history of the hotel and recommended some places to go.

The room was not the biggest in particular the bed however the room was clean and layout lovely. We did check if they had a room with a bigger bed and were lucky that a cancellation had arisen and Alice was able to locate us a different room. 

Within minutes Demitrix was at the door to show us our new room. 

I cannot fault this hotel. The staff are an asset to The Montcalm and this is what has made our stay so much more relaxing and enjoyable.

Thank you.

128,"Great stay, upgraded on my birthday",Always been a fan of the Montcalm group but was my  first time visiting the   brewery. Beautiful classic setting off a quiet courtyard in the middle of the city furnishings were elegant and dark wood staff very friendly and professional helping me carry my bags up to my room. I was especially pleased to be given an upgrade on my standard double room to one of their signature wow suites great room with a four poster double bed. Would highly recommend.,4,2019,04,06
128,Great service and lovely historic building,"From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff and shown to our fabulous room in the hotel. 
We were really impressed and we had been upgraded to a Montcalm Club room. It was my partner's birthday and the hotel arranged for a complimentary bottle of wine, plus chocolates and balloons to be placed in our room. Bottled water and fresh fruit was also available. We also had access to the Club Lounge, which was a wonderful treat. There was a selection of complimentary alcoholic drinks, sandwiches and canapes. The room was quiet and relaxing and we loved the decor and ambience.
The location of the hotel was great - within easy walking distance of Barbican tube station (5 minutes), plus just a 20 minute walk to St Paul's, Tower Bridge and the river. 
Vlad, the head concierge at the hotel, was extremely helpful and friendly, plus we also met Alice, the Guest Experience Manager, who was lovely. 
All in all, a wonderful stay and we look forward to returning soon. Many thanks to Alice and Vlad for their kindness and hospitality during our visit.",5,2019,04,04
128,Wonderful Experience,"My partner and I recently stayed at the hotel celebrating a special occasion. Our first impressions of the hotel were first class. I would like to say a big thank you to Vikash the (Duty Manager) and Nona (Guest Services) for helping to make our stay a memorable experience. To our amazement due to the nature of our stay we were upgraded to one of the suits. Our room was very luxurious with lots of nice Elmis toiletries, bathrobes and slippers and a bed fit for a King. I would highly recommend this hotel, the service we received was first class. We look forward to returning to the hotel later in the year.",5,2019,04,03

Cannot fault it at all!
Thank you",5,2019,04,02
128,Marvellous Montcalm,"After having got engaged at the Montcalm at Marble Arch a few years ago in the presidential suite I thought that would take a lot to top!  However I was pleasantly surprised with this hidden gem!

Nestled in the Barbican area the old brewery buildings are stunning. We had a wonderful club room which was immaculate and spacious. The staff were as attentive as ever.

We had use of the club lounge which is always a winner for a quick intimate breakfast. Could not rate it higher especially as they were fully booked too!

The Jugged Hare pub attached was a real find too- provided a great stop after our show at the Barbican! 

Am definitely considering the Piccadilly Montcalm for a milestone birthday celebration in May! Can’t get enough of this hotel group!!",5,2019,03,31
128,Nice at a cost.,"Very nice modern hotel, everything you need in the room and a very nice control panel that allows you to do allsorts!
The down side is the cost very expensive as is the bar and snacks and an additional charge of £25 for breakfast! ",4,2019,03,31
128,Outstanding hospitality.,"I booked a night here for my fiancée as part of a birthday present and mentioned in the booking process it was a special occasion. The reception staff upgraded us to a suite and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival. Balloons and chocolate also in the room! I have never been so impressed with the level of hospitality in a London hotel. Every member of staff was so highly efficient friendly and professional. Natalia, Alice and Vlad are heading up a dream team! We will definitely be going back. Thank you.

128,Service above and beyond,"I stay in hotels three or four days a week; staying away from home has become the 'ordinary', or it had, until my wife and I stayed at the Montcalm Hotel at the Brewery London. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi the friendly staff took control. We were escorted throughout the hotel and wanted for nothing. It was the most delightful surprise to visit a London Hotel where the team seem to genuinely care about service. My congratulations and sincere thanks go out to everyone involved. Very impressive.",5,2019,03,31
128,Fabulous stay,"This hotel was fabulous! We were greeted with a warm, friendly smile as we arrived on Saturday evening. Check in was fast and we were treated to an upgrade which was just amazing and really really made the weekend! All the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. It felt very personal and we are already looking to book a weekend to visit again later in the year. Thank you Montcalm! ",5,2019,03,27
128,Amazing ,Me and my sister were greeted with warm welcomes at reception. It was my sisters birthday so upon arriving to the room there was balloons and chocolates waiting. We were only staying a night so when the cleaner came we said it wasn’t needed so she came back to give us chocolate! It was a five star stay I would definitely return! They minded our bags the next day and gave us bottles of water when we returned to collect them! All in all it was an amazing stay start to finish ,5,2019,03,25
128,Wow - blown away ,"We have been to Montcalm before but not to the brewery one.. we decide at the last minute to treat ourselves to a night away. We loved the Montcalm so when we saw the brewery at a fantastic price we couldn’t resist. The hotel has lots of charm and corridors as the building is very old. But it has all the brilliant features you would expect. We were given a room upgrade to the Barbican duplex .. we had booked a Montcalm club room. The suite was amazing , a open bathroom in the lounge , upstairs we had the bedroom and a further bathroom. We felt like kings and queens . The club lounge was good. My only comment would have been the nibbles in the evening could have been slightly better than sandwiches .. But if that’s my only slight negative comment. We honestly found this hotel pretty fault less!! Thank you for giving us an amazing night away. We will be back I am sure x ",5,2019,03,25
128,Fantastic hotel,"Wow what a fantastic hotel!! We went for my birthday and was upgraded to a lovely room with lounge area! We were given a box of chocolates, card from the management team and a bottle of Prosecco to share. We had access to the club lounge with nibbles and drinks which was lovely. Ideal location and overall the best hotel I’ve stayed in! The staff could not do enough to make sure you had everything.",5,2019,03,24
128,Beautiful place and I was upgraded randomly ,"I love this hotel for business stays. Lovely, calm(!) rooms which are a good size, not too big and super cosy. The beds are gorgeous, very comfy and enough space left to do some exercise in the morning without leaving the room. 

Service is exceptional - you’re greeted from the minute you approach the hotel. I was upgraded tonight after a long day, which was a very nice touch and much appreciated. Thank you Montcalm. ",5,2019,03,20
128,Deception,"total disappointment when I arrived in the room, indeed after having walked a real labyrinth to access (thankfully with the help of a boy from the reception) the room was very small and did not correspond to the official photos of the the Hotel whether on Booking or on their website, this is clearly NOT a 5 star (I was the week before at the Ritz Carlton in Dubai which is a real 5 star and I could make the difference in 5 minutes ), good bedding but small bed, unthinkable for 2, shower room with toilet is tiny, average cleanliness when we detail the room but the shower room very clean.

Photos below unthinkable details in a 5 Star Hotel",3,2019,03,20
128,Lot of things to be improved,At least at the main building 2nd floor internal noises are bad like the lifts. The rooms are small and small maintenance needs everywhere. One night here is enough. Breakfast and main desk worked well.,3,2019,03,20
128,Fantastic and Luxurious,"Amazing hotel with superb staff. I highly recommend this place. The Club Room is a very nice touch too. Not to mention the location is right by a bus stop and close to nearby tube stations. Good food, comfortable beds, polite staff that go above and beyond. You can't ask for much more than that.",5,2019,03,18
128,"Lovely hotel, great staff","We had a lovely stay in this hotel. The staff were really polite and helpful. The manager went over and above to make us feel welcome and upgraded our room on arrival.
The location for our visit was perfect and the rooms were very clean and well presented.
We would definately recommend and visit this hotel again",5,2019,03,16
128,Amazing,"Hotel booked for a birthday night away, couldnt fault the service by all staff members.  Great hotel in a very good location! Club lounge was a great addition to our stay and having a pub next door, still very quiet location no noise from pub heard at all! 
Our stay was made even better by being offered an unexpected room upgrade which was amazing!!
Thank you to all staff for our totally enjoyable stay at the montcalm at the brewery!  
We would def recommend and look forward to staying with you again in the future! 

Michelle",5,2019,03,13
128,Lovely Hotel but not the best nights sleep,"This is the second occasion I have stayed at this hotel. It's location is in a good party of the city and for me close to where I had meetings. 

The service is friendly and the rooms clean.  The complimentary items within the room are all excellent, offering a high service. 

Whilst it was a nice pleasure to have been upgraded from a double to a queen sized room, I would have preferred a less noisy room, having been disturb throughout the night with various deliveries going on from around 2am onward. 

The breakfast was buffet style, although I did have to catch the attention of the staff to get a pot of team. Overall the food was good. 

So overall, a good hotel, with nice touches but if you want a good nights sleep you should probably mention this when checking in.  .",3,2019,03,13
128,"Great location, great hotel!","We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery because it is ideally located for the Barbican where we were attending a concert to celebrate my husband's birthday. This was my fourth stay.
The hotel was perfect. We were thrilled to be upgraded to a suite on arrival and the staff were professional and genuinely attentive as usual. All the rooms I have stayed in have been spacious, well appointed and very clean and when an issue did arise it was dealt with promptly and effectively. We will certainly return to the hotel again when we are next in London.",5,2019,03,13
128,Great Location and Rooms,"I traveled to Montcalm for the second time in a month for a Business trip, The rooms are fantastic, with large baths suitable even for my 6ft 3"" frame. I ordered room service on one of my stays. I was told it would take up to 30mins to arrive, i was delighted to hear the doorbell ring after only 15mins. Food was also great. would highly recommend staying here as i will be choosing Montcalm for all my London Business trips ",5,2019,03,11
128,Stupid bar prices and closing time,"Bar closed at 11 pm.... really? Gin and tonic £11.30.... really? Breakfast £24.95... really?  Staff are very welcoming with bowler hatted doormen who changed the welcome carper, morning, afternoon and evening! Hotel room excellent... but not easy to get to.",3,2019,03,10
128,Ideal for the Barbican,"Located literally 200m from the Barbican Arts Centre this is the perfect location for music and theatre fans. The breakfast is excellent. The orange juice in REAL and not odd tasting artificial OJ or Tropicana. The scrambled eggs is soft and cream and not hard like in most hotels. The room size is good by London standard, has aircon and free wifi. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom has a bath.",5,2019,03,10
128,A wonderful stay at Montcalm City,Fabulous staff who were very helpful and friendly. We were visiting for my partners 50th Birthday treat. We got upgraded to the Barbican Suite which was amazing. Even had birthday balloons and complimentary Prosecco. An amazing experience will definitely be back in the future.,5,2019,03,10
128,Brilliant,"Easy review this one - astounded how good this place was and superb value for money. Friendly staff, room had everything, good food and a 5 minute stroll to Liverpool Street station. My new base whenever I’m in London!",5,2019,03,09
128,"Dirty, dusty and a total maze!","Upon arrival we were greeted very nicely, cannot fault the staff, all were very hospitable and attentive throughout the stay.

However the layout of the hotel is a total maze, with so many different parts to it, especially when using the stairs. The room we stayed in was very small with barely any space to move freely either side of the bed. Could be noisy at times, from outside noises or when the next door/upstairs used the shower, could hear running water within the walls. Also dust was clearly visible on the headboard. Water marks and general stains/tears could be seen on the doors and furniture. Ceiling and curtains were also dirty. Shower tray looked dirty so did not have a shower during our stay. Hairs were found in the sheets. Generally the hotel looked worn run down and old.
A very poor selection of breakfast, very basic but again the staff working at restaurant were faultless. Very hospitable. Made breakfast on request.
Good location, easily accessible to tube stations and taxi’s. However if you have a car have to pay a hefty fee in a public carpark.
Overall an OK stay but the quality of the hotel could be better. A 5/10. Probably would not stay here again.",3,2019,03,08
128,Stay during conference in London,Amazing and surprizing hotel with modernly equiped  rooms in authentic buiding in London City on nearby walking distance of the must see’s of London. Felt well taken care of. Great breakfast served in Chiswell dining restaurant. Good atmosphere and most helpful staff.,5,2019,03,06
128,Fantastic hotel and staff,"I stayed in the Montcalm at The Brewery for one night recently on a business trip to London. I was travelling alone and was greeted with an upgrade on arrival which was a lovely surprise. Everyone I met was warm and welcoming, they remembered I mentioned I was in London for an interview and asked me the next day how it went! The room was beautiful with lots of little extras. I ate in The Jugged Hare and food was excellent. I wouldn’t often say that a hotel in London offers great value for money by the Montcalm does!!  I’ll certain stay there every time I’m in The City area.",5,2019,03,04
128,Our amazing overnight stay at The Montcalm At lLondon brewery,"What can I say other then that we have just come back from the most amazing trip to The Montcalm, from the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty! 

On arrival we were told that our room had been upgraded to a luxury suit called the WOW suit. We also had complimentary Prosseco waiting in our room!

The room was beautiful!

When we arrived back to our room later that night we came back to Swan towels and rose petals on the bed and around the bath.

Every little details had been thought of in the room.

Breakfast the next morning was lovely!

We can not wait to come back again!",5,2019,03,03
128,Girls weekend,"What a lovely hotel with outstanding staff. Excellent location with Moorgate tube station. Within walking distance. Our room was lovely but my only criticism was that what seemed to be a huge A/C unit was out side our bedroom window which proved very noisy and the window was only about 4 metres from the building opposite also blocking nearly all natural daylight. If it wasn’t for the fact that we were out all the time I would have asked to move room. 
Please don’t let this stop you staying here because as I said at the beginning it’s a lovely hotel and I will stay again",5,2019,03,03
128,The mint calm,"Nice hotel tucked away off the street, nice service from all the staff on the door & reception.The room was clean,warm & very comfortable,well stocked mini bar good coffee & tea making facilities, had a nice stay would definatley recommend. Just a ten minute walk from Barbican tube station, coffee shops & pubs near by.",4,2019,02,28
128,Cannot recommend highly enough!,"We recently stayed at the Montcalm to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Prior to arrival, I emailed the reservations team to let them know the occasion and to ask if there was anything that could be done to make the stay extra special.  As I didn't receive a response, I assumed that perhaps my message had not been received/the hotel was too busy to reply.  On arrival, we expected to check in to the standard room we had booked, but were informed by the receptionist that we had been upgraded to the amazing Barbican Duplex Suite.  We were provided with a complimentary bottle of wine, fruit, box of chocolates and even balloons that had been placed on the bed!  We had also been given access to the Club Lounge between 5-8.30pm which included complementary drinks, sandwiches and canapes.  We were honestly so blown away with the service, professionalism and hotel facilities!  As a result of the hotel's efforts my husband probably had his best birthday yet and I can't say how thrilled he was with the 5 star treatment he received.  We have stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels and it is very rare to experience the level of service and hospitality provided by the Montcalm. 
I cannot say thank you enough to all the staff at the hotel.  We will definitely be returning and cannot recommended the hotel highly enough!",5,2019,02,27
128,4 star hotel disguised as a 5 star hotel,"Overall it was a pleasant stay but did not feel like a 5 star hotel. Little annoying things here and there, like broken cistern, dripping taps, mouldy complimentary fruit, odd concierges etc that just didn’t justify its rating.",3,2019,02,25
128,The montcalm and brewery,"Stayed for two nights to celebrate birthday. Beautiful hotel and gorgeous room. The bed was so comfortable, staff welcoming and very accomodating. This was my husband's first experience of London and this hotel made it for him.",5,2019,02,24
128,Awesome!,"My partner and I stayed one night at the Montcalm and had a wonderful experience.  Our trip was a late Christmas gift for my partner.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to the Executive Suite.  In the room there was a personalised welcome card with complementary chocolates.  The staff were very attentive, seeing us to our room and offering us complementary drinks as it was our first stay at Montcalm.  Overall, the room was fantastic, staff were superb and we had a wonderful stay.  I would recommend the hotel to everyone.  Outstanding customer service!  Thank you!",5,2019,02,23
128,Amazing!,"We stay there for 1 night only and have to say that the hotel is one of the best in London.
The service is incredible from the moment you pass the door , Gloria, Laura and Georges maked us feel so welcome that we would have loved to stay longer.
The room are nice , clean , great location, perfect really
.",5,2019,02,18
128,A little disappointed :(,"I’m gutted I’m writing this but for the price of our stay I feel I should write the review. We were a little disappointed with our stay at The Montcalm, although the hotel, location and service were great, our room was very small, the ‘double bed’ was definitely not a double, seemed more like a large single or a three quarter bed. 
Every time the room upstairs went to the toilet you heard it & then the full flush. 
There was a wedding at the venue whilst we were there, and we were completely miffed why we were put in a room closest to the wedding party, when the party didn’t finish until 1am. Keeping us awake with the music etc. Another downside was the temperature of the room - extremely hot. We turned it down & couldn’t open any windows. What should have been a nice valentines weekend turned into a sleepless uncomfortable night. I’m not sure if I’d go back.",3,2019,02,17
128,Standards have slipped ,"Stayed one night with my husband and young son to meet relatives who were over in London. 
We have stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery many times in the past few years and have always been impressed. However, during this stay we noticed that standards have slipped. It seems that in the last five years nothing has really been updated and that was clear in the room that we stayed in. 

We chose to pay extra in a Montcalm club room which gave us access to the club lounge for drinks/snacks between 5-8pm in the evening. We used to do this during previous stays when the club lounge was located in a different area of the hotel. We arrived at the club lounge at 5pm with lots of members of staff coming in and out for about 25min. The food /drinks area was not open and not one member of staff acknowledged us or apologised for the delay. It wasn’t until I asked someone that they then opened it all up for us. Not really 5 star service. 

Our room had also seen better days. On arrival (which was delayed due to the room not being ready on time)  the bathroom door had clearly not been cleaned properly. There were also tiles missing from the shower/bath. The plug in the bath was difficult to manoeuvre and when you did try and move it, it just fell off! there were also various stains all over the wooden bedside tables. 

Staff also do not seem as enthusiastic or eager to please as has been the case in previous stays. Check in and out was also a bit of a queuing affair. 

The real positives were the meal we had at The Jugged Hare which is connected to the hotel. Well worth a visit. Breakfast at The Chiswell St dining rooms was also pretty good but it is a buffet.

Overall we wouldn’t rush back. The hotel for us is no longer the 5 star experience it used to be. It could learn a lot from the staff at The Montcalm Royal London house where we were this weekend which is absolutely fantastic. That will be our choice for future London stays. ",3,2019,02,17
128,Comfortable elegance!,"What a lovely, elegant and beautifully furnished hotel.  Quality products in the exquisite generous Club Room which was worth paying the extra for.  The super king bed was so comfortable.  The staff were very helpful and polite.  We loved our stay. Thank you.",5,2019,02,17
128,Fantastic stay!,"We had a great stay here, I mentioned on my booking that it was a surprise for husbands birthday thinking we’d get a treat in the room, they upgraded us to a suite with club room access! 
The room was beautiful and the bed was so comfy!
Staff are lovely! 
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,02,17
128,Lovely time.,"Stayed one night with my husband, got upgraded to a suite as it was for a special occasion. Staff was friendly and attentive, room with spacious clean and had lovely special touches. Hotel foyer is stunning. Very nice and quiet. We ate In the Jugged Hare pub, which works in partnership with the hotel and was very handy to get a lift straight down in the pub. Would recmmend a stay here.",5,2019,02,17
128,"Mont calm Hotel, Tech City.","I recently stayed at this hotel for my wife's birthday. This hotel is amazing. The decor & facilities in the room are wonderful. The staff can't do enough for you. 
Adrien is so so helpful & he alone did so much for us. Nice guy.
Definitely stay here again. 
The only downside is the room service menu is not enough variety. 
Overall top top hotel with great staff. If you need anything arranging just phone up & ask for Adrien.",5,2019,02,17
128,Continually excellent ,"Another year, another birthday (my 60th) and another trip to the Montcalm. 

We were not originally going to stay in London this year as my wife had offered to take me to Prague (always wanted to visit) for my 60th birthday however we decided to book Prague for June to nearly coincide with our wedding anniversary and the Prague Speedway GP. So booked a standard room at 'late' notice (for us) through a hotel booking firm and not directly through the hotel. 

Still received a fabulous welcome, a double room upgrade and a handwritten welcome back card from the management! Wish I'd let them know it was my 60th too!

Fabulous,  quirky building and the service is second to none.  

Will be back!",5,2019,02,16
128,Excellent Staff and service,"Stayed for my husband's birthday weekend. Bit of an issue with our first room with the bath plug not doing its job and the shower was broken. Too late in the evening to do anything about this, but we were upgraded the following day to a ""Wow"" room - four poster bed, huge bathroom and given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco, fruit and free continental breakfast (very nice) the next day - thanks Vlad. The staff in this hotel are lovely and welcoming and cannot do enough for you. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever slept in a hotel setting.

My only negative - although we were moved due to malfunctioning bath etc, the plumbing in the room was also not working properly. We were unable to get the bath taps to work (housekeeping couldn't either), and had to fill the bath up with the shower head. The jets worked on and off and so did the shower. My advice is to ask when shown to your room just how all the knobs etc work (if indeed they do), and if they don't saves you unpacking.",5,2019,02,14
128,"Superb, as always!","It's official - I'm 007; my room-key says so!  Maybe I'm a little old for the role, and my children too grown-up to be impressed by the tag - but the room is fantastic.  It has a distinct, tasteful style that blends well with the character of this historic building.  This is my favourite hotel in the City, so the free upgrade was a real bonus - many thanks!
Whilst the building is fascinating and its features and history are made much of, this in no way compromises the facilities and provision expected of a hotel with this star rating.  It provides excellent value for money.
But the heart and soul of the hotel is the staff team.  On arrival I am recognised and welcomed as an old friend; my needs are anticipated and addressed efficiently but unobtrusively.  I am perfectly catered for, but not fussed.
Many, many thanks to Victoria and her team.  I look forward to coming back.",5,2019,02,14
128,"Lovely hotel, poor management ","We stayed here for my partners birthday. Hotel was lovely, fabulous old building converted into high end hotel. Unfortunately there were issues with our room(s) that the staff and management didn’t deal with at all well. We ended up changing rooms four times, once for no extractor in the bathroom, but subsequently two rooms with no hot water. Management desalts with these issues slowly and at no point did they consider offering us a discount or refund which I would have expected at this end of the scale.",2,2019,02,12
128,"Wow, an amazing boutique hotel","We booked the hotel to attend a wedding at The Brewery as it was next door and had a most amazing and wonderful stay. We were upgraded to a duplex room by a most helpful member at reception and offered breakfast too which we hadn't booked so it turned out to be great value. The room was clean and comfortable with plenty of amenities, such as an iron and  ironing board, mini bar, two TVs, free mobile phone for use in the hotel and more. We also had a complimentary bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine as we had a small delay in being able to check in.  My only criticisms of the room was the slight inconvenience of having to come downstairs to use the bathroom during the night and the lighting - which was adequate but far too many switches to turn all the lights on or off.

Being converted from an old brewery there are a few sets of small steps along the corridor to our room and it was a little confusing initially to navigate our way round. All the staff were fantastic offering to help or provide anything we needed. 

Breakfast was very pleasant as we again saw the bride and groom and many of the wedding guests so all very cosy. The food was good, being freshly prepared and a reasonable choice from cold meats, cheeses, various breads, fruit, cereal and a range of English breakfast cooked items. Anything else you wanted and the staff were happy to bring it.

It's a great location for events at the Barbican or a visit to the museum of London, which I recommend. The Jugged Hare pub linked to the hotel is great where we enjoyed a late lunch before collecting our bags and heading home, reflecting on the wonderful stay and most enjoyable function at the Brewery.",5,2019,02,12
128,Friendly service and great experience at the Montcalm,"I recently stayed at the Montcalm Barbican while in London for work. The staff were friendly and helpful from the moment I arrived - Yulian and Alex cheerfully helped me corral four large bags as I departed the taxi and were at the ready for any need throughout my stay. My room was a good size with a nice bathroom and soaking tub, and housekeeping did a wonderful job keeping everything fresh and clean. Very close to the business center of London with two great restaurants right across the street, definitely recommend for overall quality and convenience.",5,2019,02,12
128,Stunning rooms,"A lovely weekend break, room was upgraded due to this break being my birthday.
Huge comfy bed, every little detail of our stay was catered for. Special little touches in the room.
Would have benfitted with somewhere to hang coats and outerwear.
Diffinately will return again.",5,2019,02,10
128,Another Lovely Visit,"Always enjoy visiting ‘The Montcalm At The Brewery’, a regular of ours. We’ve never had a bad visit. We last visited on the 8th February, 2019. I was advised we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival which was a nice touch. Our luggage was taken up for us as we were out for the afternoon. The room was lovely, comfortable & clean. We had a lovely stay and will certainly visit again. Many thanks as always. ",5,2019,02,10
128,spectacular hotel but with the perks of an old historic building,"Fantastic service and helpful personell, from doorman to concierge ect... The room was spotless and fully equipped with the amenities one would expect and more: flat screen TV with speaker also in the bathroom, mini bar, hair dryer, iron & board, elect. kettle with tea and coffee for a quick breakfast, safe, A/C heating and floor heating in the bathroom. The offered 2 bottles of mineral water (still and bubbling) for free.
The only thing that I found missing was a toothbrush set and sleepers. Also no bible and or other religious books.
There were far too many deco lights and switches, it was a little confusing at first till you get what turns what off.
The bathroom wall towards the bed was made of glass and a roller blinder could be rolled up. I found that an overkill and presumed the designer had the occasional businessman that cant afford to miss the financial news while in the bathroom (TV was in direct line of sight) in mind.
The WiFi was fast though unsecure! Use with caution.
I didn't have breakfast so I cant comment.
The hotel building was an old brewery, that means an old industrial building of the georgian era,with an inner courtyard, gate ect, impressive and well preserved. But that means that the way to some rooms is long and convoluted cause you have to go around the courtyard and change lifts.
And with being an old building comes the only real negative thing I have to comment (and if somebody from the hotel reads this should really try to amend it): The rooms have old metal-framed thin single-glass windows with very bad thermal and sound insulation, big draft blowing in. The thick drapes and the AC were battling to keep the temperature up (we visited in the midst of a snow storm to say the truth). I found that unacceptable for a 5star hotel. I presume there might be problems with the council if external changes are not allowed for a monument building, but some hotels in Berlin and in Russia for example are also quite old and have original old double windows (two frames, two panes of glass) that work just well as modern double glass windows. They should do something about it.",4,2019,02,04
128,Excellent stay,"I have stayed at the Montcalm a few times and each time the staff are extremely friendly, kind and helpful. From the moment of checking in to checking out, the staff do their very best to make your stay a real treat.",5,2019,02,04
128,A disappointment,"Please allow me to tell you about my experience at the Montcalm Brewery in detail.  

I arrived at the property by Taxi early on Saturday 24th January 2019– I believe approximately 9.30 am.  We pulled up and I struggled to get my suitcase from the cab.  The doorman was present and simply looked on as I struggled.  Taxi driver in the end came out to help and he helped  with the luggage.  Only when I was struggling up the steps and asked the doorman directly, did he help with the luggage.

Check in – I stated that I was early and wasn’t expecting a room to be early but requested to leave my bags for the day.  The receptionist appeared uninterested and asked for my passport.  When I said I didn’t have it she frowned and I had to show my driving licence. 

My bags were left and off I went to my conference.  On my return at 2.30 pm, the receptionist (the same one as earlier) again asked for confirmation and searched to find my key.  She said that there was no-one to show me to my room so I would have to find it myself.  She refused to show me where breakfast was, saying she would show me later when I returned.

I made my way to my room.  The room was small with a shower and I wanted a bath so I returned to reception and requested one. She went away and returned a little while later saying that the manager had agreed to it so I was given a new key.  The porters took my bags to the new room

I went to the new room and it seemed suitable, so unpacked, changed and left as I had a meeting elsewhere in the city at 4pm.

After my meeting I attended the theatre and returned back to the hotel at approximately 11pm.  On my return I put the key in the key socket inside the room.  The light came on then switched itself off.  I took out the key and re-inserted it to find that the key holder fell off! I was unable to get the lights to work.  I returned to reception where the receptionist insisted a porter accompany me to check on the situation.  As he saw, the key holder was broken and we were unable to have light.  He took the key back to reception as I put a chair in the door to lever it open so that I was able to pack up with some light from the hall.  I used my phone light to empty the bathroom.

The porter returned and I was taken to an upgraded room, one of your ‘Wow’ suites. 

It took me some time to unpack again.  I attempted to bathe, the bath was a little difficult to fathom, but I did as instructed on the bath to ‘turn and pull’ on the plug.  Unfortunately the plug came off in my hand as I did so and I was unable to have a bath as the plug wouldn’t work.

Sunday morning.  I had already packed the suitcase in preparation to leave.  On my way to breakfast, I asked the porters to take my suitcase from my room and bring it down but leave everything else.  I returned to my room, to find that I was no longer able to access it.  My suitcase was in reception, along with my handbag, containing my wallet and credit cards, and coat, and all were unsupervised.  I checked out, took my luggage without anyone asking what I was doing or questioning who I was.

I left the hotel, again with no assistance from the doorman.  As I left, I asked about a taxi and was told “did you ask for one inside?” to which I replied “I didn’t know I had to” and was told “you should have asked for one inside”.  I left the hotel and hailed my own cab in the end.

Needless to say I was not happy with my stay at the Montcalm.  This is not the standard I expected from a 5 star hotel.",3,2019,02,02
128,Nice room and good location ,"Clean, tidy, great size bath, nice touch that you can see into the bathroom, comfy bed, quiet, friendly staff and big juicy apples. The place is an absolute maze though, even though I was shown to my room and everything is sign posted... Thankfully my boyfriend was there because I would have definitely got lost trying to find the way around by myself! ",5,2019,02,02
128,Good hotel and location,"One night stay for business. Good quality feel about the place. Tentative staff and helpful. Good to see free bottled water and fruit, tea coffee etc with good quality bathroom products. Room average size. The night I stayed it was noisy outside, at times, from pub revellers leaving. It was also noisy inside along the corrider around midnight with revellers walking past the room.  TV remote control wasn't working but this was repaired fairly quickly. Only real grumble, room 225 is equipped with a bathroom for wheelchair users. Great to see these facilities but the sink was quite low, wheel chair height and layout of the bathroom designed around this.  If you're looking for wheelchair facilities then room 225 is great!",4,2019,01,31
128,Felt like a princess,Helped my son arrange the stay - a present for his girlfriend's birthday.  They got a lovely room and I was told she thoroughly enjoyed being treated like a princess.  A big thank you to all the staff at the Montcalm for all the attentions and for making this stay one they will both remember fondly.,5,2019,01,30
128,Wonderful experience,"Really enjoyed the stay. The staff was welcoming and helpful. I arrived early for check-in and my room was not ready, so they bumped me up to the clubroom that was ready so I would not have to wait. 
They would leave fresh fruit in the room every day which I thought was a nice touch. 
The overall atmosphere was very warm and welcoming. Recommended for business if you are attending a nearby conference or meeting.",5,2019,01,30
128,Another excellent stay at the Montcalm Brewery,"Stayed once again at the Montcalm at the Brewery and once again, an excellent experience.  This hotel is our default now whenever we visit London, which we do around 10 times a year.  

The staff are fantastic, with nothing being too much trouble.  The rooms are modern, stylish and very comfortable, with all the amenities you need. This time we even tried the club lounge, for free evening cocktails and canapes, plus a good continental breakfast in the morning.  Located in the finance district, but with good tube links into central London, it is nice and quiet at the weekends but if you want more nightlife, just hop on a tube at Moorgate or Barbican.  

The icing on the cake is the Jugged Hare next door, which you can access direct from the hotel.  Really great food here and perfect if you dont want to leave the vicinity.  If you are there on a Sunday, do have the Sunday lunch, its one of the best in London.

5 stars again for the Montcalm :)",5,2019,01,29
128,"Central Location.  Lovely staff, good facilities","This is a well positioned hotel for central London.  Located adjacent to the Barbican and well appointed with rooms to suit most tastes from the business visitor to the family trip.  There are rooms for meetings and it is a frequent wedding venue.  Staff are really helpful and courteous and do go that extra mile to make your stay memorable.  The main entrance door is up a couple of steps and opened by a uniformed concierge with a friendly greeting.  As it is a conversion of an old brewery, there are several link corridors and steps between them.  Some of the older features are still visible.  Food in the Chiswell dining rooms is good quality and fairly priced.",5,2019,01,29
128,Could not fault,"I booked the hotel as part of a trip for my boyfriends birthday and I couldn’t fault a single thing.

We arrived there on the Saturday morning and were welcomed by the friendliest staff who asked about our plans. We were then shown to our room where on arrival there was a hand written card by the duty manager wishing my boyfriend a Happy Birthday and balloons on the bed with Happy Birthday on them. I genuinely thought this was the nicest touch any hotel could do, it showed that they’d paid attention when checking in and had gone above and beyond. 

We had an issue with the pressure in our shower on the Sunday morning but after ringing down to reception they had it sorted within 10 minutes.

The room was lovely and we honestly couldn’t have been happier with the hotel and it’s staff. After checking out we were approached by the duty manager who we’d not met prior who introduced herself but knew all about us and our stay. Asking if my boyfriend had had a lovely birthday and weekend and apologising for issue with the shower in the morning.

I honestly could not fault a single thing with the Montcalm and will be coming back here again. I’m not usually one to post reviews but I was so impressed with the standard and service of the hotel that I couldn’t not.

Thanks for an amazing weekend

128,3 days with no hot water,"When I was shown to my room there was a very obvious noise coming from the fan in the air conditioner vent. Sounded like a straw or something stuck in there (ie very obvious). The concierge acted like there was nothing wrong. After an awkward pause I asked him to turn it off. The next morning I went to have a shower and all I got was cold water. Already wet I finished the shower quickly and dried. Later I went to reception and asked them to fix the problems. They said they would get them fixed by the end of the day. That night I came back and the air conditioner was buzzing loudly again so I turned it off. I put some milk in the fridge and went to sleep. The bed was very comfortable although small (single bed!). The next morning I go to have a shower And this time I get no water! I get my milk out of the fridge and it is warm. Annoyed, I ask for a new room which they agree to. The new room has only cold water, but after talking to a colleague realise this is a hotel wide problem. When I return that night they left me a note to say sorry there was a problem with the boiler but it is now fixed. Again I had a good sleep (comfortable but small) however when I go to have a shower the next morning there is no hot water, again. That’s the third morning in a row! I call reception, they send someone to test it and yep no water. Apparently it’s the tap this time. So they call me and say they have another room for me (yes room number 3). They also offer me 2 free breakfasts for the trouble. This is the first time I had a hot shower in this hotel. This third room was bigger, and generally much better. In each of the three rooms the desk chair was stretched after much use and could feel the bar underneath, and I asked for a new chair each time. After this experience I am not sure I would stay here again. The staff were polite and genuinely sorry for the issues. But I think there are some general maintenance issues that need to be addressed.",3,2019,01,26
128,Could not fault. Will be back.,"Difficult to give a fair view based on one short night's stay. But all seemed very good/very pleasant. Friendly staff, nice rooms, a bit of character, great location etc, nice breakfast etc etc...difficult to ask for more.

Felt the room lighting was a bit overcomplicated TBH. So many switches and lights took me a while to work out what-was-what. Would love to stay here in the summer months i.e. when could stroll out into the bustling areas north of the hotel.

But simply cannot knock the location - 7 minute walk to office south of hotel, Barbican on doorstep and then bustling residential area slightly north.

Definitely will be back.",4,2019,01,19
128,My only niggle is 'very small beer'.,"Overall, The Brewery is an impressive  hotel with equally impressive staff. Everyone was welcoming, friendly and helpful and the room a delight with a very large, comfortable bed and excellent coffee/tea facilities . The breakfast was also top class with very attentive staff.

So what to niggle about. We fancied a quiet drink around 9.45. The hotel bar and Jugged Hare were heaving but advised the Chiswell Dining room would be suitable.  We were able to get a drink but not any nibbles as everything had just closed, including the Club Lounge. We were just surprised at the early closure. Everyone was very apologetic and it really is only a very minor comment. In particular, the lady who brought us our wine made every effort to help. The hotel is clearly 5 star!

I repeat that ALL staff impressed and we would love to return.",5,2019,01,18
128,Platinum Service,"As a firm we use the Montcalm family quite a lot and are regular visitors of the Marble Arch and Brewery London City. Every visit has been nothing less than excellent, from booking, through to departure, nothing is ever too much for them and they always go the extra mile during our stays whether it's food / drinks in the room or access to the club lounge, these small touches really do make us go back and book time and time again. Even if meetings are a little out the way we will book one of the hotels and just travel a bit further because we know what we are getting with the Montcalm and look forward to staying away on business when we are staying with them, which not a lot of people can say! I'd like to say a special thank you to the guest relations team for making every visit special. One constructive criticism I would give is for full payment to be taken if booking over the phone. Thanks to everyone at the Montcalm family.",5,2019,01,15
128,"Brilliant stay, brilliant service! ","Absolutely loved my stay at The Montcalm at Brewery London. Customer service started out excellent and, well, just exceeded itself from there! Upon finding out it was my partners birthday we were upgraded to the Wow Suite, a really plush modern room with a variety of snacks, fully stocked mini bar, beautifully comfortable four poster bed and a stylish bathroom. We were also given a complimentary bottle of wine and invited for free cocktails at the Club House!! It definitely made my partners birthday one to remember. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, during every interaction with reception we were treated with excellent customer service by polite mannered members of staff.

If anyone were to ask me if I'd stay again - I would in a heartbeat! ",5,2019,01,15
128,Exceptional hotel,"This was my 3rd time to stay in The Montcalm at the Brewery. I had another wonderful stay. I would not stay anywhere else as the location is fantastic and the staff are amazing in this hotel. House keeping staff do a really great job with keeping the rooms in tip top condition for your stay. The reception staff and doormen/concierge are impeccably dressed and they are so courteous and attentive. I had left a coat behind me last February and had been in contact with the hotel a few months later as I had forgotten all about it, I asked at reception when I went back in January of this year and was dealing with Nona who dealt with the situation and had the coat hanging up in my room on my return from my day out. I was so pleased. 

The beds are extremely comfortable. We stayed in the Club Room which was beautiful.We had breakfast in The Jugged Hare which was also super. I will definitely be returning at the end of the year, and every other time for that matter.",5,2019,01,14
128,Great hotel,"Great hotel with great staff, the room was luxurious, comfortable and clean, also has character unlike some hotels at a similar price, couldn’t fault the place,
Is it VFM ? Yes
Would I recommend? Yes
Would I stay again ? Most definitely! ",5,2019,01,13
128,Always wonderful,"I have stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery on several occasions, and it never disappoints.
The staff are wonderful, nothing is too much trouble. 
The room are clean and comfortable. This stay I was in the Wow suite room 227, what a fantastic room! The bed extremely comfortable and the room spotless.",5,2019,01,12
128,Wonderful weekend at The Montcalm.,I stayed here the weekend before Christmas with my partner the hotel staff were wonderful! along with the hotel suite I was very impressed. The service we had was above expectation and the staff were very helpful. I will soon be returning to the Montcalm for another visit. Great location very wonderful building.,5,2019,01,12
128,A lovely night in Montcalm,"It was my first time staying in Montcalm and very impressive regarding the design of the room, the high quality of the products used and most important was a very warm welcome from the hotel staffs. I will highly recommend this Montcalm hotel for everyone and hope you all enjoy the nights with them. ",5,2019,01,10
128,"Quiet, good value hotel","I stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery for one night and was delighted to be upgraded to a Montcalm club room. The room was a good size and had lots of useful amenities such as a smartphone, nespresso machine and a good minibar selection (didn't use it but prices and quality looked good). Elemis toiletries were also lovely. The hotel is conveniently located only a three or four minute walk from Moorgate tube station and it's also not far from Liverpool St station. The area is very quiet at night. The hotel bar also closed very early but perhaps that was because I stayed there during the quiet post-Christmas period. I didn't have breakfast there so can't comment on that. Staff were very helpful and allowed me to leave my bag at the hotel after checkout. I was also able to charge my phone when I returned to collect the bag in the evening, which I greatly appreciated. The only minor downsides were no slippers provided in the room (unusual for a 5 star) and the bathrobe in the wardrobe looked a bit grubby. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel for a short stay - particularly for business travellers - and I would most likely stay here again.",4,2019,01,08
128,lovely stay,"quiet, well run, and great service. Very traditional hotel with a level of service that is rarely seen in hotels now. Location convenient to my office, lots of external reasonably priced restaurants and bars nearby.",5,2019,01,08
128,"Wonderful hotel, great staff, excellent location","My husband and I visited the hotel in December and we stayed for two nights along with my husband's parents.  This was a family break where we were taking in the sites of London, enjoying some nice food and drink and going to see Paul McCartney.  Prior to our stay I contacted the hotel as I was having some issue with a query, nothing major, but your staff were quick in responding and answering my questions.

On arrival we were checked in by a lovely member of staff who upgraded both our rooms, was friendly, cheery and really welcoming, which was a lovely start to our Christmassy weekend.  The rooms were fab, and on returning from our day of sightseeing we were surprised to find a bottle of wine in each room for my birthday.  A real nice touch which was greatly appreciated.  

On departure the concierge helped me with boarding passes for my in laws and ensured we didn't require any further help with our homeward journey.

We were flying from London City airport and had already made our way through security when I received a call from Alex, the Head Concierge.  Alex advised that my in laws had left their passports, credit card and drivers licence all in the room safe, ie they were not in possession of any travel documents.  Alex was superb, he arranged for a taxi to collect the documents and bring them to us at the airport.  His attention to detail was superb, he kept me informed, gave me all the contact details of the taxi driver and called to ensure we had received the documents safely.  Absolutely priceless customer service.  

We were lucky to have chosen The Montcalm at The Brewery for this trip because I'm not entirely convinced that had we been elsewhere, we would have had such a smooth transaction with the passports that didn't want to leave! 

The excellent customer service meant that what was a potential nightmare, was a laughable story we could tell whilst catching up with friends and family over the festive period.  

A truly wonderful place to stay, clean, cozy rooms, wonderful staff and excellent location. We 100% recommend.",5,2019,01,07
128,Superb Stay,"A delightful 3night stay- between 21st to 23rd December 2018 room 228 Wow suite. 
I've stayed at this hotel on numerous accounts and everytime it gets better. The room is perfect four bed post, sofa, tv mounted on the wall, shower with different heads and jets. Bathroom amenities elemis brand. Hair dryer, shoe polish, umbrella if you need it, carrier bag, bathrobe and slippers. Mini bar in the room, laundry services (at a charge). 
Room has aircon for either cool or hot, but in the morning I liked the fact that you can open the windows a little bit and have fresh air coming in.
House keeping amazing they came to clean the room when we wanted rather than disturbing us whilst in the room, and the turn down service in the evening was nice to come back to the room to have little chocolate on the pillow. 
As always Deepak was amazing to sort out my booking, I was able to drop my bags off prior to check in and it was in safe hands, he also organise afternoon tea for us to be served in our room which was lovely and nothing was too much to ask. Late check out, breakfast and club lounge all included. 
Afternoon tea- we had a selection of finger sandwiches, scones and cakes with a glass of presseco each. 
Check in was a breeze and I was taken into my room to find balloons on the bed as we was celebrating a birthday, with a bottle of presseco, chocolate. Fruits- with complimentary water which they refresh everyday. 
Breakfast- full English and continental so alot of variety to choose from and you can also order off the menu. 
Club lounge- lovely for a snack and a few drinks and the staff in the club lounge are more than happy to make you drinks and serve you or you can serve yourself. 
We also paid for a spa treatment at the sister hotel which is less than 10min walk away and that was amazing too, worth a trip if your staying for more than 1 night. 
Tesco is around the corner from the hotel if you ever need anything and for dinner we mainly ordered food online and got it delivered to the hotel. 
I honestly can't want to come back and stay again, Deepak and the staff are so lovely and will go beyond to make your stay relaxing and stress free as nothing is too much trouble for them. My partner had to leave at 1am to travel to work and the staff were able to make him a coffee in a take away cup for his journey which was so nice of them and kind. I can't thank the staff enough. I do have to say I missed Alice and I can't wait for her return. ",5,2019,01,03
128,Incredible stay,"From the minute we arrived at the hotel to the minute we left, we couldn't pick out one single fault even if we tried. We was also given a complimentary room upgrade to the 'WOW SUITE' and it's fair to say I've never stayed in a room like it before. They made us feel welcome and the food was great too. The staff were lovely and will definitely be visiting again soon. Couldn't recommend it enough.",5,2019,01,02
128,Amazing,"Absolutely amazing hotel. Such a luxurious feel and was treat like royalty!  We went there for my husband's 40th birthday and the hotel went above and beyond expectations. Arrived and was told we had been upgraded to a special room. 007. An absolutely mind blowing room. And greated with such a personal touch from the duty manager. A nice hand written card, the bed was so comfy,I really didn't want to leave. Thank you all so much for making it a great few nights to remember. I can't wait to revisit the hotel again.",5,2018,12,30
128,Place with personality,"Friendly reception. Great, spacious room with excellent bed. Very clean! Good breakfast (though it looks like a small space compared to the size of the building - anyway had the place to my own). Beware to turn the faucet the right way (unexpected cold water raining down ... i was awake). Easy check out. Would recommend and come back. ",5,2018,12,26
128,It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas ,Me and my wife returned to this hotel as we’d stayed there before and had a great time. This time was even better! We were celebrating our first year wedding anniversary and were upgraded to a Barbican Duplex Suite...wow! The room was on two floors and was amazing. The bed was the comfiest bed I have ever slept on. The staff couldn’t do enough to help and made us feel really special. We’re definitely staying here again and I’d recommend it to anyone I know. Thank you! ,5,2018,12,24
128,Don’t expect to get what you booked ,"We wanted to celebrate my birthday in this hotel and booked via booking.com a room with a king size bed. This is important to us, so we are always very cautious to book the right room. 
The room which was given to us was only slightly bigger than the bed wich was not even a queensize. 
First reaction: this is what you booked. And we have to understand that the marketing department does not show the small rooms. We showed them our confirmation. 
Second reaction: we see, but we are fully booked and an upgrade to the next room with a kingsize bed would be with a charge. We asked fir the manager to get an explanation why we do not get what we booked. 
Third reaction: we got a room where the furniture was totally worn down. The pic was the chair in our room. 
It was a big mistake to stay there. ",1,2018,12,23
128,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for one night with my husband.
When we arrived we were told that they had upgraded our room to a suite, it was beautiful, spotless and spacious with a four poster bed.
The staff were very helpful and welcoming.
The only thing is the breakfast and coffee could of been a bit hotter.
Will definitely stay again!",5,2018,12,16

fluffy dressing gowns and slippers provided

Elemis products in bathroom , nice small touches like sewing kit , ear buds etc 
Iron and iron boarding 
Tea and coffee ... coffeee machine with pods 
Nice bar downstairs 
Didn’t eat in restaurant 
Friendly helpful staff
Only negative breakfast , busy and not organised although staff tried hard- for the price would have wanted better service",4,2018,12,06
128,Review amended: excellent customer service post-stay,"My initial review is stated below, however I should add that once posted, I was contacted by a Manager of the hotel to discuss my experience.  I was impressed to be contacted directly and I appreciated that there was someone who cared about my experience.  We talked through my initial experience and I was offered a  50% refund and an upgrade for the next visit. These days social media plays such a huge part in our hotel choices I was very happy with the response and service from the hotel after my stay.  For this reason I have amended my review and service rating.
Initial review: I was part of a wedding party and had booked a two night stay. I called the reservations line to amend a booking from 2 nights to 1. I was told if I could send over my confirmation, the supervisor promised to respond to me the next morning. Three days later the booking was finally amended. When we arrived at the hotel, the rooms we had booked were at different ends of the hotel so we spent time re-jigging the arrangements, all of which had been requested months in advance. Breakfast was below average although the waiting staff were very nice.",4,2018,12,06
128,"We booked the Montcalm at the Brewery again for my partners birthday, and what a welcome!","The Hotel is a beautiful building which is only surpassed by the welcome we received from the staff. The manager was an amazing chap and made our weekend stay extra special. I could not have wished for better service.
We had a lovely stay in my home town of London. It is so perfectly situated for where we were going. Not far from the local life and The Royal Opera House.

Thank you for helping make a fantastic weekend.",5,2018,12,05
128,Good service and interesting building,"I had booked late for one night to go to a training course and was delighted when I arrived to find such a nice hotel. 
Very helpful staff and given a duplex with bathrooms upstairs and down which was not expected. 
Really interesting building and excellent location for me as need to be in The City the next day.
Lovely bed and bedding and great pillows. Really nice bathrooms.
Amazingly quiet for central London. Had a great night's sleep.",5,2018,11,27
128,Delivers everything it promises,"We stayed at Montcalm Brewery for two nights as we wanted to concentrate our sightseeing around the City, Southbank and East End this time.  The hotel is ideally located between Barbican and Moorgate Tube Stations.  The building is really quirky which added another dimension to our stay - a real difference from the usual London business Hotels. Our Club room was fabulous, spotless and so comfortable and quiet.  Staff are delightful.  Everything about this hotel has a top quality feel.  Breakfast was leisurely and again good quality with plenty of choice.  Upon leaving I booked a business stay here for December.  Can not fault The Montcalm Brewery.",5,2018,11,27
128,Not a 5*,"Lovely location however I don’t think that this property deserves to have 5* 

Arriving at the hotel the door man greeted us “.. how are you mates?..”.. which is not professional at all

Staff were like robots, smiles and attitude completely artificial

Room with wall paper coming of the wall

Window covered in mould

Graffiti on the wall with the date from 2015 so it looks like the room hasn’t been clean properly since that time

Poor signage in the corridors and lift, not nice using the pub to get in / out

When complaining to the reception the girl asked us to pack everything And they would move our stuff to other room
We came back around 11pm and the boy at the reception didn’t know which room they gave us and had to go away to ask the manager... told us that someone else was already in our previous room ( maybe someone that likes graffiti)

Having a cigarette outside,  the door man saw that we were looking for something and when we said we were looking for an ashtray he just told us to throw it in the floor 

We paid £170 booked nearly two months in advance for a lovely weekend away to visit the Shard, going to a concert at night and to have a nice walk in the city and this hotel didn’t contribute for it.",2,2018,11,23
128,A very warm welcome,"This is my second stay in this lovely hotel. I like it as it is so close and easy to get to by tube from Kings Cross. When I arrived I was welcomed by such a friendly doorman. I was greeted by a lovely Recepionist, who upgraded me.to which I was so very grateful. I was welcomed by a very charming concierge who was so friendly & helpful and took me to my room. The room was very clean with a huge bed which was so very comfortable. The room was spacious with a large wall mounted TV and so many channels. There was the use of an IPod telephone offering free local and International calls to which I didnt use as it did not seem right, as I was grateful for the upgrade. There was a well stocked mini bar. Iron & Board which at some hotels, one has to phone Reception to request one. The bathroom was very spacious, with fluffy white towels, robes and slippers, and my favourite Elemis products. Excellent value for money. Reasonably priced for such a high standard. On departure everyone mentioned above was so friendly. I will definitely hope to stay again. Thankyou. ",5,2018,11,19
128,From 2 blobs to 5 blobs with aftercare!,"This is an edit to a 2 blob review that I posted at the start of November 2018. I was critical of a number of things, the room size, the cleanliness and the reception staff!    I received a phone call from Deepak, the House Manager, who listened to my complaints and was very sympathetic to the issues raised .
I received a big refund and the offer of an upgrade when I try the hotel out again .
Any institution can have problems and it’s how these problems are dealt with and resolved that is the important thing. I have been very impressed with the senior management and I will be giving the hotel a second chance in the future .
This is the first time I have ever felt moved to editing a review , but in this case it’s fully justified. 
Excellent customer service!",5,2018,11,15
128,Wow...just wow!,"What a fantastic hotel. Loved every part of it, from the checking in to checking out the whole experience was amazing.
The staff were so polite,friendly and friendly.
The rooms are fabulous and the bed was soooo comfy had a great nights sleep.
Would recommend for a business trip or a romantic weekend away.",5,2018,11,11
128,"Good first impression, sadly didn’t last. ","On arriving this hotel looks stunning,  and I was excited to see the room. Check in was busy and a little slow but the staff were polite and helpful. 
Our room was a club room, which was small but seemed to have good facilities. 
The windows to the room appeared to be the originals, which although added a character look, meant a draughty and noisy night, some secondary double glazing to mask the noise from the pub and early morning deliveries or bin collections was badly needed. 
For a 5 star hotel the attention to detail was not as expected. Little things such as missing shampoo, an empty tissue box, a robe without a tie and a constantly flushing toilet were annoyances. These issues were fixed swiftly but still detracted from our stay. I would have expected fresh milk in a hotel of this perceived standard as there was a fridge, a few UHT milks were provided, which looked like they’d been hanging around a while. The room was dark and there was nowhere to do your hair, I had to plug my hairdryer into the plug where the fridge was and  perch by the drinks area to see in the mirror. The bathroom had peeling paint above the shower and chipped corner on the cabinet for the sink. The exorbitant prices of the room service were also ridiculous. £9 for a bowl of porridge plus £5 tray charge. Tesco’s is a 2 min walk so I
recommend you get some breakfast there! ",3,2018,11,11
128,Natalie’s birthday ,Spent a wonderful night here at the Montcalm and when Vitesh (manager) found out it was Natalie’s birthday whisked away to a beautiful suite followed by bottle of Fizz. Great room and staff definitely would come back.,5,2018,11,10

128,Amazing 5 Star Stay!,"Absolutely amazing! My fiance and I were visiting London for our Engagement celebrations and the hotel kindly upgraded our room, gave us complimentary treats, we had complimentary breakfast after a slight problem that occurred in our bathroom and we received a creative towel sculpture of two swans with rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom. The beds were amazing, my fiancé and I had the best night sleep we've both had for a while! We both received a bath robe, slippers, luxury lotions, body wash's and shampoo's. This hotel offers everything you could ever need in your room and should you need anything else the helpful concierge, house keeping and reception staff are always near.
We highly rate the 5 start hotel and the service we received. We'd definitely like to visit again in the near future!!",5,2018,11,05
128,Nice touches. ,Just stayed here for 1 night on our Anniversary absolutely spot on! From check in when we were told we had a free upgrade to walking through the plush well maintained hallways into our spotlessly clean room with a complimentary bottle of fizz. Then we popped out for a walk to return to our room which had been turned down with rose petals on the bed/pillows and around the bath very nice touch. Thanks very much for making our stay that little bit better! It's those sort of things which make you stand out from the rest keep doing what your doing. ,5,2018,11,05
128,"Wow, just WOW!!!","Firstly I would like to say a massive THANK YOU to Paula who checked me in and was extremely welcoming and then Stan, who showed me to my suite. 

I stayed in the Barbican Duplex Suite which is a split level suite where the bedroom overlooks the lounge area. The design for the space was incredible, there was a classic brown leather chesterfield sofa, the bathroom had a large window that looked into the lounge and my room had a pre arranged aroma that I had picked out before arriving. 

The bar was nice we were served by a lovely french waiter who made incredible pornstar martinis.

The only negative which turned out to be a bit of adventure after a few drinks is that the lay out is a bit challenging to navigate.",5,2018,11,04
128,OK hotel. Incompetent management and commercial staff.,"We used this hotel as the base hotel for a conference we ran in May. It is high end and you pay a high end price. The layout and structure of the hotel is a bit weird as everything is governed by the structure of the original building. You have to go up and down stairs to get from the bar to the restaurant/toilets etc.

We can work with that but the people we worked with where a disgrace.

Specifically, they made a huge mistake with our bill. We paid it, some £10,000 +, in full, prior to leaving.

I was then alerted to the fact they had taken over £4,000 on my personal credit card they had on file for extras when my bank alerted me to the fact I had exceeded my personal overdraft limit. They had erroneously charged some of our bill to my personal card. I pay my credit card off in full every month from my current account which meant I was charged over £150 in overdraft and unauthorised borrowing fees.

I pointed out this error to the hotel who took 6 weeks, several phone calls and emails to rectify. Eventually they refunded the money they had taken but did not make any reparation for the additional costs I had incurred as a result of their incompetence. When I raised this with them, I was told they where very sorry about that but they would consider offering me an upgrade on my room on a future booking if there was one available.

This is how they roll. Avoid, unless you want to stay in a place like this. Probably not so bad if you want to just book an expensive room to be fair but we will not return. (Full documentation on this available).",2,2018,11,04
128,Chaotic breakfast. ,"Stayed here for one night while attending a concert in London. Seamless check in and was shown to our upgraded room by the concierge. Room was immaculate as would be expected from a 5 star establishment. Bathroom was equipped with shower gels, shampoos etc. Decor was good and the double glazing made sure we wasn't disturbed by the main road outside. 

Breakfast in the adjoining Chiswell Street Dining Rooms seemed a little chaotic with which seemed only 2 members of staff plus what appeared to be the restaurant manager. 
There was only one cup & saucer on our table for two and no replacement where the beverages were. This could also be said that of smaller tea plates for toast & croissants etc and asking the staff for items seem to put them under more pressure. There was no butter available and when replenished it was in small quantities and was soon used. Speciality bread were also on the missing list until breakfast was over. Tables took an age to be cleared and the restaurant looked a mess. Probably not the fault of the staff who were rushed off their feet. More staff needed. 
On the whole an enjoyable stay.",4,2018,10,28
128,Enjoyable overnight stay in an interesting heritage building,"This was our first stay. A perfect location as we needed to be close to the Barbican - a minute or so walking slowly.
For whatever reason we were upgraded and enjoyed a very large room. The decor was a little too OTT for us with the huge chandelier and decorative fireplace but more importantly everywhere was perfectly clean and the bed very comfortable. Furthermore the room temperature control worked well so we didn’t have to overheat ,and the secondary double glazing meant it was very quiet although we overlooked the road.
The only disappointment - which was short lived and didn’t start until 0645 - was that even in an expensive room there was little soundproofing and so through the ‘ adjoining ‘ door we could clearly hear the next door neighbour with their persistent loud cough and use of the hairdryer.  C’est la vie and hope they soon recover.",5,2018,10,23
128,"Love this hotel, disappointed in service received ","I have stayed at this hotel twice on leaguer trips to London. Stayed last week with my wife and love the hotel, location is great and rooms are fantastic.

Unfortunately I was asked to pay again for my room on arrival, I had prepaid but a hotel policy is you have to have the payment card with you. That told
me not to worry and I would have this transferred back to me. A week later I have now been told that I have to contact my old credit card provider. Not happy at all with the service and resolution as I have had I pay twice and they have now changed what they told me.

Avoid prepaying for your room. ",2,2018,10,17
128,Best hotel experience in London,"I booked a Montcalm Club room for my wife's 50th Birthday. There was Prosecco on ice, bottles of water and fruit waiting in the room for us. A very nice gesture.
The room was fantastic, it was big, the lighting in the room was very well done. Our room was on a corner and not facing onto a road, so it was one of the quietest rooms I have stayed in.
We had dinner and breakfast in the Restaurant in the hotel. Food was good and service was very good.
All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and eager to help us at all times.
I would 100% stay here again.",5,2018,10,17
128,"Attentive and Helpful Staff, reasonable price and great location","The hotel was reasonably priced and really convenient for the Barbican Centre (only a short walk down the road). The building is listed and is quite a maze, but that adds to the charm of the hotel.

The room was nice and clean and not too small. However the hand held shower might need looking at (think I was in room 150 or 105).

Concierge were very help in letting me leave a couple of boxes over the weekend for a courier to pick up on Monday which I was very grateful for as it saved me a lot of hassle!",4,2018,10,17
128,Mini City break,"My wife and decided to have a night in London, nice hotel dinner a few sights maybe some shopping. So just by a random selection we ended up at the Montcalm Brewery .
As the name suggests its a hotel in an old brewery, the building is quirky and old with great rooms. We had a mid range room, it was very well equipped quite big , high ceilings and a spectacular chandelier. The room was number 007 ! quite cool.
We could not use the bar due to a wedding, it would have been nice to have been told this on confirmation as it threw our pre-dinner drinks into a spin. We managed to find a pub close by for G nT's. Because of the wedding we unable to eat in the restaurant or use the lounge, however I had booked the Jugged Hare next door for dinner ( see separate review).
Breakfast was back to normal, although mostky full of wedding guests. Food offering was excellent, much choice of continental , traditional, fruits and a barista on hand for great coffee.
Will I use Montcalm again, probably but maybe a different location",4,2018,10,14
128,So accommodating for this new mama,"The first time being away from your new baby is always stressful. Now add that it is your first week back from maternity leave, you are traveling to a different country, and your trying to maintain your milk supply for your exclusively breastfed 5 month old. its daunting for new and experienced mom's alike. I am so grateful to the staff of the Montcalm at the Brewery London City for being so accommodating. They understood my unique (or not so unique) challenge and did everything in their power to be supportive. First they emptied the mini bar fridge so that I could attempt to save my milk in my room. When the fridge was not cold enough, they offered to store it in a private fridge in the Club room. Day and night they would come to my room and graciously take my freshly pumped milk and add it to the collection they were storing for me. Did I mention that the entire concierge team that I interacted with were also men? It was incredible service! All in all I was able to take over 60 oz of milk back home with me to the US thanks to their help. Vlad and his team are amazing and I will definitely be back.",5,2018,10,13
128,"great hotel, not the normal chain one","was there for a week, great option on in room and restaurant eating. as its in the middle of london, the noise was not as bad as i had worried about. Lovely hotel would look to stay again .
love the number of pillow options !",4,2018,10,12
128,Wonderful hospitality,"My wife and I decided to do a short trip to London to celebrate our one year anniversary and in the comments I requested for a bouquet of flowers to surprise her. Once we arrived, the front office manager personally came up to me and shared they had done much more for us than just the flowers. We received one of the best rooms in the hotel, cake, champagne, etc. He personally walked us to the room and congratulated us. Both of us are studying hotel management/hospitality, and both work in 5 star hotels, and can both easily say how impressed we were with the service. We fully recommend this hotel, not just for the fancy lobby and nice rooms, but for the welcoming smile we got when we arrived, delicious food and very kind and personal hospitality.",5,2018,10,09
128,Great setting for the city of London,Lovely hotel in a converted brewery.  Many of the rooms are set around the courtyard so are a walk away from reception through this.  We we in room 238 which proved to be a bit noisy.  Could hear many footsteps and voices from above.  Quite surprising as I had thought they would insist on good sound proofing for a conversion.  The hotel is located in the city business area and virtually all the local restaurants are closed by 11pm.  Therefore not great if you want visit the West End.,4,2018,10,02
128,Top class ,"Fantastic hotel. Stunning rustic building and total 5 star decor and staff. Rooms very spacious and very comfortable. Perfect big bed and a fantastic rainfall shower. 5 minutes after settling in on our first day we received a handwritten card from our receptionist who checked us in , Katarina thanking us for a lovely chat, wishing us a great stay and gave us a free bottle of chianti! Touch of class right there. Room service for breakfast was just as fantastic, bit expensive but expected. Location great too, 10 minute walk to Moorgate station and across the road from a Tesco express for your carry out! Fantastic experience and will definitely be back ",5,2018,10,01
128,Nice stay,"we stayed here just for one night so didnt use all the facilities

Room was spacious - airy and very smart and clean 
Bathroom was outstanding lovely size and walk in shower it was almost the same size as the bedroom - all elemis amenties 
location perfect for getting around
didnt sample the food but the bar was nice",4,2018,09,29
128,Charming hotel,"I stayed here for my birthday weekend with my partner. Everything was exceptional. We were greeted by friendly and welcoming employees who wanted to ensure that we had a wonderful stay. The room was perfect. The hotel has a great atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place.",5,2018,09,26
128,"Good,  but expected a bit more ","Nice , clean. Fairly small rooms. Expected  bit more from a five star hotel at this location. The area is not the coolest just  near by, but it is very close to old street,  spital fields and all that. Friendly service. ",3,2018,09,24
128,Amazing stay,"The location of this hotel is fantastic, 20/30 min walk from Covent Garden. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful, they made our stay extra special with an upgrade to the Barbican Duplex Suite. A truly magical stay, highly recommend",5,2018,09,24
128,Best stay in London !!,"I have nothing but positive things to say about the Montcalm at the brewery.It was my birthday and the lady at that front desk kindly upgraded us to one of the best suites in the hotel which was a nice touch and very thoughtful.The duty manager Vikash came over personally to introduce himself to us and to escort us to our room,he was an absolute delight and this hotel will be our new monthly stay when we are doing our monthly London visit.We have stayed at other montcalms which have also been nice but this one went above and beyond to make our stay and my birthday one to remember.A big thank you to everyone but especially Vikash for our stay and we will see you soon ",5,2018,09,24
128,4 stars? 5 stars? It’s all in the category ,"In 6 years of using TA to plan travel, picking the Montcalm was the hardest choice I have faced. The reviews are all over the place. So, after choosing The Brewery and staying 2 weeks, I would like to try and help make others decisions easier. 

First issue I think is the category they put themselves into: “Luxury.” They are not the Peninsula in Chicago or the Four Seasons in Newport Beach, so I think this hurts them when people are reviewing. 

Here are the important facts. Location:  excellent for business in the Square Mile. Easy, safe 10 minute walk to Moorgate or Liverpool Street tube. Lots of things around hotel; restaurants, pubs, mini-Tesco, coffee. You can walk everywhere. Rooms: certainly better than a Marriott or similar but average quality furnishings, and surprisingly no dresser. Club level includes very adequate continental breakfast, and “tea” from 5:30-7:30. Common areas: this is where they lose points trying to compete as luxury. Very pretty but very small entrance area, and limited common areas (again club level gives you access to one other area).  Staff: very friendly doorman and bell staff.  

In the end I was happy with my choice. ",4,2018,09,19
128,Good but not 5 star - avoid breakfast ,"Wonderful first impressions....great check in experience, helpful concierge service. We received a slight upgrade to Montcalm club room as it was a special birthday, and this gave us a lovely bottle of red wine in the room, a free drinks and snacks happy hour 5-8pm, and a complimentary breakfast. 
The hotel overall was very good, lovely room and bathroom, balloons and petals on the bed for the birthday, and although we didn’t have time to take advantage of the free happy hour, it was a nice option. The staff were all pleasant and helpful, and for a London hotel, we were impressed
However, I can only award an average rating as the cleanliness of the public areas was shocking in places, and the breakfast let this hotel down greatly 
It was buffet, which one does not expect from a 5 star. 
You make your own toast (cheap semi stale sliced thin sliced loaf from the supermarket) in the same toaster that I have at home (so there are queues) rock hard butter in iced water....hygienic but impossible to spread. 
The bacon is streaky, but not the crispy American kind, it’s thick and the fat not well cooked so all the slices are stuck together in a congealed mess
Beans...cheap catering ones, in thin juice 
Eggs ...asked for poached to avoid the soggy scrambled mess in the tins...and they came up barely cooked, with loads of translucent snotty white and cool yolks 
Sausages were about the best thing.. meaty but still quite tasteless.
I don’t drink hot drinks so the waitress (again, good service) did bring me a Diet Coke and they didn’t charge extra for it as they do in most hotels, so this was a plus point.  But overall, a terrible breakfast.
We didn’t pay extra for it, but they charge £24 so it is to be avoided! 
Overall, a good place to stay if you can get a cheap deal (we paid £134 a night with Booking.com) but avoid the breakfast 
",3,2018,09,18
128,Excellent hotel,"I’ve been to the Montcalm at the Brewery several times. The staff are so professional and welcoming. The rooms always have a bowl of fresh fruit alongside a selection box of teas and coffees. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff here and I highly recommend staying here. We’ve only stayed at weekends and park at the Barbican Centre which is about £9 overnight, it’s a 15 minutes walk to Liverpool Street. Will be back again",5,2018,09,16
128,Very Nice,"This hotel is a super cool former brewery with an attentive staff. It’s not in the most touristy location, which has pros and cons. Would recommend it for a stay, especially if you have reason to be in the financial district. ",5,2018,09,15
128,Amazing ,30th birthday treat for the wife . When arrived we got upgraded into a suite that was amazing with complimentary bottle of red wine. Balloons and rose petals on the bed made it that extra bit special thanks to all the staff for an amazing night .,5,2018,09,09
128,Excellent attention,Staff extremely helpful and attentive. They   even arranged upgrade and champagne when learned it was an anniversary trip. Short walk from Moor Gate or Liverpool St. Near barbican and MOL. Comfortable rooms. Sorry didn't check the restaurant. ,5,2018,09,08
128,Lovely hotel ,"Just spent two nights in this hotel. The check in process was quick and easy and felt very personal. I was escorted to my room as the hotel is a little difficult to navigate your way around. 

The room was well equipped and a little quirky as there is a huge window which allows you to see into the bathroom. There was a bowl of fruit and a couple of bottles of water in the room on arrival unfortunately the water wasn’t replaced during our stay. 

The staff were all very friendly and attentive, although when asked if there was a special reason for my stay I explained it was my birthday weekend away, in other hotels I have had a plate of chocolates or a bottle of wine but this was not the case here. 

Overall a nice hotel with attentive staff. ",4,2018,09,08
128,COMFORTABLE,"My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights whilst attending a wedding in the property.
The hotel is well decorated, clean and comfortable. It is not cheap but this is a good quality hotel in Central London. The breakfast was very acceptable and the whole place had a lovely ambience.
Only drawback is that the rooms are in a bit of a maze and we had trouble finding our room.
Also some of the staff had only a limited grasp of English but then this is London !",4,2018,09,06
128,Weekend in London,"Well first of all I would just like to say thank you to all the staff at the Montcalm for making our stay very enjoyable, and also a huge thank you to the manager who made this weekend extra special for my fiancée as we were down celebrating her 29th birthday and we had some nice surprises in the room. 

Now the hotel...one word..wow! 
Beautifully decorated from the moment you step inside the reception area all the way to your room, the atmosphere was excellent and the staff will do anything to help you. 

We required a ticket printed for a bus ride we had booked to take us to Harry Potter @ the WB Studios and the staff printed that off for us no hassle at all and no eye rolling or nothing they were just happy to help.

For most that is something so little bit to us from previous experiences when you are made to feel an inconvenience it puts you off asking. 
But this was not the case here, also after check out we were allowed to keep our bags in the hotel all day whilst we enjoyed our last day in London.  

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and it’s literally a stone throw away from the nearest subway station and in a very handy area for foot etc. 
All Bar One is at the end of the street also which is handy 😀

We will be back down in December and can not wait to book again 

Many thanks 

Ali Davidson ",5,2018,09,03
128,Definitely worth it! ,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very thorough and attentive.
I loved the extras that the hotel offered, like
choice of room scent, pillow menu and fruit in the room.
The room were spacious and the bed was the most comfortable we have ever had in a hotel, this alone is well worth the money. 
The hotel is starting to look a little tired but this is reflected in the price.
Well situated between Moorgate and Barbican so perfect for accessing the whole of London. ",5,2018,09,02
128,Quality hotel ,"We were in London for a special occasion. The hotel was very smart and welcoming the room was spacious, very clean, the bed was sumptuous, plenty of hot water with a good combined bath and shower system. The duty manager had upgraded us and was kind enough to send a hand written card and wine, it was a lovely personal touch thank you!  
We loved this hotel and the super attached jugged hare pub. A truly good find.. highly recommended... we will be back! ",5,2018,09,02
128,Excellent from start to finish!,"I have been travelling from Ireland to UK for many many years now, mostly to London yet I have never stayed in the same hotel on more than one occasion. I always like to try different hotels to see new facilities / new locations / new trends.

That will change from now following my recent stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery. While my wife and I were only there for a very short stay (1 night), I can categorically state that this hotel ticks all the boxes in terms of customer service, facilities, location, staff friendliness, cleanliness etc.  Where it also exceeds all expectations is in the very important area of communicating with their guests.

Prior to arriving at the hotel, I made contact with management to explain that my wife and I were celebrating a special wedding anniversary and had chosen to stay at their hotel.  I immediately received a response from the hotel's management expressing their delight at our choice and assuring me that they would make every effort to ensure that our stay would be memorable.  I have to say that not only did they meet my high expectations - they far exceeded them.

We arrived early to the hotel to a very warm welcome in reception from Danane (from memory) and, having previously enquired as to whether they would be able to accommodate an early check in, were duly informed that our room was ready!!

We were taken to the first floor to the WOW Suite - a suite that definitely lived up to its billing.  A four poster bed, a leather settee, a beautiful bathroom and shower area and a lovely street view together with all of the normal amenities that one would expect in a five star hotel.  My wife was delighted to find the bed covered with rose pettels and a towel display forming the number of years we were married. WOW!
  
This was customer service at its finest.

Everything else about the hotel was first class.  I especially liked the fact that it is located a few minutes walk away from Liverpool Street Station and is surrounded not only by nice bars and restaurants but also lots of very interesting places including the Brewery itself - all within walking distance.  

I cannot commend this hotel highly enough - the management are top class.  Charles and Vikrash - I thank you sincerely for making our anniversary stay memorable and look forward to visiting again in the near future.  Next time will definitely be a longer stay now that we have experienced the hotel itself and know how central it is to everything in the City of London!!

My advice is to try this hotel - you won't be disappointed! We certainly were not...",5,2018,09,01
128,Lovely 1 Night Stay,"Gorgeous. Stayed here for my boyfriends 21st birthday and although we weren’t at the hotel for much of the weekend, it was perfect. I booked a Double Deluxe room was upgraded to a larger room with heated towel rails and heated bathroom floors! Was so nice and made it extra special for my boyfriends bday. Balloons were left on the bed and someone showed us to our room to explain all the amenities. A bottle of wine was arranged free of charge prior to arrival via email with reception. Was a bit nervous about staying here with the odd bad review particularly about staff but the staff that greeted us were honestly second to none. Can’t fault the stay - Thanks!",5,2018,08,31
128,Had higher expectations,"We recently had a wedding at The Brewery and decide to stay at the hotel as would make life easier. For the price of one night I would have expected more than we got. The Brewery was quite an impressive function place but felt that the hotel did. It live up to this. 
The reception staff were a little rude on more than one occasion and to different people, they also weren’t that on the ball either. 
My hotel room was rather small although there were a few amenities in the room such as ironing board, iron, clothes brush,good hairdryer, usb sockets, and TV. 
Rooms were quite dark but were clean. Shower was a nightmare to use if you haven’t used it before. 
The breakfast was not the greatest either, not very warm, soggy hash browns, and the coffee was very bitter. 
If you have a function I would recommend staying here for ease apart from that I would look elsewhere. ",3,2018,08,29
128,Night away,Really lovely hotel. The staff are really helpful. We were upgraded for free and the room was excellent. They help with restaurant reservations. Fantastic service definitely going back again. Really lovely place to stay and very clean.,5,2018,08,28
128,Okay but not special,"Firstly, I’m a big believer in getting what you pay for. 
At last minute we got this 5star hotel at a bargain price. I’m guessing we got their less than 5star room. 

Don’t get me wrong, they were not impolite and the room was adequate. But that’s all, not special. 

So what was wrong? The room had a fusty smell (maybe not a room used often?) they tried to cover this with a plug in air freshener but it didn’t get rid of it all together. The bathroom had a dodgy light that flickered on and off all the time and the bathroom tiles needed a major re-grout. The shower wasn’t brilliant either but at least it was hot. 

All the above nothing really worth composing about, unless I’d paid full whack, in which case I’d have wanted moving. And I guess had I paid full price I would’ve been in more superior rooms. 

5*? We certainly didn’t see that level of service except for the prices for minibar extras. Lol. 

Also, if you stay here in the weekend there are not many eateries/coffee houses open. Bear that in mind.  The Jugged Hare is nice (see review) but not on a budget. Although I guess if you’re on a budget you probably would not be at this hotel. 

On the upside. The bed was extremely comfortable even the pillows caused us no issues. The room, whilst next to a lift, was quiet and reasonably well appointed (can we have larger mugs please as the tea cups only hold two mouthfuls. I had to buy my own souvenir mugs so could have a decent brew.  

Forget the £24 for breakfast. No one eats that much. Walk 10 mins straight down the road past the cinema to Smithfield Cafe and get more than you can eat for a little over £5 and get to take in the sights and sounds of working class London. ",3,2018,08,27
128,Wedding,"Stayed overnight for a fabulous wedding in the Brewery. Hotel a little mixed. Good in some aspects, reception, although pleasant, didn't seem to know what they were doing. The doorman charming, helpful, with simple politeness.",4,2018,08,27
128,Weird,"So. Came down on the bank holiday weekend due to work (yes, bad times) - have stayed many times at the Old Street Montcalm and it’s usually been ok - not great, but ok. Montcalm at the Brewery tonight-however was cheap, really cheap, like £90. When I first arrived, staff where really good. room is tiny but well furnished. Then we arrive at what wasn’t good. No bar or restaurant (the bar is a pub on the corner about 200m away - it’s insanely expensive and I say this as having just paid £8.70 for a glass of Malbec which costs less than that for a bottle at retail. Went back to room. Stopped on way in (possibly because I dared to wear  tracksuit) and was challenged as to whether I had a room. Got that out of the way got to room and it is not soundproofed and there appears to be a club over the way, the radio doesn’t work, the espresso machine advertised is not there, there is limited hot wAter. Not great. I can’t really moan too much at £90, but bear in mind this place charges £300 plus when busy",3,2018,08,26
128,Accomodation and food,"Fantastic place, stayed in the city suites and ate at the restaurant. Hospitable staff where nothing was too difficult. Ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel for both dinner and breakfast. Great food and very good service. To top it off on check out left some valuables behind in the room which were found and protected until we could return and collect them. We will definitely be staying there again.",5,2018,08,25
128,A lovely night's stay,"The room was lovely.  It wasn't huge but had everything you needed and complementary water and fresh fruit. The bed was very comfy and we both slept really well. The reception area was beautiful and all the staff we encountered were so helpful and pleasant. 
Location-wise, it is an easy 6-10 minute walk to Moorgate or the Barbican tube.
We would definitely stay again.",5,2018,08,24
128,Perfection! ,"The Montcalm Brewery is my favourite of all the Montcalm hotels! The staff are so attentive, room service is always prompt and anything they can do for you they will bend over backwards! I really appreciate the service I receive here every time! The rooms are spacious and immaculately clean, couldn’t ask for anything more! 

Thank you all so much, I’m looking forward to coming back in a few days! x x x ",5,2018,08,23
128,"5* star service, 4* rooms - The Old Brewery","Initially I stayed in a single room, which was on the ground floor. I was at the hotel for work and to study for professional exams. The reception staff and concierge were some of the best I have encountered in all my travelling and nothing was too much to ask. A lovely small touch, was there was a historic photograph on the wall which showed a picture taken from my room of the courtyard, it must be some 70 years ago or more. Mini bar and complimentary items were of a good standard. 

Unfortunately, my room was located next to a courtyard where there was some low level noise from a pre-booked party which could have caused a problem. The staff were very understanding and on listening to my issue (I needed some quiet), they moved me without little fuss, to a quieter room on the 2nd floor. There was no indication that I was being difficult and each member of staff I encountered was courteous and helpful. The rooms are well appointed but fairly small for a 5* hotel. If you've ever stayed in Rome or Paris, though, this is what to expect from an older property in the heart of the city. There is a gym, but no bench, although the CV equipment is of a good standard. The decor is good and the beds are very soft so I had a very good couple of nights sleep - I would stay again.

Top tip - if the a/c is loud at night and it's not hot- take the key card out of the holder!",4,2018,08,19
128,What’s not to like?,"I was cautious about booing two rooms at this hotel as the reviews seem to be variable.  Well, the check in was quick (efficient but not overly friendly), my room (151) was small but clean and comfortable. 

I would suggest removal of the ironing board from the wardrobe to make more room for storage as there is very little. How many people actually use it? You could provide it upon request. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel.

The concierges were all very helpful with directions, the free coffee in reception is a nice touch and it is drinkable.

You are a ten minute walk from Moorgate or Barbican tube stations. Breakfast was advertised at £22 which was excessive so I ate out.

It is a lovely old building converted to a very good standard, I will return in the future.",5,2018,08,15
128,Great service,"Stayed at the hotel for only night. Check in went smoothly. Even got upgraded to a suite! Excellent service, all the staff are very friendly.  The room was spacious and clean. The location was perfect.

Would definitely stay again.
",4,2018,08,12
128,Terrible ,"Normally I don’t bother to write bad reviews I just don’t go there again.
I feel impelled to write my review of this hotel.
From check in with in took an eternity (two separate  people checked in next to me during the time it took for our check in process ) to the time of check out it wasn’t pleasurable.
The room we had in the first floor (108) had paper thin walls, poor ventilation in the bathroom, and just enough room to walk around the bed with not much extra space.
I have stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House which is excellent and the whole experience from check in to check out is like comparing a 5 star hotel to a 2/3 Star.

128,Lovely hotel and staff,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night as we were in London celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. We booked the cheapest room but when we arrived they had upgraded us free of charge to the WOW suite and left a card, balloons and a bottle of wine in the room. The wow suite is lovely and very roomy. The bed was unbelievably comfortable, one of the best I’ve slept in. Staff were so friendly and helpful, can’t fault this place at all. I’ll definitely return here. Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2018,08,11

Only 4 stars as I didn’t have breakfast. Jugged Hare bar was was quite expensive but the the range of beers was great!",4,2018,08,07
128,Trip to london,"Lovely hotel and room and has eveything you would need is in there, ideal location to metro stations, St Pauls Cathedral and National Gallery 
Nice check in & concierge was very helpful. Breakfast is a bit expensive but plenty options else where",4,2018,08,07
128,Not calm,"Not a good experience. The room (no 10) had a very noisy air handling directly at the window, impossible to find a good sleep, even with earplugs. Was sold to me as an upgrade at arrival. I do not understand how this room can be used for guests at all. Breakfast was below average. On the positive side very friendly staff.",1,2018,08,06
128,Tiny room - great hotel,I booked an opaque rate and was given a super tiny room - but luckily it was only me. There were a few other hiccups (problems with the TV and the window) but the rest was so good and the building so cool and the breakfast so tasty that it's easy to overlook it all. Great hotel - would come back.,5,2018,08,06
128,Perfectly located for show at the Barbican,Not a cheap stay but absolutely lovely. We were upgraded from a club suite to a Montcalm suite. The extra space was nice but we never used the nespresso machine. We did make good use of the club lounge for coffees and soft drinks as well as breakfasts for our two nights though. The aircon was excellent.,5,2018,08,06
128,First class anniversary experience,"Having previously stayed here, I contacted the hotel in advance to advise them that we were celebrating a special wedding anniversary and anything that could be done to make it ""more special"" would be greatly appreciated. On arrival we were warmly greeted by the receptionist who also contacted the manager to make a personal introduction and to advise us that we had been upgraded to a Duplex suite - they were off to a great start! We were shown to our room and were delighted to receive a welcoming bottle of wine, a bowl of fruit and bottles of mineral water. After unpacking we went on our sightseeing mission around Canary Wharf and on return we were greeted with rose petals and chocolates sprinkled over the bed and bath mats in each of the two bathrooms - very romantic! What a tremendous effort made by the whole team at Montcalm at the Brewery - greatly appreciated by both of us and we will certainly remain loyal to the Montcalm brand based upon our first class experiences.",5,2018,08,06
128,A nice average hotel,"A nice average hotel running in an old building. Check in and out Experience’s was good, the gentlemen in the concierge were so helpful to guide place by using maps. The first room experience was so disappointing since the room was so small and having no windows. However they changed my room soon. Sunday no restaurant is operating for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was good, helpful staffs. Recommended for business travelers having conferences in Barbican center. 
",3,2018,08,02
128,Disappointing From The Start,"Firstly I would like to say that I initially made contact with the hotel via Email, I explained everything in my review. Since then I have waited 5 days with no response, not even a reply indicating that they knew about my complaint and were dealing with it. It seems the terrible service off the staff extends to their complaints department.

Dear Montcalm, I found our stay to be below the expected standard. The room to be frank was poor(Room 033), the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. The windows were absolutely filthy, and definitely hadn’t had a clean in weeks if not months, this coupled with various old and tired items (The curtains were threadbare, the plug in the bath was broken, the consumables holder in the bathroom was chipped and mouldy, the glasses were not hygienically wrapped, the room service menu was dirty and tatty with many spelling errors, the menu button was broke on the TV (Stuck on December 26th 2016 for some reason?).

This alongside the noise from outside, and the fact that the curtains didn’t cover the windows fully meant a broken nights sleep was finally halted at 6:00am when I was hit full in the face by blazing sunlight.

Finally, we ordered Takeaway and when I came down to collect I was met with the site of 3 employees all huddled round a phone in reception, raucously laughing and swearing about what they were watching. Forgive me for seeming a little old-fashioned but not only was this quite intimidating, it also made the atmosphere awkward as I went and collected my food. It seems the pleasant and professional staff that greeted us on our arrival clock off around midnight!!

The worst part was that as this was a special present for my wife it took the edge off what should have been an amazing night away. It certainly didn’t represent value for money.",1,2018,08,01
128,Not what we expected!,"We were attending the annual dinner/dance of my Wife's firm next door, so it seemed logical to stay here. First impressions always count for a lot, and the staff that greeted us were very good. Often, at this level of accommodation, staff can be a bit ""stuffy"", but not so here. Just the right level. The room was great, and unusual in an old part of the brewery. My wife and I stay in hotels quite often, and the breakfast must rate as one of the best.",5,2018,08,01
128,Underwhelmed,"Booked here as we were at an event literally around the corner at the Barbican, so the location really couldn't have been better.  We were looking forward to the stay but were unfortunately somewhat underwhelmed by the experience.

I booked two rooms as I was staying with my wife and two children.  There didn't appear to be a way to book a twin room on-line, so I booked two doubles and added a request that one should be a twin.  Two days before we arrived, I called to see if they could confirm the twin room.  The call centre took at least 10 minutes to answer.  Then they couldn't do anything except repeat that he couldn't guarantee a twin room and only the hotel could deal with it if there was availability.  Eventually he passed me through to the hotel, who then told me that they couldn't guarantee a twin room unless I booked a ""club"" room, and guess what (!), only reservations could do that for me.  They tried to put me back through to reservations, but no one was answering, so they promised that they would call me back.  24 hours later, no call, so I had to go through the whole process again, call the call centre, have them tell me they can't do anything, get transferred to the hotel, who to their credit then told me that they would upgrade one of my rooms to a Club room at no charge.

Arrival - we arrived at the hotel mid Thursday afternoon.  I wouldn't necessarily expect to expect check-in without a wait, but we ended up waiting a good 10 minutes.  The hotel seems to have a problem with their staff provisioning.  At the front door, in the lobby and behind the concierge desk were no less than 5 staff all standing around doing absolutely nothing while at the check-in was one receptionist handing an issue with a guest.  We waited, more guests arrived, we waited, even more guests arrived.  I think there were four or five groups waiting to check in at this point.  Eventually additional staff arrived at the check-in to handle us all.  All the time, the other staff were standing around smiling nicely, but doing absolutely nothing. (Just a hint, even if you don't have anything to do, at least try and look busy!!)

Then our receptionist found the concept that we were a family and that we would be sharing the two rooms complicated to understand.  She insisted that she wanted separate registrations details for the second room.  When I told her she could use the same name, email and address as the first, it was a concept she just didn't appear to be able to compute.  I solved the conundrum for her by crossing out my first name and changing it to my wife's first name on the second room registration.

Waiting in the reception while all this was going on also revealed another problem.  Admittedly, it was the hottest day in London for the past 50 years, but they appeared to have a problem with their air conditioning.  The hotel basically smelt damp and musty throughout.  The reception, and all the common areas, corridors and the rooms were all the same; musty and damp.  What they needed to do was open a few windows and doors and allow the entire place to ventilate a little, rather than just turning up the air conditioning.  Maybe call in their HVAC company and have the system serviced.

The rooms were had were a double and a Club.  The double was very compact.  In reality, I would have classed it as a large single.  The Club was significantly larger and actually quite a nice room.  The issue for me was that in both rooms there was literally no storage space.  I'd like to challenge the hotel manager and their partner to spend two days in the Club room and find appropriate storage space to put their clothes. There is a cupboard in the room, however, it contains the mini bar in the central part.  On the right, there are a couple of shelves, but one is the safe, and the other has coffee cups, kettle, and various coffee sachets and biscuits.  The only part of the cupboard that has hanging space contains an ironing board, which, while nice to have, can't be stored upright and has to be stored diagonally in the cupboard, thereby taking up all the space.  To actually hang a suit or dress, you need to remove it.  The coffee and tea provision in the rooms was also pretty poor.  Nescafe in old sachets that have been crushed and crammed into a presentation box.  Like something you would find in a motorway service station Travelodge somewhere on the M1.  At least get some decent coffee.

The room service menu also had a couple of typo's that just reinforce the lack of attention to detail that you should expect to have in a ""five star"" hotel.  For £17 you can have a club sandwich and ""Franch fries"", or for £26 a steak and ""French fires"".

Finally, on checking out, I find that despite the fact I prepaid the booking at the time it was made, the hotel had decided to charge me in full a second time for one of the rooms for two days.  And that took a good 15 minutes to sort out.  I understand that sometimes things go wrong with booking systems etc. but it really was just the straw that broke the camel’s back.

All in, the location was excellent, and generally speaking the staff were pleasant and friendly, but I won't be staying here again.",3,2018,07,29
128,Nice!,Met in the lobby by the biggest hydrangeas I've ever seen.  Charming Snack set up in the lobby.  Rooms are unique due to the previous use of the building. Awesome Club Room.  Charming and helpful staff.  Good location,5,2018,07,29
128,Excellent Concierge Services,"May wife and I stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery in May 2018. My wife had the need of a mobility scooter. Communicating by email prior to our arrival the Concierge recommended a reliable company for its rental. Upon its delivery at the hotel, the Concierge staff secured the scooter prior to our arrival and provided for its pickup after our departure. Their assistance made a big difference in our ability to get around and enjoy London.

Also, as an avid photographer, I expressed my desire ahead of our trip in several emails of my desire to take some night time photographs of several London locations I had pre-selected. The Concierge made arrangements for a personal driver for me to visit my selected locations. Even though it was raining that night, the driver, Mohamed, was on time, very courteous, and helpful in getting me to my photo spots.

All-in-all, our experience was greatly enhanced by the excellent services provided by Vlad and the Concierge staff.",5,2018,07,22
128,Disappointing,"Stayed here this weekend for two nights, we booked a deluxe double having reviewed the rooms online, the rooms on the website has four poster beds, in reality our room was tiny and really a single room with a double bed in it..",3,2018,07,22
128,Fantastic,"Booked a one night stay in a delux double room.
Got  a free upgrade to a Wow suite.
Lived up to its name huge room chesterfield sofa and a 4 poster bed.
The hotel,staff and restaurant impecable.
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff,all extremely helpful.
We ate in the restaurant food was excellent.
Special mention to Nari our waitress.
Would definitely stay here again.
Well done to all.",5,2018,07,22
128,Saturday night stay,"My partner and my parents stayed on Saturday as we needed a base for the Virgin London 10K on Sunday.

We arrived early Saturday afternoon and asked for an early check-in (not expecting one) and was told that wouldn't be a problem - great! We dumped our bags and went out to have a look around. When we got back to the hotel at about 7ish, they had been in for the turn down service and therefore we had chocolates (which were very yummy!) 

All staff were very accommodating and helpful when we were looking for the best route to take to get to our reservation at 9pm. Reception were very friendly and every staff member we passed we received a warm hello and a smile - I am a smiler!

The only downside was the price of the drinks and snacks in the mini bar, totally understand these would not be cheap due to the style of hotel however could have been made slightly cheaper. Other than that, a really lovely stay.",4,2018,07,19
128,Fantastic hotel.,"Stayed here for one night with my girlfriend wish it had been longer. 

Really nice hotel with fantastic rooms. Good service and attention to detail. 

It's a bit oddly placed if you want to be in the centre of london (Covent garden, strand etc) but the tube station isn't far away and it's just a 10 minute tube away. 

Thanks, would come again! 
Shaun.",5,2018,07,17
128,Nice Hotel,"The location was very good, the staff attentive and the rooms, although ""tight"", were very accommodating. The breakfast buffet was very good and the service was very good. Alexander, the concierge, went out of his way to ensure we were satisfied.",4,2018,07,12
128,"Paradox Paradox and a Shame. Great Staff, Terrible Customer Service and Billing.","Oh it so pains me to write this but anyway. I have to. Last Sunday I stayed for the first time at the Montcalm, Brewery in the City of London. I travel quite a lot so I am very used to hotels and their systems. Now firstly the hotel, the staff, reception, concierge ALL were excellent, professional and caring. I wrote a review on another travel site in a more positive vein and I shall let that be.

But here I want to tell you the after-effects. This is such a case of a hotel and its management, in particular in relation to Reservations online - how they fall far short of what is expected. No sooner had I returned home and checked my accounts as I do often - there I discovered that Montcalm has charged me TWICE. I duly called them up and the very helpful receptionist explained that my credit card was charged in full (!) as a prior-authorisation. As I had paid in full (!) at check-in and with another card (as many of us regular travellers do) this led me to being approx <less 200+ in those accounts. Of course it is not the money that is the issue, but it is the principle. The money is to be returned of course within 7 days. Yawn. The hotel will tell you it is your bank etc etc trying to patter off their responsibility. But is their fault that they overcharged you in the first place.

There was never any clarity or indication that the full-amount was to be prior-authorised either on the hotel website or the travel site I used at the time. Yes there was a note saying ‘the hotel can pre-authorise a nominal amount to validate your card’ and ‘no prepayment necessary - pay at your hotel!’ — does that sound to you like they are going to charge both the pre-authorisation and validation of your identity in full? No it does not.

This is simply terribly bad practice and I wanted to write this so that those of you who perhaps are saving up your monies to book a nice holiday and perhaps do not have as much money available as some of us do - if that happened to you indeed you might be stung badly on your holiday especially if you were staying for a week or so you could very well be double-charged. What if you were a little family who could only afford a certain amount for your trip? Without any warning you would find yourself double charged into the hundreds even thousands of dollars.

At the time of writing which is almost four to five days later I have not heard a reply in kind from the Montcalm group. The Travel site in question that I used (not TripAdvisor) has written to me and have been very helpful. They agreed that the hotel should not have taken the full amount under the advertising as presented. This should expose Montcalm for the lack of customer service and care despite my positive review elsewhere. I find it despicable. For the record this has happened only twice in the past at the Malmaison and Taj hotel chains when I paid in cash - they actually charged my card also even though I had paid in full in cash (!).

Moral of the story is this: Be careful of all these hotels and these online travel sites. They are good for reviews but be cautious of booking. Just go to the hotels directly and even call them up and clarify what monies they are taking and when. Or just pay in full with One card and do not give them another. However check your accounts after as they might still have double charged you. It is not every hotel but you will be surprised at supposedly well-reviewed hotels who will let you down in the billing stage at check-out.

On the other end of the scale if you book with Club Quarters they have the easiest most honest and straightforward booking and billing I have seen. Whether I pay in cash or card never any problems and never any over charging! This should be common practice with every hotel. Their prior authorisation validation/fee? --- 20 dollars! 

You have been warned.",2,2018,07,12
128,Not Value For Money,"This hotel misleadingly calls itself a five star luxury hotel, but in all honesty the premier inn hub for £76 that we stayed in on our last night in the city was far more impressive. The only positive of this hotel is that the bed and pillows were comfortable so a good nights sleep was had. The rest of our experience was forgettable and the check-in / check-out / any enquiry at the front desk was slow and infuriating.

This hotel is not worth the money it charges for it’s rooms. ",2,2018,07,09
128,Disappointing - Definitely not what you expect from a 5* hotel,"Short weekend stay, littered with multiple issues:
- Booked through an Online Travel Agent (OTA), was informed on check-in that although they had the reservation, that they had received no payment. Gave them the benefit of the doubt, but was then rudely told that they would need to take payment from me now, and since I booked through an OTA it was ""my fault"" and that I would need to come back the next day, speak to a manager and sort out the refund myself directly with the OTA. Pretty awful guest treatment especially when I was effectively paying twice for my inconvenience; whole check-in process including wait took 45 minutes
- Room was miniscule for a 5* hotel, and greasy marks over the furniture; in the context of the price, was an absolute joke; though admittedly the bed was comfortable
- On check-out another bizarre event where once the staff realised that the amount charged on check-in was lower than that I had paid through the OTA, they were all too willing to refund me directly, and accept the larger payment from the OTA booking. Leaves a pretty bitter taste in the mouth

Won't be staying at a Montcalm Hotel again.",2,2018,07,08
128,True disappointment,"I've stayed in many luxury hotels around London on business, including the Montcalm Royal House London, and this hotel is a true disappointment. It is so much worse than the RHL in almost every aspect I can't believe that they are run by the same company. Issues:
-Flies in the rooms (I checked more than one). How is this possible even at a 3 star hotel!?
-*Extremely* tiny rooms. Not 5 star level.
-Filthy and not well maintained rooms. Again not 5 star level.
-Furniture looks like it has been worn through with very obvious visible damage in some cases
-TV does not have cable like the RHL. BBC and the like only.
-Not sure every room is like this but I'd think this is super basic-- blinds dont even fit the window so you cannot make your room dark. This matters in the London summer when the days are extremely long and it gets light very early.
-As I write this there is a huge party finishing at 11pm and the sound proofing is non-existent so I can almost hear every word being said by the revelers for atleast the past 1 hour.

For business this hotel is definitely not recommended. Perhaps if you're going for a leisure trip and you got a great deal on this hotel then maybe it might be worth it but I wouldn't stay even then.",1,2018,07,07
128,Weekend away in London,"Weekend break in London with my dad (2 nights).

Comfortable bed, clean rooms, fresh fruit and bottled water in the room. A lovely powerful shower. Also available: sewing kit, bathroom toiletries, iron & ironing board, tea & coffee making facilities, hairdryer, slippers. A good wifi service and really quiet rooms so you can get a great night's sleep.

Super location, walking distance from Barbican & Moorgate tube stations but also 15 mins walk to St. Paul's where you can jump on a bus or the central line, or enjoy the sights.

We enjoyed room service one of the nights which was very tasty and convenient. There is a gym which isn't too big but has enough for you to get in a good workout: running machine, cross trainer, cycling machine, rowing machine, some weights and mats.",5,2018,07,06
128,Grubby and not worth the money,"Stayed for two nights as it's close to the Barbican where I was at a business event. Check in was slow, the bell boy insisted on carrying my bag and telling me how to use the TV and turn the light on. Pity they don't pay so much attention to cleaning. 

I was greeted by a cigarette butt in the bath and toenail clippings on the floor. Oh well cleaner had a bad day, but looking around these rooms need a lot of TLC. The plaster is falling off the bathroom ceiling, the taps are covered in caked on limescale, the carpets are ripped, aircon exceptionally poor.

All I can say is that the guests who think this is truly a  5* hotel must have pretty low standards. 

Not what I expected for the brand, or the price. 

On the plus side the bed was very comfortable, spotless and with choice of pillow. Linen was soft and clean, albeit only one bath towel both days. 

Decent tea / coffee making facilities and a nice touch with water and fruit, the fruit was clean and good quality. 

Room is fully equipped with slippers, robes, plenty of hangers etc with all the usual amenities. 

This has the potential to be a good hotel with a little more care on the rooms.",2,2018,07,05
128,Perfect,Amazing night at this beautiful hotel. Lucky enough to be upgraded to a wow suite and it lived up to its name. Staff all very friendly and approachable. Can find no fault at all. Also enjoyed breakfast the following morning - nice selection and again very friendly staff. Thank you! ,5,2018,07,01
128,You can get better for the money,"I'd been looking forward to staying here as the website sounded so good but was a bit disappointed to be honest. The hotel is not cheap, and that's fine if the experience is to match but i had a coffeemaker and no coffee in the room. I suppose room service could have sent some but by the time i discovered the problem I was heading for breakfast. Which was extra. There is no hotel bar as the Jugged Hare pub is effectively part of the hotel but the night i was there it was so so loud that i left my drink and went to find another pub",3,2018,06,28
128,"Nice room, slightly weird lay-out, needs some repairs.","The hotel is very large and, due to it's history, has a complex lay-out, so you get taken to your room when you check-in.   Make a note of how you get there as this will become important later on!

I had a 'club room' although it wasn't entirely clear what that meant was different. The room was nice, with a large comfy bed, decent TV and very nice bathroom.   

The view from the window was non-existent, basically into a very narrow, dark gap between two buildings.  But that didn't matter to me at all - I just kept the curtains shut. 

Now - repairs - the room felt a tiny bit shabby. 

Only one of the bedside reading light worked, many of the light switches in the room appeared to do nothing (There were 12, I think.  I found 4 that seemed to make any difference to lighting)   
The bathroom mirror light didn't work at all, and looked like it was falling off. 
The 'view-hole' on the door was falling off. 

None of those things really affected my stay, but it's worth mentioning as those things are important if you have paid a lot for a room - mine was a pre-booked business trip so I paid nothing personally.",3,2018,06,25
128,Fair Price Luxury,"Staff is amazing. People on reception, waiters, everyone. Very friendly and professional. Rooms are big enough and comfortable. Price for the stay was excellent considering the fact you are staying in luxury hotel in the center of London. Close to two tube stations. Coffee in a hotel bar is great. Everything is clean and exactly what you are expect from a five star hotel.

About negative sides. If I have to be picky, pillows are not perfect. They are too soft. However, this is probably me, and I did not ask for the pillow menu.",5,2018,06,24
128,Wonderful boutique hotel ,"Wonderful boutique hotel, with fantastic service and very accomodating. After traveling from Sydney and arriving at 10:00, they made sure there was a room available for me. 

Staff are very welcoming. 

The buffet breakfast was very good as was the coffee. 

Bedrooms were very modern and a decent size for London, although the aircon seemed to turn itself on in the early morning making the room quite chilli. Bathroom was immaculate. 

There’s a coffee cart opposite the hotel which serves the best coffee in town! Walking distance to some nice cafes and restaurants. ",5,2018,06,23
128,Gorgeous room. Shame about the squeaky bed! ,"Romantic night away for two, absolutely stunning room. Great location and amazing breakfast. 
As we mentioned to the reception at checkout, unfortunately the bed was the worst! Comfy but it sounded like a sofa bed! Squeaky every time you moved! 
Also, the seems to be no lights to turn off in the corridor. We had to put a towel by the front door to stop the corridor light blinding us all night!! 
But can’t fault the decor! It was beautiful. ",4,2018,06,22
128,Nice staff but breakfast room crash,"I have booked here 4 times but last night was my first stay (due to works they have often moved me to a nearby property which was really quite fine by me). 
On checking in the kindly receptionist asked if I would accept a smaller room with a discount. I did and it was fine: 
+ nice bedding
+ good climate control (cold enough, which I love)
+ functioning iron, TV, plug-ins, etc.
- mediocre shower pressure.

Things fell apart at breakfast. The hurried staff there was working valiantly but I felt guilty/intrusive asking for a coffee and had to leave before it came (if it ever did). The buffet itself was ok (although I'd hoped to order something healthier from the card as promised the night before at check-in) but since the staff were insufficiently numbered to clear tables and take orders I left a bit frustrated: at that price a coffee should be possible. I would have felt a terrible princess ordering from the card.
I wanted to get the waitresses name to ensure my complaint was not with her (but with the management for under-staffing) but alas she did not have a name-tag(?)",3,2018,06,21
128,30th Birthday Treat,What a fantastic place to stay in London! Great location and even better hotel.  The staff were lovely and looked after us really well and the room was clean and comfy. We will definitely be returning. Thank you Montcalm.,5,2018,06,19
128,Central Location Historical Setting,"The City of London was mapped out by the Romans and its Roman walls were repaired and  maintained by successive kings and conquerors.  It still marks the financial center of the world, and after WW2 it has been constantly rebuilt with steel, concrete, and glass.  This hotel is in an older building that survived WW2 and has character.  Rooms were luxury level, although due to antiquity each room is different, and there are lots of steps and stairs, not handicapped friendly.  We had a great stay here, partly because of the religious history of this part of London.  It is a couple of blocks from St. Giles at Cripplegate (the Cripplegate was one of 7 ancient gates into The City) which is a nearly thousand year old church still operating.  It was a center of religious free thinking and often had Non-conforming, Puritan, Independent Christian thinkers.  John Bunyan of Pilgrim's Progress, John Milton of Paradise Lost, worshiped or were buried here or in the Bunhill Cemetery also just a couple of blocks from the hotel.   Daniel Defoe of Robinson Crusoe, and William Blake poet and artist, Susana Wesley (the mother of Methodism's John and Charles Wesley), all had to be buried there as they refused to ""conform"" to the limited reformations of the state Anglican church that refused them burial in the 100 other churches of ""The City"", because all wanted a better, purer Christianity.  The original Methodist chapel of Wesley is next to the Bunhill Cemetery.  So this is a great spot for those interested in the progress of the Protestant reformation of English Christianity. There were even 7th-day Sabbath Baptists worshiping in the Cripplegate ward.  And for Methodists staying here would like be staying in a Protestant Vatican, at the heart of their denomination's history.  
The Museum of London is also in walking distance, free and well worth a few hours.
It is midway between Moorgate and Barbican Underground Stations, although neither station has escalators or elevators, so unless you are fit and travel light enough to climb stairs with your baggage, you may wish to arrive by cab?",4,2018,06,18
128,"Okay hotel, not particularly luxurious for 5 star ","Rooms are a little dated, scratched up wooden desks etc, double beds are comfy but mine was rather small (I was staying on my own but a couple might find it a little more cosy I imagine). Also oddly I was given an access room (but not informed before hand) which I didn’t realise when I checked in (as I dropped my luggage and didn’t return until midnight) so struggled to use the bathroom with everything being so low...

It’s an okay hotel, but didn’t feel 5 star and If other rooms are like my one, they could do with a bit of modernisation with decor. I visited based on seeing reviews of hotels near Liverpool Street but personally I wouldn’t stay again. ",3,2018,06,18
128,A beautiful hotel in the heart of the City.,"A wonderful modern take on a beautiful historic venue. 

Excellent welcome from professional, courteous staff who were hugely helpful throughout my stay.

Good food, a little on the expensive side, but that’s to be expected of a hotel of this quality in this location.

Comfortable room, with everything you need (even Sky Sports!!), the only downside is that the double room was a little small. Very comfortable, though!

A really enjoyable experience on the whole, and look forward to coming back again. ",4,2018,06,17
128,A bit tired...,"The Montcalm had lovely attentive staff, who went above and beyond during our stay. We even had a complimentary room upgrade. 

The room was lovely, but tired. Grout had worn away from the bathroom floor tiles and there were a few marks/stains that I think were due to age rather than level of cleanliness. 

It was comfortable and clean and we received a 5 star service but, the decor let it down. This is nowhere near a 5 star hotel.",3,2018,06,17
128,Good Value,"We stayed at The Montcalm because we were in London for the first time and knew that we would not be spending a lot of time in our room  The room price for this hotel is great (almost unbelievable) and our room was clean and modern.  We were upgraded to another level room, but it was still smallish; like I said, we didn't spend much time in it.  The staff was efficient and friendly.  It is easily accessible to several tube stations and a good location for visiting the Tower of London and St. Paul's.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,06,14
128,Stayed because of my daughters wedding at The Brewery,"Had a club room on the first floor which was good in design and a comfortable bed. Radio on the TV didn’t work nor did the old fashioned Bluetooth unit next to the bed. Breakfast was excellent and the service very good indeed considering there was over 30 of us for breakfast. The real poor part was the central reservation based overseas where the staff are very poor and do not speak good English, so try and speak to the hotel itself for bookings and enquiries.",4,2018,06,13
128,Value oriented business hotel,"I asked for a quiet, easy access room, since I read that many of the rooms at the Montcalm require a bit of a journey.   My room was in a good spot, and was generally quiet except for my first night when there was an event behind the hotel so there was a ton of noise when people exited the party or hung out in the courtyard.  The service in the hotel was attentive.  It feels new and clean, but the hotel is not luxurious.",4,2018,06,09
128,Good location for East London districts and comfortable stay,"We found this hotel to be well located next to the Barbican and close to busy East London districts like Hoxton/Shoreditch. It is close to Liverpool St and Old St tubes as well. Check in and departure was friendly and efficient, and staff seemed welcoming. The room was a good size with all you need, overall it was a fine stay.",4,2018,06,06
128,Never meet your heroes,"I'd always wanted to stay here after attending an event in the Brewery. So when I was working nearby I thought it was a great opportunity. Sadly it wasn't a great experience.

Check-in was good (apart from the leaking ceiling), the staff were friendly and I was excited when they told me that I had been upgraded to 'the best room in the hotel', a duplex suite.

It was quite a walk to the room, up and down lots of stairs, not the end of the world though.

The room was a bit of a disappointment, the lighting wasn't great and the room could probably do with a refurb. I'd be very disappointed if I had paid £500/night.

Top tip. Always check the whole room before you get your PJs on! Sadly, I noticed most of the problems too late and didn't really want to get a member of staff to tell me I could change rooms at 1am.

First issue I noticed was that the upstairs bathroom stunk of sewage, it was horrible. The shower is in that bathroom and is small and dark.

There are 10 light switches on the upper floor alone, figuring them out was harder than it should have been!

The HDMI connectors don't work, so you can't watch your ipad/phone on the TV.

There is an emergency exit door next to bed. Quite a bit of noise until late at night including an elevator - not too bad though.

The AC suddenly started rattling loudly next to the bed at 1.30am. After spending half an hour changing all the settings, then eventually switching it all off (one upstairs, one down), it still rattled!? Not a great night.

There was water dripping from the extractor (see pic), which I noticed when it dripped on my ear!

Reception take £50 when you check-in. They don't preauthorise (as they told me), they actually take it, and apparently refund it after two to three days - we will see.

When I reported all the issues in the morning I got a pretty poor 'sorry'. I then struggled out of the doors with a Peli case, while two doormen stood chatting.

MANY better places to stay for less money.",2,2018,06,04
128,Tiësto ,Stayed here before hence why we came again staff very friendly and rooms fabulous nice and clean very spacious will be back again no doubt near to tube station to go into London centre and also near to pubs and restaurants.,5,2018,06,01
128,Very disspointed stay,We've booked this hotel du to its reviews. It was our 24th anniversary present and we wanted to celebrate pur Londond trip with a bit of luxury. It was a 2 night stay.Unfortuntely it was a let down. When we arrived we got complimentary fruit and 2 bottles of water. Oh if you want water again you need to ask. That service doesn't come automatically with this establishment. The room was quite small and the bed not big enough. The curtains if made to measure didn't close just below the window so the light from the yard was right in my face which made sleeping impossible. We put cushions and blankets in front of it to get some sleep in the end. The room has a lot of light switches and lights. You need to take a course to figure out which is for which. I guess coming into your room and getting your bed ready is the added service and chucking some chocolate on your bed. The next morning we went to explore London but asked the reception to deal with the curtains whih they promised they wood.When back at the hotel at night it wasn't dealt with. Also no fresh water was available. I had a bath and when looking to the right starred right into to toilet...Head level when lying in the bath. Well the toilet had not been cleaned for a wile for sure. The marks don't come from one visitor. The bathroom in all needed a good clean and makeover.the safe in the room did not work.It was late so we left the complainig until the morning. We also found a survey in the room left on our bed but no pen to actually do it or leave comments. The next morning at check out we mentioned the problems and the toilet but the reception was not really interested and also said she didn't mind that we left no feedback. Our feedback wasn't wasn't wanted in the first place i guess. I did want to show the photos but they didn't want to see. It's not worth the money. We've stayed in better 3 stars!,1,2018,06,01
128,"Good hotel, good location","Right in the city of London (The Barbican and an EC postcode), very smart hotel with a very smart room.  Actually further from Parliament and the like than you would think and not that many hotels bang next door as you would expect in London but still a good location.  Close to Smithfield which can be good for hearty breakfasts during the week.  Not a bad breakfast in the hotel though.

The Montcalm doesn't have a bar - you get directed to the rather expensive pub next door.  And they chase you for Tripadvisor reviews!",5,2018,05,31
128,Haven’t even unpacked....,"Another overpriced disappointing hotel in London. Booked through company website and they use that old trick of quoting room rates without VAT. So now paying 170 a night for a room where you can hardly swing a cat (not that I bought one)

Very disappointing and hope I can go back to one of the budget hotels like Premier Inn next time where you get a reasonable room for a reasonable price. First and last time at the Montcalm",2,2018,05,30
128,Nice stay but below average breakfast,"We booked this hotel at the last minute for our Wedding Anniversary day out in London to avoid the train ride home late at night.
We were pleased to book this hotel at a very reasonable rate and  my husband had  left a message to say it was our Wedding Anniversary. Despite being allocated  a bigger room on arrival, I was disappointed not to find any acknowledgement of our Anniversary, neither at Check-In nor in the room.
Generally, in a hotel of this class,  I would have expected at least a message,card or a little ""treat"" as experienced elsewhere on previous occasions.
The room and bathroom were spacious and clean with nice Elemis products in the bathroom. The bed was super comfy and large and we had a good nights sleep.
A big letdown was the breakfast though, especially at a cost of £19 each. The hot dishes were not fresh and tasted boiled rather than grilled and were of a similar quality to a ""Premier Inn"" breakfast at less than half the price that we had a few weeks back.
The smoked salmon was tasty and the poached eggs nicely cooked to order but the presentation of the cold dishes e.g. ham, cheese, salami etc left a lot to be desired. I am also  still baffled that you apparently had run out of teapots, even though there were less than 20 guests eating breakfast at that time.
All in all a nice stay and a convenient good nights sleep for the price we payed, but had we payed the going weekday rate I would have been very disappointed and the rating would have been no more than 3*.",4,2018,05,28
128,Excellent service.,"During my recent trip to London on the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, I decided to book a stay at this hotel. The pictures on display were definitely the selling point as was the positive reviews I had read. And I was not to be disappointed. I frequently visit London and have stayed in many hotels but the Montcalm is definitely the best one thus far. 

The service was above excellent and as hard as I try I am unable to find any faults. All staff members who I came in to contact with were always smiling, friendly and helpful. At the initial check in - I had left my luggage having arrived at the hotel 4 hours before check in. I was told at reception that I could return before 2 for the check in and that my luggage would be delivered to the room. On my return I was asked by the concierge if I had stayed at the hotel before - to which I replied the negative. Instead of merely giving me directions to my room, he personally walked me right to the door step. On entering the room, my bag was already placed neatly on the luggage racks, with our coats hung up in the wardrobe. 

The room was very clean and in good condition. Air conditioning was in perfect working condition as well. The bathroom was slightly small - but had excellent facilities including a rainfall shower. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. Definitely made for a good nights sleep. 

The highlight however was definitely the excellent service from all the staff at the hotel.",5,2018,05,28
128,Wonderful stay,"A wonderful, lovely hotel, in a great part of London.

Aside from the historical value of the building, the place is simply great - it had the largest bathroom I've ever been to in a London hotel room (and I've been to quite a few).

All kinds of little things are well thought through, the staff are uber friendly, and the location is simply perfect - will definitely repeat, and will try other locations as well.",5,2018,05,27
128,my third visit,"By now I'm starting to feel like a regular. We love this hotel and always try to fit a night or two here when in London. It's a real treat to stay here. We had a Club Room. There's everything you need and more in the room and all beautiful quality. Breakfast here is absolutely brilliant. Personally i prefer the cold buffet items over the regular hot items.
Without question we'll be checking in again on our next visit",5,2018,05,26
128,One night stay- Birthday,"Once again amazing! My stay was organised by Deepak and Alice as always and another birthday well spent. Stayed in a wow suite with breakfast in morning and access to club lounge for one night. Loved the rooms and always have done- I think I've stayed in every wow suite in this hotel now and this one was my best I think room 228 I believe. Again balloons on bed with rose petals and a bottle of champagne with chocolates to start off my birthday was great. They defo make you feel welcome. In the evening theirs a turn down service where they leave you some chocates too. Fruit and water in room too as well as a mini bar. It's not too expensive compared to some hotels but if you find it expensive theirs a Tesco across the road. The staff at reception and especially the concierge team will go beyond to help and always happy to do so, nothing is ever to much trouble. The day we checked out we was flying out and the hotel was kind enough to print out my boarding passes. Every visit to this hotel just gets better and better and I always leave happier and relaxed than when I arrive. I can't wait for my next say and wish it's longer than one night. Great location near liverpool street station (central line) perfect to get around london and was perfect for us to get to stansted airport. Breakfast always lovely again you can ask for extra and they will always  accommodate, different choices. Thanks again to all staff 😊",5,2018,05,24
128,"Good location, great service and it’s very own pub!","My partner and I booked the hotel to celebrate our third anniversary and were extremely pleased with the standard of the room and overall service. The complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates, with hand written card was a particularly nice touch. 

The breakfast was good and the staff were very friendly. Because it’s an old brewery building, there are quite a lot of twists and turns to find your room and I’m not sure how suitable it would be for a wheelchair user, but overall we loved it and would certainly stay again. ",5,2018,05,21
128,Absolutely lovely. ,"We stayed here recently to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, having stayed at M at Montcalm (Shoreditch) for our honeymoon. We absolutely adored M so we thought we’d give The Brewery a try - and we weren’t disappointed. It is such a beautiful building and the staff couldn’t have been more welcoming and friendly. 

The room was situated in London Suites across the road from the Brewery itself and was very stylish and spotlessly clean. The bed was by far the most comfortable we had ever slept in and our choice of memory foam pillows was a good one. Being a very hot day the room was understandably a little warm when we arrived but the AC worked quickly to cool everything down which we were very grateful for! 

We only stayed one night but we wish we’d stayed longer. It was just lovely and we will definitely continue to celebrate our anniversaries with Montcalm! It’s our favourite place to stay in London. ",5,2018,05,20
128,One night stay for event at The Brewery,Really nice traditional Hotel in good location for city functions.  If you are attending a function at The Brewery and don't fancy the train or taxi journey home then stay here.  It seemed very good value to me especially as I was upgraded to a suite that was great. Very comfortable large room and nice bathroom.  The Hotel has traditional character about it.,4,2018,05,18
128,Lovely little hotel - unique architecture and atmosphere - good value,"This hotel has a unique feel to it - cool architecture as it used to be a brewery. The rooms were cool, a bit rustic but modern, and a fun comfortable stay. The lighting was nice and the location was great. True, a bit of a maze, but you'll find your way eventually - that's part of the fun.

Happy with our stay here.",4,2018,05,16
128,They lit the fuse!,"Having stayed here several times before, and having rated the experience as excellent, unfortunately, this time i can not give the same comments. 
On arrival to the check in desk, i can only say they lit my fuse. After being asked more than seven times what my name was, confirmed the girl behind the desk should not have been there. My opinion was she had not had sufficient training to be in that position.
Knowing the breakfast here is superb, once again the fuse burned harshly, when going for toast i found something called a toaster (took all of 6-7 mins to produce a
warm untoasted slice of bread, and a Que 4 people long all waiting for this poundland toaster to toast bread) 
what restaurant manager would allow this ! .
Add to this the sausages have changed taste, the hash-browns were soggy and tasted
terrible, the coffee top ups were none existent.   

As i stated, i have stayed here several times before and i know the service i have had has been superb, therefore this review means something is going wrong, either the managers are failing or the staff are unhappy.",2,2018,05,15
128,Exceptional ,Booked through booking.com Easy to get to and a great location even if walking into central London. I parked in the Barbican Centre Carpark overnight and this was cheap enough. About £14 from memory and a 2 minute walk to the hotel. Greeted like royalty when I arrived and the hotel is beautiful. Checkin was swift and a concierge took my bags and escorted me to my room in a building opposite across the road. Set in a Victorian style town house with its own reception. The room was on the ground floor and just stunning. Clean and well decorated. The only downside was that room service happened to drop off some chocolates when I was right in the middle of intimacy with a friend!! She insisted on coming in despite my objections and the fact I was wearing nothing but a hastily wrapped bed sheet! Killed the moment but was funny. ,5,2018,05,14
128,Beautiful rooms but a maze of a hotel!,"I stayed here on a business trip for 3 nights. Overall my room was clean, decor was beautiful, and the staff was extremely helpful and attentive. Unfortunately the hotel layout was a bit of a maze and I found myself having to exit through the bar every morning as the signs directing me to reception/main entrance were incorrect or rather not updated while they were undergoing renovations in certain areas of the hotel. It was strange to take an elevator a floor or so and then need to exit and walk up or down a flight to get to my room. Check out took a bit longer than expected as a result of a large group checking out at once. Overall would stay here again but would hope they make some improvements in the meantime.",3,2018,05,13
128,Terrible Management,"We stayed here for 2 nights a few weeks ago and were looking forward the stay. On arrival, even tho I paid for the room 2 weeks in advance, I was told that they were going to transfer us to another of their hotels! This is terrible as we booked this hotel for the location.
The worst part of this was when we asked to speak to the manager, Remus [-], he didn't apologize and was very smug and condescending, we were shocked at his professionalism. 
I have worked in hospitality and have never been treated this poorly before.",1,2018,05,08
128,My favourite hotel,"Luxury, attention to detail, attentive staff. Just had our 6th visit to this Montcalm hotel. We like to treat ourselves to a stay in London every few weeks and found this hotel a year or so ago. Fabulous room as usual. Can't wait to return. My only grumble is that breakfast is expensive.",5,2018,05,07
128,A 40th to remember!,"A huge Thank you to the hotel and staff. A stay here was a special present for my sister and the hotel staff made it a birthday to remember. My sister was so happy with the hotel and they made it very special for her and her husband.
Great location
I would have no hesitation recommending the hotel.
Thanks again 10/10",5,2018,05,07
128,"Great hotel, comfy beds, good location","We stayed here for 4 nights as a couple to round off our holiday in England. The hotel is lovely, staff were very obliging and the rooms were clean and very comfortable. We booked a club level room and appreciated the continental breakfast each morning. We had quite a lot of baggage and found the room was spacious enough to spread out without feeling cramped and the bathtub was a welcome benefit at the end of a long day walking around London. As for the location, its a 10 minute walk from Barbican station (look out for the Banksy's on the way!), there's a great looking pub on the corner (we didn't get there) and within walking distance (15 mins) to Jamie's Fifteen restaurant. All in all, a clean, comfortable and welcoming hotel.",4,2018,05,06
128,Great experience,"As many of the reviews have indicated, this is a lovely hotel. The rooms are very well appointed and the beds comfortable. I’d like a proper king mattress next time (seriously, what is it with these hotels and their single beds with mattress covers) the room fragrance was too strong but unlike poorer hotels you had complete control of things. Next time I’m in the area I will stay here for sure. Great staff, room and facilities. ",5,2018,05,04
128,Ok...,Beautiful old building. Interesting history and location. Hotel itself was ok. Service in advance was poor. Check in waiting time was long. Room was very poky. Gym was tatty and poorly equipped. Left a lot to be desired for an expensive hotel. ,3,2018,04,30
128,A hotel that cares,"I stayed one night in the decadent two storey Barbican Duplex Suite, allowing for some productive work from the lounge and desk downstairs and a silent, comfy retreat upstairs. The marble bathroom on the lower floor came with a large bath, great for soaking in with Hermes products, and heated flooring. The room also included access to the Club Lounge which was fantastic for getting some work done, nibbles throughout the day and a few cheeky drinks from 5. Also part of the hotel, the Jugged Hair is a lovely British pub with great food, service and vibe. Not all rooms at Montcalm at The Brewery come with a bath, so double check at booking if you'd like one, and I did miss having a robe to wrap up and relax in. But what I valued the most with this hotel was the level of care from staff to ensure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. If there's something you're not happy with at Montcalm London City, or that you require specifically, my experience leads me to feel that it will be received and handled with sincerity and care.",5,2018,04,30
128,Nice Hotel buy ....,"The main reception area had a wow factor, as expected. The bedroom nicely furnished and stylish. The bed was too small for two people over 6ft to share, so sleeping was uncomfortable.  The temperature of the room was quite warm, annoyingly the AC was inefficient and noisy so we had to turn it off.  There was a tiny window in the room which meant we had no natural light. Breakfast was not included so unable to comment of quality of food. ",3,2018,04,30
128,"Easy, good service & comfortable","Clean, comfortable room.
Excellent location with excellent, secure parking at the Barbican next door. Tube station within 5 mins walk.
Cool hotel, based in an old brewery. Would recommend. Great value for money in central London.",5,2018,04,29
128,Miss,We had a really lovely time here. A great hotel and would recommend. Lovely and clean. Good location near to underground and the staff were helpful and polite. We liked the pictures of the old brewery in the room,5,2018,04,29
128,Nice hotel,"On check in we were upgraded to a club room, concierge is very attentive.

Disappointed that unlike the sister hotel Montcalm royal London no nespressco machine in room no poor either.

Room was large, as was bathroom, disappointingly no bath!

Elemis shower gel/shampoo/conditioner/body lotion.

Hotel is beautifully decorated, the bar jaggered Hare isn’t actually attached you have to go out to get to it.

It was ok but no pool definitely made it less appealing than the sister hotel.

Nice and quiet rooms.",4,2018,04,25
128,Reasonable but slightly disorganised check in ,"First up I thought this place was fine. It has some high end touches such as one of those waterfall walls in reception and a decent range of complementary items like fruit and water in the room and so on.
I stayed in a single room which is very small, though not uncomfortably. It doesn’t really have a window.. more a high up point that allows light in without being able to see out.

All in all then fine and probably standard pricing for the area.

Only thing that was irritating... at check in there was one person trying to manage 2 people separately checking in. And dealing with other problems.  Meanwhile concierge had two people dealing with one customer. As the customer finished the two staff stood behind the desk chatting and generally having a sociable time. A little irritated I called out “would one of you like to check someone in?” Which it turned out was fine, and happened. However if I had not asked then these two, plus some other staff who seemed to solely be standing about, would have left their colleague to deal with us all.

I would stay here again.  But Montcalm please understand that people checking in love to be seen quickly and efficiently... we shouldn’t have to prompt your team.

",3,2018,04,24
128,Fabulous,"I had the pleasure of staying one night at the Montcalm @ the Brewery in London City. 
From arriving to departure I could t have had a better stay. The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the room and facilities were excellent. 
I was upgraded into the Wow Suite upon my arrival . A very nice gesture . It’s fair to say that come Monday morning I didn’t want to leave !",5,2018,04,24
128,Luxurious and super value,The room was a little small but beautifully put together. Loved the window from the bathroom which enabled me to watch TV whilst bathing. The bathroom was simple luxury with many extras such as high quality products to use. Loved the pub which is attached to it and easily accessible via the hotel itself. I spilt red wine on an expensive cream sweater and the bar staff could not have been more helpful in ensuring it was not ruined. We chose to eat in the restaurant attached the next evening and it was excellent. I can't fault this place; probably our favourite hotel in London.,5,2018,04,22
128,Totally 5 star!,"We had an exceptional weekend to celebrate our ladies birthdays. The rooms, breakfast and especially the service provided by the staff was totally 5 stars!
Thanks very much and we hope we’re back there soon.",5,2018,04,22
128,Quiet comfortable away from bustle!,"Quick overnight stay in London for a show. Old brewery architecture delightful, pleasant inner courtyard. Impressive reception.
Comfy bed, very large. Spacious room, lots of windows. Very well appointed, modern and luxurious. Lots of lighting options.
Easy free Wi-fi.
Location a little out of the way. Lots of lifts, stairs and walking to room.
Window latches fiddly and didn’t do job really.
Shower over bath not ideal, and very weak.
Overall though, a really nice hotel to stay in. We probably had a better than normal room, and it was a beautiful day.",4,2018,04,22
128,How to get it right,"Booked a Wow Suite to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Hadn’t stayed in the hotel since December as my company doesn’t get Montcalm rates any more but like I’d never been away. An amazing greeting from Alice on checking in, an absolute asset to the Hotel, can’t speak highly enough of her. They asked on reception if it was a special occasion and mentioned it was my wife’s birthday, popped out for a few hours and when we came back there was a bottle of bubbly and balloons waiting for her, fantastic! Staff accomodating, room spacious and spotlessly clean, had club lounge access and popped in for half an hour for a G&T and some nibbles, we were the only ones in there but a great bonus before heading out for an evening meal.

I can’t recommend this hotel enough, if i’m In London on a leisure trip it’s always try top option, I see a few negative reviews, I have had some experiences in the past (broken iron, noisier rooms etc) but they’ve always gone out of their way to resolve.

Thank you Montcalm, thank you Alice, another amazing stay",5,2018,04,20
128,I realy wanted to enjoy and like this place but it was a huge let down,"I booked two rooms back in February for a two night stay here.  I stay in hotels a lot and, as as the conference was also at this hotel, i decided to treat myself and a colleague and stay here.  I had just spent two nights at an IBIS in Sheffield before coming here so was expecting both a treat and a huge difference in service and quality.

How wrong i was.  

The hotel had emailed me in advance welcoming me and asked me for my pillow choices from their pillow menu - i responded but when i checked in they claimed never to have received the email. 

Two rooms, were booked on the same day at the same (expensive) price,  My room was one of the smallest hotel rooms i have ever stayed in whilst my colleagues was what could be described as an average home bedroom size.  I get all the stuff about 'historical building with challenges' but hotels need to design rooms that are a decent size worthy of a 5 star hotel and 5 star prices.  With a 5 star hotel and a 5 star price, you expect a 5 star experience and this certainly didnt provide that. Only two spare powerpoints in the room and one of those was at floor level.  The room was inward facing and this meant that it was generally dark and gloomy.  There were no draws to unpack your clothes into and very limited wardrobe space so i spent the two nights still living out of my suitcase.  It was the usual story of squeeze everything that is needed for a 5 star room into the smallest space possible to make it even smaller.  

Other people have commented about the 'route march' to the rooms and how confusing that can be - i didnt have a problem with that as it add to the charm but internal building signage could be improved.

As usual for a 5 star hotel, there is a very (overpriced) minibar + jars of nuts and harribo at £5 a pop.  However check the jars carefully, the useby date on one of mine put it three months out of date - I thought i was paying for quality service paying attention to detail. 

You get nice bathroom toiletries but it was a very compact bathroom 

I spent two nights at a IBIS and then straight after i spent two nights here:  In terms of value for money, quality of service, experience and attention to details (not to mention a decent room size) The IBIS wins hands down.  I so so wanted to enjoy a 5 start experience after paying a premium price but was left very disappointed - Id rather have stayed at the Premiere Inn down the road..",2,2018,04,17
128,Excellent all round,A clean and comfortable hotel in the heart of the Barbican with friendly and and helpful staff. Super breakfast and excellent value for money on a Saturday night in London. Close to the tube station with quiet rooms available.,5,2018,04,16
128,A Huge Disappointment,"We stayed two nights in a Club Room (306) 8th to 10th April 2018.  On arrival, a receptionist informed us that we had booked a standard room without breakfast at a rate of £170 per night.  We advised her this was incorrect, that we had booked a Club Room with contintental breakfast served in the lounge.  She insisted she was correct.  Her more senior colleague stepped in and showed her that we were correct.  This lady then took over the check-in as the first had walked off in a sulk.

We were shown to our room by a porter who stayed an uncomfortably long time showing us ridiculous details such as where the wardrobe door is and how to open it; such an obvious ploy to obtain a tip.  Really, he wouldn't leave.  The room was perfectly acceptable, clean and for London, reasonably spacious.  There was a hole smashed into the plasterboard wall, which I found quite shocking.  The hotel management sell me a Club Room and it has a hole in the wall?  The window frames were dirty, there was mould from the damp caused by the leaking gutter outside and the green net curtain was dusty.  Please see photographs.

I estimate that approximately 80% of the hotel staff are from one Eastern European country.  They emerge in the morning like rabbits from the basement of a property opposite the hotel.  Their uniforms don't fit them.  At least 50% cannot communicate in the English language to even a reasonably competent level.  At 6pm one evening, a female knocked on our door and spoke what she thought was English - four times my wife and I tried but we couldn't understand a single word.

The Club Lounge is bizarre.  Canapés and drinks are available there but there are no plates or napkins!  One has to remove a saucer from a cup and use that to take a few nibbles back to one's table.  The coffee machine has only decaffeinated capsules, but a member of staff will go away for ten minutes and make a normal cup.  The Lounge is used as a thoroughfare by staff members so at times it's like a railway station, with constant comings and goings.  Butter is left out on tables all day and tables are not cleaned - we saw a couple leave a table only for the waiter to reset it without wiping it down.  He brushed crumbs onto the floor.  The concierge couldn't give you directions to the Jugged Hare, much less direct you to local attractions.

On check out the manager, a Mr Vikash Kooblall, asked how was our stay.  We were in a hurry and gave a brief synopsis.  He promised to 'make everything right on our next stay' with what he called a 'Wow' experience.  We shrugged and exchanged mail addresses.  The matter was taken over by a Mr Charles Campen, who offered us a standard room for £239 at our next stay in London.  The reviewer who described this place as 'All Fur Coat And No Knickers' was spot on - it's a badly managed, Fawlty Towers type of experience with untrained staff.  Poke under the veneer and see what you find.",2,2018,04,16
128,Very nice hotel in walking distance from attractions,"This was a very nice surprise 
Safe and clean 
Courteous and efficient Hotel
The room was equipped with a gps unit and free phone that came in very “handy” 
One could do all and avoid overcharges 
Happy to recommend ",4,2018,04,15
128,"Lovely hotel, Couldn't fault it","We are not normally ones for leaving reviews, good or bad, but on this occasion I feel compelled to leave feedback as we were so taken with this hotel.  Our original booking through Booking.com was for 2 rooms at the London City Suites which is over the road from the main hotel but upon arrival we were told we would be in the main hotel, The Montcalm at the Brewery, and had been upgraded.  Our room was a good size for London with a fab bathroom, very clean and everything provided that you could require.  Didn't use room service and ate out for breakfast but thats not unusual as when we visit London we don't plan to spend any longer in our room than it takes to either wash, change or sleep.   Staff were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful at all times. Its a little out of the way for most of the touristy sites but there is a tube station just a few minutes walk away.  It was also much cheaper than anything else I could find on the date we were visiting.  If we had been in the room that we originally booked then maybe it would be a different review altogether but based on our experience this weekend  I would definately choose to stay here again on my next visit to London.",5,2018,04,15
128,“All fur coat and no knickers”,"I had booked 9 rooms as I had my senior team over in London from all corners of the world, and wanted to make sure they had a comfortable, luxurious trip.

I had stayed at this hotel for 1 night back in 2011 not long after it opened and it was a good experience with plush boutique rooms with aromatherapy lamps and other nice touches like water and fruit in the room and Elemis bathroom products.

I had to pay upfront 8weeks in advance (c.£9,000). No problem, because I thought I was getting good rooms.

When me and my last guest came to book in we were told that we will have to go to their sister hotel which was a 2 min cab ride away. I said this was not good enough as I had a block booking and wanted to keep us altogether, particularly as I was the only local and knew my way around. I was told they’d had leaks in the room. I was about to accept our fate when another guy walked in and was given a room at the hotel no problem. So I asked how had he managed to get a room and asked to speak to the Manager. At first the Manager said he had no rooms but when I said it was not good enough and they’d had my company’s money for 8 weeks he said he’d see what he could do. 20 minutes later we were given room keys by the porter, no explanation and no apology. The Manager didn’t even bother coming out to speak to me.

My room was scruffy with coat hooks and the toilet roll holder missing, with just the broken fixings left in place.  The bed side tables were marked, scuffed and scratched. Their was no aromatherapy lamp as promised either. And some of the mosaic tiling in the bathroom was missing and the shower tray was stained and the shower door had broken away from the bottom runner (room 626). I didn’t dare complain as I didn’t want to be moved.

2 days later one of my guests text me to ask if having a mouse in a London hotel room was normal! He too didn’t want the hassle of being moved so blocked the hole where the mouse was coming in from.

All in all I was very disappointed and will not be going back.

",1,2018,04,14
128,Terrible,"Poor room service (reformed chicken!), noisy room (lift and neighbour) and couldn’t even get the breakfast I had paid for in my booking, served in my room. Didn’t sleep and left hungry. Avoid room 601 as it has a connecting door meaning you can hear every word from your neighbour.",1,2018,04,13
128,Ok but i have stayed in better,"I stayed here for three nights on business.  I was put in a Club Room which was over the road from the main hotel with its own receptionist.  The room was smallish but well decorated and the bed was really comfortable.  The room was quiet despite being on a main road.  On the first night it took me about 10 minutes to turn all of the lights off as they were controlled from different parts of the room.  Lights around the skirting board look nice, but after the first night i never turned them on again, bit of a waste TBH.  Food in the Restaurant is a bit on the steep side but there are plenty of other places to eat nearby to suit all budgets.  Staff are friendly and welcoming with a nice atmosphere.  The continental breakfast was a disappointment so went to an EAT for breakfast on the last day.",4,2018,04,13
128,Our base in London ,"We used to stay in different hotels when in London close to the places we were visiting. It has changed since we came across The Montcalm at the Brewery. It is beautiful and truly calm. Rooms are quiet, beds are comfortable, everything you can possibly need is provided and of high quality. Service is outstanding and personal. We particularly appreciate that the members of staff we met a few years ago are still here and they recognise and greet us as old acquaintances. Dearest Alice, the guests experience manager, is an absolute credit to the establishment. Her personal charm and professionalism ensure that we will be coming again and again and will be recommending the hotel to all our friends and family. Thank you, Alice, for recommending and arranging the spa visits to the sister hotel in Finsbury square. We had fabulous treatments and enjoyed the facilities. 
We loved food in Jugged Hare, the atmosphere and service were fantastic.",5,2018,04,12
128,Luxurious rooms and lovely service,"Booked two days at the Montcalm as we were going to an opera at the Barbican.  I wanted a hotel close and it wasn't till we got there that I realised it really is very close.  Or room was lovely and we'd asked for a twin which they provided.  The rooms are beautifully furnished and appointed and the mini bar was a suprise, beds were very comfortable and it was nice going to a hotel where they took your luggage to your room. My only gripe would be that the TV was a bit strange to operate and you couldn't see the programme schedule or i couldn't find it.  I minor thing. We had a Club Room so access to the Club Lounge, we had wine and very nice sandwiches in there on the pre opera night as we'd booked the Chiswell Street restaurant for later.  They also served a continental breakfast in the lounge in the morning, which was very good indeed.

We liked our room so much and we had such good food from Chiswell Street, that we ordered Club sandwiches in our room on the second night and stayed in.  It was rather pleasant.

Overall a lovely hotel, with elegant decor and very helpful staff. Would definitely stay there again.  Interestingly it's one of the few hotels where I found booking direct got me a better deal.",5,2018,04,10
128,So much potential and let’s it down on silly things ,"So, stayed her a few times and each time little things let this place down.

1. No headboard even though in a Club room... 
2. Clock in room set 48 mins too fast.... is it too hard to have the right time on the clock? 
3. Power - the place you put the key was broken and I had to play around to get it to stay in the room otherwise lights would only stay on for a minute
4. This morning toilet wouldn’t stop flushing... fair enough I didn’t report it as was getting ready and mentioned as I checked out... 

Every time I stay there is always something “lazy” that lets this place down. Please try harder to focus on the edges...",3,2018,04,10
128,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel with very friendly staff.  Centrally located and convient to walk to offices in the city.  The room is very nice and well furnished and the bedding comfortable.  Staff are very friendly and my special thanks to Vikash the manager for being so friendly and hepful, which is true of all the staff who make you feel welcome. ",4,2018,04,06
128,Old world courtesy in a regency setting,"Arriving in the middle of a heavy rainstorm, I was ushered inside quickly by the attentive doorman and received promptly by a smiling receptionist.  Speedily checked in, I was personally escorted through a maze of corridors to my splendid room, which had everything necessary for my stay, and more.  A very comfortable bed, large bathroom with upmarket toiletries and a plethora of towels.
I was joined by a colleague for a splendidly tasty lunch in the restaurant, served by very attentive staff.
Unfortunately, having overslept slightly, I did not have the time to sample breakfast, a treat I shall save for my next visit.",5,2018,04,05
128,Great service.,"My wife and I had a most pleasing stay at the Montcalm.
The room was well designed and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in.
The Hotel is well situated for the tube and has the added bonus of being next door to the Jugged Hare.
One of the best gourmet pubs in London.
We will definitely be returning.",5,2018,04,05
128,Tiny Cramped Room for the Money,"I am sure this place has some fantastic larger rooms however ours was tiny and cramped with very limited natural lighting. It was a disappointing stay considering the money we paid. We booked in for a function in the city and the location was ideal for what we needed but the stay was a let down, there are nicer hotels a short walk away. We did get an added benefit of navigating a maze to get to our room though. I get that the hotel is in an old brewery and they are using the space as best they can but it was really not easy to find our room. The staff were friendly and helpful though so the hotel does have some redeeming qualities.",3,2018,04,04
128,Favourite hotel!,"It is an amazing hotel, with a Brewery that I must say has fantastic products! I stayed thanks to a birthday present from my husband and although it is in the middle of the city and has a lot of business like guests, we found that during the weekend is quiet and a fantastic retreat. We loved it!",5,2018,04,04
128,A Fantastic Stay!,"Dear Management,

I had a wonderful stay at The Montcalm at The Brewery London. All the staffs were very friendly and welcoming. The environment is very chic and comfortable and the standard of the establishment is second to none. I am very grateful for the wonderful experience and I look forward to returning.
Thank you again.

128,Vacation ,"It was a wonderful stay! The hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful! They had a surprise for us in the room, bottle of champagne and cookies, since we were celebrating birthdays! We will def come back ! 
Thank you so much! ",5,2018,04,02
128,Engagement night away,"Stayed at the hotel last night with my girlfriend. Wrote to the hotel management at the beginning of the week to explain to them that I was proposing to my girlfriend and they were more than happy to accommodate anything I had in mind. From the moment we entered the building we were greeted with friendly and very helpful staff. The manager can straight out to see us and to help us with our luggage. We got into our room and they did a great set up with rose petals and towels to decorate the room and the room was beautiful. Comfy bed and the shower was amazing.
We left the building to go to the shard and on return we had a complimentary bottle of champagne in ice with 2 glasses. Could not thank the hotel enough. Will be back again. Thank you very much",5,2018,04,02
128,A Wonderful Stay. ,"We stayed here a few years ago and enjoyed our stay so much, we wanted to come back.  

From the checking in process to the little touches in the room and public areas, this hotel never fails to impress.  Deepak made us feel extremely welcome and we had a lovely card in our room when we arrived to welcome us back.  The staff really go out of their way to make you feel extra special. 

Our room was beautiful and spacious with Hermes bathroom products.  The bed is so comfy that we didn’t want to get out of it all afternoon, only to take a trip to the Club Room for some nibbles and drinks before heading out to dinner.  

This hotel is ideal for Business and also couples as it offers an elegant setting and character features with finishing touches that will surprise.  

Finally the breakfast in Chiswell, again a nice setting with quirky decor, serves pastries, meats and cheeses with a full continental and for those with a larger appetite, a full English cooked breakfast.  The ingredients are locally sourced and for the foodies amongst you, wont fail to impress.  

I highly recommend this hotel and I can assure you, you will be well looked after! ",5,2018,04,01
128,Mixed views ,"We arrived on Friday lunchtime and luckily our room was available straight away. Reception area is lovely and staff were friendly and helpful. The girl at check in informed us that we had a complimentary upgrade to our room which was great. 
The journey to our room seemed to go on forever. In one lift,up some stairs,trek along a full length corridor and into another lift then along another corridor to our room with barely a window in sight. However the hotel is beautifully decorated. 
We got into our room and to say it was a complimentary upgrade, I dread to think what the original one was like. We were in room 235 which is small but the worst thing was it is very dark inside even when it’s sunny outside. However it had a great view of the offices opposite which were less than 12 foot away. The bed was too small for us but we did actually sleep quite well considering the constant noise outside of air con units. Even the unit in the room had an annoying drone. The bath took about 40 minutes to fill up as there isn’t any taps so you have to use the shower. Never see that before. We certainly won’t use this hotel again which is a shame because it’s history as a brewery is superb. ",1,2018,04,01
128,Quality with a bit of Old World Charm,"Really liked this hotel, helped, I suspect, by an upgrade to a suite. The suite and bathroom were excellent, very comfortable and lacking nothing. From the moment of arrival, there is a sense of Old World Charm thanks to  attentive and pleasant staff working in a building that has a clear sense of history. The downside of designing a hotel in a former brewery might be a warren of corridors and steps that could be a problem for the infirm. The breakfast was perfectly good with, as before, attentive staff. As London prices go, the cost of room and breakfast was reasonable for a hotel of this standard. About a 10-mniute walk (much of it under cover) from Barbican station puts the hotel in striking distance of King's Cross and all major tube routes.",4,2018,03,29
128,London City location - good for business,"The hotel is located in a convenient location if your business is in the financial districts.  Hotel is a conversion of an old brewery complex, and is modern, but starting to show its age.  Nearest Tube stop is Moorgate.  Taxi from Heathrow was 97GBP with a morning arrival due to heavy traffic.  Not a good location if your objective is sightseeing/leisure.",3,2018,03,28
128,Favourite London Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely lush! I have stayed 3 times now. It's always lovely and clean, the staff are very polite and friendly and the robes and beds are the comfiest ever! 
We have had the pleasure of staying in the Wow suite which was delightful but have also stayed in the most basic rooms, which while some may find compact do not let down on any quality. While it can be on the pricey side, there is often a 21 day advance booking discount which can save you quite a sum.",5,2018,03,27
128,Short Weekend in the City,"I've started using the Montcalm at the Brewery as my preferred hotel when in London many years ago for business. Since then, I always try to book it also for my personal visits to London.
It is a wonderful structure, great rooms with high quality bed for a very comfortable night, luxury toiletries and an amazing team that helps you with every need and always tries to accommodate your requests!
Looking forward to visiting you again!",5,2018,03,26
128,Wonderful hotel ,Stayed here for one night in March would definitely stay again. We were upgraded to a suite for free which was fantastic and the staff couldn’t do enough to help. Hotel itself is beautiful and location was good too.,5,2018,03,25
128,Enchanting and top class,Wonderful doorman welcoming you to this unique building and glamorous reception.  From the guests concierge to the receptionists and then being escorted to your delightful room.  Huge hotel with endless  corridors but slwa6s staff in hand to escort you and guise you to your room. The club room or deluxe doubles envelope z chic classy design offering endless facilities and beverages. A beautiful bathroom with so many added touches.  Fantastic restaurant. lGlorious stay and so central to everything in the city to explore done drink and great for a city work location too,5,2018,03,24
128,"Nice lobby, very good staff, good service and poor rooms","The Montcalm was a disappointment. The first room I was taken to, and spent the first night, was in the top floor, accessed through a maze, probably the old attic, was oddly shaped, the TV couldn't be seen from almost any angle and was really hot, even tough temperatures outside were below 0C. I requested a new room and was moved to a very small but practical room, which had only a small 60cm x 60 cm window, unreachable at the to high corner of the room. I stayed there, as I was tired of moving, but I can't say it was a room compatible with the cost I was paying. There are probably better rooms, but I suggest avoiding rooms 510 and 225A :-) The hotel is reasonably clean, linen and toiletries are of good quality and the staff is helpful. I think part of the problem is trying to create +250 rooms in an old brewery building. Something has to give in, and in this case it was the quality of the rooms, or at least some of them.",3,2018,03,24
128,Went to See Adele ,Lovely trip to London for my first time and stayed in this gem. The hotel and room were amazing we love the space and the bathroom was just gorgeous. I would love to stay here again however it can be pricey.,5,2018,03,23
128,Simply marvellous,"An hotel of classic understated luxury offering absolutely faultless service, in a fantastic location. Hotels like this are few and far between - the staff are charming, respectful, friendly and super-helpful; the accommodation is impeccably clean and luxurious, with beautifully appointed rooms.",5,2018,03,23
128,Awesome bed,"Awesome comfort.  Really enjoyed the Jugged Hare as well.  Great for business and probably would be nice for a romantic break as well.  All round great hotel.  Quiet, great service, adequate gym.  Thanks.  One to remember.",5,2018,03,20
128,Lovely stay,"Very nice room with good facilities, staff very pleasant, would certainly stay here again, very quiet and comfortable, must admit to getting lost as the hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren but this wasn’t a real issue, just added to the fun!! Extensive mini bar for those who use them, I don’t, but be prepared to put £50 deposit down which is refundable although it can take a few days, this was the only downside although I fully understand that if this wasn’t done the hotel could end up out of pocket, I do wonder if there could be an alternative, such as a locked bar that you pay to open?",5,2018,03,20
128,Birthday Surprise ,"I have booked the room as a surprise for my partner, and we have received free upgrade to the Club room which was amazing, very clean and the bed was so  comfortable, also we have received free bottle of the wine, staff at the check - in was friendly and very efficient, definitely we will come back :) ",5,2018,03,20
128,Fantastic from start to finish!,We arrived here on a Sunday morning as both of us had a conference in the city the following day however it also happened to be an important anniversary and we planned to also celebrate and see a show that evening. Before we arrived I received an email from the Mountcalm asking if we were visiting for a specific reason and when they were informed it was a special occasion they really did go the extra mile and then some! We were told we had been given an upgrade to a lovely suite and when we arrived there was a complementary bottle of wine with a lovely card attached. when we returned to our room that evening there were Rose petals on the bed and candles everywhere. Thank you all at the Mountcalm for a lovely experience!,5,2018,03,19
128,Stay for business event,"Real mixed feelings about this hotel 

The positives
Rooms are very plush, large soft beds and quality bedding, fantastic bathroom very modern and comfortable.

Tea and coffee along with a coffee maker and a free to use mobile phone are all available.

The negatives
Getting to the room was confusing due to the layout of the hotel

The conference room we were in was down in the basement but was well lit, coffee and tea was served and replenished throughout the day but there was no sugar.  
The toilets although very clean were very small and the taps were too powerful for the small sinks
We had private dinning in the evening, the room was freezing cold, the waitress looked miserable, I don't think she smiled all evening.

The food was nice but portions were small with no sides.
",3,2018,03,18
128,Amazing lovely staff,"This is such a lovely, friendly accommodating hotel. I stay here when I need to go and write for a weekend away. It is quiet, warm, super comfy beds and lots of and the staff are so helpful and friendly. This time I asked to change rooms so that I could have more space to write and the manager was super accommodating, finding various options for me and calling to check that I was okay. I will return here again and again. Top class!",5,2018,03,18
128,Amazing ,The hotel is stunning . It really took me by surprise when I walked in . It showed true beauty and elegance . The staff were very professional and kind. Room and food services were excellent from the minute I stepped up to the desk till the last day. I would recommend this hotel.,5,2018,03,18
128,Great team!,"Stayed here from Thursday 8 March until Sunday 11 March. After our first night, we had a couple of personal requests which the staff were more than happy to accommodate. 

All the team we spoke to were really helpful and there seems to be a genuinely nice working spirit within the hotel.

We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely be back, should we have any business in the area again. 

Thanks Team Montcalm.",5,2018,03,14
128,"Excellent, BUT....","They added a whopping £40 PER NIGHT for the very short one time task of separating the bed into a twin bed for me and my daughter.
That ads up to a remarkable high price for a 10 mins task or so if you stay there for a few days.
Otherwise excellent!",4,2018,03,13
128,Fantastic,"Great Hotel, Rooms are lovely and the service is second to none. I would definately recommend staying here.
The bed was very comfortable and the shower was amazing. 
The location is great too, as you are only a short tube journey from all of Londons major attractions.",5,2018,03,13
128,Excellent location and service,"Very helpful staff. Excellent location just opposite the Barbican centre. Room is very cosy and well equipped. Considerate that the hotel that the hotel is in central London, price range is reasonable and value for money. .",5,2018,03,13
128,Cramped and pokey,"The rooms are of great quality, but tortuous to find in the rabbit warren of corridors. Whilst the bed is comfortable, there is just too much crammed in a small room. I found myself knocking the phone off the wall as I shaved, banging my elbows in the shower and having to clear the small desk just to plug the kettle in. 
Once I escaped the maze and found the breakfast room, whilst of good quality, the service was painfully slow whilst trying to eat at a reasonable pace to get on and do a days business.
Won’t be coming back here...",3,2018,03,13
128,Nothing 5 star about this place! ,"I have stayed here before and it was nice enough, but on this visit I was given an old room in the South Wing with stained paint, a broken chair, and a loud springy old mattress. They presented this as a club room ‘upgrade’ but it’s a real downgrade from the standard room I had last time. I let the desk know and asked to move rooms, and I have since been waiting for over an hour for a response with no update. I wouldn’t stay here again. ",1,2018,03,12
128,Amazing mix of tech and tradition,"Had the pleasure of a Saturday overnight stay with my husband celebrating our Birthdays. The hotel made us feel so welcome, the room was huge by London standards (sofa at the foot of the bed, plenty of space to walk around the bed and room, and the largest bath I have ever seen in a hotel room!
Balloons and a bottle of wine were in the room for us, and we ordered room service which again was great, great food and service.
All of the above coupled with a turn down service including chocolates on the pillow finished the whole weekend off for us.
If you are in London for a weekend, but want a nice base to come back to and enjoy, then give this place a try 😊",5,2018,03,12
128,Above and beyond what we expected,"My partner and I stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery for 2 nights in March 18. The hotel and service was exceptional. Prior to our arrival we received an email suggesting we make contact with via their Whatsapp messaging service for an effective more personalised stay, we did that and informed the hotel of the purpose of our visit, my partner and I were celebrating our anniversary. We had never had a hotel make contact prior to our stay so this was a nice gesture.

Upon arrival, we were welcomed warmly and shown to our room, which had been upgraded to a club room that was lovely and spacious, with a large comfortable bed. The room had everything you could need, including robes and slippers. There is a well stocked mini bar, but in addition to this, we received complimentary water, fruit an a bottle of red wine, along with a personalised card wishing us a happy anniversary. After exploring the City that afternoon, (the hotel is a perfect location for exploring the City and just a short walk to Barbican underground station), we returned to the hotel to find they had placed rose petals on our bed and arranged towels in the shape of swans and a love heart. This was a lovely surprise!

We have stayed in a variety of hotels across London, however we both felt this was one of the best hotels we have stayed in to date, the personal and unique service tailored towards us contributed towards an overall fantastic and memorable stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery. We would definitely return and recommend this hotel to others looking for a luxury but affordable stay in the City.",5,2018,03,12
128,Perfection,The service in the hotel is spectacular ! I told them i was staying with my girlfriend as its her birthday and they put balloons up with a bottle of red wine. Was very easy to find and close to Moorgate. I’ve stayed in other Montcalm’s in london but I have to say that this one is definitely one of the best!,5,2018,03,11
128,Stay for a City Wedding,"Excellent greeting and warm welcome. Upgraded to a suite that was simply superb. Lovely staff wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommend the Hotel.Great location for the City , easy to get to on tube ,Barbican station only 5 minute walk and easy on circle line to get to Paddington Station .",5,2018,03,11
128,"Impression of a luxury hotel, odd room setup!","This place has a rather grand feel when you enter although we found 2 reception desk areas rather confusing.  We stayed here for two nights during our honeymoon and were upgraded as on booking my husband had stated this was for a special occasion.  We were greeted with a beautiful towel arrangement on the bed when we arrived (see photo) along with some chocolates, fruit and champagne and bottles of water.  The room was small and compact with everything required, iron/iorning board, sewing kit etc along with a hugely over expensive tray of snacks and fridge of drinks is in the wardrobe (check the prices before you take anything as there is a Tesco down the road)  But what bemused us the most was the very odd fact that the bathroom had a blind between it and the bedroom meaning you could watch everything going on in their from your bed!!! Who wants that??? Actually don't answer that question.  We couldn't get our heads round this at all and neither of us particularly liked it.  If this was our upgrade I was quite curious to know what sort of room we would have had and if it would have been better?  The view from our window was overlooking a tower of offices.  We didn't stay for breakfast as this was again quite expensive (yes I know it is London).  This is quite a maze of a hotel to navigate your way around, I did like the simple touch of having jugs of water with lemon or lime right next to the lift so you could help yourself as you came and went during your stay.  The doorman was brilliant as we were leaving and hailed us a cab rather than letting us walk to find one.",4,2018,03,10
128,Sufficient but confusing hotel - great location,"I was in the city on a business trip lasting 3 days. I found the layout of the hotel massively confusing - it really takes some getting used to to figure out how to get to your room. 

The room was small and just about sufficient. I guess the price we paid was all for the location, and not much else. Everything about the room was rather cramped. Didn't get a chance to eat at the hotel at all - so don't know about their F&B options.

I was rather unhappy with the work desk - I doubt a smaller work desk could be possible. 

Also, I didn't appreciate that the tea / coffee machine in the room wasn't replenished day on day.  The complimentary apples at the reception were a nice touch, no doubt.

I doubt I would want to stay there on a personal trip.",4,2018,03,09
128,Great location and impeccable service,"Impeccable service. All members of staff were both very friendly and professional. Great location - just a few minutes walk from Liverpool Street, Moorgate and Barbican. The room was great with everything we needed.",5,2018,03,08
128,Confusing hotel ,If you like wandering around in a maze in order to find your room or breakfast or the reception ....than this is the place to be. For everybody else who is just looking for a place to stay for a couple nights I suggest to book a different hotel ,2,2018,03,07
128,Thank you Montcalm at the Brewery,"You guys made our wedding anniversary that extra special - a big thank you to your amazing staff. The room was lovely and it’s in really great condition, clean and tidy. It was exactly what we wanted for our weekend away in London. 

Location-wise it’s only a 10min walk to either Old Street or Moorgate and 20min walk to Tottenham Court.",5,2018,03,06
128,Totally Amazing 5🌟.... Stay Here! ,"My wife and I stayed here for just two nights at the weekend. Upon arrival we were greeted by smiley happy faces everywhere. Check In was smooth and flawless from start to finish. Concierge rapidly look control of our bags and once finished at check in showed us to our room.

The room was great with everything we needed and more. All very clean and well presented. Not a single criticism can be made regarding our room. The bed was even super comfy and I am fussy about a good bed!

We were given access to the Club Lounge which in the evenings is a free help yourself bar where sandwiches and canapés also wait for you. In the morning a very simple yet adequate continental breakfast can also be found. It was lovely and quiet in here and everytime we went in it was just the two of us and the odd staff member who would check if we were ok or needed anything.

The hotel itself is very well kept and is very fresh yet holds a very dignified and classic feel to elegance. 

Just 5mins walk to both the barbican and moorgate tube stations means it is perfectly located.

We will definitely return as this is our type of hotel and now our 1st choice when staying in London",5,2018,03,05
128,Old meets new but it doesn't always work,"The service in this hotel was very good and deserving of its luxury tag, sadly the facilities themselves are too ""retro-fitted"" to feel properly five-star. The foyer is beautiful, and warm smiles greet you throughout, and turn-down service is very nice. But the room felt like an old London attic with modernist flair forced into it, though everything worked fine it just felt odd. Also it's a bit misleading that there is no restaurant or bar on-site, the places they advertise on the website and even in the in-room information are distinct restaurants away from the hotel.",4,2018,03,04
128,"Amazing hotel , 5*","I decided to choose this hotel for my boyfriends 21st birthday. We were upgraded to a suite which was outstanding!The staff are very attentive and polite. The location is brilliant, few minutes walk from Moorgate station. The room had everything you could possibly need/want.The beds are so comfortable and the decor is very tasteful. With the room that we chose we even got the members lounge included which was lovely .We enjoyed our stay so much that we will defiantly be staying again!",5,2018,03,04
128,Fantastic business location and interestingly quirky,"My last business trip to London was four days and I stayed here. It was an excellent choice and I will not hesitate to go back. The things I really liked about it were: the quality of the service, the proximity to the city and the breakfast room! (and the breakfast).
The place is quirky and there seems to be corridors everywhere - Surprisingly, I found my room unassisted on all 4 nights, because the corridors twist and turn all over the place.
Rooms were small, but adequate and clean. 
I liked it a lot.",4,2018,03,03
128,Converted space doesn't always come out well...,"One of more bizarre hotels I stayed in in the last few years. It is in a nice and interesting conservation building but a result is odd. My room was claustrophobic, with low ceiling and not much space for anything, it had tiny window coming out onto some wall. I could hear industrial aircon behind the buildling all night. The partitions between the rooms are poor so I could hear the person in the next room snoring. I.e. you cannot sleep without earplugs. This is not cool at 300 pounds per night...
The conversion results in a maze of corridors to get to the rooms and you cannot avoid stairs between the floors! This was not cool with the bags in the winter weather.
All staff when I arrived was from the east which is fine as I am too but with Russian spoken everywhere and the hotel being a bit dark I was just waiting for Vigo Mortensen to jump out somewhere with a knife (Eastern Promises). It just gave the whole place a bit of a dark, scary feel to it. Not sure if this was intended",3,2018,03,02
128,Wonderful stay!,"Stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery for two nights. Wonderful hotel. Staff lovely and attentive. Francesca especially stood out to us, emailed prior to our stay to check if we were staying for a special occasion (it was my birthday). Greeted us at reception which was a nice touch. When we arrived to our room balloons had been put on the bed and a bottle of wine left! We throughly enjoyed our stay and will be back soon. ",5,2018,02,26
128,Great in nearly all ways,"Came here for my wife’s birthday. The staff are really helpful and the hotel is very nice, and excellent value, given it’s in London. We got a free upgrade which was a pleasant surprise. Sadly the room we were in had a real draft coming in through the window and the bath mixer tap wasn’t working properly. Apart from these easily resolvable issues it was a great hotel",4,2018,02,26
128,A very pleasant experience,A lovely hotel in a relatively quiet place for a weekend stay.  Very comfortable and well appointed room complemented with delicious tea and luxury toiletries.  We ate in the Jugged Hare and had a fabulous meal.  Excellent overall ,5,2018,02,25
128,Stay at Montcalm,The team were very friendly and there was complimentary water and fruit in my room which is always a nice touch. Single room was small but probably average for London. Room was clean. I'm happy to recommend this hotel to visitors,5,2018,02,25
128,Romantic ,Stayed during the week - the hotel had a lovely buzz about it.  Our club room was well appointed and large.  The bathroom was well appointed with nice little extras. Well stocked mini bar and large comfy bed,5,2018,02,22
128,Good stay again,"Visited this hotel for maybe the 4th or 5th time. We were kindly upgraded to a Montcalm club room which overlooked the main street. The room was great as much larger than previous rooms we've had. The hotel knew we were celebrating a birthday and gave me a small bottle of red which was a nice touch! Minor gripes..the signage to the reception/main entrance is nonsensical from the first floor club rooms as it refers you all over the place and doesn't seem to help you get out (we ended up exiting via the Jugged Hare). Also we noticed the room was very cool when we returned late on the Friday night. The club rooms have lovely old sash windows but these are not double glazed or draught proof, plus I noticed there was a thin crack in one of the windows (which we told reception about when we checked out). I love a period feature (there are also window seats) and I don't mind street noise but I guess others might. The staff here are always lovely and friendly and the room has all the things you need plus a proper minibar (hooray!). It's still our favourite place for when we stay in London.",4,2018,02,22
128,Superlative service...,"I cannot rate this hotel too highly and I have stayed in hundreds. The staff were all, without exception, a delight to meet - from the initial frendly greeting from the doorman, the charming and efficient reception, the care at the concierge desk through to a cleaner who wanted to make sure I wasn't lost in the maze of corridors.

The room was perfect - spotless and with everything one could need. An excellent experience throughout",5,2018,02,22
128,2nd time and didn't dissapoint.,"You know how sometimes when you have a great experience and you go back and it doesn't actually match up to your expectations!!! Well I can say that this time it did and more.

I had actually booked into the ity Suites but after an exchange with the Guest experience team They very kindly upgraded me to a Club Room in the main hotel with a nice bottle of Chianti to boot. The room was spacious, comfortable and perfect for my 2 day visit.

The staff at the hotel were fantastic, very accommodating and helpful both on the reception desk and concierge with every request I had handled in a timely and professional manner.

The hotel also boasts on each end Chiswell Dining Rooms and the Juged hare, both serving an amazing selection of produce cooked to perfection.

For anyone wanting to stay in the City of London the Montcalm is a perfect place for a short stay. Close to Barbican and Liverpool Street Tube stations and a 10 minute stroll to Bank its ideally located.",5,2018,02,21
128,Pleasant overnight stay,"I stayed here overnight for an all expenses paid gala dinner and awards ceremony with my daughters work. The room I believe was a deluxe twin, which we deduced this from the website afterwards. Overall the room could have been slightly bigger and I felt the bathroom was very compact with not much room to manoeuvre. You had to shut the door to get to the bath and shower. The door stop was right as you stepped out of the tub and I stubbed my toe a few times. A few things didn’t work as easily as they should. The shower dial needed tweaking to work out the correct way to turn to get the desired bath/shower styles and the temperature too was tricky. A couple of cosmetic issues needed attention and this to me lost stars off the rating it had been given. 
However positives were, nice Elemis products, soft towels and also face towels (Brucie bonus there!). Pillows were like sleeping on a cloud and bed was very comfy too. Bathroom wall was see through glass with an electric blind for privacy if required. Free bottled water, biscuits, fruit, nespresso machine and ordinary kettle with tea/coffee/hot chocolate. Big tv with sky sports, unfortunately we couldn’t get the live radio to connect. 
Breakfast was very disappointing to be honest, the room we were told to use had about 60 seats and was full. Whilst getting our food several items ran out and the staff couldn’t keep up with demand, although it wasn’t exceptionally busy. Food was mediocre, bacon over cooked and sausages just been shown the grill. Eventually we got the food we wanted after enquiringly about seating was told we could use the restaurant.  We found out upon entering this that there was another buffet available here too. I went to get juice as they still hadn’t brought any when I was in the other room but they’d also run out. It was a bit silly they didn’t have the usual big barrels but it was decanted into glass containers which probably held about 5/6 glasses if that. Considering I was in a party of 240 people booked in overnight, the planning wasn’t too great. By the time I got my juice my breakfast had gone cold.  The restaurant itself was cold and as soon as we are we left to retreat back to our room for warmth. 

I have been to hotels with lesser stars rating and have received better service overall. 
I appreciate the hotel rooms have had to fit into the existing structure of the building, however I’m sure for big bookings there is a room that would have been better suited. The buffet could have been laid out in a more spacious area and food/drink containers bigger to hold more food. 
",3,2018,02,20
128,Traditional Luxury,"We were greeted by a concierge who carried our bags to recepetion and another to carry them up to our room. Our room was ready early which was a bonus. 
The room was nice, the bathroom was gorgeous. The mini bar was extortionate, as expected. 
Though it was a lovely room, it was very dated. The desk chair was wripped and scagged. There was mention of a control panel to determine the scent going into your room, though we couldn't find it. 
There was a little phone-looking object that you could take around the city with you. It had reviews, suggestions and wifi. But ours didn't work. 
The location was a bit far out, but we like to walk so that didn't bother us. 
The staff were very friendly.",4,2018,02,20
128,Delightful very British traditional luxury hotel,"The hotel is very much on the high quality premium experience hotel without being excessively pretentious. I stayed in the club room which was very clean and high quality with a lovely marble bathroom, bath and nice bathrobes. 

The bed was extremely comfortable, I slept very well, quiet room with no external noise. Teas and coffees were plentiful and high quality.

Perfect one night stay for business travel.",5,2018,02,18
128,Quirky and great service,"We stayed here as part of a big group business event. The check in service was great, very personable and with lots of smiles. 
The room was spacious, clean with lots of little complimentary gifts (if you’re small like me though, get your step ladder ready to get on the bed)! That aside, the temperature control in the room worked-a dream and the bed was very comfortable.
Food was fantastic and the breakfast offerings covered everything you’d want. 
A lovely locAtion for you to have a walk down to the river and back again. ",5,2018,02,18
128,Amazing! Will repeat again!,"I have stayed with my partner at this hotel in Vanaltine's Day and was amazing. Since I made the booking I have received a top quality service. Specially thanks to Francesca Derudas (guest experience Host). It was really easy to get my plan done as i have been in touch with her via WhatsApp (they have this service available). My room looked exactly how I wanted and made me feel really comfortable.

Thanks to all the staff for an amazing experience.

128,Anniversary weekend bliss at the Montcalm,"Such a wonderful stay for our first anniversary, in the very hotel (and room) we shared on our wedding night. I dealt with Alice prior to the stay who luckily remembered our wedding stay from the previous year and upon my request kindly upgraded our 2 night stay from a standard room to a WOW suit, the very room we spent our wedding night. A very special stay from start to finish, bottle of bubbly left in the room on arrival, access to the club lounge for complimentary breakfast in the morning, and wine, spirits and sandwiches 5-8pm. Nothing too much trouble for any of the staff and the whole weekend was as memorable as our wedding stay. We hope to stay here every anniversary but don’t think any will top our first.",5,2018,02,15
128,Five Star Experience,"Come down to London at least once a month on business and usually stay in one of the larger hotel groups but on this occasion was sent to Montcalm Brewery and what a pleasant surprise. From the moment I checked in to moment I checked out a wonderful experience and staff could not have been nicer.
Lovely spacious room with all the facilities and techy stuff I needed. Bed was so comfortable and one of the best nights sleep I have had in a while.
Will be back!",5,2018,02,14
128,"Great staff, great stay, great location!","I really enjoyed my stay at the Montcalm (Brewery/London City). The staff were friendly, gracious, and very helpful. Special shout-out to Francesca, Stanislav, Vlad, and Dayana. They took great care and ensured I was comfortable and that I knew how to get around. My company had recommended this place (and a colleague, a very frequent visitor to our London office, especially recommended it).

The property is located in an ideal location, close to Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations, and VERY close to my office, which made things so much easier when the weather became less cooperative than usual.

The room was well-appointed, had thoughtful touches (such as nightly turndown service; aromatherapy, a wide array of pillows), and well-lit.

No complaints at all, and I'll definitely return on my next trip to London. Very highly recommended!",5,2018,02,13
128,Lovely London Hotel,"Montcalm never disappoint. I have stayed in other of their properties and always deliver. 
To start with the guest experience team is great as they were in contact with me through WhatsApp and found a nice greeting card and mini bottle of wine waiting for me in the room. 
The room was a bit small but had a very spacious bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, the air con nice and quiet and all in all very cosy. 
The amenities provided are top notch and plenty. Amazing slippers and all in all a very giving hotel. Wifi was a bit slow at times but apart from this all was great",5,2018,02,13
128,Excellent staff & location - January 18,"We really enjoyed the stay and were very impressed by all staff who were always friendly and extremely helpful. They particularly looked after my daughter who was attending her graduation at the Barbican centre which is just across the road. 
We also really enjoyed the food, drink and ambience in the Jugged Hare. The location is also great for any activity in the city. 
Thanks again we will definitely return to the Montcalm and would highly recommend this hotel",5,2018,02,13
128,January 18 weekend stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm Brewery several weeks ago for my wife's birthday on a Saturday night . i was already quite familiar with the hotel having stayed before myself and have also put overseas guests up there several times as its quite close to my London office. The hotel is very well located being close to the Barbican and close to Moorgate and Liverpool St stations , we drove up and parked the car overnight at the Barbican which was really close. Francesca from guest relations had emailed me prior to check in to ask if we needed any assistance which I thought was a nice touch and I was very impressed when she greeted us at reception upon arrival and asked if my wife was having a nice birthday ...a lovely touch which most London hotels would not do and it was a nice start to our weekend there. Even more gratefully received was the lovely room and the complimentary bottle of wine which Francesca had organised for my wife's birthday , after a long day out in London and with the winter cold and rain howling down outside it was really nice to come back to a luxuriously appointed warm room , stick the TV on and sit back with a nice glass of wine after a drink at the Jugged Hare pub which is part of the hotel. This area of the City is quieter at weekends but we much preferred it to staying more central , its literally 10 mins by tube into theatre land and the west end restaurants and a great place to explore around by foot on a quieter weekend , although the weather wasnt at its best in January when we stayed. All in all a lovely hotel with good value and great staff.",5,2018,02,12
128,Very good hotel,"I liked this place. Very good service minded. The rooms are big, quiet, clean.. 
You got a phone you could borrow if you went out for sightseeing etc.. 
Only down side is it was little far from the city for me..",5,2018,02,12
128,A weekend in London - tradition tradition,"Fabulous hotel. Traditional. Doorman to open the door, greet and welcome. Staff in the foyer to take your bags. 
We arrived early for our room and while waiting to check in, we were offered coffee. The receptionist congratulated us on our anniversary. We left our bags and wandered over to the Barbican tube station (about 5 mins walk) and spent the afternoon in London. When we returned to the hotel, we found a complimentary bottle of wine and a card from the hotel. Towels had been turned into swans and we had rose petals on our bed. It was such a lovely touch. The room was lovely and large. The nespresso machine was fab first thing this morning and it was nice to find a fully stocked mini bar. The hotel claims to be a five-star. It is ... in a very traditional sense of the word where looking after guests is a priority. A hidden gem in the square mile. Will happily recommend. Thank you for making our stay really lovely. ",5,2018,02,11
128,Excellent ,"My girlfriend and I stayed here at the start of the year. We both thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel, the room was fantastic and all the staff were courteous and extremely helpful. Francesca in particular went the extra mile to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible. All in all a fantastic hotel made even better by the wonderful staff. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and would certainly recommend the hotel. ",5,2018,02,10
128,Not impressed...,"Avoid rooms facing the street. Was very noisy. Pretty poor breakfast in a shabby ”club room”. Room was ok with pleasant shower. Not the least sound proof. You hear everything in the corridor. Not very expensive, but not good either...",2,2018,02,08
128,Great Stay,"Stayed here for a quick London getaway as we had an event at the Barbican. 

I also arranged to propose to my gfat the Shard the night before, the Montcalm team were happy to help with arrangements to make our day even more special. The concierge got in touch by what's app making everything so much quicker and easier.

All in all a very well located hotel with very helpful staff.

Would definitely recommend and go back.",4,2018,02,08
128,"Beautiful hotel; the old brewery building layout is quirky and sometimes confusing, but excellent service","We stayed only the one night, and upon arrival were escorted by two staff members to our reserved room.  It was only once they'd left that we realised the bathroom was downstairs from the bedroom - not something either of us wanted to navigate in the middle of the night.  The issue was dealt with smoothly and swiftly - they moved our bags to the new room, as we were in a hurry to get to an appointment.  
Lovely, uber comfortable king size bed, and pillows were almost ridiculously luxurious and soft ...Elemis complementary soaps etc. were a beautiful bonus too.  All in all, it was a terrific place to stay, though  it's an example of you get what you pay for - it's very expensive.
The next day we had brunch in the Jugged Hare, the pub-restaurant attached to the hotel - again, faultless service and terrific food - will definitely be returning!",5,2018,02,07
128,Review ,I celebrated my birthday in the hotel and it was a fantastic experience! Staff was so welcoming and friendly. They assisted me really quick and are so responsive. The room was clean and comfortable as well. Will definitely choose to stay at the hotel again in the future. ,5,2018,02,07
128,5 start stay at one of the best hotels in London City!,"My husband and I stayed at this beautiful hotel very recently. I always wanted to stay here. We were celebrating a mini - honeymoon, so it was a special occasion, the Guest Experience Manager contacted me asking me the reason for staying before arrival. On arrival we got a very nice welcome from the check in staff and we were shown to our room. We stayed at the Montcalm Club room overlooking the Barbican Centre; the room was so spacious and nicely decorated. The room was larger than many other hotels we have stayed in London in the same price range!
We got petals in the bed and a lovely towel design over the bed. It was a very nice surprise having a bottle of wine and a handwritten card by the manager. The staff makes you feel really special.
I really like the location of the hotel in an old brewery building, it is very refreshing to have this kind of hotel in the London City where there are a lot of new modern tall buildings. 
Also, it is so well located within walking distance of Moorgate, Barbican Centre and Old Street tube stations. 
There is so much too see around the area such as the Barbican, Centre (including a hidden Banksy) the Museum Of London, the Guildhall Art Centre; and the gateway to East London. It is well within 15 min trip to London Euston or King Cross St Pancras as well by underground.
I would definitely recommend this hotel for a romantic get away. 
Unfortunately we could not have brunch on Sunday at the Jugged Hare as it was fully booked, but certainly next time we will try it!

Overall we had a great and relaxing experience away from the traditional touristic or shopping bustling areas. 

Highly recommended!!!",5,2018,02,07
128,Fantastic stay!! ,"This hotel made our trip to London! What a beautiful hotel, and impeccable customer service! 
Alice was so lovely, and made our stay that little bit extra. 
The room was beautiful, the facilities were 10/10 I would recommend this place to anyone! 
Fantastic value for money, we will be back soon! I won’t stay anywhere else now! 

Thank you so much!

128,Nice hotel for a weekend,"This was a nice hotel for the weekend. The room is a bit small and dark, but clean and modern. Service is good and the place is close to 2 subway station. What you will mostly enjoy is that they provide you with a phone with internet and GPS and local number for free. Very handy !",4,2018,02,05

128,Couldn’t ask for more!,"From the moment we arrived the staff couldn’t have done more to make our stay more welcoming.

The room itself was very spacious and clean, had everything you could possibly need in a room.

Thanks too all the staff at the Montcalm hotel.",5,2018,01,27
128,"Large, Comfortable Rooms in a Cool Old Brewery","The Montcalm is a lot more hotel for the Pound than I have usually gotten in London.  While one must progress through a bit of a rabbit warren of doors and steps to get to the elevator or room, once inside, all is great.  The rooms are spacious and in very good shape.  Thick windows and curtains block any street noise (I was on the second floor).  Good amenities.  Good access to Tube stops and restaurants.  I will definitely look to stay here next time I'm in London.",5,2018,01,27
128,Five Star Hotel with Five Star Staff!,"My wife and I recently stayed here and I have to say everything about The Montcalm was first class. Even before we had arrived Francesca from Guest Experience had been in contact to ask if there was anything they could do in advance to make our stay even better. On arrival we were upgraded to an even better room, complete with a complimentary bottle of wine! The room itself was very clean and modern, with some great little extras like a Nespresso machine, and a smartphone which you could take around London with you to save on your own phone bill. Our only complaint was we only got to book in for one night before flying home! The hotel is a 10min walk from Liverpool Street Station(Handy if flying to Stansted) and only a couple of mins from Moorgate Tube Station so great for getting around London. We're already looking forward to our next trip to London and stay at The Montcalm :)",5,2018,01,24
128,Best hotel ever,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying here for our wedding anniversary. I used WhatsApp to speak to the concierge and I must say the service was impeccable.

On arrival I was informed we had been upgraded to the “wow suite” and judging by my wife’s reaction on opening the door it’s clear to see where they got the name from.

Very happy with everything the hotel and staff could offer; from the lovely turndown service to being handed an umbrella as we went out for the evening.",5,2018,01,23
128,Quirky but very nice!,"Good hotel for a city visit, as 10 mins from Moorgate tube station. Rooms are nice and good to get an upgrade to Club room. Good coffee and tea selection with a biscuit, comfortable bed and nice ensuite. Would stay again.",4,2018,01,22
128,Fantastic hotel ,"What an awesome find! So many to choose from but this one really stood out for us!
So we booked it.. thank goodness we did, because it lived up to all of our expectations. The staff were attentive and friendly. Attention to detail is paramount for all of them. Nothing was too much trouble.
The room we had was beautiful and well equipped to a very high standard!
Can’t say enough good things. Definitely will be returning again!
Thank you to all!!",5,2018,01,22
128,Hospitality every bit a 5 star hotel,"The service I received from the hotel is amazing. From the get go, the hotel (Francesca on whatsapp) contacted me directly to see if they could make my visit a little bit special, and they sure did deliver. I was celebrating an occasion with my partner, and the hotel very kindly provided a room upgrade as well as a complimentary bottle of wine, with a handwritten personalised message from the management. Imagine my surprise when I turn up for check-in, and I received friendly smiles from the doorman, to the front desk and from the concierge which personally walked me to my room. 5 star treatment from a 5 star hotel, and it was delivered so naturally and I felt like I was an important guest returning to a family home. 

The room (Montcalm Club Room) was modern, well arranged, tastefully desiged and immaculately clean. The bathroom, the bath tub and shower was spotless, and the water pressure is good. The tub is very roomy and great for soaking in hot water. The bed is soft but sufficiently firm, and the mattress is clean. We had a good night sleep, and woke up refreshed. We reluctantly woke up for breakfast as it was such a good sleep!  Room service was excellent, the tub was washed down and dried by the time we returned from the evening, and the complimentary shower, shampoo and toiletries were re-stocked even though we didn't finish the ones from the previous day. There was a mobile phone which was free to use during our stay, and we used it with the bluetooth speaker in the room to play music from Youtube. We didn't use the TV as we were out and about the city but the menu and GUI looks very user-friendly.  If there was one thing I'd improve, it would be to reduce the number of light switches in the room.  It took about 8-10 switches to have the room completely dark. This is very minor of course, as this enabled us full control over the lighting in the room. 

Location wise, it's very close to the tube station, and Barbican Centre, perfect for catching a show and walking back to the hotel (across the street) at night. Whilst it may be further away to the shopping areas, but it's convenient for a short Uber ride (£8 to Oxford street, £6 to Borough Market).

All in all it was a very memorable visit, and the highlight of the stay is the personalised service and hospitality we received throughout. They've managed to make us feel so welcomed and so comfortable, we felt sad to leave. Thank you so much for having us, and for making our stay so enjoyable! Thanks again Francesca for arranging all of this for us!",5,2018,01,21
128,Amazing Hotel,"From the second I walked up to the door I had a great experience. ALL of the staff were so friendly and helpful.

Lovely room and building.

128,Fit the Bill for a 1-night Escape,"4.5 star review - but rounding up to 5 stars. Stayed in the basic room.

Stayed 1 night, we live in central London but have construction works at our place and needed a local break to enjoy a nice clean clutter-free room & bathroom. For this purpose it did not disappoint!

- Comfy big bed
- Good size room with desk, office chair & dressing chair, decent TV
- Nice bathroom, not big but has decent rainfall shower over bath, modern vanity & toilet. Soft robes included.
- Great Staff & Front Desk experience: One of the reasons we chose to stay was that other reviews said the hotel was good with early check-ins (bearing in mind we just wanted to get away from our flat), and as our room was ready when we arrived they let us check-in at 11am, and with normal check-out at midday we had over 24hrs for a 1-night tariff! This exceeded our expectations, and is part of the reason I'm rounding up to 5* instead of down to 4*. 
- Free WiFi worked with strong signal, but was very slow.

- Deducted half-star as our room had an adjoining room with a door between them. This is not unusual in hotels I've stayed where a family may want to connect the 2 rooms. However, there was almost NO sound insulation between the rooms and between 9pm and 1am we heard the couple nextdoor: fighting, coughing, farting, laughing, and shagging. Nothing against those guests as they weren't particularly loud, just that the sound-proofing was sorely lacking. I raised this point at check-out. I didn't ask for a new room that night nor refund on check-out as overall our experience was good. We stayed in room 302.

Note: The desk in the room has ports for HDMI, RCA, VGA which all feed into HDMI 2 channel on the main TV on the opposite wall. I hadn't seen this type of tech in a hotel room before, so I tested it by hooking up HDMI cable that I had with me to my laptop. It didn't work. However, after some troubleshooting I found a prior guest had unplugged HDMI 2 from the TV, so worked fine after I reached behind the TV to plug it in.",5,2018,01,14
128,Great Hotel,"Very clean, warm and very comfortable bed. Really good staff trying to help every time you ask them. very nice experience staying at this hotel. I was in a business trip to London and spend 4 night to this lovely hotel",5,2018,01,10
128,Another Superb Stay,"Another excellent visit had. The staff have always been superb. Usually arrive early in the morning to drop our luggage off on most stays before heading to work which has always been a big help but on this occasion, arrived around midday to drop luggage before heading out for the day. Our room was already ready for us so following a quick check in, as always and bring shown to our room by the helpful hotel staff, we were away for the day. Arrived back in the evening and enjoyed another comfortable & relaxing stay. Always look forward to coming here to stay and am again looking forward to another stay in late April for my birthday, the only hotel i check into for my birthday the last few years. Highly recommend you to stay here, service is fast, efficient, helpful & with a smile. Nothing is too much effort for the staff, and the guest experience is very good. Don’t miss out staying at this jewel of London. ",5,2018,01,09
128,Birthday Suprise,"Fantastic hotel based in Barbican London.
We spent the first weekend after the Xmas period to celebrate my 50th birthday (which wasn't mentioned to the hotel)
Upon check-in the team realized the celebration and spoilt me with Bubbles after an evening in the fantastic pub attached to the hotel (Rugged Hair)
The history and setting of the hotel is first class with great people to accompany the experience.",5,2018,01,09
128,What can I say?,Wonderful building decorated with lashings of style. Incredible members of staff who are both superbly 'uniform' and individual in equal measure. We have already booked for our next theatre trip and can't wait!,5,2018,01,09
128,New Year break,"We stayed at this hotel over the NYE weekend. It has a superb location for both daytime sightseeing trips and also drinks/meals/theatre in the evening......due to very easy Tube access.
The staff were very professional and helpful.",4,2018,01,08
128,great weekend hide away in the city,"A reasonably well appointed hotel with staff who were extremely helpful, cheerful and professional.  The approach of the staff was really excellent and made all the difference.  The room was well appointed but the size of the bed was too small and a king sized bed would have been much more appropriate, especially as there was plenty of space in the bedroom (we had a duplex).  The settee was also very tired and needed replacing.  However, despite this we had a great stay and will be back.  Would have no hesitation in recommending it.",4,2018,01,08
128,Fantastic Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary as we had already stayed before for our wedding ‘minimoon’ 2 years previously, and once again we were very impressed with The Montcalm hotel, especially Francesca the Guest Experience Host, who upgraded our room and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our special occasion! We really could not recommend this hotel more as it and the staff make the stay an absolute pleasure, also the location is great for close proximity to London attractions, west end, soho etc. plus the reasonably priced and secure Barbican car park is right next door.",5,2018,01,07
128,Great overnight stay close to Barbican,"We booked at short notice to go to a concert in London and would definitely stay here again. The location is great, very close to the Barbican, where you can park for the weekend when this part of the city is relatively quiet for £18. The check in was professional and friendly and we were shown to our room personally as it was in another wing and tricky to find - involving the use of two different lifts. We should have paid better attention as got hopelessly lost twice trying to find our room! The room (239) was great with every facility needed and the most comfortable bed. Our only criticism was that we found the lighting/heating a little hard to fathom. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a good value comfortable stay in a brilliant location ... just a few minutes walk from Moorgate tube.",5,2018,01,07
128,Good hotel in a good location,"We stayed here on a trip to London in May 2017.

The hotel is in a good location with easy access to the main attractions via tube.  It is a smart and clean hotel, with nice big rooms - though the bed was quite high up! Breakfast was also very tasty with a good selection and friendly service.  Would stay here again.",4,2018,01,07
128,Overnight for Christmas Party,"Attentive staff at reception - when they saw I was using a walking stick immediately moved me to a more accessible room so I wouldnt have to struggle with the shower. I didnt even have to ask.
Room was very comfortable and the right temperature. Amenities included robe, slippers, toiletries. Chargeable mini bar and free drinks station.
All electronic amenities to hand
Really comfortable and quiet even though I was on 1st floor and near the lift.
Couldnt fault it",5,2018,01,04
128,Good hotel with thoughtful (and well-thought-out) features,"Stayed 3 nights on holiday after Christmas. Quiet (not touristy) location near a couple of tube stops & Barbican Centre. Waitrose around the corner. Check-in was quick & we appreciated a room being ready since we arrived @ 10 AM. Room was small, but bathroom was large with dark tile - clean though some tiles were a bit worn. The shower (over extra long tub) had both rain spout & hand-held shower and the operating instructions were clear (I hate not being able to work out how to operate hotel shower faucets - quite the opposite here). Powerful Babybliss hair dryer. Lighting generally was dim. Bed was really comfortable with smooth soft bedding. Mini-fridge contained minibar items but had just enough free space for our own small water bottles. Fresh fruit provided (and re-stocked) during our stay and decent tea provisions (and biscuits) as well. Free wi-fi. Good value. Highly recommend if the location works for you.",4,2018,01,04
128,Quick stop over for exhibition ,"Spent one night here whist visiting the Barbican. Had a club room. Welcome team was very nice and attentive. The hotel was clean, tidy and lovely and the club bar as nice to relax in.

My only grip was this old building made it impossible to find your way from the room or to reception.",4,2018,01,03
128,"Nice location, beautiful hotel, just a bit too noisy ","This is our second time in Montcalm Brewery in a few months. We managed to get a decent price. We were given a warm welcome on arrival and the staff were attentive, this was an improvement on the last time, although they were lovely then too. 

Our room was once again beautiful, lovely bathroom, free fruit and bottled water, really and coffee facilities, robe, comfy bed...just a nice room and a good size in a great location. 

Unfortunately, the noise was a very irritating problem for us again. This time it seems the floor above had constant banging/walking/cleaning maybe? It was often, and until quite late at night. This seemed to be what let the hotel down last time. We did get a comment from the hotel manager on the previous review, but pulling in a favour to check noise didnt seem like it would have been a fair comparison for other customers. 

The last thing, check out time again! I forgot to ask on checkin but it's normally information always given so I forget to ask. Second time staying and the second time I wasn't told. Not sure if this is supposed to be given? 

All in all, we are mostly happy with our stay, the noise didnt discomfort us too much as it was a leisurely break so no early morning work to scoot too. 

",4,2018,01,02
128,January Gem Of A Hotel....,"Currently staying for 2 nights in Room 207. Warm, efficient and professional welcome at 12noon when we checked in today. Our room was available at 2pm. The concierge took care of our luggage whilst we went off to enjoy a Thames River Cruise. When we returned at 4pm our Club Room had been upgraded to a Montcalm Club. Concierge escorted us to our room.
Rooms easy to find - clear sigh posting.
As we were celebrating New Year they had even left champagne in the room aswell as fresh fruit. 
Room is massive, quiet and faultless. Bed the most comfortable I have slept in. Winderful rain shower and tub. Romantic swans, candles and rose petals left at turndown.
Club lounge has branded beers and spirits on offer in the evening. Was a quiet place to sit and relax before going out to dinner.
Moorgate station 5 min walk away and we were at Tower Bridge after only 3stops.
I cannot express how pleased I am that I booked The Montcalm. 
",5,2018,01,02
128,"Stay was ok, issue with payments","Our room was nice enough, really nice big modern bathroom, and staff seemed polite. However our issue with staying at the hotel was how they went about payments for the room- not only did they charge us twice, one at 2am on the day of check-in, and again when we checked in (without letting us know at the time of booking that they would be charging us twice for the room) but we also had to pay a £50 deposit for the room, which of course we got back within the next few days. When we phoned the room questioning why we had been charged twice, we were told the supervisor would phone back, and they never did. Needless to say this caused unnecessary complications and worry for our one night stay. As I said we did get the money back into our accounts after four days but this whole situation could have been handled better just with better communication to guests and letting them know in advance what money they were taking out of our account and why.",3,2018,01,02
128,Highly Recommend!,"Me and my partner stayed here for one night on New Years Eve and absolutely loved our stay! The staff were very happy, helpful, welcoming and polite. The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable! Check in/out times were great and was only a very short walk from Moorgate tube station which was very useful for our stay. Not only this but the area around the jogel was very quiet which was great! Both of us thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would happily return again!",5,2018,01,02
128,Good value luxury in the heart of the city,"Stayed here for a very reasonable price in the week prior to Christmas (later added breakfast for £15 a day). The hotel is dead handy for the city, and about a ten minute walk from the tube station. It's just round the corner from the Barbican, one of the main reasons for wanting to stay here. There is plenty of character in the buildings from its historic nature and previous uses.The downside is its a bit of a maze, with it's own bridge linking parts of the hotel. Check in was a longer process than is normal, and then we were shown the short cut across the courtyard to the block where room 245 is. The room was small but had plenty of mod cons. The bed was very high indeed, and also very comfortable. Nice black fittings and furniture and touches such as a long shoe horn. There is a fridge full of good stuff, also fruit and some free bottled water (not replaced the second day). There is an easy to use safe half way up the wardrobe watch your head when bending down! The wardrobe is actually quite small, and there is also hardly any draw space. Wifi here has a strong signal and is easy to log onto and there is a good sized flatscreen tv. The bathroom has similar advantages and issues. Lovely shower and lit mirror and nice robes, but hardly any space to put your sponge bag. On the last morning both of our room keys stopped working, which is a bit naughty. 
Breakfast is served in the embedded Chiswell st dining rooms and is excellent. The hot buffet was good quality. On the second morning I ordered the bacon and avocado with chilli on toast, very good it was too. There is also an embedded gastropub the jugged hare where they serve an acceptable pint of real ale in a bar with glass cases full of stuffed animals behind the bar. Overall this a very good hotel and decent value, well worth considering if your staying in the city.",4,2018,01,01
128,Take a compass!,"The Montcalm has been converted from an old brewery, and its layout is dictated by the original purpose of the building. There are stairs or short flights of steps all over the place, and you really need a map to find your way around this rabbit-warren to your room or to Reception. There are lifts, but they don't necessarily serve the floor you want, and you might need to transfer during your journey to or from your room. The only lift serving our floor was out of action on the day we arrived, and although we were told it would be working by that evening, it was still out of use when we left two days later. The climb up three flights of stairs, after crossing the enclosed bridge to the south wing and walking the full length of the first floor corridor was quite tiring.

The staff were all extremely helpful, especially the concierge.

The bed was very comfortable, but the room heating / cooling controls were unfathomable, and after opening the window to cool the room a little, I found that the window catch / handle had fallen off, and it was almost impossible to close the window properly.  In contrast to the bed, the chair at the desk was extremely uncomfortable, almost impossible to sit in.

The shower cubicle was nice and big, with clear instructions for use of the shower, but the bathroom itself was cramped, with practically no space to put my belongings (brush and comb, toothpaste, razor, deodorant, etc., and spectacles when showering).

The hotel does not have its own bar or restaurant, but the pub next door serves meals and drinks. There is also a restaurant on the other side, but it was closed when we were there, between Christmas and New Year: presumably it sees itself as catering for business diners, and there are not many of them at this time of year.

The hotel is just round the corner from the Barbican Centre, and being located in the City of London is convenient for most City locations. The walk to the Underground station feels longer than it actually is.

I was very comfortable, but I found the layout of the hotel very confusing and inconvenient, and its location is more convenient for business visitors to the City than for tourists, so I don't think I would choose to stay again.",4,2017,12,31
128,Can do better,"I am a stickler when it comes to service..that I have nothing to complain about. Mostly pleasant and good. 
But when it comes to the room, it is utterly small and cramp. Not good for ones like me who travel in a few suitcases. Amenities are pretty much standard. Checked out on the gym, ok since I happened to be alone most of the time. Can’t imagine if it was crowded, max 3 person since they only have 3 machines, only one treadmill. 
Breakfast buffet has small selection but good enough. Enjoyed the Cumberland sausages..my fav! In terms of location, centered in City of London. Not a place for tourist since it is a little far off from tourist attractions. 
",3,2017,12,31
128,Way beyond expectations,"The location is good, the rooms are tastefully furnished, the staff and service are excellent -- they will happily go the extra mile, as they did for my partner and I. The facilities, including the Club Lounge and the spa at the nearby sister Hotel, the Royal (which also has an excellent rooftop bar) are equally good. It's a real bonus to have the superb Jugged Hare pub literally next door. If you're in search of authentic British food, you're in luck! A lovely touch is pillows and room scents to suite your taste.

Overall, a truly five-star experience at a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.",5,2017,12,30
128,Birthday weekend,What can I say another great stay at the montcalm. I've actually lost count how many times I've stayed at this hotel but this recent stay topped off all the others and was a little more special. When i arrived the door man collected all my luggage from the car and made sure it was taken to my room whilst I checked in. Even hung up my dress so it didn't get creased. Smooth easy check in. And loved to see the familiar faces as that was a nice gesture of me knowing them and them greeting me. Alice also greeted me on check in which is always lovely and she assured me everything will be prefect for my partners birthday and wanted to arrange with me a bottle in the room and for her team to decorate our room to make it that little extra. My room was the wow suite spacious and everything for a 5* hotel. The day of check in I had plenty time to sort my self out as I has reservations at the gherkin building and the hotel was kind enough to sort a taxi out for us. While we was gone alice and her team made our room super special and placed a bottle in our room so when we got back we could continue to drink and have a romantic evening together. We had breakfast included and club lounge. Breakfast is always nice nothing was any trouble and they would make you anything you wanted if it wasnt at the buffet. I ordered my partner a birthday cake and got it delivered to the hotel and they were kind enough to sign for it and keep it in the fridge and when I was ready for it I just had to ask them. Nothing was any trouble for them. I have to say I think I've stayed at all the montcalm hotels now and this is far my favourite one and would be my first choice all the time. I can't wait to stay here again on another occasions. Deepak always makes my booking so smooth and I can always rely on him. I like the way he builds a relationship with clients that makes them come back and I'm speaking from experience as Deepak sorted out my booking from marble arch back in 2013/2014 and ever since I've been loyal. My partner and I wants to say thank you to the whole team at montcalm especially Deepak and Alice because you are the reason we come back every little occasion. Wi-Fi is included in the hotel and works perfect. Easy location close to stations and buses. Tesco is near the hotel too to pick up bits and pieces if needed. 100% stay at this hotel any trouble do speak to anyone they will be more than happy to help theirs not a single bad thing I can say.,5,2017,12,28
128,Birthday treat ,"Had an amazing weekend celebrating my birthday and staying at the Montcalm. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. We stayed in a Barbican duplex suite which was over and above our expectations. It smelt fantastic as soon as we walked in and had everything you could need and more. Robes, slippers, fruit, bottled water, chocolates on the pillows. The bed was extremely comfortable with plenty of pillows and the bathrooms were also clean and modern with luxury toiletries. We had continental breakfast in the club lounge which was also very good. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again. ",5,2017,12,24
128,Superb hotel with a very unique and quaint architecture,"Stayed three nights here on a business trip in mid July and enjoyed the stay very much.

The hotel itself looks beautiful, much of the original architecture having been retained. Despite the age, the interior of the rooms are very well maintained and new, giving you the best of both worlds. 

Air-conditioning in summer is not one that everyone looks out for but something I wanted to have and was glad they had, having experienced no air conditioning in another establishment the month before during the hot spell.

The staff were very helpful, whether with directions or taking delivery of parcels (including one that arrived ahead of my check in).

All and all a great stay and if my meetings are in the area again, I would certainly hope to be able to stay here.",5,2017,12,24
128,Wonderful,"MyMom and I had A wonderful stay at the Montcalm London! The room was cosy, clean,Quiet and in a nice area close enough to The Picadilly Cercus and all the shops , Restaurants and Broadway shows !
I highly recommend the Montcalm.
I will stay there again in December .",5,2017,12,22
128,Montcalm-ish,"Fairly pleasant weekend stay in a historic building. It was all fine but maybe didn’t match my expectations completely. Concierge and doormen were delightful and helpful.
Room was tiny but that was made up by the wonderful shower. Room service was excellent and affordable. Location of room did mean a fairly long walk from the elevator with some up and down stairs along the way so check if you are carrying heavy bags or would struggle with that. Some outside noise from the windows which are in keeping with the building (ie. old)

Probably a better stay during the week and not the weekend as more local amenities would be open. 7-8 minute walk to either local tube stops.",4,2017,12,19
128,"Ideal for Barbican Theatre, boutique style","Stayed for 1 night when visiting the Barbican for RSC. This hotel is ideal if doing same again - just around the corner from the theatre (5 minutes walk), comfortable, clean hotel Friendly efficient checkin, helpful staff helped show us to our room (bit of a maze, as inside an old warehouse type building).
Room itself (a double deluxe) was ""cosy"" but spacious enough for one night, and comfortable soft bed. Clean modern bathroom with rain style walk in shower. Free wifi, in-room safe, tea/coffee making facilities.

Have stayed also at the Malmaisson - also very comfortable, and for me has slight edge over Montcalm if staying a couple of nights or exploring more generally in the east/central London area. But the Montcalm would be my choice again for a theatre visit to the RSC.",4,2017,12,18
128,Nice hotel-But poor service,"My family were coming to London for my Mother’s birthday, and had booked out three rooms. We came to check in at 1:30 but only one of the rooms was available- which was fine so we checked into that room and put all our bags there, and went out. Then when we came back they couldn’t find our other two room bookings and we waited 15 mins in the reception whilst they tried to sort it out. Turns out they had allocated the rooms we were supposed to have had to other people- we found this out when my sisters’ room had a note inside it with some champagne saying ‘welcome Abdul’ - which the hotel staff promptly removed after we mentioned it to them. Instead of having a room next, or even near, to my family, I was on a different wing, having to go up and down about 5 different sets of stairs, navigating a plethora of endless corridors until I finally arrive at my room. The room itself was nice, clean and tidy- once I eventually got there. Getting lost in dozens of different corridors after coming back in the evening isn’t my ideal pastime. Most staff were friendly but I think we got unlucky with the person who checked us in- he was rude, unhelpful and uncaring which isn’t what we expect at all. ",2,2017,12,17
128,"overbooked,poor managements,drunks in lobby,","Having been to this hotel a few times I can tell you it has changed massively for the worse. Arriving at 8.45pm we found they were overbooked. others were also being shipped to a sister hotel 5 mins away.
Staff are new and are not getting a grip.
wait a second or wait a minute seems the rejoinder.
abusive drunks were coursing through the lobby. On asking about this the answer was that they are part of a party ..not staying at the hotel.
Mr Singh night manager is authorised to offer you a breakfast free
We were offered to sit in an ante room...it had bits of building works going on.
offer of drink was not sorted
So now after 45 mins we got a room
I took on the basis that our manager was offering the breakfast.
He phoned now after 1 hour and said there is no breakfast
at this point we no longer wanted to stay at the hotel
back to lobby with appearance of drunks.
I phoned the police
asked the somewhat tired receptionist if we could have our signed resrvation back
i was informed by Singh that this was the property of the hotel
this is now 10.05pm.
Any thoughts of a meal gone. any thoughts of relaxation gone
made our way home
finally got in at 1.00am
we did not have keys to our house so had to get our son to taxi over
if you ever think of staying at this hotel group i would stay clear
In the past they had coffee and decent staff.
Bad news in every sense.",1,2017,12,17
128,Helpful and well located,"I stayed here recently. Well appointed rooms with space. The first night, i had a room just above the Brewery. Very nice corner room, but very noisey during December as people enjoy Christmas drinks. The staff were very helpful in moving me to a room across the corridor, which was very quiet and peaceful. Great location for me as business is around the corner. ",4,2017,12,14
128,Never fails to deliver,"Part 1-business
I stay at this hotel most weeks on business and it always lives up to expectations. A lovely personalised greeting from the reception team and always a hello from the Guest Experience Team who do an amazing job. I tend to get upgraded to the Club rooms as a regular customer which are spacious, spotlessly clean and roomy, most have Nespresso machines and lovely sized luxurious bathrooms, why stay anywhere else. Unfortunately my company aren't getting Montcalm rates in 2018 so I'll need to look elsewhere but amazing while it lasted! 

Part 2-Leisure
Stayed in November 2017 for our Wedding Anniversary and absolutely amazing. Arranged the rates through Guest Relations who kindly upgraded us to a suite for our special occasion and gave us access to the Club Lounge and Chiswell Dining Rooms for breakfast (will save that for another review). We were met by the fantastic Guest Relations team at check in and taken to our lovely suite, we had a fantastic 2 day stay and were made to feel welcome by all members of the teams.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough for business or leisure, there are challenges with all hotels but any (small) issues I've had they've always gone out of their way to resolve, I may not be back on business but will be looking to book for our next special occasion, thank you all!",5,2017,12,13
128,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed for 1 night as we were attending a function at The Brewery. Reception staff and concierge both pleasant and helpful. We had a club room which was warm, clean with a very comfortable king sized bed. Lovely bowl of complimentary fruit and 2 bottles of water. Would definitely stay again and for longer!",5,2017,12,12
128,Amazing 40th Birthday!,"What a treat. My wife took me to the MontCalm The Brewery for my 40th, the hotel is simply stunning and the staff amazing. Spoilt us rotten with a suite upgrade and access to the lounge which provided a lovely pre evening drink. Ate at their restaurant the Jugged Hare which was equally special. All in all a fantastic stay. Will start saving for my 50th!!",5,2017,12,11
128,Disappointing,"Booked The Montcalm, The Brewery for 2 couples for a theatre weekend. On arrival I thought that the Hotel was just what I had expected. Reception staff were pleasant and welcoming. We were the first couple to arrive and paid for both rooms. When we met up with the other couple I found out that they had paid for the room as well.  An error which should of not happened and immediately put us on the defensive. First morning, went to make a tea and coffee only to find out all the milk capsules had gone off.  The Tv remotes in both rooms didn't work very well. There were no Bath Robes.  In conclusion we all felt that The Hotel was nice and the staff were pleasant and helpful. But the attention to detail was missing, so therefore I would of only given it 3 maybe 4 stars at a push.",3,2017,12,10
128,Small room long way from reception,"Despite advising of birthday nothing was done, which was a little disappointing.
Room was a long way from reception and looked over a brick wall.
It was functional with comfy bed.
Bathroom spacious with good products.",3,2017,12,09
128,Simply superb service and a wonderful stay!,"I booked a night at the Montcalm at the Brewery as a surprise for my girlfriend's 30th birthday and we both experienced a wonderful stay. The staff were attentive and welcoming throughout and went the extra mile to ensure that our stay was special - a free upgrade and champagne, balloons and a birthday card in the room! Thank you all and we will be back!",5,2017,12,08
128,Great location and good accommodation,"Just one Sunday night here - quiet and pleasant.   No restaurant or bar food available that evening and only a pub suggested (The Jugged Hare) - no good for veggies as full of stuffed dead animals gazingly glassily as you dine ... breakfast was an extra to the room rate and £25 when all you want is fruit and yogurt is excessive!   But the bed was a delight, the staff very welcoming.   The building is a real warren of corridors, steps and difficult to navigate without a compass.   I only  managed to find reception once without getting lost.",4,2017,12,08
128,"""Wannabe"" fancy hotel","I was quite excited to try this hotel, we had booked a club room with lounge privileges. At first the hotel seemed nice, decor was lovely. Outside it was quite busy and noisy due to happenings and festivities held at the Brewery almost every evening. Situation at the business quarters left a tourist quite far away from the sights, but the tube station is few hundred yards away. The room was good but a bit worn down. Lounge was ok, really nothing special, not a cozy or warm place to spend time. Evening canapes and drinks were fine. Breakfast was poor, limited choices and low quality products offered. Staff wasn't attentive or proactive. Not that they were rude, but they just didn't get the job. In the evening the hell broke loose in our room, which was unfortunately situated above a pub. Walls were paper thin and the noise of drunk people just penetrated the room heavily until midnight when the pub was closed. This happened every single evening. Our mistake was, we didn't confront the hotel staff about this problem earlier, we somehow assumed hotel was fully booked as such a lousy thing of a room was being used to accommodate guests. At departure staff kind of apologized for the noise and discomfort but weren't willing to give any explanation why we were accommodated in that room in the first place if there were better ones available. One could imagine that noisy room like that provokes negative feedback every single time and would only be used if the hotel was full. Cleaning of the room was sloppy, bathroom amenities were not replenished and attention to detail was absent. Hotel obviously tries to be 5 star, but barely makes it to 3 stars in my opinion. As a tourist staying more than one night I would avoid this hotel if possible.",3,2017,12,06
128,"Wow suite, Deluxe double room","Best Hotel experience ever! Fontina was truly amazing and helpful and the staff in general. Everything was clean, food was good and great location as well. We stayed in the wow suite and the double rooms-both amazing and extremely comfortable. Definitely going back.",5,2017,12,03
128,Stylish and comfortable hotel,"The Montcalm at the Brewery makes good use of an old London building converting it into a stylish and comfortable hotel, but retaining some of the original features. Staff are incredibly helpful and charming and the rooms warm and cosy on a cold night in London. Breakfast was good too. 
If I have one criticism it would be that we would expect a coffee maker in a club room",4,2017,12,03
128,Not recommended ,"Poorly organized and managed hotel.  My reservation was incorrect which created significant delays to check-in (I was not the only one with challenges- they lost the reservation for the guy standing next to me).   I specifically asked if I needed reservations for the restaurant which they responded no, but of course when I went the two restaurants a few minutes later, both were booked solid.  The room itself had poor lighting and was difficult to access.  Overall, not a good experience and I will not reserve here again.

128,Birthday Visit ,"We were fortunate to arrange a weekend stay at this Hotel through Daisy Slavkova, who provided us with friendly and efficient five star service. 
From the moment we arrived to leaving everything about the Hotel, Service and facilities was perfect. 
As we have come to expect from a Montcalm property, the rooms and facilities were superb. 
This coupled with excellent service from every member of staff we encountered made for a lovely relaxing stay. 
I would recommend this Hotel unreservedly and will definitely return.

128,Satisfactory stay,"We stayed here for one night this week whilst attending a function in The Brewery next door. Check in was swift and the place nice and clean. Room was a deluxe double which was exceptionally tight for space. No window in the room either which made the experience very claustrophobic. The glass partition in bedroom into bathroom was all a bit weird! We stayed room only because the price of breakfast was in our opinion, extortionate. Probably wouldn’t return to be honest. Only stayed because it was so handy.",4,2017,12,01
128,Lovely Hotel,Very pleasant staff and atmosphere. Very convenient if visiting the Barbican Centre as it is only a few minutes' walk.  Our room was lovely and comfortable. We will stay here again at our next Barbican Centre concert. Recommended!,5,2017,11,28
128,Accessibility issue,"An accessible room was booked.  First floor - easy lift access, lovely, clean well-equipped room with walk-in shower.  However, the bed was literally so high I couldn't get into it without being lifted into it!  I am 5'2' and the bed hight came higher than my own waist.  The photo's added to this review show my partner who is actually taller than me (a bit!) and hopefully fairly show the height of the bed in relation to her waist.  Any able bodied person could no doubt get into it but for a person with disabilities it was challenging and if I had been a wheelchair user, probably impossible.  This is NOT an accessible room.  The management are advised to get a specialist accessibility advisor in so they can be sure they understand what 'accessible' means.  

Also, weirdly for a London hotel, the receptionist seemed very confused that two women had ordered a double room.  She asked us THREE times if we actually wanted a double.  We hope this is not evidence of homophobia but it was peculiar.

The room was very quiet (a wedding was happening but we did not hear a thing).  It was stylish and chic and the bed - once I got into it - was comfortable.

The Doorman was very welcoming and helpful with out bags.  The reception area is welcoming.

The location is very handy for the Barbican which is just across the road.",3,2017,11,27
128,"Fantastic hotel, great service and location","A wonderful hotel with a fantastic location and I now never stay anywhere when I visit London. 

The service is exceptional and the staff are always friendly and helpful and want to ensure that you have the best stay.

Rooms are a generous size and the food is great!",5,2017,11,26
128,Not really boutique,"Yes, a great location for the city end, near tubes, Barbican etc., and a couple of good if expensive eateries attached (Jugged Hare and Chiswell St Dining rooms, yes service good, and friendly staff (if not a little obsequious with door opening), deserving of some of the good reviews in terms of room size etc etc. But it is not a boutique hotel. A large rambling modern hotel squeezed into an old brewery means three wings, a confusing layout and makes it very easy to get lost. I am trying not to be negative but I think a balance needs to be provided to some of the more gushing reviewers. The club lounge is a dark impersonal space with nothing very special apart from a free continental breakfast. The wellness centre is sad and scruffy with a dingy staircase leading down to it. The bedroom could do with a little attention to decor - it is confusingly high-tech but switches were falling off the walls, and some broken. Interesting idea having a glass partition to the bathroom so you can watch your partner's ablutions, but for the more private moments the electric blind needs to be working properly. A bit of peeling paint in the bathroom, and the obsession with darkness meant that we needed an iPhone torch to check we had left nothing in the wardrobe. The Montcalm Club room and no view but looked straight onto an office block some thirty or forty feet awayThe advertised king size bed was under five feet in width (4.6 base with slightly overhanging mattress) We thought that for the size of the room a larger bed could have been accommodated. So all in all a few grumbles led to us downgrading this a little. Three and a half but that is not available. So better than average but not as good as very good  -  we had expected something slightly different and a bit more special from the reviews.  Still, on the plus side the meal in the Chiswell Street Dining room was very good, even if rather expensive, and the concierge knew a local pub for the BT Sport premier league game in the evening.",3,2017,11,26
128,Christmas break,"Had a fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. Lovely and friendly staff throughout the hotel. I stayed at the montcalm over the road from the brewery which was lovely which had its own reception desk and friendly receptionist at that. 

The cleaners were friendly came and checked to see if we wanted to have it prepared for the evening and gave chocolates too.

The rooms are a great size with a lovely bathroom with a shower in bath and my friend just had a shower cubicle in her bathroom

The rooms were on a street view.",5,2017,11,26
128,Wow Suite should be renamed Absolutely Amazing Fantastic Suite,"The best hotel and staff team bar none. Alice and her team are superb. Right from check in the could not be more helpful. We arrived early and they stored our bags while we went for lunch. Upon our return the room (wow Suite ) was ready and we were still early. The Suite is very appropriately named although is should be more than a WOW.
Four poster bed is so comfortable you literally melt off to sleep. The bathroom with heated flooring, huge bath with jets and rainfall shower is awesome.
It is wonderful being able to play music in the bath and chill.
Apart from the wonderful facilities, we could not fault the team. They are helpful beyond belief and nothing was too much trouble.
I travel often through business and pleasure and have to say that I have not found better than this and doubt if I ever will.
Thanks Alice and team for a wonderful stay, we will be back again, again and again.",5,2017,11,26
128,Business Trip,"Wonderful hotel close to the heart of the City of London. I have also stayed at the Finsbury Square hotel and both have great facilities. The bedrooms are comfortable, breakfast options immense always very attentive at check in and check out.",5,2017,11,25
128,Great location,"The location of the hotel was excelllent, very close to everything. The staff attentive and helpful. The room was big and the bathroom very big. It was clean. Bed comfortable. I did not have breakfast at the hotel but there is plenty of choice around the corner.

I was in room 031- West wing. If you do not mind noise from late in the afternoon to sometime during the evening then this room will suit you. The noise stopped around 10.30 – 11 each night except Friday and Saturday. Saturday I was a bit annoyed with the noise as it woke me up during the night.
Room 031 is right on top of the pub.

If you have difficulties with stairs this hotel is not for you. There are lots of stairs to climb even if you use the lift.

I had a few small problems in my room, for instance one day the electricity did not work, the problem was solved very quickly. Another day the battery in the safe ran out so I could not open the safe, again solved quickly. 

I give the hotel 4 stars because of the great location, the helpful staff and the cleaning standard, however for my stay, there were too many issues and small problems to give the full 5 stars for this stay.",4,2017,11,25
128,Slick,"Good front desk (I tested them out with a couple of things too!), slick and modern rooms, comfy beds there's not much to dislike.

Well, breakfast being 24 quid might be one (though its 17 if booked in advance). 

My room had a big bathroom adapted for wheelchair users.",4,2017,11,24
128,Good location for Barbican and Shoreditch areas,Very helpful staff and well run hotel. Room layout is a bit unusual (bathroom has a big glass window into the room and I couldn't see how to close the blind) but comfortable and well maintained. Would be nice to have a snug lounge for guests to use as the hotel has the feel of a conference centre (which it is!) an area for guests to sit and read the papers with a drink etc. As with most hotels its too hot!,4,2017,11,23
128,We were treated like royalty!,"I've never reviewed a hotel before now, but this place has earned it!  The service we received was exceptional.  The staff went out of their way to make our family's stay as relaxed and comfortable as possible.  Our room (a very generous upgrade) was fab!",5,2017,11,23
128,Fly in the ointment,"I must start by saying this is a 5 star hotel and fully deserves that billing. The ambience, attention of the staff and quality of the room all meet or exceed the expectations of most travellers....... all to be let down by the breakfast. The restaurant was understaffed, the tables not properly set and the choice in the hot food buffet was less than You would get in a Holiday inn. All for £17.00 each. 
Would I go back if on another London city break, yes definitely. But I would hope by then the brekkies had improved. ",4,2017,11,19
128,Really speoial hotel,"This is a fabulous hotel, excellent staff and customer service, great rooms, nice business class type lounge to relax in, just really exceptional from start to finish. If I am clutching at straws the room needed one switch that killed all the lights, but that's hardly a complaint. Would recommend to anyone.",5,2017,11,16
128,Amazing stay,"I don't often write reviews but the staff at The Montcalm went above and beyond for us, I had to share! My partner and I where celebrating our one year anniversary and as soon as we got to the hotel we were told we had been upgraded to a suite. The room was spectacular! It had two floors, two bathrooms, a lounge as well as a lovely room. Wee were even given a complimentary bottle of wine. I can honestly say they made our stay very special and we will definitely be goin back!",5,2017,11,15
128,"Great staff, great hotel, great price","My husband and I had a wonderful one night stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery London City. It was a birthday treat and the hotel were kind enough to upgrade us to a suite upon arrival and provided a bottle of complimentary wine in the room. I cannot fault anything about our stay. Fontina, the guest experience manager, greeted us upon arrival and ensured she was there upon our departure to say goodbye. All the staff were friendly and approachable and the room was clean and very nice. I would warn guests that the bedroom windows do not keep out all the street noise and the floor was creaky but the building is Grade II listed and for us it wasn't a problem as we appreciate the history of the building. Without hesitation I would stay at this hotel again, in fact I am thinking of taking my young daughter there when I take her to London as I know that we will be looked after extremely well. Thank you again The Montcalm, keep up your excellent customer service and high standards.",5,2017,11,15
128,Look forward to trying again,"I will be working in Chiswell street for a good couple of years to come, so was really pleased to find this hotel with such good reviews and I hoped to use it for the foreseeable future. Its difficult to find good hotels in this area. Unfortunately I didn’t live up to the majority of reviews on here.

The hotel is well situated 5 mins walk from either Barbican or Moorgate tube stations. On arrival all the staff are friendly, which continued through the stay. However, for a quiet Sunday afternoon check in was laborious. I had to input my card details 3 separate times due to all the various requests by reception staff, surely this could have been done in one go?! It didn’t help that I was seen by 2 separate people during check in, being asked the same questions twice. After 15 mins I finally received a door card, and I was then asked if I would like breakfast as it wasn’t included in the booking. I had distinctly included breakfast, so immediately queried this. I received the same response. As I was in a bit of a rush I left it, but upon checking all the booking details breakfast was definitely included. I feel a bit cheated by this.

The room itself was a double room on the second floor. A little small, but comfortable with some character with dark wood fittings and modern finishes. All the expected basics were in place such as a kettle, minibar fridge, iron etc. The room was clean, and though it was slightly small there was enough room to store items. Apart from the intermittent working tap in the bathroom, it was difficult to get a good nights rest. The room was noisy from traffic below, but especially from the other hotel guests simply walking along the hallway. The rooms door is right in the room with no seals around it to block out the worst of the light or noise. It just made you feel every time someone walked past they could be in your room!

All the problems are simple things that could easily be addressed to make this into a good hotel, but its such a shame this place fell short. I’ll continue to look elsewhere in the area.
 
 
Update: I have since spoken to the House Manager at the hotel who has been very co-operative in understanding and looking into the problems I encountered during my stay. The hotel have looked into the check-in process and the problems around the inclusion of breakfast, and have refunded me accordingly. The hotel owners do seem to want to make a difference to the customers experience and will try and action any difficulties you may have. Given the post stay service I have received I will definitely go back to the hotel and give it another chance in the new year.",4,2017,11,13
128,Romantic gateway,"Although I spent only a night in the hotel, it's been a wonderful experience. I requested a special touch for the room being my 2nd anniversary with my girlfriend, and she was happier than ever. A special thank goes to Fontina, Guest Experience Manager, for her kindness and professionalism.
Maybe just the bed was a little too soft for a good sleep.",5,2017,11,13
128,Would stay again,"I️ stayed here for a week on a work trip because it was relatively close to the office, within budget and had pretty good reviews.

I’d stay here again because of the location, quality for a reasonable rate and attention to detail from the people who work there.

Everyone was very nice, helpful and accommodating. I️ landed super early so they showed me to where I️ could change and get ready for a day of sightseeing since it was far too early for my room to be ready. 

The rooms are a bit on the small side which is to be expected in London however I thought it was very nicely done and the bathroom is huge.

The one thing I️ would change would be that I️ wish the doors had the top hotel lock (deadbolt) on them. I️ felt safe the entire stay but for being in a major city I just want the extra lock (I️ live in NYC so this just might be a peace of mind thing).The location isn’t central for a vacation/family trip but it’s perfect if you need to be in or around Barbican Centre. 

I️ would stay again the next time I’m in town for work! ",5,2017,11,12
128,Amazing hotel,"We had an amazing time in London and to make it even better was coming to an amazing welcoming hotel, the hotel had amazing staff who was so polite and welcoming and the hotel it self was amazing, it was based in a really nice spot, and the rooms was beautiful! I will definitely be coming back next year",5,2017,11,12
128,Couldn’t have been looked after better,"We spent our wedding night in the Wow Suite at the Montcalm. We could not have been looked after better! The room was stunning, the staff were
 friendly, accommodating and extremely helpful, and the room service quick and delicious. When we came into the room, we were surprised by candles, rose petals and a bottle of champagne. The concierge was very helpful arranging transport for us. ",5,2017,11,11
128,Beautiful hotel,"Such a lovely hotel, the staff were very helpful, friendly and attentive. Our room was amazing, luxurious and spotlessly clean. The location of the hotel is great too, its in quite a quiet area away from the hustle and bustle, but also only a short walk from the tube station which obviously connects you to everywhere.",5,2017,11,10
128,Wonderful Experience ,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay, the hotel was clean and beautifully presented in every way. The staff were fantastic, a special mention to Alina, Alex and Nona, who all contributed the fabulous time we had. We enjoyed an upgrade to the club room which was spacious and immaculately presented.. The Club Lounge was great too!! We are already recommending the hotel to all we know and look forward to staying again.. soon.. ",5,2017,11,08
128,Amazing stay,"Had the most AMAZING stay here on 27/10/17. We had been married 1 week and booked a standard room... Fontina and her amazing experience team looked after us, upgrading our room to a duplex Barbican suite with a bottle of bubbles!! Our stay was fantastic and we were totally spoilt! We will definitely be back, thank you � xxx",5,2017,11,08
128,Service was worst I’ve experienced in years,"For a business hotel I generally look for two things: comfortable bed/decent shower and speed/quality of service. On the first, they were fine ... but when you’re paying over £200 b&b you really take that as base line.  However, on speed and quality of service, this hotel needs to get a grip: 
- Check-in took 15 minutes, even though they had four desks open and there were only eight people in front of me.  Many behind me were waiting longer and were getting hot under the collar. 
- Once at the check-in desk, my fully prepaid company deal included a “full breakfast”, but this required a call to the manager to elicit whether it was full continental or full English. Apparently it was full continental. Fine by me, but we’d just wasted another 3 minutes. 
- In the morning I went to the concierge to ask where I might get some paracetamol (headache due to an airless room). He looked like a startled rabbit at such a question, rummaged around in his drawer full of papers, but didn’t find anything. Finally he suggested where I might find a shop open. 
- When it came to breakfast, I was told my “full continental” required me to eat in the “Club Lounge”, rather than with my business colleagues, who, despite all having the same travel company booking, were apparently “full English” and allowed to eat in the restaurant.  The Club Lounge had the worst breakfast selection I can recall seeing in any hotel, there was no butter, and I had to ferret around to get some milk for my tea. When I went the five yards to get a croissant (which, incidentally, was cold and stale), I returned to find my place had been cleared away.
- I then came to check out. Another 10 minute queue and, no, although there was nothing to pay, apparently it was not acceptable just to drop off my key. 

All in all, really poor. The staff weren’t unfriendly, it just felt like the culture being set by whoever is at the top was not one which puts the customer first. Whoever is at the top needs to spend 24 hours watching what happens in this hotel (or how about just being an overnight guest?) ... and you’ll soon find out why your customers aren’t coming back.",1,2017,11,08
128,Perfect stay,"This is an excellent hotel in the heart of the City, convenient for the Barbican Centre, Liverpool Street station etc. It is surrounded by places to eat or buy food. The room was on the small side but very good value with the deal I had and wonderfully appointed. Lots of 5* features to make me feel pampered. It was very quiet because it was overlooking the rear courtyard and the event with loud music stopped at midnight. I would certainly go again.",5,2017,11,06
128,Great location and character but not matching its aspiration in all areas,"I have stayed here previously; there were one or two frustrations, but due to it being close to the office I picked it again.

Check in was again very slow - two people at reception, only one person in front of me and from arriving to concluding check in it took about 10 minutes. It seemed like the receptionist I was dealing with was new and had to ask for help a couple of times when responding to some basic questions, but when wanting to check in promptly to then go out to dinner, it was not the service a hotel of this type should aspire to.

Location very good and I like the character of the hotel and of the rooms. The layout is quite confusing and one of the concierges always escorts to the room  - am in two minds if this is entirely helpful or a bit annoying. 

The room was of average size. Only one plug near the desk with was a bit frustrating.

Bed comfortable. Despite there being a popular and noisy bar on the ground floor there were no disturbances and I had a good night's sleep.

Some of the furnishings  in the room were a bit tired.

Room was £189 for b&b per night (the cheaper breakfast room option) and overall felt it could be better value for money.",3,2017,11,04
128,Brilliant place to stay in town! ,"We were upgraded to a Wow suite which was lovely as we were in town for an evening show to celebrate my birthday. The staff could not have been more helpful. They took great care in making sure I didn’t miss out on anything by providing snacks and breakfast to meet my food intolerances in the club lounge. 

We enjoyed it so much and with the added bonus of a club lounge I could eat in 
we are heading back for husbands 50th next week!

Thanks Montcalm staff you are brilliant! ",5,2017,11,04
128,Another fab stay!,"We celebrated my husbands birthday at the Montcalm last Friday. We were upgraded on arrival to a suite with champagne and chocs in the room, Alice our CS manager together with her new assistant called Fontina were excellent and made our stay that extra bit special as always! Alice even came into the restaurant where we were eating and organised a celebratory drink. Breakfast in the morning was also superb, however if I have one small criticism it would be that the waiting staff for breakfast with the tea and coffee were not always attentive to your needs. We are already looking forward to our next visit for a birthday.
Keep up the good work!! :-)",5,2017,11,03
128,Fantastic stay,"Not only one of the best hotels in London but the staff were so friendly and polite. Would defiantly stay again. A huge thank you to Grace & Katrina for the wonderful hospitality. Staff were so helpful and made the stay even better.
",5,2017,11,02
128,Just perfect - don't miss it if visiting the City,"We stayed here recently for a trip we were making to London for my husband's birthday.  

Even before we arrived the guest experience manager had been in touch to ask if the visit was for a special occasion and if they could assist in any way.  Well of course it was and they were more than happy to get a bottle of champagne installed in the room before we arrived.

When we finally did arrive (a short stroll from Moorgate or Barbican stations) the doorman greeted us and showed us into the lobby.  This is part of an old brewery and the vaulted ceilings give a real sense of space.

The check in process was excellent - again the customer experience manager arrived to welcome us and offer birthday greetings to my husband - a lovely touch.

The concierge took our luggage away to be stored until the room was ready and it was in the room waiting for us when we got back.

The room itself (the WOW suite) was vast with a huge four poster bed (my first time) and a luxurious bathroom with waterfall, hand held shower and bath.

Checking out was also a breeze and again the chap who managed the process was lovely.

The entire visit was perfect from start to finish - all the staff were great and could not do enough for you.  

Will I go back?  You bet - that's where I'll be staying from now on when I visit London.  

Great location, beautiful rooms and wonderful staff - what's not to like?",5,2017,11,01
128,Recommend Grace,"My stay at the Montcalm was great. The staff are absolutely lovely. Grace was really helpful, professional and attentive. She even fixed a problem I had with my phone.  I come to London quite often - will definitely be back.",5,2017,10,31
128,Above and beyond expectation!,"We had an amazing stay with an upgrade to a suite which was stunning, our anniversary was made so special with rose petals, bubbly and chocolates.

Thank you to Alice and the team at Montcalm Brewery for your efforts!.",5,2017,10,31
128,Fabulous weekend in fabulous surroundings!!,Thank you so much to the amazing staff at this gorgeous hotel for looking after us so well. Such a fabulous hotel in a fascinating building - everything you need to a relaxing stay with that touch of luxury to make you feel special. Particular thanks goes to Alice in guest experience - a lovely lady and she did a superb job. ,5,2017,10,30
128,Lovely hotel in fairly good location,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night and we were not disappointed. The staff on check in were friendly and the concierge walked us to our rooms with our luggage, which was a nice touch.

The room itself was a decent size, not huge but nicely decorated and the bathroom was large with a great shower. The room itself was probably one of the cleanest I've stayed in, big thumbs up for that! 

The breakfast wasn't great, overcrowded, constantly ran out of food and the staff seemed overwhelmed. However this didn't put a dampener on our stay.

I'd recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.",4,2017,10,29
128,Amazing Birthday Celebrations ,"Hotel is fabulous it's in a great location and with amazing staff who really went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant stay. Montcalm Club rooms are just wow! Definitely will be returning soon !! 
",5,2017,10,26
128,"Amazing, a must if you want a great hotel in London.","My Sister and I have just returned from a night at the Montcalm at the Brewery.
We would like to thank all the staff especially Fontina and her amazing team.
We were there for my Sisters Birthday treat and we were not disappointed, we were upgraded to the WOW Suite which was totally amazing we also had a lovely card and bottle of bubbles waiting for us which was totally unexpected but very much appreciated.
Breakfast the next morning was mind blowing, as so delicious we didn't want to leave.
We look forward to returning again soon so until then a very BIG THANK YOU to you all.
Linda Price and Maxine Allen.",5,2017,10,23
128,perfect place to spend my 21st,This is hands down the nicest place i have ever stayed. so welcoming and well designed inside. we had a room on the top floor away from everywhere else so it was quiet and we were undisturbed. The bath tub was huge so made for a good place to relax after a long day in the city. We overslept in the morning and very nearly missed breakfast however they allowed us to sit down anyway and we didn't feel rushed to finish up and get out. We were also able to store our bags there for the day so we could enjoy another day in the town. Would stay here again in a heartbeat,5,2017,10,23
128,Superb hotel and fabulous staff,"We had an fabulous stay. I ordered flowers and champagne for a special occasion and  everything was handled to the letter. Fontina and Alice were superb and made us so welcome, as did all the staff. Could not wish for a better experience, with superb staff and a great room. Perfect.",5,2017,10,22
128,Effortless 5 star service perfect for birthday weekend,"Booked the Montcalm for 45th Birthday weekend for my wife (and a belated 50th for me). For a 5 star in London rates are very competitive and it's only 2 tube stops from kings Cross. We generally used the Barbican tube station which is a short direct walk from the hotel and no problem with weekend luggage. Being close to a central tube also makes getting about London dead easy.

What made this trip special, however, was the hotel service. Whilst you can't really expect an upgrade just because of a birthday or special occasion I get the impression that Montcalm make a specific effort if they have the space. We had only booked the double but ended up in the Montcalm Club suite with a card, balloons and a bottle of reserve chianti waiting for us. We are far from posh folk but it was a nice red and not expected. 

In addition because of some confusion caused via the booking agent (nothing to do with the hotel) we were also offered complimentary continental breakfast which had a lovely selection of food including fresh fruit, salmon and meats and was  (for us) nicer than the standard full breakfast although we could have chosen that at the restaurant downstairs at a reduced rate.
Personally I would recommend the continental it's in a drawing room with really helpful service and papers etc.

Our room was great fantastic bed, spotless and the usual touches including a free smartphone for use during your stay (not seen that before). Decor and ambience was super classy but comfortable. 

The service in general was just ultra professional and friendly - made us feel welcome but not artificially so - and from the front desk to the concierge to the cleaning staff they all made the effort to say hello and pass the time of day.

We stayed at another hotel in London 2 years ago but it doesn't compare. Montcalm is sort of like a 5 star boutique hotel with a bit of Kingsman thrown in as it's got loads of history in the building itself. We like to stay at different places when we get a rare break from kids etc but this just ticked all the boxes for us so next time we come to London (even if we have the kids in tow) we will be back at Montcalm. It made the weekend for us. 
",5,2017,10,22
128,Excellent service and lovely rooms!,"The Montcalm is in such a great location, quite central and the building has a lovely fascinating feel to it. 

From the minute we stepped into the lobby you could tell the service was going to be excellent. The door man was super friendly and always opened the door with a smile. 

At first the room location was a little confusing to find but I couldn’t fault the building one bit. As you can see from my photos the decor was modern and the bed was very comfortable(shame I didn’t take a photo). Safe to say if I am ever in London I will be considering The Montcalm again. 

We got breakfast included with our room and it was right next door at this lovely little restaurant that we visited the night before for drinks. The breakfast didn’t fall sort of option, there were hot and cold food choices along with teas and juices upon request.",5,2017,10,21
128,Excellent hotel,"Having spent unpleasant nights in several way below average London hotels in recent months, it was a real pleasure to stay at the Montcalm. It's everything you should expect in a hotel, but other London hotels often fall short of this standard. It's very clean, beautifully designed, the bed is so comfortable, and the room is very comfortable. It's quiet, well-designed, and the air conditioning works without making hideous noises or blowing freezing air on you.
The staff are lovely, very attentive in a professional way. The wifi is free, there's fruit and water on offer in the room, and the breakfast was lovely. I'm so pleased to have discovered this hotel. I'll definitely be back.",5,2017,10,20
128,A Curates Egg,"A mixed and (due to various issues) overly long review I am afraid. 

Don’t get me wrong this is a very good hotel. As soon as you enter the foyer you can tell it is straight from the top drawer but our stay would have been better if there had not been some, admittedly, minor problems. 

The hotel was chosen on location alone; reputation, facilities and price or even value for money was not our initial concern. We were due to attend an event being held at the Barbican Centre and as my husband has severe mobility difficulties the most important thing was to be as close to the venue as possible. 

From that point of view it is ideal; you are literally just a hundred or so yards away.

We booked six weeks in advance and did so via telephone rather than online in order to clarify several issues regarding access, stairs and bathroom facilities etc. This took a little longer than expected and required three calls to the Customer Related Enquiry service as well as one to the hotel itself. 

The conversations were not that straightforward but our concerns regarding potential mobility issues were answered and so I looked to confirm my booking immediately. It should be noted that you cannot book directly with the hotel which seems strange and somewhat self defeating to be honest.

The booking was therefore made with the C.R.E. service (David Da Costa) who was both helpful and personable throughout. We referred him to the relevant online offer / price regarding the availability of deluxe double rooms of which we required two. He advised the rooms would be next to each other, which ultimately was not the case, and that one would have the disabled friendly features discussed. 

We arrived mid-afternoon Friday; reception was quite busy but well staffed and so no real delay was incurred. The only steps encountered (3) was at the entrance itself and were wide, gradual and fitted with a handrail; furthermore staff were always available to assist and ensure my husband managed them without too much discomfort. 

The room was ideal for our needs; situated on the first floor and close to a lift, it had a walk-in shower fitted with a pull down seat and grab rails. The toilet also had supports and there was an emergency cord available if required. There was enough access for a wheelchair in both the wet / bedroom should one be necessary. 

All in all it was well designed and laid out and while I respect every case is different I do believe someone with fairly substantial mobility problems could book here with a reasonable amount of confidence. 

Unfortunately the second room was, in comparison, quite disappointing; not from a décor and fittings perspective but from silly things such as the television not working, neither did the heating for that matter and even the ironing board (which was actually required) was broken and could only be used by laying it flat on the bed. 

Nothing massive but enough to take the gloss off our stay which was a shame because we were told upon arrival this room was an upgrade on that which had originally been booked although it was not apparent what the differences and enhancements were. 

Be that as it may, we are grateful to whoever was responsible for this kind gesture.

In conclusion, it is a good hotel; the staff in general but especially those involved with room service, were kind and attentive. Its proximity to the Barbican Centre is its main asset and selling point – whether it constitutes real value for money we are not so sure but we would, providing the same room was available, have no hesitation in returning.

Also worthy of mention is the free Wi-Fi and complimentary local and international calls which was a ‘handy’ and unexpected bonus.

One last point if someone from the hotel happens to read this; the tea / coffee making facilities are very good and offer a wide choice but have you realised how awkward it is to fill the kettle because of the restrictive size of the hand basin and it can only be done a cup at a time. Not aware if this is the situation in all rooms or whether it purely applies to those fitted with wet-room suites.

Thank you",4,2017,10,19
128,Amazing Birthday Visit,This was my second stay at Montcalm London Brewery and it was faultless. We were upgraded on arrival to a Wow Suite and the very helpful staff and Guest Manager couldn't do enough for me in helping arrange a surprise for my husband. The Club Lounge does not stock Diet Tonic but the staff did not hesitate when I requested some and it duly arrived at my room within minutes. Great breakfast and such comfortable beds! Can't wait to return ,5,2017,10,18
128,Good hotel in the city,"I booked this hotel primarily because  it was close to where I was attending a course and it also gave me the chance to meet a friend.

The hotel is a converted brewery and so has a slightly quirky appearance.  I was pleasantly surprised on checking in to be told I had been given a free upgrade to the Wow suite.  The room is an usual mix of the traditional (fireplace and four poster bed) and modern (most of the furnishings and bathroom).  Also, rather oddly there is a window with electric blind between the bathroom and bedroom - not sure what that's about but it amused us!

We ate at the Jugged Hare - essentially an upmarket city pub with decent food.  Nothing special but very acceptable food and good beer/ale selection.

Doormen are a little stiff and, in particular, seemed suspicious of me and my partner when we returned after dinner - maybe they were worried about gatecrashers at the wedding reception being held at the hotel that evening.

Overall, a good place to stay in the City for a reasonable price.",4,2017,10,17
128,Fantastic Location,"I booked this hotel for a September weekend getaway and paid an extremely reasonable price for our stay.

The location is fantastic. Within easy walking distance of Liverpool street station (handy if you are getting the Stansted Express) and Moorgate Underground Station.

I found the hotel and room itself to be extremely clean and well appointed.

The staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay and we availed of the complimentary drinks and Finger food from the Club room, located on the first floor.

Overall, I could not fault our stay in any way and I would book The Montcalm again without hesitation.",5,2017,10,16
128,Customer service at its best!,"I booked two nights for my girlfriend and I for her birthday, the hotel came as a recommendation from a friend and I am glad I booked.

The hotel is two stops from London Bridge, Covent Garden was about 15 minutes (walk and tube) and about 15 minutes walk from the Gherkin (next to swingers crazy golf - great place).

The room was a little small, but packed with everything we needed and more. Very clean with a modern vibe making the rooms feel first class. They provide a free smart phone for your stay which is excellent for getting around and seeing the sites of London (I only really used it to search tube station routes but it worked perfectly). It's worth noting that the data is free of charge in or out of the hotel.

Unfortunately there was a power cut on our second day (a cable caught fire in an adjacent building - nothing related to the hotel). This caused a 4 hour power outage, no lighting, showers or water from the sinks). The staff were incredible, facing angry (idiotic) customers who couldn't cut them a break from an issue they had no control over. That said the staff were truly amazing, we asked for shower facilities and they offered use of the suites in a separate building for customers to use. They gave us a letter of apology, a nice bottle of wine and an offer to attend the bar for free drinks and snacks that evening. To top this off on checkout the following day, the Duty manager 'Charles' also gave apologies (again not required in my opinion). 

Overall a fantastic stay, willing to go the extra mile for their customers. I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel and I would stay here again.",5,2017,10,15
128,Perhaps the greatest hotel I’ve stayed in todate,"I booked a hotel close to The Barbican for my graduation in May 2017.

The Montcalm Brewery was incredible, from the moment we arrived we were treated warmly and with welcoming arms.

We were shown to our room and I had been upgraded because of graduating, so it really was a special occasion. The room was clean warm and smelt amazing! The bed was big and comfortable and very very classy.

My only criticism is that I chose to eat in The jugged Hair pub as part of the package I paid for, I wish I hadn’t because I could hear my self talk to the wife as it was so noisy with people chatting, I ordered a main but no sides came and it was a bit of a disappointment (but that’s not the Montcalm fault!)

Breakfast was had in The Chigwell DinningRooms and let’s say it was incredible, great selection of food and very nice venue (wish I had eaten there in the previous evening for dinner!) 

I’d definitely stay here again such a brilliant hotel 👌🏽
",5,2017,10,15
128,Excellent hotel,"We visited as a couple when I was heavily pregnant so it was our little babymoon. Hotel location was good for us, the area was quiet at the weekend. The hotel staff were all excellent, nothing was too much trouble and felt very luxurious. 

Would stay here again. ",5,2017,10,13
128,Superb...and more,"We stayed in a club room. This was in fact a second night having been in London City Suites the previous night. Although with a different name it's actually an annexe to the Montcalm.
As I was already checked in it was just a room changeover, fast polite and efficient. The staff here are so professional and polite....and that's all of them.
Our club room was a good size, room amenities excellent and everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel. The bed was really comfortable with a mattress topper and crisp quality linens. Unusually both still and fizzy water were supplied and a good selection of teas and a nespresso machine.
Breakfast served in the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms was a lovely environment and quite a surprise for a large hotel. Having choices from an a la carte menu AND a buffet was fantastic. The range of buffet items was not huge but certainly adequate and the everything was top quality. 
Would I stay here again...... I really hope I have the opportunity to make this hotel a regular stay. Highly recommended",5,2017,10,05
128,Wedding Night Stay ,"We stayed at the Montcalm Brewery on Sat 16th September with our wedding party.   What an amazing hotel.  Immaculate rooms, Myself and my
husband were so happy with our room.  A massive thank you to Vlad for making us feel so welcome & thank you for helping me when I got lost - you know the hotel so well!!! 

All the staff were so attentive and friendly.  We will be back again soon :) 

Thank you !!!! 

",5,2017,10,03
128,Luxury Experience,Hotel was stunning and a joy to stay in. The service was just as amazing. The guest experience team looked after us beautifully during the weekend stay. They suggested and organised us using a local Montcalm spa which was fantastic and it was so quick to get into the west end in an Uber in minutes then come back and relax in the city which was calm and peaceful. There is an amazing coffee shop called 'fix' nearby. Many thanks to Remus the hotel manager and his excellent team for looking after us.,5,2017,10,03
128,Quality hotel in central London,"In the last couple of months stayed frequently at this quality hotel. Well fitted out and comfortable bedrooms. Welcoming staff and in particularly would recognise Fontina on Reception and Guest Services in providing excellent service. 
Robert Aldrich",5,2017,10,02
128,Regular Business visits,"As a frequent user of hotels in London I initially started using this hotel based on the convenient location and good transport links.  The rooms, lounge and Gym are of a good standard as is the food in the agacent Chiswell Dinning Rooms.

 The consistently helpful and efficient reception team coupled with real attention to detail from Fontina,the new customer service manager, means that this is now the only hotel I use for my frequent London visits.",5,2017,10,02
128,Held my wedding here and it was just fantastic :),"We got married here in September and I can honestly say it was just perfect from start to finish.  Nikki, the wedding co-ordinator, was such a pleasure to deal with, it was all so straightforward and went like clockwork on the day thanks to Nikki and the staff behind the scenes.  We had a small group (34) for the daytime ceremony and meal, then about another 100 guests in the evening, and basically had the run of the facilities, with guests gathering first in the Worsely Room, moving to the Melville Room for the ceremony, and then to the Samuel Room for the wedding breakfast.  The evening reception was held next door in the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms restaurant.  We were also fortunate enough to be able to use the Brewery's courtyard for photos, so it all flowed beautifully.
The food was fantastic from the canapes, to the meal, to the hot bowl food in the evening, and the staff were excellent - friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  As for the hotel rooms, we were upgraded to a Wow Suite which felt really special, with lots of little extra touches waiting for us when we got back to the room at the end of the evening.  Like the restaurant staff, the hotel staff were so friendly and the service was fabulous (particular thanks to Sandra who saved the day when the zip broke on my mother's dress!).  We had a truly wonderful day and I can honestly say there was nothing about the venue that I was disappointed with, regretted or would have done differently. I knew from when I first looked around the place that it ticked all my boxes - I wanted somewhere central, a bit luxurious but not too formal or stuffy, with good food and good ambience, and it certainly fulfilled all of my criteria.  It was the best day ever!  Special thanks to Nikki, who as I said was fantastic to deal with, and to all the staff who helped us and our guests enjoy our big day.  I would wholeheartedly recommend The Montcalm in the City/Chiswell Street Dining Rooms to anyone wanting a London wedding - we are still smiling about it now - and will definitely go back next year for an anniversary celebration :)",5,2017,10,02
128,Fabulous Hotel on all levels,"This Hotel was a complete surprise to me.  Recommended by a friend, I had no idea what to expect but it surpassed all expectation.  From the moment the Concierge greeted to the moment I had to leave, there was not one aspect that disappointed.  I was warmly and efficiently welcomed at Reception.  Nothing was too much trouble. En route to my room, as someone with hotel industry experience, I noted how clean the surroundings were: carpets, walls, pictures, vases, windows.  All were spotless.  My room was simply magical with every attention to detail.  The bathroom was large and immaculate, stylishly decorated and with additional toiletries, if needed, along with copious towels and flannels.  The bed was - honestly - the most comfortable in which I have ever slept.  I have a bad back, so really appreciated that.  The pillows were likewise wonderful.  All the decor was stylish.  All the lights worked - a miracle these days!  No dust anywhere!  Fresh fruit and water.  A well-stocked mini-bar with extra 'nibbles'.  Room Service was delivered promptly, with an amazing smile and, again, great attention to detail.  It was as luxurious as one could imagine for, incredibly, a VERY reasonable price.  And what made it extra special was the staff.  They were incredible, without exception: smart, professional, helpful and hugely welcoming and cheerful.  Absolutely fantastic.  I would recommend this Hotel to anyone.  Don't take take it from this review, go experience it for yourself.  It really delivers!",5,2017,10,02
128,"Fabulous location, wonderful hotel.","Everything about this hotel ticked all of my boxes. Staff were terrific, really really helpful.
Room was perfect and the bed was super comfortable.
Monogrammed slippers and soft bath robes await the weary traveller, accompanied by intoxicating bath and shower products, complimentary fruit and Spring water. It really is bliss.

The hotel itself is beautiful and full of history. Location wise, it's a hop and a skip from Liverpool Street station, 10 minutes by cab to The Strand, 15 to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Theatre land. 

Loved our stay and would definitely go back next time we are visiting the UK. ",5,2017,10,01
128,Best Hotel in London ,"My mom and I had the best time at this hotel. The room was fantastic, the location was great, and the staff was so incredibly helpful. One person, who specifically comes to mind is Fontina. She was so helpful in getting us the perfect room, recommending restaurants and things to do in the city, as well as consistently making sure my mom and I were having a great time. Thank you Fontina and thank you Montcalm!! ",5,2017,10,01
128,Character and charm ,"My visit was a mix of business and friends and The Montcalm had a good rate offered for the week night and weekend. This hotel use to be an old Brewery building so offers something a little different in terms of design and layout. 
I was upgrade to a Club room and the hotel staff were excellent, helping me at every point. The breakfast room service was very good and arrived hot. 
I didn't eat at the restaurants (you have two to choose from) I had a drink in the Jugged Hare and  the cost was good, the food did look good. If I have more time in the future I will book a table.
The only slight negative for some may be the hotel layout. As it's an old building it has many corridors and it's easy to get lost. The staff always took me to my room when I arrived back however. 
The room cleanliness was excellent, and the bed super comfy.
I would recommend this hotel. Many thanks Team Montcalm at the Brewery! ",4,2017,10,01
128,Never quite works for me,"I have stayed here at least 4 times and given the price you pay for a room, I always find it fails to tick all the boxes. This time the room was easy to find - no need for maps, guides and umbrella when sent across the road but once in the room one still spends minutes trying to locate switches for lights and to get the air conditioning to deliver the right temperature. Very irritating when all you want is a shower and a good nights sleep. My main irritation on this visit was check- in. The queue was so long that I went to the Jugged Hare for a pint and when I returned, I still had to wait 15 minutes. An opportunity for improvement!",3,2017,09,29
128,Perfect stay in the heart of London,"We stayed at this hotel three nights in a city break dedicated to theatres and museums. Everything was perfect at the Montcalm - the location, the food was delicious, beds were relaxing, toiletries - simply exquisite, and the atmosphere - vintage with a flair of modernism. But the best thing was the service: very polite staff, anticipating one's needs, ready to answer all questions and always smiling. I would like to thank Dorina for her hospitality and special humour, Alex, Florin and Emil. They made us feel like home and deserve our deep thanks. We will definitely return to Montcalm at the Brewery Hotel in London next time when we're in town.",5,2017,09,27
128,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here for business twice over the last month and it was in the perfect location. The staff are friendly and professional and the food is beautiful. The only downside was that the second time I stayed here, I could literally hear everything from the room next door, as it was an adjoining room. I heard the other guest flushing the toilet, the television, the shower. I was kept awake by their snoring and then in the morning I was woken up by their alarm!! It was perfectly clear that they weren't being excessively noisy, it was the fact the door separating the rooms was quite thin.
I did telephone down for earplugs and they were brought up to my room in minutes. Again, the staff are brilliant here and I didn't complain to them about the noise. I didn't see there was much they could do about it seeing as the guest next door wasn't being particularly noisy. It was quite late (past midnight) when I gave up and telephoned for earplugs, otherwise I might have asked to move rooms.
If I were to book again, I would ask that my room isn't joined to another. It was the only thing I could find fault in.",4,2017,09,26
128,Still a great standard,Love this hotel. On the positive side we were given a free upgrade to a club room. One minor negative is that our room (206) wasn’t double glazed so we could hear the Saturday night noise on the road outside. ,5,2017,09,24
128,A great place to stay,"I arrived for an event at the Brewery, which made total sense for the accommodations as well.
The Montcalm is a great place to stay, reasonably priced.
The hotel staff went above and beyond to help me with any of my needs and made the stay enjoyable.
The room was large, comfortable and clean.

If I need to be in the area, I'll definitely go for the Montcalm again.",5,2017,09,22
128,Treating mother,"Just a gorgeous hotel in a great setting, easy to get to anywhere in London with central line being a stones throw away! got a great deal, the staff couldn't off been more helpful!! Completely recommended ",4,2017,09,21
128,Fabulous hotel,Gorgeous lovely hotel in the heart of the business city...rooms are lovely..was upgraded to a club room with complimentary fruit and wine. Bathroom was fabulous...really really comfy. Pubs on either side of the hotel were very welcoming and lovely also. Great food. Will stay again ,5,2017,09,20
128,Lovely stay,"Quick one-night business trip, but quite happy with my choice of the Montcalm. Room was comfy (surprisingly large!!) and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Appreciated the small touches, like the gift waiting in the room, and the Guest Service Manager arranging a car for me upon departure. Hope to return soon.",5,2017,09,19
128,My Sister's Wedding Accommodation,"Vlad the head Concierge could not have been more helpful. The hotel was fantastic, comfortable beds, spotless bathrooms, breakfast was superb and we will definitely be visiting again, GREAT CENTRAL LONDON LOCATION!",5,2017,09,18
128,Family Overnight Stay,"Great central hotel with Special thanks to the concierge Vlad made us so welcome really nice staff,  great room the hotel was a great end to our weekend of celebrations Thanks to Vlad and all the staff",5,2017,09,18
128,Great boutique hotel in a great location,Overall I had an excellent experience at the Montcalm at the Brewery. The staff at the front desk and the concierge's desk were all friendly and very helpful. My room and bathroom were clean and modern. I would also like to complement the maid service (which including turn down service each evening) room service. I had a terrific stay. And the location is terrific!,5,2017,09,18
128,Very good location,"The hotel is very near to the City of London. Near to three metro stations, one railway station. Rooms are very clean, nice staff, old historical building. Good for business and family stay. I would strongly recommend to stay at This hotel.",5,2017,09,17
128,An exceptional hotel with exceptional staff,"I've stayed at the hotel a number of times now and have stayed in a various types of rooms, all of which are lovely. 

The staff really go out of their way to make sure your stay is extremely enjoyable and nothing is too much trouble for them. 

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, whether you are staying for business or pleasure.",5,2017,09,17
128,Chosen for location ,"We chose this hotel entirely due to its proximity to the brewery where were attending an event.
Staff were helpful and welcoming and we were able to check in early. 

The bed was really comfortable.  It was a real pleasure to go to sleep! 

Location wise - it is at the Brewery - about 7 mins walk to moorgate (a better choice of tube station then barbican for most routes)  

(If you have luggage don't be reluctant to take the assistance - lots of small staircases to get to some of the rooms) 

The room was noisy during the day from street noise but fine at night. 

Only negative was fruit in room was over ripe. ",5,2017,09,17
128,Why did the chicken crossed to road ?,"A beautiful hotel. It was a brewery before converted to a hotel chain. They kept the structure as is and it is beautiful... Exceptionally friendly stuff 👍👍👍
The hotel is just less than 10min walks from Barbican station and very near to the Barbican centre. Conveniently located..",5,2017,09,15
128,Very nice hotel,"Booked as a business trip. A nice hotel, with some character and very conveniently located. Rooms are very nice and everything is finished to a high standard. They provide a complimentary phone for use around the city, umbrellas if it's raining, concierge service and so on. Not cheap obviously, but as always, you get what you pay for.",5,2017,09,12
128,Birthday ,"I booked back in July for my girlfriends birthday surprise. We arrived and were greeted by friendly staff. Unknown to myself we had been upgraded to the ""Wow"" suite and it really was wow. After a night out we returned to find a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates as well. A fantastic thought by the hotel. Will definitely be returning.",5,2017,09,11
128,Business or Pleasure this just became my number 1 London hotel...,"Checkin was efficient, hospitality was overwhelming, concierge couldn't do enough, best breakfast I've had in a London hotel for a long time, the room was clean, homely and I had everything I needed for both my business and my enjoyment. Overall, the staff couldn't have done more to welcome us at the Montcalm, I don't think I'll be able to stay anywhere else in London going forward. Thanks Montcalm Brewery...",5,2017,09,10
128,Wow!,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Montcalm last weekend for a short trip to London. While I've been to London many times, this was the first time that I stayed here. From the minute we arrived, we were welcomed by the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. The lobby and the yard that separates the two the sides of the building are beautiful. We were upgraded to the WOW suite and honestly, the only words to describe it is WOW! It is a beautifully appointed large room with every amenity you could ask for. The Jugged Hare restaurant is on the corner and part of the hotel. We had a traditional Sunday lunch that was delicious. The Montcalm is perfectly located in The City and a short walk to St. Paul's, the Museum of London and the many bridges to take you over the Thames as well as down the block from the Barbican. I'm glad that this hotel is on my firm's list of preferred hotels. I will definitely be back!",5,2017,09,10
128,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,After a long day in the office nowhere better to unwind. Stay once a week and always get a lovely greeting at reception when I check in. Irrespective of how busy the hotel is there's always a feeling of calmness. Rooms are spotless and excellent service from all teams from customer relations to housekeeping. There are a number of nice restaurants and pubs/bars within walking distance and close to a number of tube stations. Celebrating my anniversary in November and will be looking to book in!,5,2017,09,09
128,Quite adequate,"We went there for 4 nights.Very comfortable despite the small size rooms - and this was a Club Room- and good value for money. Easy walk to the Financial District too but not much else in the area. Look for a higher floor looking onto the courtyard but stay away from the south east wing as it is very far and difficult to get to.
",4,2017,09,06
128,Top notch,"I liked everything about this hotel.  The property is very interesting, old world. The location is convenient for business and leisure.  The rooms were well appointed, with all the modern amenities.  And most of all, the staff and their approach to service are fantastic - genuinely congenial and attentive without being at all obsequious. Be sure to visit the Potted Hare, next door, for a fantastic taste of ""modern rustic"" fare.",5,2017,09,03
128,Lovely modern but classy hotel,Myself and my husband stayed at The Montcalm for a family wedding. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We felt very welcomed when we arrived. Our room was lovely and clean with everything you could possibly need. The breakfast was also lovely with lots of choices and again staff in the breakfast room were very friendly and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again and the hotel is very easy to find and accessible to other parts of London.,5,2017,09,03
128,Always stay here when in town ,"In the last year we have tended to stay here each time we are in London mainly due i the quality of service, rooms etc. whether business or pleasure i would always return now while the device continues! the area can be quiet at the weekend given it's in the city but that's perfect for us. The jugged hare next door also does the best Sunday lunch in the area and not to be missed. ",5,2017,09,03
128,Amazing stay for our wedding,"My husband and I had an incredible stay here the night of our wedding (we got married at Chiswell Street Dining Rooms next door). We stayed in the WOW Wedding Suite, which was BEAUTIFUL. So spacious, clean and with lovely, classic decor. The service of the concierge was amazing and all our needs were catered for. Cannot recommend highly enough!",5,2017,09,03
128,A second great stay,"This was our second visit to Montcalm at the brewery. We thought we would try the London city suites this time, but on arrival had been upgraded to a Montcalm Club room in the main hotel itself. Having stayed in one on our previous visit however we were disappointed to find this one was a lot smaller and darker. The bathroom was tiny, that said it was an upgrade so we had to be grateful. The advantage of a club room is use of the club lounge, which I am sure many guests are unaware exists. Here we were able to enjoy complimentary canapés and a glass of wine before we went out for dinner. Breakfast was wonderful, the service was slow, but there was a huge wedding party in, so we understood the lack of personal service. A nice touch was a bottle of wine in our room and a card welcoming us back. Well done Montcalm, we will be back.",4,2017,08,30
128,The Montcalm group does not disappoint,"The Montcalm at The Brewery is the second hotel in this group we have stayed in and once again we were not disappointed. It really is a luxury group of hotels. The Brewery is a sympathetically and tastefully converted hotel in - as you'd guess - an old brewery so a lovely building. Ideal location close to Moorgate tube station, The Barbican and a short walk to St Paul's and the river.  It is the business district and so quiet at weekends and the hotel offers fantastic deals. However, it is the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff at every level which will ensure we will stay again. They make their guests feel valued and nothing is too much trouble. We wanted a rest before the theatre so came back in the afternoon, our room had yet to be serviced but on ringing the concierge, housekeeping came immediately and then after the room was finished another member of staff came to check we were satisfied! Excellent.",5,2017,08,30
128,"Great hotel, tube station close by. Ideal hotel for exploring.","Stayed here for 3 nights over the bank holiday weekend.  Excellent hotel. Pleasantly surprised with how nice it was. Converted brewery building with all its original features.  We upgraded to a Club Room which was lovely, plenty of room with 2 arm chairs.  Lovely bathroom with Elemis toiletries which was a nice touch.  We had one slight issue with cooking smells coming into the room which were wafting up from the kitchen. Complained and resolved swiftly with a can of air freshner being delivered to the room which sorted it out. very comfy bed and a choice of pillows. Good range of high quality teas which was good too as a tea-aholic. Continental breakfast was good. Not much choice but good quality so no complaints. The hotel is a good location for exploring London.  10 minutes walk from either Barbican or Moorgate tube stations. 25 minutes walk from St Pauls Cathedral and Millenium Bridge. Hotel is right next door to the Barbican, there are a couple of restaurants and bars in there.  We didn't eat there but had a drink in the Bonfire restaurant which had an outside area overlooking a lovely relaxing area.  We drove into London as the trains were going to be disrupted. There is a car park at the Barbican centre.  I booked online with Just Park and paid £41.50 for 3 days which I thought was good value.  car park 5 minutes walk to the hotel.  good air con.  There is a tesco express and a waitrose close by to stock up on goodies. This is in the business area so was quite quiet at the weekend, so also not many places open to eat.  There are 2 restaurants with the Hotel.  Jugged Hare, and Chiswell Restaurant.  Didnt eat in either so cannot comment.  Had a drink in the Jugged Hare which was reasonably priced and food did look really good. There is a road opposite Whitecross Road which had a few restaurants and pubs.  We went to Iskele Mediterranean restaurant which was excellent.  The staff were really great, very friendly and the Club Lounge staff were exceptional.  Would definitely stay here again.  We were staying here for a birthday and wedding anniversary, so were a bit disappointed that it wasn't recognised by the staff,  Reading other reviews on here it seemed that they often got upgraded or perks.  But never mind we were just unlucky I guess!!!",5,2017,08,30
128,Great hotel,"Chose this hotel for part of my other halves birthday gift and it certainly didn't disappoint! Great location as it's only a short walk to barbican tube station. The staff were lovely and helpful from start to finish. I would definitely recommend and go back, and potentially try some of their other locations too.",5,2017,08,29
128,Our anniversary visit,"Me and my partner booked montcalm hotel for a weekend away on our anniversary, and upon arrival they upgraded us and greeted us with champagne, the room was beautiful and the staff were amazing!! We will be booking this hotel again as the rooms and service was beautiful! We stayed in june and hopefully we will be booking soon to go down again because the service was amazing! ",5,2017,08,29
128,Last minute choice... would definitely recommend ,"This has to be the best London hotel that I have stayed in. Beautiful decor, ambience and customer service. We were upgraded to a club room which meant free continental breakfast and complimentary drinks and snacks throughout the day. However this was not brought to our attention until we had an issue with housekeeping...
My boyfriend and myself had been out all day from 10.30 - 5.00 only to return to the room left exactly as we had left it. Towels in shower, bed unmade, dirty coffee cups, etc. I called reception who dealt with things very swiftly but housekeeping had lied to them to say that the room had been cleaned! Then they said that we had put our do not disturb sign out. Neither of which were true! Due to this mix up, we were asked to go to the club lounge to have a drink. We did this only to realise that this was actually part of our room package anyway! Anyway no issue with the reception staff and management who also checked that we were ok with everything on check out. We were. 
Would definitely return and recommend. 

Also it was a great touch to have hot chocolate in the room. As a non tea or coffee drinker, I rarely have the pleasure of a hot drink. So thank you.

Excellent shower, air con, hairdryer, bathrobes, toiletries, reasonable prices for the mini bar. 

A great stay. ",5,2017,08,28
128,Good........and bad....,"Firstly, the good - the staff....absolutely couldn't fault them...polite, friendly and receptive without exception....

Now...the bad...my husband stays here often booked in by his company who have an office close by...we were celebrating my birthday and he recommended the Montcalm as an alternative to our usual London hotel.  The room was extremely small and dark (below basement level I am presuming?)  The beds are also small (not sure if they are double or queen but smaller than any we have at home).  Pillows are feather and quite OK - bedding was clean and acceptable.  The room was separated from the bathroom by a glass window which had an electric blind for privacy.  Ours didn't work so we were moved to another room which was even smaller than the first!  It did have a window which allowed in some natural light but no glass screen which made the room appear even smaller and the shower screen couldn't be open at the same time as the bathroom door or they would collide...this meant the bathroom door had to be closed when using the bathroom with consequential steaming up issues.  The bathroom in the second room was absolutely tiny (think knees hitting the side of the bath when using the loo).
Because the room was so small, it felt like we were lying literally underneath the TV when watching it in bed as the room was very narrow...Also the kettle and cups had to be removed from their storage and carried over to the small desk to enable them to be used. In the second room, there was no headboard so the pillows are directly against the wall and I banged my head on the brick wall getting back into bed in the middle of the night... 
Overall, the location is good, parking available at the Barbican (though beware on a weekday as it's a lot more expensive) and underground stations are a walkable distance.  The staff are absolutely brilliant and can't do enough but the functionality of the rooms is questionable.  Everything felt 'difficult' from having to have all the lights on constantly to bumping into the toilet as soon as you entered the bathroom....design faults which the staff can do nothing about but it would have been nice to be moved from a faulty room to one which was better, not worse!",3,2017,08,28
128,Great location,"The London City Suites is an interesting review to write - there are some things I loved and others I didn't.  I booked the hotel for the proximity to Liverpool Street Station - I was arriving very late at night so needed somewhere with a 24 hour reception and close by.  On arrival the woman who checked me in really could do with some customer service training - she struggled to articulate my surname and for a moment I had a panic attack around whether I was in the right place, whether the booking wasn't confirmed etc - this made a bad impression and it kind of stayed with me.  The check in was slow and she asked for the deposit on my credit card - for a moment I thought as she peered at me that she really does think I am going to run off without paying the bill.  The other two staff on duty were friendly and one helped me with my bag to the room.  The room was up in the eaves and whilst the actual room is small, the bathroom is quite big which is nice.  The room had a really small, very high up bed, if you were tall, it would be uncomfortable as I am 5ft6 and my feet were close to the end of the bed.  There are some nice touches like complimentary water and also fruit, kettle in the room, iron etc - all nicely done.  I found the toiletries very strong smelling and masculine - not my taste, but lots of them and nice fluffy white towels.  I ordered room service and the food was okay, staff were friendly.  It is very much a business district of London so possibly more suited to business travellers, I am an artist so felt that the hotel lacked a bit of soul.  To get to the room, you have to go through a courtyard and then another lift - something very unappealing when waiting for the lift is a horrible smell, like dirty hair, wet dog - this hung around for the two days I was there.  The rooms are cleaned daily, sheets turned down at night - all nice touches.  Concierge very helpful.  On checking out, I noticed the couple next to me getting confused by yet another staff member who seemed confused and confusing with explaining their deposit - so it seems there is a need for some training around making people feel comfortable.  I don't think I would stay here again - although it is a very nice hotel.",4,2017,08,27
128,Exceptional customer service,"We have stayed at this hotel at least once a year for the last 5 years and they always exceed our expectation.

Last time we visited was on my birthday and we were upgraded into a club room, there was champagne, balloons and chocolates in the bedroom.

Perfect location into town, metro stop close by, lots of nice bars and restaurants available on the other side of the barbican centre

I highly recommend this hotel",5,2017,08,23
128,I was unlucky...,"I had an early meeting and needed a hotel nearby my office. The hotel is just around the corner so I booked it a couple of hours before checking in.

It took 15 minutes to locate the booking on arrival. I was not aware until check out that I had actually been upgraded to a club room. 

This hotel is a rabbit warren. However, there is a back entrance to the hotel which is best used for entry and exit if the lift does not go directly to your floor. 

My room service order was cold on arrival presumably because it was such a trek from the kitchen.

The room was overly warm but reasonably sized and clean. The bed was comfy.  My view was of the brick wall of the adjacent building so the room was dark.

I obtained value for money but this hotel is not upscale.",3,2017,08,22
128,Brilliant find - a real hidden gem!,"We needed to stay in the local area as we had a dinner reservation nearby so opted for this hotel based on the reviews and good imagery - needless to say it more than lived up to its expectations!
A very attentive and helpful team were welcoming and upgraded us, even providing a complimentary bottle of prosecco which was a nice touch! 
The room was spacious with a large rainfall shower and a well stocked, reasonable mini bar. The dining at the Jugged Hare looked amazing but as we had a booking already elsewhere we just stopped for drinks. 
This really was a lovely find and attention to detail like changing the matt at the front door to say 'good morning' or 'good evening' exemplified the overall experience. We will most certainly be returning and hope to be able to spend more than a single night in this lovely hotel!",5,2017,08,22
128,"Great hotel, tiny room","The place is very luxurious, nice lobby and doorman to greet you. The room I had was tiny and hard to find, the building is old so lots of winding corners. The room itself was very well appointed with luxury bedding and fixture. Room service was good and speedy. I used the sauna and steam rooms in the basement which were empty - I was the only person in the gym area for my whole visit which was nice. Only reason for the lack of 5 stars is the size of the room. It was the smallest hotel room I have ever had, around 50cm around the bed, small bathroom and despite visiting in December it was very warm.",4,2017,08,22
128,Fantastic hotel and great value,"We stayed here over a bank holiday weekend, and mostly booked it due to the reasonable price. We were so pleasantly surprised. It is a gorgeous hotel with lovely hotel rooms. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have stayed in. If you're going at the weekend it's not quite in the hustle and bustle of London but there is a nearby tube station. I'd highly recommend it!",5,2017,08,22
128,Amazing Hotel can hightly recommend!,"This is the second time I've stayed at Montcalm at the Brewery, the staff are always very courteous and professional.

When I checked in, I was told I'd been upgraded to the 'Wow' suite and was escorted their by a lovely Spanish lady, she talked me through the room features and then kindly offered me a free bottle of wine, which was greatly received.

The room featured a stunning four poster bed, gorgeous décor and rain shower bathroom with retractable blind!  I can highly recommend the hotel and room if you're looking for a romantic weekend away, mine was a business trip, but I'll be back to use the room one weekend!",5,2017,08,21
128,Not half bad,"Me and my mother visited the Montcalm at the Brewery at the beginning of August. I asked for a room with a view not onto a brick wall since I'm claustrophobic. Our room was in the west wing and indeed we had kind of a view. Be aware that they take a £50 deposit at check in from your credit card. We were upgraded to a club room (probably bc of the view situation). The room was pretty small but that wasn't a big problem for us. What was a problem was the size of the double bed, it was pretty small for 2 people but doable. There was a kettle, tea and coffee available. Also everyday the housekeeping gave us some kind of cookies or snack bar. We were welcomed by complimentary waters (still & sparkling) and some fruit. The concierge helped us with the baggage and showed us around. The bathroom was very nice, you could heat up the floor and both bath and shower options were available. Not going to lie the toiletries they offered (especially the shampoo) were surprisingly good. There also was an ironing board, robe and slippers available. The area seems pretty safe, just across the street you can find waitrose and m&s a bit further. The hotel is around 7-10 minutes from either the Moorgate or Barbican underground stations and a walking distance from Liverpool street. The checkout was smooth and fast. Overall our stay was pretty enjoyable. ",4,2017,08,20
128,Great stay,"Really friendly warm welcome..had an upgrade to a fantastic room as well. The club lounge was good, nice and quiet in the evening, with very attentive staff in the morning. The staff couldn't do enough, gave me a very positive experience, so will definitely return. Well done!",5,2017,08,18
128,Excellent,"I've stayed at this hotel lots of times and have never been disappointed.  The staff are friendly, helpful and effective.  The Duty Manager, Dorina, is excellent and the service levels are consistently high.  The rooms are well appointed with nice modern bathrooms and exceptionally comfortable beds.  I know I'll always get a friendly welcome and a good night's sleep.",5,2017,08,18
128,Great Stay,"From the friendly welcome on our arrival to our departure after 3nights, everything was perfect. The lovely room, the facilities, the Jugged Hare next door and the Chiswell Dining Rooms, all part of this wonderful hotel.",5,2017,08,16
128,Good value hotel for London,"We stayed at this hotel whilst we attended the World Athletics.

It is ideally located for getting to Liverpool Street train station and also Barbican tube.

It's also not far from the City if you are in London on business.

The room was big and the bed was comfortable.  Try to get a room with a window overlooking the street so you get natural light.

The Jugged Hare pub that is connected to the hotel is excellent.

The staff are friendly and very helpful.

At less than £150 a night it's good value.",4,2017,08,16
128,"lovely hotel, but small rooms","The hotel décor is beautiful and the staff very helpful, however (maybe this is a thing with London hotels) but the standard room was small with barely enough room for the bed and a bizarre glass partition between the bathroom the rest of the room - maybe to increase the feeling of space... this aside had a lovely weekend & would recommend the hotel",4,2017,08,16
128,Wonderful stay,"We were looking for a hotel on a recent trip to London and really couldn't have chosen better! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt special. The room was beautifully decorated with every mod con you could want. The bed was so comfy we were contemplating staying another night! The staff were everything you could ask for, always smiling and couldn't do enough for us. We'll definitely stay here again when we're next in London. ",5,2017,08,14
128,Boyfriends Birthday,I had such a lovely time whilst at the Montcalm. The staff there were so nice and always willing to go the extra mile to make out stay great. I am extremely grateful & I recommend this hotel to everyone!!,5,2017,08,14
128,A fine welcome ,We could not have been made more welcome by the very friendly staff. Our suite was absolutely superb with loads of facilities. Finding the room did involve a circuitous route which is part of the charm of this place but a lift near the suite took us straight to the splendid Jugged Hare restaurant next door. We shall definitely be back.,5,2017,08,13
128,Location and comfort,Lovely friendly reception; very nice room (were upgraded to a WOW suite.  3 minutes to Barbican if you are doing theatre.  Decent to very good food at Jugged Hare (or is it Potted?) attached to the hotel.,5,2017,08,13
128,Very good,The hotel was clean and charming and a great price too. Staff were very good and lovely to us. They made our stay very special before we flew out on our honeymoon. Thank you. Breakfast was good too and very tasty and plentiful.,5,2017,08,11
128,Simply The Best,"We travel quite a lot and while we always said we would never stay in the same hotel twice (change is as good as a rest, right?), we happily broke that rule with the Montcalm. It's a fabulous place. Walking distance from Liverpool St. station and stone-throwing distance from the Barbican. And a surprising bonus is that at the weekends the surrounding area is so amazingly peaceful. As for the hotel itself, loads of individual character, it's not one of these hideous designer emporiums... Yes, it's a bit of maze, but it's an old building, and once you've got your bearings that's no real problem. As for the good and bad, we fully accept that's what critically important to one person, is not worth a breath to the next..., and so we'll not labour on what we rate highly (or don't) too much. We say too much, simply because some things just have to be mentioned... The reception area is lovely, and the staff to a one are probably the best we've ever encountered. You can so tell when somebody is just going through the motions of politeness. None of that here... Of particular note would be Vlad Jefanovs the head concierge, and Alice Cubostrojeva the guest experience manager. Our most recent trip was destined to be chaos from the outset, requiring numerous date/duration revisions on our part. Not an issue, and all resolved by Alice and the team with no fuss and no bother whatsoever. A couple of other plus points that we personally consider mentioning will be of limited value to some, but not to all... The hairdryer is top quality, there's magnifying mirror in the bathroom, Elemis bathroom products are supplied, and there is always a total absence of squawking and/or misbehaving kids... Perhaps best of all, if somebody says they will do something for you, they do it! We will definitely be back.",5,2017,08,08
128,Beauty is only skin deep,"A lovely hotel, reasonably well located between the city and Barbican, and the room and associated facilities were fine.  However, we were not happy at the rather offhand manner of the staff who didn't seem to understand that dealing with customers in a helpful manner should be their priority.

To be fair the hotel did respond to our criticisms after we had left so it would not be fair to criticise management too much, but in a competitive market attitude and friendliness is an important facet of the hotel business.  Hopefully they will improve.",3,2017,08,08
128,Blown Away,"What can I say about this hotel that won't be just a list of superlatives? Absolutely amazing stay where we were looked after from start to finish.
Reception staff both friendly and eager to please (and more), Concierge helpful and the ambience wonderful.
We had a Club Montcalm room which was extremely spacious and had all the luxury and extras you'd expect....and more.
I have now used Montcalm more than once (the other being in Marble Arch) and they will certainly be my hotels of choice in future.
Thank you to all at the hotel for a glorious welcome and stay.",5,2017,08,06
128,Lovely surprise in the heart of London,"This was my first time at the Montcalm and can't tell you how happy I am to have discovered this place. Am a regular traveler to UK this place tops all those that I have used earlier. Location, rooms, courteous and helpful staff you name it they have it all. The breakfast is slightly monotonous if you staying over a week but good decent quality. The best part was the lovely surprise as I was there just a few days prior to my birthday and they really went out. Thank you so much team Montcalm I will definitely be back again",5,2017,08,06
128,Relaxing Stay.  Staff Very Attentive And Responsive,"We booked a 'special weekend' here to celebrate my wife's birthday. 

We did find a few things wrong.    However, we detailed these to the hotel and the staff seemed genuinely concerned by these and sought to put the various issues right.  I do find that if you politely raise issues with staff at hotels generally, it leads to a good outcome for both guests and the hotel.

The original room we booked was too small. The staff helpfully offered us a complementary upgrade to the next size up but this was also too small and so we paid extra for the 'club room'.

The breakfast menu sent to the room contained a lot of misspellings - eg ""saussage"", ""tomatos"" ""yogurt"", ""omlette"" and ""grilles mushrooms"". I appreciate almost all the staff are not native English speakers but this is not excuse for a hotel purporting to be of this quality to have basic spelling errors.   When pointed out to the management, they explained that catering is outsourced and they would insist on the correct spellings.

There is no parking at the actual hotel. We paid an additional £9 a day for parking in the Barbican Car Park next door - which was OK as it was a weekend. But note that the weekday rate is £34 a day.",4,2017,08,05
128,Wedding ,"Easy to get to and parking very close by in the Barbican.Friends daughters wedding on a Saturday.
A stunning venue different from the normal Hotel venues. Stylish with a great ambience.The set up is great with an elevated floor for speeches and dancing and the main floor for tables.",5,2017,08,03
128,Horrible,"Although they indicate 5 stars, I do not think it is because of their infrastructure they can not give a service of that magnitude. Presumptuous and tacky, stairs up and stairs down, come on a mess, too personal at the reception that tackles you to help you, I'm older, with a person who serves me is enough. Extremely expensive prices for the service they give. The personnel doesn't speak more than 2 languages (English and Polish).",1,2017,08,02
128,Montcalm ,"A high end price hotel for the room standard. Location is reasonable good close to underground. Be vigilant to check if breakfast is included or not, price pending on witch restaurant you are having breakfast £12-25 on top of room rates ",3,2017,08,02
128,Class,"Lovely well situated hotel exuding class. It was clean with a sizeable and well furnished room. Staff friendly and prompt.
It was clean, good nearby amenities and the room itself was big with a very comfortable bed. 
Recommended. ",5,2017,08,01
128,Old brewery never looked as good as this,"Converted from an old brewery right in the heart of the financial district, the Montcalm at the Brewery London City is not your average business hotel.  Staff are very helpful and room was quiet and comfortable.",4,2017,07,31
128,Great Location & Great Service,"We stayed for one Saturday night as we were attending a show at the Barbican Theatre.  From the moment we arrived, we received excellent service with all staff being friendly, professional, efficient & genuinely caring about us & the experience of our stay.

The hotel was immaculate & surroundings a very high standard  Our suite was very well equipped with a Nespresso machine in addition to the usual kettle with complimentary tea & biscuits & the mini bar was very well stocked.  This is the first hotel bathroom I've been in equipped with weighing scales & the complimentary toiletries smelled delicious, suitable for both men & women.   The aircon was efficient & it was our fault for not turning it down & sleeping in a cool draught.  The bed & pillows were feather soft & there was plenty of storage.

We made use of the large umbrella stored in the wardrobe & hair-drier as the London weather could have been better. Although the sound of revellers in the Jugged Hare was clear in the corridor outside our room, it was beautifully quiet inside. We didn't eat in the hotel.

We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel & have confidence that the other Montcalm hotels will have the same high standards.",5,2017,07,30
128,WOW indeed!,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Located in a lovely part of the city this hotel is easily accessible and very luxurious.The staff were incredible and gave us a complimentary upgrade to the most spectacular room, the WOW Suite...and WOW indeed! The room was spotless, stunning and had absolutely everything you could ever need. The staff left a bottle of Prosecco in the room as a birthday gift along with some balloons and rose petals. They go above and beyond to ensure your stay is memorable and it certainly was. I'm certain well return!",5,2017,07,30
128,Wow !,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel. The staff were exceptional and they kindly upgraded us to a suite as a surprise 'the WOW suite' !! And it was WOW.
The decor and little details like chocolates & wine just made it magical.
We would definitely return as the location was great to for Liverpool Street station. ",5,2017,07,30
128,The Staff Here is Extraordinary,"The staff here is very service oriented, polite, yet also friendly, helpful, very conversational and very international.  This is a historical site, the location of an old London brewery and the original structures have been reasonably well preserved(large interior courtyard).  The rooms here are better than average although somewhat on the small side (common in most London accommodations). The on-site restaurant offers better than average hotel fare and great service.  Be prepared to go up and down some steps in get to your room, depending on which one is assigned to you.  There are some well decorated meeting rooms on the ground level and a small but comfortable lobby with an adjacent siting room. Internet/Wife service is good from entire set of inter connected buildings.  There are three Underground stations reasonably nearby, but something of a walk if you are not physically fit.  The Barbican Center, a classic moderist, large, mixed-use project, is very nearby (large parking garage).  The neighborhood is reasonably quiet, however, there are not a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity and not many nearby retail services.  This is maybe not the most central of locations but it certainly is good value for your money and if you like great service, the Montcalm at the Brewery certainly offers great service.",5,2017,07,29
128,A Bit Disappointed,"This was my second stay at this hotel.
For
Well located for northern part of the City of London. It is a nicely converted old brewery. The parties in the court yard did not disturb me.
Well equipped room and bathroom. Nice towels, heated mirror and rain shower.
Fast and good response from reservations/ front desk.

Could improve.

The rain fall shower only gave cold showers. Though the other part of the shower and basin had hot water.
The window latch was broken and therefore the window would not close.
The room was not large a had two small windows facing a a high rise block so was dark and an unpleasant place to be in day time.
I had a better experience the first time I stayed there.",3,2017,07,29
128,Perfect for more than a business stay!,"I am already a frequent return visitor to the Montcalm at the Brewery, and its time to share my experience and review.

It's actually going to quite short. I come here for business and it is simply perfect.

The staff is unbelievable. Always available, attentive and courteous - always! And if you find yourself in need for above and beyond, just ask for Dorina, the Duty manager ;-)

Location is convenient, next to the Barbican and close enough to the Tube.

Hotel is well maintained, with quality Club rooms and lounge. Rooms are well equipped, with attention to details and reception will help with most of what you may need in addition. You will notice early on that the hotel is built to resemble a labyrinth, so getting to your room first time can be a little tricky. But hey, have I mentioned the great staff? 

Dining - ground floor of hotel has two separate restaurants - one of them is a popular bar/restaurant called the Jagged Hare. excellent place for after work mingling and amazing food (especially if you are a carnivore)

Gym - renovated lately, and has basic features and equipment so once finished with the Jagged Hare, you have where to go! - a suggestion here to management - p[ease add yoga mattresses 

That's it. My summary - Excellent!",5,2017,07,29
128,The staff went above and beyond! ,"
I recently brought my boyfriend here for his 21st Birthday. We had visited The Montcalm at the brewery before and felt very welcome and at ease. The hotel is in a great location, a quiet area and close to the tube station(takes about 10 minutes to get to the main London stops on the tube) Safe to say they are consistently helpful and accommodating. The rooms are lovely and I've had two of the best nights sleep staying here. 

I asked when making the booking if there was anything they could do to make it special for my boyfriends birthday. 
They well and truly went above and beyond; upgraded our room to a beautiful suit, placed balloons and petals on the bed and gave us complimentary chocolates and a bottle of wine. 
The stay was definitely one to remember and I can't thank the staff enough. 
Will defiantly be making a third trip here in the near future. ",5,2017,07,28
128,A GREAT Weekend,"We have stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery on a number of occasions and it just seems to get better and better. Being Members of the Montcalm Club we were allocated a Club Room. All the rooms are excellent but this one just had the edge! You could not have wished for more and this time we decided to have a late snack in the evening and a SUPERB breakfast, both served with impeccable, professional service in our room.The food was of the highest quality and beautifully prepared and presented.

We arrived on the Friday morning and our room was already available. We were booked in for Afternoon Champagne Tea at the Ritz - so were in an unusual position to be able to compare immediately with what is supposed to be THE place in London!
You would have to go a long way to better the Montcalm. The facilities are excellent and the Staff as incredibly polite, friendly and efficient.

Oh dear! We'll just HAVE to return - soon!! Thank you all.",5,2017,07,27
128,Perfect central London location for Barbican and access to public transport,"We've stayed in the Montcalm Brewery twice - once to attend a ceremony at the Barbican and once before a meeting at St Pancras/Kings Cross. The Barbican is right across the road, so it's incredibly convenient for the theatre, music, etc. It's also very well connected for public transport, within easy walking distance of Farringdon for connections to Gatwick or St Paul's for the DLR to City Airport. The buildings are beautiful, lovingly maintained and decorated, although we have experienced some problems with electrics and water. The best thing about the hotel, though, is without question the staff. No problem is too big or too small, there are always lots of people on hand to help with anything from holding cases to receiving post. We were upgraded to a Barbican Duplex room on our second stay and it was spectacular. Absolutely recommended for the wonderful people and fantastic location, would definitely stay again.",5,2017,07,26
128,Nothing is too much trouble,"We have just spent our fourth visit to the Montcalm and as before the experience is magical. The hotel is a rabbit warren but the staff are excellent particularly Alice, in terms of making special occasions even more so.

The rooms are very comfortable, and the club lounge is an enjoyable experience particularly as we were joined by friends from the USA who really appreciated the English hospitality and service level.",5,2017,07,25
128,EXCELLENT LOCATION AND SUPERB ACCOMODATIONS,"This luxurious, yet unpretentious and not-so-stuffy, hotel is historical and well located.  While it is outside of the busy action of Downtown London proper, it is very simple to get to all the touristy attraction.  It offers a well-appointed room at a fraction of the cost (at least on weekends) – plus it’s super easy to get to the touristy attractions with the nearby and easy to use underground or a short Uber ride.  We were thrilled to be here.  This neighborhood was full of character such as Brick Lane – Bohemian area – and Spitafels Market – a very upscale crafts type market surrounded by numerous upscale retail stores.  The energy of this part of town was outrageous and it was great to feel more like a local AND have a super posh and comfy place to lay your head at the end of a beautiful fulfilling day.  Lonut, one of the bellmen and concierge was excellent help and went above and beyond to guide us and provide detailed directions to the places we needed to go.  Being here was like living in an affluent neighborhood with terrific and helpful neighbors.",5,2017,07,24
128,Len S,"Room a bit on the small side, but otherwise super - very comfortable, including the bed - bit tricky turning the lights off though - had to resort to phoning reception.  Good continental breakfast & good service from staff - bit of a trek from reception to the room.  The Jugged Hare was very lively both Friday & Saturday nights.",4,2017,07,24
128,Nice hotel not quite 5 star but the service lift is great!,"Booked the hotel as we wanted a five star place for a night in London that's was reasonably priced which on paper the MATB ticked all the boxes. Lots of free weekend parking and plenty of eateries around. 
We arrived and checked in (couldn't help but notice that ebookers had paid significantly less for the room than we'd paid,but that's another story. 
Having checked in we were shown to our room which although a nice touch did seem a little unnecessary- unfortunately the gent who was our guide clearly had less knowledge of the hotel layout than most and initially took us to our room 314 on the first floor, having wandered the length of floor 1 he realised his error and swiftly guided us through an unmarked door through a room of dirty towels and into the service lift (which smelled like the afore mentioned brewery) on our arrival on floor 3 once again through the dirty towel room we found ourselves in a small corridor with no sign of 314. At this point our gent looked entirely lost at this point my wife took over and followed the signs back to reception and as we arrived back at the main lifts we found our room. 
The room was great,smaller than expected and with a bathroom which had seen better days but all in all a comfortable if not 5 star experience. ",3,2017,07,23
128,Fabulous hotel,"Weekend visit to London with my daughter and , wow, the hotel was wonderful. Amazingly friendly staff and beautiful touches i.e. Villeroy and Boch china in the room. Great area with plenty of bars and restaurants Although we had a great time at the Jugged Hare. Highly recommend and can't wait till next time,",5,2017,07,23
128,"Good hotel, but worrying hygiene and noisy","I've stayed quite a few times in the 3 Montcalms in close proximity and the one at the Brewery is the oldest. The rooms vary greatly in size, this time I did have a reasonably good sized one. I've been there all this week and a couple of things have made my stay a disappointment. First are my hygiene concerns - I've seen mice openly running around in a couple of areas, most noticeably the club lounge. Staff I've reported to this to were either mortified or complacent ""It's London, you find mice everywhere"" - I've stayed in London on average once a week for the last 3 years and never seen a mouse in a hotel. 
Also, though the hotel advertises itself as having a 'wellness suite' - there's no spa, it's just a gym room with only one running machine. (though you can walk to one of their other hotels 10 mins away and use that) They've recently moved this into the basement, and as soon as you go down the stairs you're hit with a disgusting stink of I don't know what, but possibly stale, rotting food or bad drains. This smell was also present the last time I stayed, in the lift in another part of the hotel. 

The other thing is that they play loud music in the hallways through ceiling speakers. I've no idea why they thought this was a good idea at any time of day, but at 11.30pm at night, it just annoys you when you're trying to sleep. I've had to call twice to get it turned off. If you're in the main hotel and facing into the courtyard, they have a marquee up in the courtyard and have noisy events on in the evenings too, so if you want peace and quiet in your room, ask for one over the road. 

I went for the clubroom this time, which includes breakfast in the club lounge and use of it in the evenings. Apart from the mice, it's quite nice, breakfast is OK, a few more options would be nice. In the evenings it could do with more sofas, and annoying again, loud music through a roof speaker. The TV is always on but muted, for no good reason that I can imagine. The range of drinks and canapes is quite good. One evening I had to work on my laptop until very late and didn't have time to go out and eat and managed with the tiny sandwiches and fruit. 

Internet is high speed and available throughout, with no complicated sign up process, the staff - almost entirely Eastern European as far as I can tell, are very pleasant and helpful.",3,2017,07,22
128,"interesting building, great service, good middle priced restaurant, tiny gym but adquate, nice rooms","This is one of your more interesting london hotels. built out of an old whitbread brewery, the rooms are of good open size, the service is excellent, the wifi solid, and if you need to be near the financial area or wall of london street this is a super location. the beds are kingsize, the bathrooms modern with smallish sink areas is the only poor component.",5,2017,07,20
128,Excellent Hotel & Staff,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and love it, from the moment you turn up and the porter takes your bags to the time you leave its never disappointing, we love to stay here when we have a weekend in London, we have stayed in the WOW suite and that was lovely the best four poster bed ever. The hotel was actually a large brewery in the 1800’s and is impressive, must mention Alice the Guest Experience Manager she is lovely and extremely helpful. The pub next door which is linked by lift (the jugged hare) serves great food and drinks, and there is a jazz/cocktail club called the nightjar a short cab ride away but please book in advance.",5,2017,07,20
128,Ooh-la-la in London,"It's a long ride on the trains from Heathrow airport to here, but we were happy to see that the hotel is near to two underground/subway stations. As soon as we approached the doorway a very helpful and friendly porter relieved us of our bags and escorted us to reception. Here we were welcomed in a very friendly and charming manner by all the staff. Our club rooms were big and very quiet, with comfortable beds and pillows. We got lost a few times trying to find our room through all the passages, but after a while we conquered the maze. The breakfast was a bit disappointing and for the hefty price not much of a buffet choice. We only ate here once, opting to go elsewhere to eat. We would definitely stay here again, as the location is fantastic with lots of public transport within walking distance. ",5,2017,07,19
128,Great staff so accommodating....,"We stayed here as I was traveling on business.

LOCATION - Great hotel if you are going to the Barbican Centre, St Paul Cathedral.  Definitely close to business centre.  Which means at night most of restaurants shut down.  Close walk to Marks and Spencers and lots of eateries open during the day.  All Tesco Express real close.  There are restaurants in the Barbican.

SERVICE- What makes this hotel good is the staff.  They are so professional and accommodating.  They did everything to make sure we had a great stay.  They upgraded up to a bigger room to accommodate my daughter's crib and also gave us a room without many steps as we were travelling with a toddler.  The bed was a double and too small for us so we asked and complimentary upgraded us to King.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  They were always willing to help us with our bags and stroller.  Catching a cab was easy.  The front desk, club and bell room staff were amazing. This really made our stay very enjoyable.

ROOM - It is a bit of a maze getting to the rooms there are lots of corridors up down and around but I suppose this is an old building refurbished which used to be a brewery.  The room was good.  Bed was soft.  We had two rooms first was small however this is to be expected in London.  Second room was nice and spacious with large bathroom.  Nice shower feature several rainfall modes for shower. Bed was soft.  Room had a modern décor.  Interesting feature was a complimentary cell phone which we didn't use.  Internet speed was good. They have turn down service which is good because there are several curtains to close, turn down of bed and a little chocolate is always good. There are also houserobes and slippers when you check in.  Don't find this very often in US hotels.

CLUB LOUNGE - a variety of foods available at various times during the day.  Great to gab a Continental breakfast in morning.  Mid day snacks.  Sandwiches, chips and nuts in evening.  Beer, wine, teas and soft drinks.  My favorite item was the macaroons.  So delicious.  

Overall I would go back.",4,2017,07,18
128,Work stay in London ,"Stayed here late May this year. Staff always friendly, professional and courteous. When I stop over in London it's always great to stay at and thus will always try and book Montcalm before other hotels. Rooms modern with great in room equipment. Look forward to returning here later this year as always a pleasure.",5,2017,07,18
128,Exceptional service,"We stayed 2 nights for a family wedding in the area. We were able to check into our upgraded room at 11am as they had rooms ready which was great as we could then set off to look at the local museum and St Pauls. Service was exceptional, best concierge team I have ever seen and that includes several in 5 star hotels we have stayed in. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, whether it was the loan of an umbrella to go to the wedding or prinitng off tickets for our trip home. Room was spotless, very comfortable bed, great toiletries and the brilliant idea of a smart phone to use while in London.",5,2017,07,17
128,Outstanding service continued long after the stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Montcalm last year and everything about this property exceeded our expectations. The room was larger than I'd expected, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the decor throughout the hotel was gorgeous but still cozy and welcoming. What really stood out, though, was the incredible customer service. Each staff member, from the doorman to the concierge was friendly and helpful in every way. So much so that when I got to the airport and realized I'd left behind some important items, they sent housekeeping up to our room right away to search for them. They promptly safeguarded my not-very-valuable-but-sentimentally-important package, got several different shipping options for me the next day, and sent it back carefully packaged without delay. The communication throughout this process was prompt and informative, and I just couldn't have asked for anything more. I would happily book here again the next time I'm in London. ",5,2017,07,16
128,30th celebration ,"Stayed here for my brothers 30th birthday, so we had 3 rooms between us. All excellent, spacious and clean. Club room was a much appreciated extra and would definitely recommend this. Hotel was beautiful, well presented and decorated. Staff were amazingly helpful and Dorina, the duty manager, was brilliant. So helpful, and very accommodating. The extra touches and staff being so helpful really made it a truly special occasion. We will definitely be staying here again thank you! ",5,2017,07,16
128,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery recently for my boyfriends birthday. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite for the occasion, which was a beautiful huge room. The staff were friendly and welcoming. I also had a parcel delivered and set up in my room with no problems. One of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in too. ",5,2017,07,16
128,Getting it right the second time,"After I stayed at the hotel for one night and published my unhappiness with the standard of the room and the service, I was contacted by a manager from the hotel group who was handling my complaint very professionally. They reimbursed me for the obviously over-priced room and were carefully listening to my feedback about the stay. I promised to let people know about this positive experience via the tripadvisor platform, so here we go: The bad experience I had seems to have been a one-time event, which I will find out next time I stay with them. Which I will do. Thanks to Deepak, for following up and caring.",3,2017,07,15
128,Calm By Name...!,"Relaxing soothing place in London? The clue is in the name! Montcalm hotel at the Brewery is a haven in the city. From the gentle sound of water in reception to the very comfortable well furnished rooms, there's an immediate aura of tranquility
Whether you're on a business trip, sightseeing, or on a shopping expedition The Montcalm at the Brewery, is the perfect place to recharge batteries. Also, the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.",5,2017,07,14
128,Excellent vacation,"Had a fantastic stay at this hotel.
We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights.
Received a free room upgrade because of my birthday anniversary + some nice treats.
The hotel is very clean, modern, very friendly and helpful staff.
Very good location + very safety area. 
Free WI FI with very fast connection with no password.
Great value for money.
Very recommended.",5,2017,07,13
128,Amazing ,"The rooms are incredible , would definitely stay here again staff are also very friendly , didn't have breakfast in the hotel because we were in London and there are so many places to choose from . But the hotel its self was incredible ",5,2017,07,12
128,Nice hotel,"Decent hotel and within short walking distance of Moorgate tube station. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was nice and clean, comfy bed, mini bar etc. There was a bit of a smell of sick in the lift the next morning probably due to some guests not being able to handle their liquor lol. ",4,2017,07,12
128,Great stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery London City,"Had a fantastic stay at this hotel. Great rooms and services made all the better by the welcoming and personable guest experience staff...

128,Wonderful boutique hotel,"We were in London for an Adele concert which was cancelled so thankfully we had booked a stay in this wonderful hotel. It is a 5 star establishment but reasonable at weekends and to cap it off they upgraded us to a wonderful room.
Everything about this place is top class with no expense spared.
We visited their sister hotel around the corner and spent some time at the roof top bar which is a fantastic place on a sunny day.
",5,2017,07,11
128,Room without a view.,"We book two club double room. With lounge access. we were going for a girls weekend in London. The room was very dark we didn't even know it was daylight in the morning. The view was a brick wall on our room. Our friend who we travelled with  had the next room Which was not much better. We had to have the light on to do our hair and makeup.
It was clean. I have stayed in the Montcalm at the brewery before in club rooms.
But I don't think i would stay again.",3,2017,07,11
128,Excellent people,"A little bit narrow room but big bath, very kind and professional staff. very assorted breakfast and good quality. We would leave in the morning and return at night, so we did not take advantage of all the options.",5,2017,07,11
128,Excellent hotel in great location ,"Excellent hotel in a great location close to St Paul's, Barbican, Moorgate area. Very comfortable beds. Attentive staff who go above and beyond to help you. I had a problem with my room and it was sorted professionally and promptly. I would totally recommend this hotel",5,2017,07,10
128,Such a pleasure,"We arrived on an morning flight, after a cross Atlantic flight.  We were welcomed and shown our room immediately.  We had booked the Club option, which We highly recommend.  That plan includes a light breakfast and an afternoon reception.  The hotel is in the beautifully repurposed Whitbread Brewery.  The attached pub was wonderful on a damp evening.  

The location is ideal for sightseeing in London City and the South Bank.  

We strongly recommend Montcalm at the Brewery.  It will certainly be a likely choice if we visit London again.  ",5,2017,07,09
128,A good find,"We are here at the moment, hotel is ideally situated good access to all attractions.
Rooms are excellent, good pub restaurant attached.
Check in efficient and to our delight we had an upgraded room with champagne and cake in our room as we were celebrating our anniversary. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends.
Staff are friendly and efficient, housekeeping excellent.
Will return to this hotel again.",5,2017,07,09
128,I recommend ,"I stayed here every week for over a year, staff always knew who I was and welcomed me by name. Rooms were always clean and well equipped. Restaurant has a 2 or 3 course menu which was delicious. I've stopped travelling now but would highly recommend staying here 👌🏽",5,2017,07,07
128,Nice place,It was a nice place and quite central. We had a nice time here. We got the room 620 right at the elevator on one side and the street on the other side but it wasn't noisy at all. It could be a little bit cleaner ( we found a hair in the bad and the shower was a bit dirty and not in perfect shape) but it is tiny details the place is absoultely wonderful! It's a good choise if you are in London! ,5,2017,07,06
128,Fine City Hotel for Business Person,"I highly appreciate the hotel, particularly the staff. For example Vladimir the Head Concierge has made numerous business dinner recommendations and reservations for me. Convenient breakfast in Chiswell St Dining Rooms and lunch or dinner in Jugged Hare. ",5,2017,07,05
128,Fantastic Stay!,"Stayed her for 1 night. All staff were very welcoming and efficient, on knowing our stay was a special occasion Alice went out of her way to make our stay even more special with a upgrade to our room. She is a credit to the hotel.
The hotel is in good location easy walk to barbican or moorgate underground.
Wish our stay was for longer will definitely be returning to this hotel in the future.
Many thanks to all the staff especially Alice.",4,2017,07,04
128,Good quality hotel with friendly staff and decent breakfast,"Stayed here in May on business for a couple of nights. Location is OK - a short walk from Moorgate tube station and a slightly longer one from Barbican station, walking under the underpass which might not be much fun late at night. Rooms were OK but the bed size did seem rather on the small side - I would question whether my so-called kingsize bed was really the same as what I have at home and for North American visitors, be aware that whatever it says in the listing, the size will likely be smaller than what you are probably used to. Nevertheless, the hotel's location is helpful for business appointments in the northern part of the Square Mile. Breakfast was fine and set you up for the day as required.",4,2017,07,04
128,Great experience  !! first class,"We had a great experience when we stayed at the hotel this weekend the staff were so helpful they gave us a warm welcome and was very polite and realy helpful and realy did put us first they gave us an upgrade of our room as we had our anniversary and they gave us compliment wine and chocolates, the food was outstanding great service and good quality and the manager Alice was a very bubbly and great personality she went out of her way to make sure we was happy the room was stunning the bed was so comfatble and the hotel was very clean bright and funky but  classy would recommend this hotel 100%",5,2017,07,03
128,Wonderful hotel,"just returned from a weekend break, staying at the lovely Montcalm at the brewery,
we only found this hotel by accident because our first choice was fully booked,
And I'm so glad we did,
From the moment we walked in I knew we were going to enjoy our stay,
lovely rooms & great staff,
We ate in the Jugged hare on both nights of our stay,
a great choice of food & beers
I had the pie of the day on both nights which was wonderful.
we will definitely return to this wonderful hotel.",5,2017,07,03
128,First class,Absolutely superb!  Booked for an engagement weekend.  We were looked after by Gema who went the extra mile to make sure our stay was super special.  Fabulous room and great service.  We will definitely be back...,5,2017,07,03
128,Lovely Hotel,Spent a night here at check we were told the room was not ready so we left our bags and went for lunch On our return our bags had been taken to the room luckily as the lifts were out of order and we were on the 4 th floor After a long treck the young man opened and door and told us there was water in our room and the walk was good to help you lose weight ! The room was nicely decorated but the bathroom could do with redecorating paint peeling off the wall The bed was very comfortable but seemed very small for a double We have stayed at this hotel a few times but I'm sure we have always had a larger bed ? Breakfast very good and the rosemary and fig bread is absolutely gorgeous I would love to know where they get it from so I could be some Can't wait for our next stay at this hotel,4,2017,07,03
128,Family visit,"Stayed one night and absolutely loved it.From the moment we arrived till the moment we left a perfect stay. Great staff ,great room and a perfect position for us to visit family. Will definitely stay here again.enjoyed a pint in the jugged hare pub ,part of the hotel .",5,2017,07,02
128,"Repeat visit, will come again ","This is maybe the 3rd or 4th time I've stayed here. This time we got upgraded from the standard to a club room (bath, more space...). Complementary small bottle of red and a nice welcome in a card were also nice touches. The hotel is immaculately clean, staff are friendly (but note weekend check in/out can be busy). The room has all the facilities you could need and for us exploring both central London and visiting friends in East/north London it's a really good location. We never bother having breakfast at the nearby Jugged Hare which is affiliated with the hotel, instead opting for Cote which is across the road. This isn't a cheap option but if you book direct with the hotel you get a good rate easily comparable to other hotels (ibis etc) and I think for the same rate you get more here for your money. Recommended.",5,2017,07,02
128,Disappointing Service for a hotel that gets such great reviews,"A left this hotel after 2 days disappointed. Good location and the bar downstairs is very convenient but the hotel lacks follow up and speed when it comes to service. 

We had a broken bathroom so had to switch rooms (but had to follow up ourselves) and I asked for a wake up call which they forgot.

Staff can smile more and be more service minded!",3,2017,07,02
128,Absolutely fabulous stay,Booked as birthday surprise for my husband and was over the moon with the room and staff and service. Prosecco & strawberries one night and wine and chocolates the next. Not to mention the towel art ! Would recommend without hesitation. Oh and the beds are the most comfortable anywhere. Finally the fact that the rooms have sky sports was the best birthday present as we didn't have to leave to watch the Lions match 👌,5,2017,07,02
128,Small trip in London!,"The best hotel ever! Polite staff and amazing service! We could rich the hotel easly from Moorgate station. The room was big and bright with a so comfortable bed. We did not want to leave it! Thanks to every single person who work there but first of all to Fontina, the italian girl who did the check in for us and showed our room. We will come back!",5,2017,07,01
128,London three days of business meetings,The hotel is in a great location and within easy walking distance from a few tube stations. The hotel has an usual layout as it used to be a brewery. The rooms are nice with very comfortable beds! Would definitely recommend for business travellers particularly.,4,2017,07,01
128,Anniversary weekend ,"Booked to stay for our wedding anniversary, the hotel wet great, we got upgraded and got straight into our room. 

We didn't spend too much time in the room but our room was decorated with petals and complimentary wine and chocolates which was a lovely touch. 

Good choices for the continental breakfast. The hotel also held our bags after we checked out until our flight. 

I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,06,30
128,Very inexpensive for a upscale London Hotel,"We stayed at the Montcalm for its proximity to the Barbican. After a crappy day of traveling, I was a bit short with the reception clerk and she handled me very professionally. And, she upgraded our stay to a huge room, suite like perhaps because it was a Sunday night. £150 for the room was a bargain, before the upgrade! Finding the room was through a maze, up and down stairs and elevators. Going out put us through a local pub that evening, a quirky layout, though the room was plush with a huge bathroom. Could not figure out how to turn off the bedside tables, so use the outlet switch. The rain shower in the bath leaked and the fitting might need tightening, breakfast was expensive, so we had a la cart which worked out fine. If i need to be in that part of London again, I would absolutely stay at the Montcalm. I recommend.",5,2017,06,28
128,"Great location, clean and smart room - one issue","Stayed here because we were going to a concert at the Barbican. The location couldn't have been more perfect. We enjoyed the Montcalm very much, great room and excellent facilities - but there was one issue. I reported to reception that the kettle in the room leaked boiling water when used. As it was rather dangerous, I also left a note in the room to warn others not to use that kettle. The receptionist on departure apologised and as a gesture of goodwill offered the waive the cost of our minibar use. That was a kind thought, but it turned out to be an empty gesture because I was still charged on my card for the minibar after we left. While we obviously expected to pay for minibar items, the hotel staff should not make promises they can't keep.",4,2017,06,28
128,Amazing birthday treat,"My friends, family and I stayed at The Montcalm at The Brewery for a night to celebrate my 30th birthday (our 2nd stay at this hotel). Upon arrival we were helped by Matt, the wonderful doorman. At check in I was told that I had been upgraded to the WOW Suite! We were helped up to our rooms  with our many, many bags and had all of the room features explained perfectly. 
In my room,  most kindly,  the hotel had arranged a bottle of champagne, strawberries, chocolates, balloons,  a card and '30' in rose petals. It was such a lovely gesture and a wonderful way for us to settle in. 
The room was absolutely amazing. A four poster bed (I'm 6""0 and my feet didn't stick out at the end) it was like sleeping in a marshmallow!  Ridiculous levels of comfort. The bathroom was so sleek, I want one in my house. Hermes toiletries, plush towels, a speaker with volume control so you can watch the tv in the bedroom from the bath  (which I also fit in!) There was an electronic blind to cover the glass wall. Heated mirror, heated towel rack and heated floor. Handheld shower,  rainfall shower,  jets. Nespresso machine,  kettle,  tea, coffee, hot chocolate, water, fruit, biscuits. Turn down service with pillow chocolates. Anything you could want. The staff were exceptional and so very friendly. It truly was a most wonderful weekend. We would like to thank all of the ladies that helped us check in and out,  Natalie,  Victoria and Valentina. We cannot thank Alice and her team enough for our wonderful experience and are planning our next visit to a Montcalm. ",5,2017,06,27
128,Another Fabulous Stay,"Having stayed at many of Londons top hotels on a regular basis  for both work  and pleasure we now look no further than to stay at the Montcalm Brewery in one of their   amazing suites.. 
We have stayed at the Montcalm  on a number of occasions and  have always had a great experience with all the  lovely staff, especially front of house who cant do enough to help you .
The service, has always been first class ,food  amazing and  beds incredibly comfortable beds in spotless rooms . You get the sort of service you expect from a hotel of this calibre and would recommend to anyone its worth spending at least 1 night there. For those that book the suites then there is a real added bonus of a lovely varied breakfast in the Clubroom and late afternoon refreshments ( soft and alcoholic drinks and varied sandwiches and nibbles.

Thanks again for yet another great stay.and we look forward to seeing you in July.",5,2017,06,27
128,Birthday Surprise!,"I stayed at the Montcalm at the brewery with my girlfriend as we were celebrating my birthday ( I was totally unaware this was the birthday plan).   We arrived a the hotel and were met by very pleasant and helpful staff.

We recieved an upgrade to our room as it was my birthday into a fantastic, large suite which had came with a complementary bottle of wine. 

The bed was very comfortable and it was actually a problem when we came to leave as my girlfriend just did not want to get out of it.

The location is only a short walk from Barbican tube station and from Liverpool street underground. It is surrounded by fantastic bars and nearby shoreditch has plenty of resturaunts to eat at!

Visit this hotel!",5,2017,06,27
128,Excellent Break,A great quirky hotel in a good location near St Paul's Cathedral and the City of London. Excellent value for money. Spacious room with lots of facilities. Very polite and friendly staff. Would have no hesitation in returning and recommending.,4,2017,06,27
128,Montcalm stay,"The room was very comfortable and the staff very helpful and polite, a very pleasant stay. Would recommend this hotel to anyone as the standard is very high, the location is very close to Liverpool Street station which has both underground and overground trains so commuting is easy, will definitely return overall excellent.
",5,2017,06,26
128,Such a lovely place,"What a lovely place and lives up to their 5* rating. 
Stayed for our anniversary and we was given an upgrade/ champagne and chocolates in our room, which I thought was a lovely touch! I was made to feel so special. The staff were all polite helpful and it was nice to stay at a hotel that looked after you simple needs! 

Bath Butler is a must!  Who doesn’t like rose petals !!  The little additions you get in your room are sweet. The Bed is so comfy! its like a massive hug!!

Treat yourself…we only live once.",5,2017,06,26
128,Fantastic stay!,"My husband and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our birthdays and wedding anniversary. The hotel is in a wonderful location, central and easy to get to but in a lovely quiet area. 
When the staff knew it was a special occasion, they upgraded our room and left some extra treats for us. There was also the very thoughtful touch of a pregnancy cushion as I'm 6 months pregnant. 
The bed was wonderfully comfortable, there were lovely Elemis toiletries in the bathroom, bathrobes, slippers and a coffee machine. 
Finally, the staff were fantastic. So helpful, friendly and thoughtful! Thank you to all of them for such a relaxing stay, my husband and I will definitely be back in the future! 
",5,2017,06,25
128,Luxury and Location,"Very well placed Hotel for the City. Very well appointed rooms and extra little touches that added to the experience. I stayed in one of their ""Wow rooms"" which was extremely comfortable with plenty of room to relax.

The bath with a window in to the main room was an interesting idea! I may come back with my wife at a later date!!!",5,2017,06,24
128,Fabulous Hotel with wonderful staff,"This was my second stay at the Montcalm this year. From arrival into the stunning hotel lobby and throughout our stay, the staff offera war an friendly welcome and are a credit to this wonderful establishment. If you're planning a trip to London in the near future then choose the Montcalm, you won't be disappointed.",5,2017,06,24
128,Another fabulous stay,We have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions and this was again another excellent experience. They really make it personal and do everything they can to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Thank you again it was wonderful.,5,2017,06,20
128,Great Stay,"Great hotel and in a good location, we were able to walk to the Tower of London fairly quick and was only two tube stops from Kings Cross station. The room was nice and clean and we even got upgraded on the day and breakfast included! Really comfy bed too which is always a bonus! ",5,2017,06,19
128,Very Nice Hotel,"I stayed at the Montcalm for a business trip. Upon arrival I was greeted by very friendly staff and a gorgeous lobby area. Luckily I was upgraded to a suit! :-) I think the room was very nicely appointed with everything you would need for a stay in London. Air con worked well and everything was nice and clean. The bed was very comfy too. YOU MUST HAVE BREAKFAST HERE!! The breakfast was epic. It was a buffet style but everything was so nice and the staff were great.

This hotel is now on my list for best London hotels!!",5,2017,06,15
128,"Funky vibe, but awfully loud","Stayed here for a few days while in London... really dug the exterior and the vibe of the place. Unfortunately there was a wedding one evening and children were running all through the halls screaming for hours which sort of bittered my opinion on the place overall

That aside, the staff were all quite friendly, the location itself was quiet being more in the business district, not a whole lot happening nearby at night time which could be good or bad depending what you're into!",4,2017,06,14
128,By far the best hotel in London ,"There's so much to love about this hotel ... the quirky building layout, boutique rooms with Hermes toiletries, the acclaimed Jugged Hare restaurant with wonderful choice of wines. Plus if you book a club room, there's complimentary early eve drinks and canapés - makes for a great start to a night out. I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Thanks Alice and the team for all the treats and exceptional service x

128,AMAZING!,This hotel is amazing! Stayed here for my partners birthday..and they upgraded us to a lovely suite that had an upstairs and two bathrooms plus late check out! The staff were so friendly and polite..we had a very personalised experience and will definitely be returning again soon!  ,5,2017,06,13
128,"Great hotel, excellent customer service and fabulous location!","The Good: Great location, close to the Barbican tube station, bus routes, good restaurants etc. Spotless clean rooms, good selection of amenities in the rooms, excellent WiFi, good cell connectivity and surprisingly low levels of road noise - even in the ground floor rooms. The suite style rooms are very well appointed and more spacious - highly recommend these if traveling with family.

The Excellent: Customer Service. The manager on duty recognized that I was traveling from overseas and went above and beyond to let me check in way ahead of my actual check-in time. I was there for 5 days, every inquiry and interaction with their support staff was informative, courteous and excellent. 

I was there on business and I'd definitely recommend this place for business travelers.",5,2017,06,13
128,Fantastic Hotel with great staff,We were more than impressed with our stay at the Montcalm.  The staff were all consistently great and couldn't do enough for us.  Rooms well designed and comfortable with great quality beds and bathrooms.  Great bar areas too.,5,2017,06,13
128,WOW factor stay at The Montcalm!,"We arrived at the hotel early and were met with exceptionally friendly and accommodating staff. It was our 30th wedding anniversary treat & my goodness we were treat like royalty. The room had been upgraded to a suite & it certainly had the WOW factor! Bubbles, chocolates and strawberries were laid out along with a card. We felt like we were well and truly spoilt from start to finish. The bed was amazing, so comfy. The room was really clean and spotless. Would recommend this hotel and will be staying there again in the future. All staff were so lovely and smiley :) The Jugged Hare pub which is part of the hotel, was fab too with great staff. Could not fault our the hotel at all. Amazeballs :)",5,2017,06,12
128,WOW! Fantastic experience,"We stayed in the WOW suite on our 25th Wedding Anniversary. The General Manager, Mr Obertelli and his staff were absolutely fantastic in making it such a truly memorable occasion. Without exception the staff were all excellent, very friendly and welcoming. We loved the room and were made to feel so very special by all the very thoughtful touches put in place for us. Such as Champagne, fruit, chocolates and flowers. This was all a complete surprise for my wife and it went like a dream. If you want a unique hotel stay in Central London for a special occasion, then look no further, you need to contact Alice at this historic venue. From my initial call she was so extremely helpful, her attention to detail and caring approach second to none. We cannot thank Mr Obertelli & team enough for organising such a memorable stay. We would also highly recommend to you the Chef and staff of the adjoining Chiswell Street Dining rooms. They did a terrific job recreating our wedding meal twenty five years on. We will hopefully be able to revisit soon.",5,2017,06,12
128,Great hotel and location ,Built within the confines of the old Whitbread Brewery this hotel has modern rooms while keeping the charm of history. Getting to your room can be a bit of working through a maze but adds to the flavor. Great location and lots within walking distance and only minutes from Tube station. Attached pub was usually very busy with good food. Only drawback was did not have Whitbread beer on tap. ,5,2017,06,10
128,Nice rooms great service!,"Me, my brother and sisters celebrated our mothers 70th Birthday om The Montcalm. Prosecco and cake on the room was the very nice gift from the hotel to our mother. Very nice and helpful staff. Would love to visit the hotel again.",4,2017,06,07
128,Our Favorite Hotel In London,"Where to begin with this fantastic hotel?! :-) 

Upon arrival we (my gf and I) are always greeted with a very warm, sincere/genuine, friendly welcome from both the Concierge (Vlad is a legend!) and the reception team! From this amazing start it just gets better.....
We cannot fault this hotel, its clean, friendly, well positioned, rooms are so very spacious, beautifully furnished and the choice/type of room is amazing!! 

If you decide to stay we recommend upgrading/pay for the Club Lounge access......this is truly worth it and once again the service, canapés and choice of drinks in the lounge cannot be faulted! Perfect ahead of a night out with friends/colleagues or Clients. 

We have stayed here numerous times (usually once every two months!) and it is our perfect escape to the city....we stay here for both business and pleasure and is perfect when hosting Client events in the City and sourcing overnight accommodation for our Clients. The feedback from them is just as positive and some have requested to stay here again!

In addition to the fantastic service, polite, courteous staff  the rooms are all so very clean, spacious and benefit from all the usual facilities and more!

Attached the to hotel is the famous Jugged Hare....wow! This cannot be faulted for its quality, service, food, wine....its a must if you visit!! In addition you should also opt for Breakfast - served by Rabbi and his team in the Chiswell Dining Rooms (attached to the Hotel) it is truly delightful and didn't realize there was so much choice you could have for Breakfast!

We cant leave this site without mentioning one of favorite people at the Montcalm Brewery... Alice....she has made our stays so very easy, relaxing, memorable and nothing is ever a problem. In fact there has been nothing to ever complain about, so when we do visit it is always nice to say hello, grab a hug and catch up like old friends and that is indeed what we have here....its like staying with friends....Alice and her team do an amazing job and we strongly recommend you give this hotel a look! Its a gem.....only hope I can now get a reservation, now that we have shared our perfect London getaway with you all?!!

Keep up the amazing work everyone....Paul and Kirsty are coming back!!",5,2017,06,07
128,Still great!,"Three months since my last review and hotel is still my number one place to stay when in London. Stay on business and will try and check in during a late lunch (have been able to check in around 2pm several times and go straight to room to drop bag off) or if room not available check in and pick room key up later on. Some of the rooms can be a bit confusing to find at first but as long as you ask reception which way to head for there are a lot of signs so it tends to be confusing the first time you need to find your room but fine after that. The rooms are always spotless with really comfy beds and you it's generally a relaxing atmosphere even when it's busy or there are conferences. I checked in with horror on one occasion as there were 15 people in the queue ahead of me but they sorted this and I was checked in within 5 minutes. Great location for Barbican Tube station in particular (a few mins) but easy walking distance to Moorgate (5 mins) and Liverpool Street (10 mins max). Great location, great rooms and great staff, will be staying here for leisure when I get the opportunity. The one downside is I compare other hotels I stay in when in different cities and they haven't met the standards of the Brewery yet!",5,2017,06,07
128,Don't stay anywhere else!!!!!,"What a great place!!! From the moment we checked in...till the moment we left! Amazing staff! Hotel were aware it was our anniversary.. they delivered wine and chocolates to our room with lovely hand written card from manager! Later in the evening they had petals and room decorated with towel arrangement! Just so lovely! Really comfy bed.. spacious room..,tremendous staff! Location good.. close to Liverpool street station. Only regret is that we were only staying one night!!!! Will defo be back .. would not even consider anywhere else! Thanks for a wonderful stay!!! ❤️",5,2017,06,06
128,Lovely visit! ,"Great hotel, so glad we found this gem! Upon check-in at our room, the staff had placed Cokes and chocolate cake for us- a lovely birthday surprise! The room was tidy and reasonably spacious for a central London room. The bed was very comfortable and the amenities nice. It is definitely a place I will both return to and recommend. 

A few areas the staff needs to improve upon though- bathroom cleanliness. The shower was missing tile and the tub/shower surround was caked with dirt and mold in places. This is not something I expect to find in a well maintained room. The housekeeping staff would not provide me extra shampoo and towels either- when I asked the housekeeper in the hall for some I was told that the room had 2 guests and what they provided was adequate (which was 2 towels and 1 bottle of shampoo). Additionally, we were placed in a club room but firmly told by the staff at check in not to ask for club privileges as we would not get any and we were ""lucky"" to be in that room. I thought that was a bit rude, it would have been better to not say anything at all. The workout room is a bit awkward, I wouldn't use it again. Although the rooms all boast iPod docks, the hotel has not upgraded them, so they are all iPod 4 docks with the old connectors. It would be better for them to either scrap them or replace them with the lightning pin connectors so they can actually be used. ",4,2017,06,05
128,Very nice BUT,"The welcome by the concierge and receptionist was fantastic, The rooms were lovely but the catering arrangements are strange , a pub at one end with a bistro attached ( we were advised not to bother to eat there ? ) We ordered champagne and received moans when we complained one glass was flat ( the remains from an opened bottle ) and at £9 a glass not cheap.  Our room safe didn't work and neither did the one in our friends room. The TV didn't work and the toilet was faulty. I would expect a notification to reception to have an immediate response but it didn't. Overall very good and we are going back.",4,2017,06,05
128,Great value - good location,"A Friday evening one night stay as a couple with theatre and a business meeting the next morning. The value/price trade of versus the west end definitely worth considering. Rooms are good (if compact) and we were upgraded to club level. Staff friendly and welcoming.

minor negatives - tea and coffee service at breakfast very slow. No lay down space whatsoever in the bathroom and no drawer space in the bedroom",4,2017,06,02
128,Birthday weekend ,"Had a fantastic stay at this hotel for birthday weekend. Hotel easy to find and convenient. Very attentive staff and extra touches in room for birthday were really appreciated. Lovely large room. Great shower! Will definitely return for another visit. 

",5,2017,05,31
128,Very disappointing,"My husband paid for 2 nights in this  5 star hotel  photos on here look fantastic sadly we were left very disappointed the lobby and main body of the hotel is great and lived up to expectations sadly we were led across the sqare to an adjacent building to a top floor room in the roof, as soon as you walked in the room smelt damp and had clearly had a water leak at some time , the room was tiny with the en sit was the size of a standard public toilet cubical,  wallpaper was water marked and peeling  and furniture had seen better days, we didn't bother eating there as the room was so shabby we felt the food would be as well 
Not the standard i expect from a five star hotel with a minimum price £280+ a night we've stayed in better quality 3 stars that are cleaner bigger and don't smell in smiliar areas",3,2017,05,31
128,Hotel service review,"There was an issue with my booking to begin with but this was a system error. While this took some time to sort out, I was looked after by Gemma who is the hotel's customer service assistant. Gemma provided me with excellent service, taking me to the area where the hotel provided free food and drink for the inconvenience and helping me to my room. Gemma was also very knowledgeable about the local area which I wanted to explore. She gave the best customer service experience and I very much appreciate this! Thank you so much to Montcalm, Gemma and all the staff who helped me have a fantastic stay!",4,2017,05,30
128,Theatre show one night stay ,"Arrived at the hotel with a friendly welcome and a porter who took us to our room( as it was quite a route and I don't think we would have found the room ourselves ! )We had a deluxe room which had the toiletries, hairdryer,coffee machine free water and fruit. The room also had a mini bar with the usual charges attached. A large bathroom with a great shower! 
We were positioned overlooking the front of the hotel but with it being a Sunday evening it was fairly quiet and we slept well - the bed was very comfortable ! We didn't eat dinner on the hotel as we had arrangements in the city after watching a show but we did have a few drinks in the bar/pub attached to the hotel which is quite small but had a good. 
We didn't have breakfast at the hotel- instead opted for breakfast over by St Paul's cathedral as we were walking into the city. 
I would recommend and stay at this hotel again ! 

",5,2017,05,29
128,Front office team - last minute help!,"Arrived at the hotel on very short notice and realised that my booking was incorrectly made for a day earlier. My error and not that of the hotel. Being tired after a long flight the last thing I wanted to do was find another hotel. Fortunately, a lady by the name of Fontina was able to assist and get a room for me. This despite the fact that the hotel was very busy. Fontina called reservations and sorted it all out for me. She could easily have and rightly so told me that I don't have a booking and nothing is available. Yet she took a professional and friendly approach and helped! Thank you.

Adrian Bolmoago then took it one step further and arranged my laundry despite the fact that I was leaving early the next morning. He was incredible and kept checking in if I was okay in the room and if I needed anything else. And I got my laundry before I left in the morning!

I'm a great fan of this hotel and this experience is a testimony to the fact that if you are travelling on business, then the Montcalm at the Brewery is the place to stay. They will go the extra mile.",5,2017,05,29
128,Could not have been better,"An excellent stay, we felt valued by the staff and enjoyed staying in a beautiful room. It's an interesting building that must have been a challenge to convert into a 5 star hotel, the result is far more interesting than your usual place. Comfortable bed and room, lovely Hermes soap, shampoo etc. Wonderful breakfast. Very well located for a 10 minute taxi or Uber to the West End. This was our second visit this year and we'll definitely be back again soon.",5,2017,05,28
128,Ms.,"This is the second time that I have stayed here because I like it so much!
The staff is so welcoming and helpful.
The amenities are top notch.
Florin has shown me all the shortcuts from my room to the street.
Come for a stay while visiting London. You will love it!",5,2017,05,28
128,Beautiful luxury hotel ,"We stayed at the Montcalm last night to celebrate my husbands birthday and we couldn't have been happier with our stay!

It's in a quiet part of London and we were able to drop our bags off in the morning before we went off out for the day. We were greeted by a member of staff as soon as we walked into the beautiful lobby and checked in with no fuss. We were upgraded to a duplex suite which was stunning and very luxurious. 

When we returned to the suite we found complimentary chocolates, bubbly and balloons waiting for us which was a welcome sight after a long day! Staff couldn't have been more helpful and helped plan our journey around London. 

The rooms are fitted with air conditioning and the bathroom products are Hermes which was a lovely addition. The wifi was good and there was a good selection of tv channels. 

Moorgate station is the nearest to the hotel, only 5 minute walk and there's places to eat and drink nearby. The breakfast menu is a bit pricey so we chose to eat elsewhere. Overall the hotel is stunning, clean, lovely staff and the beds are super comfy. Would highly highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again. Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2017,05,28
128,Characterful and well located hotel,"Characterful hotel. Smooth chick in. Bell boy took bags to room and spent a long time pointing out the features of the room  - some basic, some less so (eg how to turn on the underfloor heating in the bathroom).

I had limited time after checking to freshen up and change to go out to dinner. As I was coming out of the shower and the door bell to the room rang. I wasn't in a position to open the door so called out to ask who it was. There was a frustrated grunt from who I assume was a chamber maid, but no other answer before walking away. 

Room very spacious, furnishings beginning to look a little tired (eg a tear in the desk chair).

The room has a free mobile phone (which you can use outside the hotel) but did not use this.

Breakfast was help your self in  a characterful (lots of leather arm chairs) but small room.

I ordered a newspaper but it wasn't delivered to my room.

Overall I liked the hotel, but for the price some of the details need to improve.

I have used the associated restaurant a number of times previously and can highly recommend.",4,2017,05,27
128,Superb hotel.... 5 ⭐️!,"We booked into the hotel to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday and our wedding anniversary, and upon arrival received an upgrade to the Barbican Suite (amazing room!) in the west wing, and wine and fruit/chocolates in the room. Check in was very smooth and we received a very warm welcome, and the room itself was enormous, with every possible amenity you could think of, including Hermes toiletries.
The bed was one of the comfiest I have ever slept in, and the room was extremely quiet (considering the location and proximity to the city). 
Alice is an absolute credit to the hotel, and went out of her way to help resolve any issues and made our stay extra special....A huge thank you from us both. We shall definitely be returning later in the year. ",5,2017,05,27
128,Great hotel ,"The experience commenced from the offset when the door man greeted me with a smile, took my luggage and kept it saw while I checked in. He was friendly and gave me some history of the listed building which once was a brewery. This led on to my second experience of happy beautiful, and well presented reception staff who had genuine smiles on their faces. As the person in front was taking long to register, they offered my complimentary drinks, which I declined but it was a nice gesture. My room was the Barbican Duplex Suite. Tv, leather sofa bed, coffee machine, desk, shower, toilet, sink, beautiful window, ground floor, then I can walk upstairs to my large comfortable bed with tv, mini bar, another shower toilet sink. They use Hermes shower, hair products which means you can never smell bad even if you're someone that doesn't like to shower much...but for those who love a good shower, their products will make you smell divine. 3/4 mins walk from Moorgate under ground station. Located to bars restaurants. They have their own bar/restaurant which serves great food and drink. Breakfast was tasty. My company were hosting an award ceremony there too, which they catered for and the 5 courses were excellent. Good service, lovely friendly staff, no pressure for tipping but I gave tips as I was happy with the overall service. Remember it's in the middle of the city so no great outside views, but the building is listed and is well maintained. Five stars for sure. ",5,2017,05,26
128,Rude night manager,"I stay here often and generally like it, although the rooms are a bit small and can be very noisy.  However last week a number of us had a run in with the night manager as he pretty much went out of his way to be as unhelpful as possible.  This is certainly not the place for you if you expect a helpful and ""can do"" attitude from the staff.  On balance there are a lot of nicer hotels in the area within the same price range.",2,2017,05,24
128,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.......,"We arrived post a function, so too late to enjoy many of the facilities.  Our room was at the rear of one of the townhouses across the road.  Not huge - but perfectly wine.  Absolutely no view - but very, very quiet.  I can quite honestly say I have not slept in a more comfortable bed in a hotel in London other than at the Savoy.  What a joy to sleep in a bed that isn't the current fashion of being so hard you white as well sleep on the floor.  For that alone 5 stars!",5,2017,05,24
128,London Gem,"My husband and I have used this hotel on several occasions a year for the past four years. We have never been disappointed and have always had a great experience. The staff are so professional and friendly and make you feel at home. It is a short walk from the underground with plenty of excellent places to eat and drink.

It truly is a gem in the city.",5,2017,05,23
128,overpriced and dark & dingy rooms,"first of all I acknowledge that the staff at the hotel were first class, and the bed was extremely comfortable, but that apart it was not an enjoyable 2-night stay.
Our original room was pokey to say the least, felt more like a cupboard, asked to change to one with a bath, number 231, which was slightly larger, but still dark and pretty dingy due to the two small windows.
Breakfast on both days wasn't particularly great either, for a reduced B & B rate of £228 per night I would have expected much more, albeit it is in London.",2,2017,05,22
128,One night stay for an event in London ,"Booked a fantastic one night Saturday stay with lastminute.com 
On arrival at this lovely old London brewery converted into a five star hotel we were greeted by very helpful and knowledgeable staff, our room was upgraded to a club room one floor up above the reception which was convenient as I was told the hotel has lots of rooms spread over different buildings. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable, if anything was noted the finishing touches to detail in the fact of the room being well used and a little dated, needn't be a problem as everything worked as should be. The room 109 is a disability friendly room with a walk in rain shower, atomiser, double bed, wardrobe, iron and board, hairdryer, tea/coffee making facility, mini bar, all you could ever need for a comfy stay. 
The area in the city is quiet at the weekend but is within easy walking distance of the many bars and restaurants shoreditch has to offer.
Al in all a very pleasant stay at this lovely hotel, thanks to all staff who go out of their way to make you feel at home and make your stay a very enjoyable one.

I would have no hesitation in booking here again or recommending this hotel",5,2017,05,22
128,Fantastic stay,"Lovely hotel, beautiful room and such helpful service. I was a single woman staying for one night and on arrival was upgraded to a lovely double room with breakfast. Such courteous and helpful staff as well as being a great location for the Barbican. I can't rate this highly enough and would recommend thoroughly.          ",5,2017,05,22
128,Perfect Weekend Stay,"We've stayed in many higher end London hotels over the years but The Montcalm at the Brewery certainly stands out as one of the best if not the best we've stayed at. 

From the minute you arrive you are treated to the highest level of service. Whether it be the reception team, concierge or lounge teams, everyone is incredibly attentive and friendly and you get the feeling they are willing to go above and beyond for you. 

The standard and fit out of the room is a real stand out point. To find rooms that offer that amount of size with a good mix of modern and classic themes is quite unique for central London. 

Highly recommend for anyone looking for a high quality and good value in Central London.",5,2017,05,22
128,Excellent Stay - Would Come Back Again.,"It was my wife's birthday, which I mentioned to the hotel prior to arriving. On arrival, we were treated to a very warm welcome, an upgrade and some treats in the room. The staff couldn't have done any more for us on our stay, in particular Gemma, who was great. The room was spacious (club room), clean and comfortable with no outside noise. Location is excellent - just a short walk to the nearest tube station. The pub next door has a lot of character and sells a nice selection of beers.",5,2017,05,22
128,"Modern, centrally located hotel","I stayed for the first time at the Montcalm and was more than happy with the choice of my PA. Very centrally located near the City Centre, it allows to explore many things on foot or by the tube (station nearby). The rooms are modern with beautiful bathroom amenities and very elegantly furnished. Pricing is very reasonable for London - although i am not sure if i benefitted from a corporate discount. I would stay there anytime again, had a great time.",5,2017,05,22
128,Award Evening,Having been invited to an event at the Brewery we were booked into the Montcalm. We could not fault it the reception staff were flawless and the rooms perfect.Nothing was to much trouble. The event in the brewery was outstanding how they manage to serve so many people with food that was so amazing. Well done. However the people who should the biggest shout out and recognition are the door men they were outstanding.,5,2017,05,20
128,Good location for getting to and from various places of interest.,"Although my stay at the hotel was short the experience was first class from checking in, to checking out. Everyone was very curtious and extremely helpful from the manager to the domestic staff. I am wheelchair bound and have found that most hotels even the ones who say they accept wheelchairs usually turn me away when I say I have a power chair, but not this one. The space was great and allowed me all the freedom I needed.
The rooms were very clean and well kept and food and service couldn't have been better. Another thing I found especially refreshing was the fact that I was treated in the same manner as everyone else. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely be staying there myself in the future.",5,2017,05,20
128,"great staff, great surroundings","A lovely place to stay; the staff make it feel all the more sumptuous with their wonderful service. The room is lovely with everything you need. Great rain shower, wine, fruit and above all, a wonderfully comfortable bed. Very convenient for what we needed too.",4,2017,05,20
128,Not a great experience,"We picked Montcalm for the convenience of being next to the Barbican for an event.  The booking was in advance, and we had been in communication with the hotel a number of times, with various requests (inc family members staying) to ensure our stay was seamless for our gathering - a graduation!

It was disaapointing that despite check-in for 2pm (arriving at 2:30pm) we were still didn't get into a room until 3:30pm!  Supposingly, previous guests left late (though cant understand that the entire hotel didn't have another room available).  Reception was chaotic, I had 3 reception staff across our check-in.   We were also kept waiting because as my husband was parking the car at the Barbican, and the wanted his credit card. It actually wasn’t needed with an internet pre-paid room.  You would have thought that as they delayed our check-in there was a little flexibility or service, to allow me at least to go to the room first!  Afterall, my husband would have still had to go back to reception to get his room key!! 

We were fast running out of time to make an appointment by 4pm (only in London 1 night), then an hour later, we get to a room where the trainee said it was an “upgrade”. We were put in a room at the top of the brewery, 10 steps up, into what would have been the roof.  It was small, it was dark and offensive of the trainee to think we would accept this as an upgrade - you should never treat guests as if they are stupid!    In a previous role, my job was to find hotels for one of the largest global banks - so I know the hotel business.  So after seeing the room, we went straight back to reception, we finally got into a club room at 3:45pm (we arrived at 2:30pm-ish)!. 

Two of the receptionist (inc the trainee) spend an inordinately amount of time on the telephone, checking if the room was ready, or as one said, whether it was ready and something ridiculous about a fruit bowl!   Check-in was also slow for our family member, and we witnessed other guests complaining.  The room was nicely decorated, but the tap in the bathroom kept falling off.  The room wasn't even ready, eg: the telephones were unplugged.  It just wasn't 5 star top notch.

If a hotel is going to market itself to be 5 star, then the hotel needs to revisit it’s training programme and front of house service.  There were 5 people at the desk, attending to check-in which took ages, and a bit of common sense and problem solving wouldn't go a miss.  Even when I ask for an email to be printed, they give me the attachment not the email despite the it being explicitly clear!!

Next time I would rather be inconveniently located (catch a taxi, go on the tube) and stay in a 5 star hotel that lives up to the expectation of it’s rating.

ps: On another note, because we had an advance booking, my husband decided to stay for work 2 weeks prior.  He was put in a building across the road.  His room service had to be chased after an 30min wait (so a wait of 45 min) and both times the food was cold!    He wasn't convinced about the hotel then, and he certainly will not choose to stay for business again.",3,2017,05,19
128,extraordinary stay,"What a great hotel! When we arrived we were welcomed by the doorman. Because of it's history, the hotel can be a little maze. Luckily the staff lead you to your room when you arrive, and help wherever they can help. The service is excellent! The neighbourhood is quiet. There's no noise from the streets at night, you can even leave your window open. The underground is nearby (2 minute walk). We would strongly recommend staying here!",5,2017,05,18
128,Appalling ,"I have had to stay here twice before on business.  The rooms by the street are noisy and the pathetic single glazing is useless to stop noise.last visit I had to change rooms after the first night as it was very noisy from the road outside. 

The other issue is the lack of training facility. They had 2 or 3 machines put in what was an old room as a temporary gym 

This trip after explicitly asking for a quiet interior room I was given a room on the main road where it was very noisy. 

The staff helpfully set me up to move to another property where they could accommodate me in a quieter room. 

So overall a mixed experience - helpful staff but noisy rooms. ",2,2017,05,17
128,Night in a brewery?,"Spent Saturday night here. Booked 2 rooms for myself and my friend who traveled in from Spain. Having recently stayed at their Tech City branch, I knew I could trust Montcalm to look after us and impress my friend! 
And they didn't let me down! The service was very professional and friendly (considering I know we can both be testing!). Very welcoming indeed! The rooms were very well equipped and more than comfortable. The ladies on reception even gave me an upgrade free of charge (thanks ladies!). It was already good value for money without an upgrade!
Definitely would recommend and will return",5,2017,05,16
128,Faultless from start to finish,"I booked a nights stay in The Montcalm at The Brewery for my husbands 40th birthday and from start to finish it was a faultless experience!
I had notified the hotel before hand that it was a special occasion and when we arrived the lovely staff who checked us in told me that they had given us a complimentary upgrade to the best room in the house... and it really was! It was pure luxury!
The hotel staff had put balloons and flower petals in the shape of '40' on the bed, which was such a lovely personal touch that i am sure you would not get elsewhere!
Every member of staff we encountered were professional, helpful and extremely friendly.
We will, without a doubt, be booking again at The Montcalm and would very much recommend staying here to anyone who is looking for a beautiful hotel with perfect customer service in London.",5,2017,05,16
128,"Some positives, some negatives","On the positive side: personnel is very attentive and nice. They asked the reason for our visit and when told it was for my wife's birthday, we got chocolates and a bottle of wine waiting for us at the room.
On the negative: the room was extremely small. So much so that there was not enough space to put drawers (so part of our clothing had to stay in the suitcases). Also, some maintenance work is starting to be needed and the room smelled.
So i don't know if i would go back.",3,2017,05,16
128,A very pleasant experience,"It was a pleasure to return to the Montcalm and find that any wrinkles it may have had in the past have all been ironed out. The welcome on arrival was calm and relaxed though informative and helpful. Our room was a delight with every everything you could want and fitted to the highest standard. All the staff put themselves out to please, even down to the offer of making a honey and lemon drink to help my wife sore throat !
 The Food in "" The Jugged Hare "" restaurant was as always superb and breakfast, now served in the larger dining room, had everything you might want and more, with a relaxed and leisurely atmosphere. A perfect way to start the day.
  We look forward to our return visit.",5,2017,05,16
128,One night in the City of London,"The welcome was courteous and very friendly, a great start.
The plaque on the room door said it all ""WOW Suite"", as the door was opened, wow a  four poster bed, which was really comfortable, a leather 3 seater couch at the end of the bed. The room was big, well thought out, we wanted for nothing, the room had everything, even an umbrella for the English weather.
The bathroom was substantial including a full size bath and multi-function shower.
The hotel is situated in an old brewery, in the centre of the city of London, with excellent transport links. There is very little road noise, which was great.
This hotel is modern, but is unlike the other well known chains, it has an old world charm about it! The staff are all very friendly and offer help.
I think I have found a hotel to come back too when in London.
The only thing I could fault was the lack of a descent pub/bar, which was open, on the site of a former brewery (the City is quiet at the weekend), but you can't have everything.",5,2017,05,15
128,Outstanding luxury,"A great location to access all of the attractions, where you can relax in first class luxury and you are respected for being a person rather than a room number.  The whole team did an outstanding job running this beautiful historic building effortlessly.  The attention to detail bringing it right up to date with all the technology you could wish for but retaining the charm of it's bygone age have been installed as if they were always there.
The saddest time came when we had to leave after just two days, it was not long enough and we will be back.",5,2017,05,15
128,Absolutely Superb,"This hotel is a little treasure in the City of London but with in easy access of the West End. 

It is quiet, the rooms are all lovely well equipped with the best beds in any hotel I have been in.

However what makes this Hotel is the staff from the front door through reception to the management. The staff are polite.friendly and helpful - they will go out of their way to make sure you are happy. 

One special note is to Dorina in Guest relations who is absolutely awesome. 

Stay here you will not regret it.",5,2017,05,15
128,Amazing hotel,"Staff were friendly, lovely upgrade to a very clean high standard hotel. Very close to tube and easy to walk to major attractions from the hotel. Staff were very attentive. Will return to the hotel very soon.",5,2017,05,15
128,A touch of class,A lovely hotel in a great location. The rooms are extremely comfortable which made for a relaxing break. The staff couldn't do more to make your stay a welcome one. We will certainly be staying again on our next trip to London. Excellent!,5,2017,05,15
128,Excellent hotel,"A beautiful, well run and friendly hotel perfectly placed for city sightseeing. Clean, beautifully decorated and well equipped, this is a superb place to stay. 100% recommend. Added bonus of the Jugged Hare underneath who do some lovely bar nibbles.",5,2017,05,14
128,"Great  place to stay, excellent staff","Stay here frequently for business purposes. Friendly, welcoming staff, always trying to provide an excellent service. Hotel / rooms are full of nice little features to make your stay relaxing after long and busy days. Club rooms and lounge particularly good.",5,2017,05,14
128,Happy Birthday,"Chocolates wine balloons and a room upgrade made my stay at this London hotel extra special, a wonderful birthday treat  From the time you check in to the time you check out, nothing is too much trouble - fabulous hotel",5,2017,05,13
128,Birthday treat ,"I've stayed at this hotel twice, once in April for one night which was brief and decided to book it for a birthday treat weekend with my partner. We stayed for 2nights sat 6th may to mon 8th may. We stayed in a wow suite on both visits which was absolutely amazing. I loved this hotel because it was quieter than the other montcalm hotels. The rooms were spacious and even had a sofa bed. The bathroom had different shower heads and again spacious even had speakers so you can listen to the TV whilst in the bathroom so you don't miss anything. TV had a wife range of choice of channels to pick from and my partner even watched football on the Sunday. Beds were comfy and room was extremely clean. We got bathrobes and slippers and all the amenities of a 5* hotel which just made it feel luxury. We had full English breakfast included and club lounge access. I really enjoyed the club lounge it wasn't to busy nice for a light snacks and a drink wide variety choices and staff very helpful. Breakfast I found not alot of choices but felt like the in room menu for breakfast had more choices but it was still lovely to have and staff helpful and willing to serve and help at breakfast time and nothing was too much to ask... as you was able to order anything else extra at no extra cost which is extremely generous and good. 
Check-in on both visit was made extremely comfortable by Alice and her team where they offered me a drink and took my bags and even took me to my room to show me everything and even showed me the way to club lounge etc and made sure I was clear with everything. 
We didn't come across much trouble only two things... I did find the room on my second visit a little cold but I expect that with a old fashion building but I just loved the feel and decor to the building if your looking for modern it's a cross between. This building has history and whilst in club lounge I enjoyed reading about it. And 2nd thing was the cleaner accidently wrapped up my partner mobile phone in the bedsheets when she cleaned our room and we was searching everywhere for it when we got back from breakfast but once reported it at reception we had the cleaner manager come talk to us and they managed to find it so everything was good and the cleaner was very polite and apologetic.
Depaak is an amazing manager he sorted out my booking and made everything so smooth for us. Nothing was ever to much to ask him and made me feel at home. The hotel has a guest experience team and Alice (the manager of guest experience) surprised me with balloons and flowers, chocolate and a bottle of champagne to celebrate my birthday. This hotel i have to say is officially my favourite out of the montcalm hotels. With the staff just being so amazing and so helpful with everything. They don't have a spa but one of their sister hotel with is 5mins away didn't have a problem with us using their spa which was nice of them to sort out for us. 
I would say if you have any questions or issues just speak to a member of staff not one person was not helpful everyone was so hands on. 
Hotel is close to a tesco and about 10mins walk to Liverpool Street station so easy transportation.
Massive thank you to deepak and Alice for taking care of us and running such a beautiful hotel with 5* standard.",5,2017,05,13
128,Business trip with a baby,"I just returned from a short business trip to London.  Because I recently had a baby, I needed to bring my infant as well as a companion along.  The Montcalm was a fabulous destination.  It's perfectly located, a 10-30 minute walk to everywhere we needed to be, the staff went out of their way to improve our stay, and the accommodations were clean and perfect.",5,2017,05,11
128,"Reasonably priced, luxurious hotel..... with great beds!!!","This is the first Montcalm we've ever stayed at and were highly impressed. It was very reasonably priced so despite the reviews, we didn't expect too much. Very pleasantly surprised though, it was very luxurious. Definitely the best part of the hotel however was the beds, the most comfortable we have ever slept in!!!! The ONLY disappointing thing was that there were little bits of damaged, like a tile fallen off in the kitchenette, plaster blown in the bathroom, etc. As you can see this hasn't affected my review, but some it might take the edge of it being a truly ""luxurious"" standard of hotel",5,2017,05,11
128,OMG - what an amazing hotel,"This is a diamond of a hotel - tucked away near the Barbican in east central London.  It was an old brewery and has lots of quirky corridors and split levels.  I had emailed the hotel regarding our booking as I will be celebrating my 50th this month.We were given an amazing room - split level - bedroom upstairs with bathroom and a further bathroom downstairs off the lounge area.  We had a beautifull bottle of prosecco waiting for us on ice and a basket of fruit.  Bottled water was also complimentary.  The staff could not have been nicer - check in was superb and I was offered a hot/cold drink whilst I waited for my husband to return from parking the car ( the barbican car park is 5 mins walk away and only £9 per day on weekends)
There is a fabulous pub downstairs - part of the hotel so if you just wanted a chill weekend, bit of mooching with markets on sunday this is a real treat - I felt thoroughly spoilt and will definitely go back.
Diamonds are a girls best friend and this is one of mine - thank you xx",5,2017,05,10
128,Fantastic value for luxury,"This hotel is a gem in the City of London.  It is almost next door to the Barbican centre.
It is a beautiful old brewery building.  Discreet entrance and foyer area is very luxurious with many staff greeting and waiting for guests.  They are all extremely helpful and polite.
We stayed in a club room on the first floor.  With access to a members area which had a bar and snacks as well as a continental breakfast in the morning.
The rooms are plush, modern, clean, quiet and reasonably large.  What more could you want in London?!
There is also a small and dainty gym/exercise room....not designed for serious fitness freaks.
Plenty of restaurants nearby.  The Jugged Hare is the Hotel restaurant and pub.  Extremely nice!
Close to a number of tube stations (5 min walk).  We found the Barbican station the easiest to use.

All this for £150 a night!!!!!  I booked off late rooms.com  I understand this is probably a deal price but for the money (in London!) the value was incredible.
This hotel is must!",5,2017,05,10
128,Great hotel,"I felt welcomed from the moment I entered the hotel. Rooms are very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Room service is 24h and the food is good but there should be more options in the menu. I checked out with Ms. Fontina at the reception. A very professional lady. 

I enjoyed my staying!",5,2017,05,08
128,Our anniversary weekend ,"Stayed 2 nights with my partner for our anniversary. Friendly warm reception from the start made this a very pleasant stay. 
On arrival to the hotel amazing Alice whom is a guest experience manager greeted us and took us to our room. Entering to our room we were very pleased! She had arranged a bottle of Prosecco on ice with strawberries and chocolate. The bed has been decorated
with rose petals in a heart shape, which I found very romantic. She took the time to
explain all the services available. 
Also must admit the amazing room service which made our stay even more comfortable. 
We will definitely revisit this hotel again in future. 
",5,2017,05,08
128,High End Service with Historical English Flare,"I found myself working long hours outside of London to complete our UK project. I wanted to reward and celebrate our success with a high end weekend in the center of London. I booked a night with Montcalm at the Brewery, knowing it would be nice, but was blown away and instantly gratified the second I walked in.
The Montcalm is dripping in class and legacy, I felt as if I went back in time to a simple era when a hotel stay was an extension of your family back at home. The Montcalm at the Brewery was updated seamlessly with all the technical efficiency and convenience found in a modern day 5 start hotel, but still kept this endearing character of how I would imagine London would be in its best days as a roaring Victorian metropolis.

The location is great, walking distance to the tourist stuff at the River Thames, and also to Brick Lane Markets with unforgettable nightlife and dining near by .  I choose to uber around to save time, rides were around 5-6 pounds.

I was greeted in line to check in by several staff that offered to make my stay, in the first 30 seconds of being there,  more comfortable and relaxing. I was able to pay in USD which keeps the foreign transaction fees to a minimum. I was accompanied to my chambers down slick hallways in the East wing, to the Montcalm 'Club' room. What a fantastic room and presentation! It had all the things nice hotels used to have. Feather pillows, extra blankets, a desk, conversation chairs, a real mini snack and bar with coffee, tea, and wine, closet and iron, and safebox. The bathroom was immaculate with a glass enclosed shower and bath, with auto shade, rain style faucet and hand shower hose, zoom mirror, heated towel rack, phone, weight scale, and extra toiletry supplies. Technology was smartly laced with a fully integrated TV system to match the Montcalm brand, with free, speedy, wifi and a complimentary iPhone that can be used offsite if needed with free calling.  I can go on and on so trust me when I say I believe you will be impressed.  Absolutely classic. 

The service is what ties everything together.  My stay was overseen by a Guest Relations specialist named Gema C.  She is professional, warm, and sincere in every way.  It was clear to me that not only did she strive to make my stay the best, but also to have a great experience  in London.  She is very knowledgeable about the history of the site, food and travel options, and especially fun things to do.   She looked out for my best interest and was very supportive of my needs, it meant a lot to her to ensure my weekend would be the absolute best.  Gema personifies exactly what the Montcalm is trying to build upon.   From the doorman, receptionist, cleaning staff, room service, she represented what the team works hard to do, with complete focus.  That is to make the guest feel at home, most likely a more luxurious version of your own, but also feel in a different era of class and hospitality.

Do not hesitate to indulge with Montcalm at the Brewery.  I highly recommend you to request to speak with Gema the second you walk in and I promise your time will be magnificent.",5,2017,05,07
128,Nice hotel.  Shame about the breakfast,The hotel is a great find.  Although it is quite tired in decoration now.  Was extremely disappointed with the breakfast and service.   Staff didn't seem bothered as standard was below a premier inn. Don't bother paying for breakfast,3,2017,05,07
128,High quality hotel - central position - easy access to transport,"Hotel was very nice and staff very helpful and friendly. The lobby area operation was very well staffed with very short waiting time at check in / out and at concierge desk. Room (a club room) was a very good size (as was bathroom). We  only used the club room (guest lounge) for breakfast which again was very nice with fast working and friendly staff. Stayed on a friday night so the Jugged Hare (pub next door) was very busy after the nearby offices emptied as was the attaching restaurant, but easily found a table in the restaurant opposite which seems to attract pre theatre diners. The road outside, whilst being busy enough for Taxis to drive past, it was never noisy or difficult to cross. Since this is in the middle of a lot of office buildings there is the usual collection of coffee and food shops within easy walking distance, and may restaurants in the surrounding area. I'd read about the inter connecting buildings of the old brewery before we stayed , but having been shown to room on arrival  i had no problems with navigation subsequently. Would certainly stay again , and it probably becomes my first choice for London as a consequence of all of the above.",5,2017,05,07
128,Bumped out,"It is simply not acceptable that, when I book and pay for three nights in this hotel some weeks in advance, I arrive at about 8 at night to be told that I am being moved to another, sister, hotel only 5 minutes walk away.  Bad form.",1,2017,05,07
128,Very comfortable ,"Not the first time at this lovely hotel and hopefully not the last.
It's a hotel with so much character and space. The rooms are clean and well laid out. As for the staff - lovely, friendly and efficient, they make you feel very welcome and relaxed.
Given its location it's very reasonably priced.....another bonus. 
Thank you again Montcalm and I look forward to the next time.  ",4,2017,05,06
128,Total luxury,"Beautiful hotel with first class, friendly service.  The location is perfect being able to walk to many interesting places.  The food was impressive with delicious fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice. We were spoilt from the minute we got there.",5,2017,05,06
128,Very bad - they overbook,"I had a confirmed reservation, but they had no room, so they send me at 1 o'clock in the nigh to Montcalm Royal London House which is very noisy, because the bar just over the rooms play very loud music",1,2017,05,04
128,Solo Weekend - First Time Visit to London,"For my first ever visit to the capital, I asked and searched for a lot of hotels but due to the big boxing event, all hotel prices sky rocketted. Luckily this hotel was recommended to me. As soon as I landed, the staff were super friendly, always there to help and ensure I got the best treatment like a real VIP. A staff named Grazia welcomed me with amazing truffles sent to my room after seeing her when I was checking in. The room was amazing. It was perfect and spotless clean. I did everything I wanted to do in London and most places were close by. The staff are brilliant and always looked out for me to ensure my stay was comfortable. If I come to London again, I am choosing this place and I hope they do something extra special for me...maybe a free upgrade...lol bit cheeky but who knows. 5 star..highly recommended.",5,2017,05,04
128,"4 star maybe, this place is a labyrinth","More thought needs to be given to the room numbering in this hotel. It is a labyrinth. You can't even depend on the first room number to indicate the floor. If it has to be this way, at least add colored lines on the walls and have people follow them like they're in a hospital. More than once I had to get staff help to find my room and I'm not daft.

The breakfast leaves much to be desired, nowhere near enough tables and they are not quick enough to clear them when someone leave. So we have to help the staff do their job.

The rooms have the typical ventilation noises that you can't turn off, even with the key removed from the slot. Close the bathroom door and try your best to ignore it.

I was here on business and happy to let my employer pick up the tab. There is no way I would give out my own cash for this place. Four star at the very most.",3,2017,05,03
128,Long weekend in London,"We stayed here for 3 nights during June and absolutely loved it. Rooms were clean and spacious, staff were very friendly and helpful. Bathroom was a good size and the location is great if you are wanting to be on that side of London! My only complaint would be that the bed is very high off the ground! ",5,2017,05,03
128,Excellent hotel with light pricing!,Vlad from concierge desk did a great job by helping us with transportation and provided the fast track tickets to the most beautiful palces in London. The party at Armenian restourant ( Erebuni ) was unforgetable !,5,2017,05,03
128,Extraordinary customer service and amazing experience,"I'm staying at this hotel almost every week and each time I am highly impressed by the warm and professionalism of the staff. Nothing compares with a nice and very clean room after a busy day at work, and the staff is always careful to make my stay pleasant each time - small gestures as a hand written welcome note or a bottle of wine are impressing me each time. Special thanks to Ms Dorina who has an incredible sense of customer care.It is a pleasure to stay at this hotel and I totally recommend it.",5,2017,05,02
128,Amazing ,"Fantastic. Just fantastic. This was my second visit and it won't be my last. I was generously upgraded to the Wow Suite and that was my reaction when I walked in. The bed was the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on. The toiletries were divine and the teabags made the most amazingly aromatic brew. The service at the front desk was faultless. I was made to feel instantly welcome. And the breakfast, in the adjacent Chiswell St Dining Rooms, was delicious and wonderfully fresh. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,05,02
128,Perfectly personalised! ,What a fantastic stay at the Montcalm ! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt truly welcomed by all of the staff here. I had organised as a surprise for my boyfriend and we were surprised and delighted to find some little extras in our room when we checked in along with a lovely handwritten card from the hotel- a true token of personal. The room itself was fabulous and they really have thought about every little detail! The bed is perhaps the comfiest I have slept in !  But the real bonus to this hotel really is the staff- each are so committed to making your stay one which you will remember and I can truly say that each member of staff did this- thank you for a truly personalised and luxury experience in the heart of London. 💂‍♀️💂,5,2017,05,01
128,5 Star Luxury ,"Me and my partner stayed at the hotel for one night as we were in London looking at properties for when we move down in a few months. We payed about £160 for the night which I thought was a great price for a 5 star hotel. We booked a deluxe double room, with check in being at 2pm. We arrived in London at 11.45am and thought we would check if our room was ready on the off chance. We arrived at the hotel about 12pm and was informed our room was not yet ready so was upgraded to a club deluxe double room which I thought was very kind of them to do. The room was very spacious and clean, with a huge king sized bed and it was honestly the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! The room came with a smart phone to use and take out at your leisure with free calls and data. It also came with coffee making facilities, minibar, safe and fresh fruit and water. The staff were very attentive to our needs while we were there, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was very clean and well presented and definitely worth the 5* rating. We will be coming to London a lot over the next few months while we look for property and we aim to stay at The Montcalm every time as we had such an enjoyable experience. Thank you very much! ",5,2017,05,01
128,Good service but the hotel is not five stars,"I was staying there for three nights. In general the experience is ok but nothing more than that. Yes, you will be greeted when you enter to the hotel and someone will open the door for you. Another person will guide you to your room but it is mainly because the floor plan is complicated.

But in your room you get too many glitches to call it a five star experience. My room was small. Really small. I think Travelodge has larger rooms. In the room I found things falling out, needed repair or replacement. I made some photos to give an idea about the room size and these glitches that I had to deal with.

In general, the location is good, rooms have windows to the court that is rather quiet but sometimes drunk people pop up from somewhere and due to poor sound isolation on windows, you can clearly hear them. If I would need to choose, I won't be staying there for the amount it costs.

Wifi is free, fast and does not require password.",3,2017,05,01
128,Good Quality Hotel + Good location,"We arrived at the Montcalm, hot and bothered from traveling on the train and tube, and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel. The next thing to improve our mood was that we had been upgraded to a Suite, instead of a double room. The staff were all very friendly and we would have no hesitation to book again. ",5,2017,05,01
128,Great experience and very welcoming staff!,"I was visiting London end of March and was very pleasantly impressed by the hotel. very modern, high technology in the room, good location, clean with high quality toiletries and good food. 
Above all, what made a special difference was the staff: highly attentive, customer oriented, helpful with information and prompt services. Ionut, Iuliana and their manager Dorina made me feel at home, guided me when needed and supported the few special requests with promptitude and joy. 
Thank you for making my stay there such a great experience! would come back again with every occasion and would definitely recommend the hotel further! LOL",5,2017,05,01
128,Weekend with friends to watch the Joshua Fight,"For little more than the chain cheapies like Premier, IBIS etc. This is fantastic. Luxury hotel, very helpful and friendly staff, clean and very comfortable. They think of all the little extras like fruit and bottles of water, Elemis toiletries, coffee machine and nothing too much trouble. Will definitely try this again next time.",5,2017,04,30
128,Birthday ,"A great stay. Not only the comfortable cosy room with a great bed, but the attentiveness of all the staff and the little extras made it a special weekend. From the time we checked in until we left they couldn't have been more helpful.  We will be back!",5,2017,04,30
128,Period Charm with Modern Rooms,"I really enjoyed my one night stay at Montcalm, it had everything I wanted in a City hotel, centrally located, beautiful old building but perfectly modern where it counts. The room was very comfortable with a stunning modern bathroom, lots of little extras like a fruit bowl, sound system, drinks corner, iron & ironing board & laundry service if required. Booking.com gave me a great rate too! ",5,2017,04,30
128,"Smart, peaceful and luxurious ","We stayed at the hotel over the weekend for an early birthday weekend. On arrival we were upgraded which was wonderful. The check in process was swift and friendly, then shown to our room. There were a few little birthday extras which are very considerate and add that little extra something. 

The service is exceptional, nothing is too much and the staff are always smiling. The rooms are clean and smart. The bed is one of the most comfortable we have stayed in. The extra pillow, high bed both made for a truly relaxing nights sleep. We would come back just for bed! 

 The hotel can seem like a maze, but everything is clearly marked with signage. The area itself is very business orientated it makes for a quiet evening in London. So if you are looking for something away from all the hustle, the Montcalm offers this in a central location. Although there was an event on at hotel on Sunday and some noisy revellers could be heard in the early hours of the morning. 

All in all a wonderful stay and a perfect start my birthday week. ",4,2017,04,28
128,THE WOW SUITE,"What an outstanding hotel, Very easy check-in with friendly staff and no fuss ! I was allowed to drop my luggage off early before my check in time which was a great help.  My room (the wow Suite) was fabulous! Beautiful four poster bed which was very comfortable in fact its the only four poster bed that has been.  Fabulous spacious bathroom with Hermes products and spacious bath.  Perfect tea /coffee facilities with little extras plus a well stocked mini bar. My room was immaculate and I couldn't have asked for any better.  Every member of staff I encountered was polite friendly and went out of 
their way to help and assist you in any way they could. Breakfast was superb including 
the service. I haven't used this hotel chain before but wouldn't hesitate to use them in the future.  A final thank you to Mandeep who from the start of my booking was caring attentive and polite. A truly valuable asset to any company.",5,2017,04,27
128,Simply put? Marvellous,"Our stay at The Montcalm was probably the highlight of my trip. My partner and I stayed for a long weekend for her birthday.

The Montcalm was fantastic from the start. Our bags were taken on arrival, and we were checked in promptly and efficiently. We had arrived before our room was available, but staff looked after our bags while we explored the city and when we returned they had been moved to our room ahead of us.

The best part was that we had been given a free upgrade to one of their Club Rooms, with complimentary champagne, chocolates and a birthday card. This personal touch had a huge impact on our stay, and I really appreciate that the hotel would rather improve our experience than let the room sit empty because we hadn't paid for the better room. Absolutely the right attitude.

Housekeeping came daily, with a system that allowed you to choose whether you changed your towels each day or re-used them to help the environment. There was also a turn-down service, which made for a lovely night when you return to the hotel to find your room all ready to relax and sleep in. The room was very clean, and the furniture beautiful. 

The building is historical, which means that some of the corridors and stairs are a bit odd. That being said, it's very well kept and the age of the building only adds to the charm.

Upon checkout, staff were happy to look after our bags until we actually left London that evening. We were invited to give feedback, which is always a good sign with any business.

I could say so much about the hotel, but I will leave it at this: You won't regret staying here! You will feel welcomed and comfortable from the beginning and will only wish you could stay one more night.
",5,2017,04,27
128,Worth Every Penny!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Montcalm for 3 nights whilst exploring London for my 20th birthday.

The hotel upgraded us from a Deluxe Double Room to a Club Room for free upon check in. Whether it was because it was my birthday or because the room was empty for the duration of our stay, it was a lovely surprise. They let us leave our luggage safely at the hotel whilst we engaged in other London activities before checking in at 2pm and on our last day after check out at 12am.

The hotel room had beautiful decor, complete with blackout curtains and an expensive leather couch at the foot of our king size bed. I had the best nights sleep of my life and am actually planning on purchasing the mattress topper they used.

The facilities in the Club Room were never ending. Here's a list:

Overhead shower, rainfall shower and bath all in one
Huge bathroom mirror, accompanied by a magnified mirror
Montcalm hand soap, cotton balls, cotton buds, nail file, shower cap and small hairband
Bath mat, body towels, hand towels and flannels
Elemis hand & body lotion, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner
Iron and ironing board
Hairdryer (ask at desk for hair straighteners)
Sewing kit
Lockable safe for valuables
Laundry service
Normal clothes hangers with trouser attachments and two padded suit hangers
Montcalm bath robes and slippers
Complimentary coffee machine with daily top ups of coffee inserts, sugar, tea bags, milk and luxury hot chocolate
Two main cups and adjoining saucers with spoons
Two espresso cups and adjoining saucers with spoons
Complimentary fruit bowl with one apple, pear and orange
Complimentary still and sparkling bottled water and glasses
Large flat screen TV with plenty of TV channels to choose from, music and radio channels and a paid movie section (we paid £12 at the end of our stay for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them)
Daily maid service as well as a daily turn down service

My boyfriend and I are not posh people and the hotel was definitely incredibly posh being kitted out in deluxe crystal chandeliers, however, we felt welcomed and completely comfortable, no one made us feel like we shouldn't be there and everyone treated us the same as they would a customer with a platinum credit card.

We will both definitely be staying here again.",5,2017,04,25
128,Wonderful,"We had booked in her for two nights for the marathon weekend. We arrived at the hotel at about 2pm and although it was busy we were dealt with quickly. Reception team were polite and friendly and the hotel lobby was beautiful. 
We were shown to our room which was nicely decorated, clean and modern. The room wasn't big and the view not great but that wasn't what we came for. 
The amenities in the room were good and the bed was very comfortable. We opted to not have breakfast as we were on the move early. 
All the team were polite whenever we walked through and not at all pompous as in some London hotels. 
In fact we loved it that much we booked and stayed an extra night and got upgraded to a superior duplex room which made our stay. Great job, great hotel, great location. We will be back ",5,2017,04,25
128,Superb attention to detail,Lovely hotel beautifully maintained. Staff very polite and helpful. Our room had everything you could want. Every client need has been considered from lovely complimentary teas to beautiful bedding and towels. Location accessible by two tube stations. The price reflects the quality of the hotel although it is not a hotel for those on budget .,5,2017,04,24
128,A night away from home in a hotel that I ACTUALLY enjoyed,"I never enjoy being away from home and staying in hotel on a business trip - until I discovered Montcalm at the Brewery. Most unbelievable, genuine, caring service. Excellent facilities. Room was really comfortable and exquisitely decorated.",5,2017,04,24
128,5 star but not exactly,"Hotel's location is really great since it takes you literally 10 minutes cab ride to all of the most interesting areas / places in London but if you are expecting a liveliness of Soho or hustle of Oxford St. and cool vibes of Shoereditch, you won't find them there. It is more of a ""business area"" with the tall office buildings around and tons of traffic. The rooms are small and could feel bit claustrophobic, but that's ok, I could live with that. What I can't pass on is the fact that mini bar was terribly dirty. Reception was the place I had issue with, they seemed to lack the 5 star feel as they were too cold and at times felt like they were even annoyed when talking to you. The look of the hotel is beautiful.",4,2017,04,22
128,Really lovely luxury hotel with great staff.,"We stayed at this hotel last year and it did not go according to plan, however the hotel staff said for us to return and they would put it right. We returned in early April and wow did they put it right. After emails to the duty manager Dorina, we arrived and checked in. Dorina was called by the reception and she came out to see us. She had a big smile and greeted us by explaining how proud she and all the staff were of the hotel and that she was going to look after us. Dorina more than looked after us, we were treated to a luxury stay made even more special as it was the weekend of my wife's birthday.
The hotel is lovely and the staff are lovely. Its location, rooms and facilities are simply excellent. Well worth upgrading to the have the use of the club lounge, a real treat. We love the history of the hotel site as the old brewery.
This review highlights a lovely hotel, but also that when things don't go to plan in the past they are willing to put things right and welcome you back.
This customer service and reputation is a rare thing nowadays.",5,2017,04,21
128,Comfortable hotel in a great location,"Really enjoyed my stay here, the staff were very friendly and the hotel is beautiful inside. The only negative was that the gym area was barely the size of a small hotel bedroom and not fit for purpose.",4,2017,04,21
128,Great check-in and UPGRADE!,"We much enjoyed our fabulous Club Room upgrade and the friendly check-in; everyone at The Montcalm went the extra mile to make our stay a splendid experience! And nearby ""Osteria"" at the Barbican can be very warmly recommended for its fabulous Italian wines and food!",5,2017,04,19
128,A STAY TO REMEMBER,"Not only is this hotel stunning and beautiful the hotel staff are friendly and welcoming. 

Me and my boyfriend had spend a night here to celebrate our anniversary. My boyfriend called before hand to let them know it was our anniversary in the hopes of planing something nice and they told him not to worry they would arrange something. 

When we arrived we were looked after by a lovely lady (Grata) she took us to our room and said they had a surprise for our anniversary, we were bumped up from a double room to a 'wow suite' with no extra charge. The bed was beautifully decorated with swans made from towels and rose petals spread across the bed. The room was beautiful with a large 4 post wooden bed, sofa and seating area and a large bathroom. Perfect for a romantic night away.",5,2017,04,19
128,Perfect,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff were all so friendly and polite, they really made you feel welcome.
On check in we were upgraded to the club room which was lovely and spacious. The hotel is a bit of a maze but this just adds to the charm.
I cannot fault this hotel, we are hoping to return in the future!",5,2017,04,19
128,The Montcalm at the Brewery London City,Arriving in London 4 hours early for our check in time we risked going to our hotel to see if we could leave our luggage in the lobby as we had a very busy schedule and didn't fancy carrying our bags around the City. To our great amazement we were allowed to check in there and then and were even given an upgrade on one of the rooms we booked. The reception staff and concierge service we received were outstanding throughout our stay and the rooms were thoroughly cleaned and freshened every day. I really can't rate this hotel highly enough.,5,2017,04,19
128,Wow!!!,"Stayed here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We had booked through booking.com and had a really good deal. We were shown up to our room by the concierge who was informative. We were given a ""club"" room which was very impressive. The room was well equipped with everything we needed and even had a clear view of the bathroom 😳 the hotel is located close to a tube station which made going out and about easier for us. This was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Can't wait to come back! ",5,2017,04,18
128,Unfortunate encounter,"After a recent stay at this location, I have to stress that this hotel in no way deserves its current star rating. 
Unfortunately the Mountcalm Club bedroom held what appeared to be the smallest double bed in existence, coupled with a non-working shower head, a bowl of fruit that consisted of 1 x Apple- 1 x Orange & 1 x Pear, all of which were either recovering from a heavy night out the night before, or had just seen better days, led to a not so great overall experience. 
Additionally the in-room scent which was ordered when the room was originally booked was also nowhere to be found or enjoyed
 
Continental breakfast... If this is the hotels view of what is served on the continent, then we will have solved the world obesity problems over night... ""if you would like a little breakfast fun, ask for a Cappuccino and watch what happens""  ;o)
To top off the experience we were then overcharged for the room, and when the staff were challenged   about this, they became defensive and seemed to infer that ""This is how it is""  “All very 5 star”!!

With a little customer service training, more flexibility and accommodating approach this could be a great hotel in a decent location, but as it stands it needs a serious shakeup..",2,2017,04,18
128,An excellent hotel with wonderful staff!!,"I booked this hotel over the Easter weekend for my partner and I to celebrate his birthday and our recent engagement having stayed at this hotel on two or three previous occasions. 

On arrival we were greeted with the same warm welcome we had experienced during our previous stays. Whilst the lady on the front desk was preparing our check-in, a call was made to a lady called Gema who I believe is part of the guest relations team. She came over and introduced herself and was incredibly warm and welcoming. She was already aware of our occasion and took a genuine interest in us and our plans for the weekend.

Meanwhile the lady on check-in informed me that our room had been upgraded which I was pleasantly surprised by. We were then shown up to our room on the second floor and was told that it was the best (or one of the best?) room/s in the hotel and on entering it certainly was outstanding. Gema and her colleagues had gone to a lot of effort to make our room special. The beautiful four poster bed had two towel swan creations on it and rose petals were scattered all over with two little chocolate treats. There was a bottle of prosecco on ice, a personal hand written card to us and a lovely Easter egg on the coffee table. The room itself and bathroom were exceptional and spacious and had all the amenities anyone would want.

We were absolutely delighted with the room and very grateful for all the effort that had been made for us.

Gema was also present when we were checking out and she was as delightful as when we first met her. She asked how our stay was and offered us a tea/coffee and when we said we were pushed for time as our taxi was outside she offered to make these available for us to takeaway (we were also given two mini eggs which was a lovely Easter touch). 

Our stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery was wonderful and was made very special by the efforts and kind gestures the hotel team went to. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definitely be staying again!",5,2017,04,18
128,Not a 5 Star Hotel or experience,"My partner booked this hotel for a luxury night away as part of my Birthday Gift, but the hotel did not deliver a luxury experience.  It was more akin to a 3 star. Three withering pieces of fruit and an atomiser in the room (which even the staff could not get to work) does not make a 5 star stay.  Nor does the double bed in our Montcalm Club Room (we expected a King) and the lack of a comfortable chair.  There was a sort of desk swivel chair -  but one of us had to either lounge on the bed or the floor, when there was certainly ample room for an armchair and coffee table.  The continental breakfast was well laid out but the cappuccino machine was broken and the juice glasses were chipped, oh and the hall carpet was frayed and a trip hazard.  Small, forgivable things when you have a great experience, but annoying when you feel the hotel is over rated and not value for money.

Also beware, my partner reserved our room in December, but when we checked in we were told a collection had not been made on his card.  He will write about this under his own review, but unfortunately the customer experience in addressing this was woeful.  It is great to have cheery helpful staff pleased to welcome you, but when things are not as you hoped they were unable to handle our feedback in a professional way.

We will not visit again, overall the hotel is cramped, dark, superficial and over priced.",1,2017,04,17
128,Excellent !!,"We stayed one night over the Easter weekend to celebrate our anniversary. Hotel was very well decorated and everything was great. Especially staff were so impressive, thanks to guest experience team for looking after us and for the room upgrade.",5,2017,04,17
128,Good Hotel and friendly staff,"We chose the Montcalm after a wide search to find something over Easter.  We normally stay in the centre Dukes, Mondrian or St James's Club but decided to do something different. The room (105) was adequate in size but had good facilities, no complaints at all about the room other than some small details could have been taken care of earlier.  The chair next to the desk was worn through to the metal, for example, but that's a minor point. Otherwise it was comfortable and clean.  One down side of this room is the noise from the deliveries and others below at 02:00, 04:00 and again around 07:30 every day.  To be fair we didn't raise it with the team until we left and they responded very well to the comment promising us an upgrade next time.  The hotel is an interesting place and having the Dining Room and Jugged Hare as food choices is an excellent thing.",4,2017,04,17
128,"A cramped, unimpressive hotel","This is a repeat of an unfavourable review from a few months ago that was strangely removed.

I was really unimpressed with the hotel. It looks great on the surface, but it's all style over substance. My room was small and cramped with electrical humming outside, but the worse part the hassle of getting through the hotel to my room in the first part! As I recall, I had to get into a lift, up various small flights of stairs, cross a bridge, another lift etc etc. And, all through thin corridors and on carpet - not fun when you're trying to wheel a suitcase!

Breakfast was probably the best part of it (apart from them using cheap streaky bacon).

Maybe all the other glowing reviews had a different room; who knows. But my colleagues (I work for a company with a big office very nearby) generally choose to stay elsewhere when they come over.

Based on this experience, I would much rather go for a Premier Inn or something over the Montcalm for a fraction of the price.",2,2017,04,16
128,30th birthday night away!,"We stayed as two couples celebrating our partners 30th birthdays. We chose this hotel because we loved the fact it was an old brewery. It did not fail to impress. All the staff were pleasant and happy to help. A big shout out to Maxime who helped make our experience even better. I emailed her the day before to say about our partners birthdays. We had free room upgrades, balloons and a card and bottle of wine in the rooms! All these extras made our stay extra special! Location is perfect. Nearest tube stops are Barbican and Moorgate within 3-5 min walk. Definitely recommend!!",5,2017,04,16
128,Perfect stay,Out stay at the Montcalm over the Easter weekend was perfect. Excellent and personal service. Room was lovely so nice that we didn't bother going out apart from dinner. Thank you Alice for looking after us and all the other staff.,5,2017,04,16
128,Luxury experience in London 1 night ,"We came on bank holiday and quickly realised prices for a normal 3* (which we would usually book) were through the roof- so when we found that this 5* was ONLY £20 extra we absolutely had to give it a try!! It was 100% worth it, in the centre of city of London this hotel was complete luxury and style ! In every detail from the top quality bed to the complimentary coffee everything was to a very high standard !! I must say- one of the biggest things I noticed was how accommodating and pleasant all the staff was especially at reception! One person in particular Gema was extremely helpful in giving us top tips of local attractions and restaurants to go to which made our experience more personal! We even had a complimentary bottle of wine put in the room to welcome us! If you are going to London &I seriously can part with a tiny bit more cash it's really worth and nothing felt pretentious or posh at all ! Totally surprised and totally blown away ! We would definitely consider booking again! Hope this was helpful .. ",5,2017,04,15
128,Wonderful hotel,"Myself and my husband stayed here for the weekend to visit our daughter. Beautiful rooms, great customer service and great location. When we arrived we were upgraded to a better room, without asking. Will go back again.",5,2017,04,12
128,We didn't want to leave!,"On check in we were warmly welcomed and told we had been upgraded compliments of the hotel! This was my boyfriends birthday present from me and not only did they upgrade us there were balloons, wine and a birthday card waiting for him in the room. He was so appreciative!

The hotel room was beautiful, the staff were so accommodating and nothing was too much effort. The location of the hotel is discreet which makes it even more of a wow factor when you walk in. The location also enables easy access to central London.

Our one wish was that we could afford to dine in the restaurant as it was slightly too expensive i.e. breakfast £25 per person, however that was our oversight and we will be aware for our next stay!

So glad to have found this beautiful hotel. 

",5,2017,04,11
128,Excellent customer service and beautiful hotel,Stayed here with friends. Beautiful hotel and rooms. Our room came with a Nespresso machine which was a good touch. Comfy beds- we couldn't get up in the morning. Breakfast was tasty. Good location although a bit quiet at weekends in surrounding streets when workers are off. Complimentary coffee bar in reception was also a nice touch! ,5,2017,04,11
128,Good location and stay,"I was in London for business and found this hotel very reasonable in price, despite the fantastic location and service. There was one error made in that I was opted into email communications (you know how it is these days!) from the hotel twice during my stay- something I complained about then and there. Sometimes things go wrong and actually it really shows the quality of a place as to how they respond- The Montcalm responded extremely well-the same day as my complaint I received a letter of apology and some very nice wine in my room the same evening. 

The staff couldn't have been more polite and the room was immaculate. Would highly recommend. ",4,2017,04,11
128,Outstanding hotel in the heart of the city,"Great room and breakfast, very luxurious hotel that offers a range of complementary stuff (e.g. Magazines, cookies, chocolates, etc.). The location is very convenient to visit the city/shoreditch. As a tourist maybe a bit further away from the main attractions, but still very easy to reach everything. Staff was very friendly and willing. ",5,2017,04,10
128,Good,"On what basis does one review? Price or package? Well this is a five star establishment. We got the lowest priced room for £110 on an offer for after a night out in London. And for the price we got the hotel was great. The room was overlooking a....wall but then again when their other rooms are a lot more expensive we did not expect views to the Big Ben but probably their worst located room. The bed was great, all was clean and tidy, chocolates were on the desk for us. Aknowledging that we paid little, a 5 star hotel should  in all rooms provide slippers and a bathrobe, it didnt. As a five star hotel i would rate it only if I had paid something extra and was in one of their superior rooms. So yep, defintely worth £110 a night, 5 star....? I would need a couple of nights on their more upscale rooms to judge but the signs are there, profesional and pleasant staff, well equiped rooms etc",5,2017,04,10
128,Beautiful hotel & incredible staff,"This was my first visit to the Montcalm and I had high expectations because of a friend's recommendation. From start to finish, the staff and hotel exceeded my expectations. 
I got to the hotel quite early and they checked me in instantly, received my bags and ensured they'd be in my room when I returned. I explored London that day and came back to make use of the club lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks - this was a really great addition to my stay. 
The room I stayed in was gorgeous, modern and comfortable. And the staff even left balloons and rose petals to mark my friend's 30th birthday; a really nice touch. 
After a wonderful night's sleep we were met by Grazia (the guest experience executive) and she was so friendly throughout our time at the hotel. She made us feel welcome and her customer service made us all want to return. A great hotel and I'll be back when I visit London in the future. ",5,2017,04,10
128,Excellence!!,"My girlfriend booked a room atThe Montcalm at the Brewery London City as we were going to London for my birthday celebrations. On checking in we were informed that we had been given an upgrade to a Montcalm Club room at no extra charge as it was my birthday to which we were really surprised at and very grateful. The room had rose petals and balloons on the bed and there was a birthday card, complimentary chocolate truffles and a bottle of Chianti included so I was even more surprised and grateful to the hotel for going out of there way to make our stay admirable experience. The room itself was excellent and the bed was so comfy that at this point of writing this review I'm laying in my bed at home wishing it was one of the Montcalm beds!! The staff were extremely attentive and friendly at all times. Ordered room service on returning from a lovely meal out in the City as fancied a few drinks to end the night and the beers were bought to the room ice cold which is perfect as no one likes a warm beer!! I would highly recommend The Montcalm at the Brewery London City and we will be returning for another stay!! If the management read this I thank you and am truly grateful for our stay at your hotel. ",5,2017,04,09
128,Another great stay!,"We have just had a wonderful stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery and want to express our thanks to the excellent staff at this hotel.  Aside from the warmth of our welcome there, from the doormen to those manning the reception, throughout our visit every effort was made to ensure we enjoyed our time there.  A small difficulty with local noise (not the norm for this hotel) was rapidly resolved with a change of room and we certainly appreciated the generous resolution to our problem and the concern of the duty manager that we were happy with our hotel. The Montcalm’s well appointed rooms and excellent location first drew us to this hotel but perhaps more importantly, we feel very fortunate to have found a hotel that prioritises the well being of their guests.  Since our last visit there, the location for breakfast has changed from the Jugged Hare to the Chiswell St Dining Rooms.  The food is just as excellent and the staff just as caring but we found the ambience to be even more relaxed and pleasant. There is nowhere else we would rather stay when visiting London.",5,2017,04,09
128,Great if you are petite!!!,"This places oozes of classy English style, the common areas are stunning, the rooms well stocked up with anything and everything, a real 5 star hotel, no short cuts there. 

However, the room is small and the shower is claustrophobically tiny, to that degree that an adult can only squeeze in sideways to the shower entrance, that is bad design. On top of that, if you put the water in the shower ON too hot, you cannot change the water setting without actually being in the hot water itself, since the way it's designed the access is only under the actual shower, so, for example, I switched the shower on, the water was stifling hot, I got 5 seconds of burning hot water all over my body before I could turn it down, that is bad design and too tiny to maneuver.

Location wise, its great for a city business trip, less so for tourists. Other than that it was a wonderful experience, the food was also very good and they even gave me a complimentary top class breakfast. Staff very attentive at all times.",4,2017,04,09
128,Hotel stay,We had a fabulous stay at the hotel and this was our second time staying at the hotel. The staff are most helpful and friendly and made sure we had a comfortable stay at the hotel. Thanks to Alice and all staff of The Montcalm for taking care of all our needs. Would definitely stay again at this hotel on our next trip to London. We recommend this hotel to visitors to London. Gurdip. Malaysia,5,2017,04,09
128,The best hotel in London for service ,"My partner and I recently stayed at this wonderful hotel in central London.  Planning my visit before hand I contacted the manager Dorina who could not do enough for us.  Dorina is one of the most pleasant managers I have come across, nothing was too much trouble. 

As we were staying for our anniversary we were welcomed back with familiarity and a kindness that you would only associate with family.

The beautiful reception area is always a joy to revisit as are the spacious rooms.  Superbly clean, fantastic facilities and beautifully comfortable beds you will ensure you have the perfect stay.

Check-in and checkout was fast and pleasant and the delicious breakfast in the buffet area was enough to keep anyone going for a full day walking the streets of London.  

I cannot recommend this place enough, if you're looking for high class service, friendliness, and information should you need it, then the Montcalm at the Brewery London is for you.",5,2017,04,08
128,Wonderfully different,"With such great service it is hard not to like this hotel. The layout can be confusing as this is built around an on brewery but therein lies the charm- some of the features remain with the cobblestone courtyards and domed ceilings.

We loved it.

The staff were all friendly and pleasant and could not have been more helpful. The room on the 4th floor was comfortable with thoughtful attention to detail for comfort and convenience and all areas of the hotel that we used lived up to the high expectations set by the initial reception experience.

A most comfortable, enjoyable stay.",5,2017,04,08
128,"Nice Hotel, not first class","I had to reject the room they gave me, it was very spacious but extremely noisy and cold, with a huge - almost desert - bathroom..... The new room was smaller but ok. Strange service, most of the peapole are russian apparently, friendly but sometimes overfriendly and you don't get the feeling they care for you... Good midclass hotel, good location near Barbican.",3,2017,04,06
128,Second Visit... It won't be my last!,"I originally stayed at the Montcalm in November and had such a wonderful service that I was eager to return. I was lucky enough to need a room at the end of March and booked accordingly.
Alice the guest experience manager made the transaction easy and lovely.
I arrived at the hotel and the doorman immediately called me by name and welcomed me back!
The receptionist also called me by name, said it was wonderful to see me again and that she would let Alice know I had arrived! I felt like royalty.
I was fortunate to be staying in a Montcalm club room which was even better than my first visit. A huge luxury bed, every amenity that you could require, including robes, slippers, ironing board and iron, a mobile phone to use whilst in the City.
There was complimentary fruit, water, nespresso machine and a selection of teas as well as a fantastic well stocked mini bar.
The bathroom was wonderfull, with a monsoon shower, large bath tub and stocked with Hermes luxury toiletries. 
The room itself was a great size, with an office desk space, a separate table and two small armchairs and a wingback chair and footstool.
Even though the room was amazing, the staff were even better!  They welcome you like old friends and no request is too much trouble.
Again my bags were kept for me until later that evening as I had a full days engagement.
I also was lucky enough to dine in The Jugged Hare which was fantastic! The meal my daughter and I shared was sublime.

I know I will be returning to the hotel again, there is no where else I would rather stay when visiting London.

Thanks go out to all the team at the Hotel for their amazing welcome, service and warmth. I hope to see you all soon!

128,Anniversary night at a beautiful hotel,From the moment that my girlfriend and I arrived at the hotel we were greeted in an incredibly friendly and welcoming manner and we were made to feel very welcome. All of the staff were very courteus. We were offered a complimentary room upgrade which made us feel great. The hotel was beautiful and the room was incredible. It was beautifully decorated and when the check out time came we both really did not want to leave and wish we stayed for longer. The whole experience at the hotel from check in to check out was truly fantastic and will definitely be coming back to the Montcalm in the future.,5,2017,04,04
128,Good experience,"Stayed here on a Sunday night through work. Quick check in and out, professional and friendly staff. Room nice, clean and bed ultra comfy. Tesco Local almost opposite for any last minute buys, recommend Cote restaurant 1 min walk away, 5 mins walk from Barbican Tube. Would use again. ",4,2017,04,03
128,It's a maze,"I was full of expectation for my visit , but to be honest I have returned  from my stay  disappointed . Check in was very average .No real explanation of restaurant or amenities
It was a maze to get to my room  - guests should be issued with a gps to get to their rooms.
I found the bed comfortable but small.
It was great to see Elemis toiletries  and the bathroom was a good quality.
Breakfast was an average experience , but a good pot of tea .",3,2017,04,03
128,Weekend away,"My husband and I fancied a weekend away so we chose the Montcalm. The doors are opened for you as you arrive and you are escorted to reception. Fantastic service and nothing is too much trouble. The 1st room we went to was far to claustrophobic for us with a tiny window and very small bed. Reception soon took us to a different room which was amazing with a large window and lots of space. All our bags were moved/carried for us and the gentleman gave us a history of the hotel as we walked. Vladimir gave us some wonderful hints and tips for the city and supplied us with a map with directions drawn on for us (thanks for the help) The 2 Adrian's again were amazing with knowledge of both the city and hotel, and for making cups of tea to revive us after a long day of sight seeing!! I would go back in a heart beat.",5,2017,04,03
128,Lovely hotel in a great location,"My friend and I booked a girly weekend away and decided to stay here as it was close to Liverpool Street and tube stations and looked lovely on the website... we weren't disappointed and were really impressed with the staff, service and room. Our room was clean and the bed was comfy, the bathroom was spotless and modern with a waterfall shower. The staff were always happy to help and we were very happy with our stay. We cannot comment on the food as chose not to eat in the hotel. Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2017,04,03
128,Friendly hotel.,"A lavishly decorated reception with friendly welcoming staff. The building is a converted brewery so has interesting features. Our room was fine, comfortable bed and well stocked mini bar. We were upgraded to a club room. The hotel is very close to the Barbican and a 30 minute bus journey into central London. 
I would definitely visit again. ",5,2017,04,03
128,Great London Hotel,This is a terrific London hotel. Lots of charm and a great restaurant. Very reasonable priced and good location. Centrally located near the financial district. I will definitely be coming back. Within walking distance of St. James.,5,2017,04,02
128,Very convenient near the City,"The hotel is located closely to the City and to Barbican. The staff is very helpful and amazing, the rooms are very clean and convenient for a short or even long stay and are equipped. The restaurant/bar of the hotel is very rich and the food is tasty!",5,2017,04,02
128,Getting it Right,"We were traveling to London again for a birthday/valentines weekend and, taking advantage of a good accommodation deal we decided to give the Montcalm another chance.
When we got there we were again ushered into the very nice lobby and quickly checked in. As previously we had let them know before hand that it was a special weekend (my 'sorry for being away on valentines day' treat for the wife, plus it was my birthday), but this time they got it right. We were ushered into our very nice room (much easier to find this time) which was quite literally WOW (called the wow suite you see). A massive four poster bed, huge storage space and very impressive bathroom (great named smelly's which the wife was very impressed with). We quickly dumped our stuff and headed out. On our return was some nice chocolates and a bottle of champagne with a lovely note wishing us an enjoyable stay and happy birthday/valentines.
The room was only slightly noisy (because its a busy road next door and not due to unruly guests) and the bed was very comfortable (big four posters make you sleep like royalty anyway). the rest of the room was big enough to accommodate some serious shopping without getting cluttered.
The staff (as per the first time) were very helpful and friendly and as we were leaving we were met by Alice from the customer team who wanted to make sure that everything was good during our stay (it was, top marks and a great effort from the whole team!). 
This is the level of service I expect from a hotel of this standing and would certainly encourage me to stay in one of the Montcalm hotels again next time we are in London.",5,2017,04,01
128,Excellent Hotel,Stayed at the hotel last night with my sister for her 50th birthday.  What a fantastic experience! Staff were friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in. Nothing was too much trouble from booking in to being shown to our room personally and carrying our luggage.  We were shown around the room and given plenty of information about the hotel services and places to visit.  An extra surprise was the bottle of wine and birthday card for my sister when returned to our room in the evening.  Very special.  Had some expectations of a 5 star hotel but this experience exceeded expectation.  It was a wonderful stay with some wonderful staff who can't do enough for you.  This is why great customer service wins hands down every time... thanks to all the great staff at this lovely hotel for making our stay so memorable.  We will be recommending and returning :),5,2017,04,01
128,Great venue,"We attended a Christmas function and had a great time, the food was excellent and the entertainment great. 
We stayed in a standard double room which was very comfortable and spacious. 
A really good place to stay. ",4,2017,04,01
128,Unbelievable ,Incredibly polite and helpful staff. Was given a upgrade as it was our anniversary and came back to my room to find gifts (truffles and chianti) and a beautiful towel swan display. The location is perfect to get around with 2 stations 5 mins walk. Can't say enough about this place and would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in London. ,5,2017,04,01
128,Excellent service! ,"Beautiful hotel. Eccentric layout but the room was very nice. Their service is superb. Lots of extras that made travel easier. They have a""loaner"" cell phone in the room that they let us use. It allowed us to call home to the US and use Google maps while we were out and about. Always had coffee tea and biscuits in the lobby which is nice aftera long trip.  I will stay here again. ",5,2017,04,01
128,Montcalm at the Brewery 5 star experience . ,"We found the montcalm at the brewery to be an incredible place to stay while in London. We came in December 2016 and stayed for 14 nights, found the experience unforgettable.. so  when we came again in March 2017 and this hotel was the hotel of our choice, without a second thought..The rooms are fabulous, staff incredible, services second to non and accommodating.. Mr. Adeel, the club lounge manager needs a special mention.. he was real helpful when we needed anything done..
Keep up the great work, People of  MONTCALM.",5,2017,03,31
128,Apparently we stayed in the 'sister' hotel,"Ok so we were looking for a last minute break to London for New Years Eve. As you can imagine most places were fully booked or crazily priced. However this place popped up and even though a tad more pricey than i'd usually like to pay it was still a good price.
When we arrived we were told that actually we were staying at the sister hotel which was down the road but the room had been upgraded. Got offered a hot chocolate (very nice) while we waited for a taxi (provided by hotel).
So now at the sister hotel we were checked in and offered some small macaroons. Check-in was fast and we were shown to our room and also given a quick tour to all the different gadgets in the room. Under-floor heating in the bathroom, a smartphone with lots on, different lighting in the room and many other things. From the word go everyone was professional and polite and i feel nothing would have been a problem for the staff.
Also there is a small pool and hot tub which is very nice as well as a gym (although did not use this)
Possibly one of the best hotels i've ever stayed in and will always check to see if there is any offers on the next time we are London way.",5,2017,03,30
128,Luxury and comfort,"Spent a weekend here. Booked a club room on the second floor.
Check in was smooth and we were quickly taken to our room where we were given a quick tour on how to use all the facilities. Rooms are nice and large and the bed in comparison seems a bit small. Bathroom has a bath with overhead shower and Hermes products.
Nespresso machine for coffee and a ionisier which fills your room with fragrance automatically.
The hotel offers a complimentary mobile phone you can use during your stay for local and some national calls and internet browsing. Ideal for overseas travellers.
Though the room overlooks the main road we didn't have any noise issues even on a busy Monday morning.
The club lounge is on the 1st floor and as others have commented it really isn't as good as you expect from lounges. In fact it almost feels as a after thought.The serving area is quite small and the range of food in the evenings quite limited. The one redeeming thing was having Adil help us with sandwiches when the ones offered we weren't able to eat. His care and service was outstanding.
A continetal breakfast is served till 11.00 am in the lounge. The sitting area seems to have a corridor running through it with other guests going in and out.The hotel probably needs to re-think both the situation of the lounge and also the facilities it offers, seems to have lagged behind others we have visited.
We also asked for the bath butler service and there was a little confusion over this as the check in and guest relations staff didn't seem to know anything about this though its advertised on the website. Eventually this did get sorted and we enjoyed the service. Its probably making this request a little more in advance than we did to make sure it goes smoothly. Thanks to Milen for getting this sorted.
The location is great for the Barbican and surrounding area and its just a 8 minute walk from Liverpool St station.
In all a very nice stay and we would be happy to visit again.",5,2017,03,29
128,Not what I expected,"After reading all the reviews,I was excited for our overnight stay.Easy to find,five minutes away from Barbican tube station.I had booked two double rooms,there was a bit of confusion on checking as they could only find one room,but they soon sorted it out and upgraded us to club rooms,although reading lots of reviews,this isn't out the norm!
Normally when I've stayed in hotels,at check in,I've found normally,that your told where everything is etc,but no nothing!! Our rooms although lovely,were a bit tired in places.Club lounge,we found was on the first floor with hot and cold drinks!!
Breakfast was chaotic and the worst one I've had in a hotel,not a lot of choice and they kept running out of things,milk,butter,etc!! On a positive note though all staff were friendly,a big well done to the guys on concierge,all so friendly and polite.Maybe I expected to much after reading all the great reviews,but I would not stay again.",3,2017,03,28
128,Luxurious hotel,"I stayed here for 1 night during a business trip. The hotel is nicely decorated and the room has all the necessary amenities. Two remarks: the room is quite small (ok for London standard, but not for the price) and that is that you can get lost in the hotel. The hotel has different hallways and at the beginning it is quite a challenge to find your room. Luckily the staff is very helpful!",4,2017,03,27
128,Excellent!,"Excellent stay, we were upgraded as it was my wife's 40th Birthday.
Staff were very attentative and helpful.
They were very warming and made our stay more homely.
Will recommend to anyone and will stay again if the opportunity arises.",5,2017,03,27
128,Whistle-stop tour of City!,"An absolute gem of a find for us, as we were attending Guildhall School's Open Day.  The location then, was the reason I booked the Montcalm at the Brewery.  This is a fab hotel!  The staff were extremely attentive from beginning to end of our stay; wished we could have stayed longer!  Lovely bedroom, loved the Club Lounge experience.  Will definitely revisit.  Thank you!",5,2017,03,27
128,Magnificent ,"For reasons of a function we chose to stay at this hotel and we definitely made a good choice. Check in was a smooth process where we received an upgrade to a club room. 
As we arrived fairly late we decided dinner from room service would be a good idea and again we didn't regret it. The waiters delivering the food were first class as was the food. Breakfast the next morning was equally as good. From first contact at check in until check out every person we dealt with was terrific. Highly recommend this hotel and would return. Thank you to all of the staff for being so professional and friendly and making our stay so great. ",5,2017,03,26
128,Wonderful hotel,"We have just spent the weekend at the Montcalm at the Brewery and would highly recommend it. The staff are wonderfully attentive, and genuinely seem to be interested in you as a guest ! The little details in the room are really thoughtful, i.e. a umbrella in the wardrobe for the unpredictable British weather ! We arrived early on the Saturday and although check in is not till 2pm the room was already available, so we were able to unpack and head off out . We stayed in the suite which although it may not be huge is lovely, could do with a slightly bigger duvet on the bed ! The hotel is a bit quirky but this adds to it,s charm . As I said previously the staff are fantastic the level of customer service is wonderful from reception to room service. Could not rate higher ,",5,2017,03,26
128,"PLEASANT STAY, GOOD LOCATION AND GREAT STAFF.....","Extremely good location for us, being immediately adjacent to the Barbican, where we were attending a graduation ceremony.
Without doubt, the staff at this hotel are a credit to their organisation, everyone with whom we had contact were genuinely interested in ensuring our stay was pleasant.
However, the fixtures and fittings in the rooms did not even reach the standard of a Premier Inn, and require refurbishment, to come anywhere near to their star rating.",3,2017,03,26
128,Not good enough for its classification,"It's not a bad hotel but my  expectations for a 5* hotel were really bigger. The room was very small, hardly two people could stay there and noisy. It looked like a ""single"" room for working days used a ""double"" for tourists on weekends.

On the other hand, the facilities maintenance leave much to be desired. Putting to one side showiness, this hotel deserves hardly 4*.",3,2017,03,26
128,Fantastic hotel 5 star experience ,"I visited the hotel whilst on a work trip. Everything was perfect in terms of the checking in experience, pleasant staff, room was absolutely great with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in whilst staying in a hotel. Only little niggle was that due to the wifi being an open network across the hotel with no password it meant my laptop failed to connect to my work remote server due to the nature of my job the server only allows connections if the laptop is using a wifi network with password security. The hotel didn't have a solution which did mean I had to spend 3 days tethering my phone to my laptop to do some work in the evenings. Apart from that a fantastic hotel and I would definitely stay again!",4,2017,03,26
128,Delightful Experience,"Stayed in the Montcalm at the Brewery while on a short business trip to London.
My colleague and I arrived about 2 hours prior to the usual check in time. We had to go to a business meeting straight away but we were allowed to check in early which was great. I came back from my meetings later that evening to find a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in my room, with a note attached from ""Alice"" at the Montcalm, welcoming me (by name - nice touch) to the Montcalm and telling me if I had needed any assistance, to contact her. I thought this was such a nice touch and it really made my experience at the Montcalm a special one. The room was well decorated, the beds comfortable and a good selection of channels on widescreen television too. Also, the staff at the check in/check out desk were very friendly and welcoming. The concierge also made sure to give us an umbrella when we needed to leave the building when it was raining. They could not have done any more for us. I will definitely be back for my next business trip to London next month. Thank you again for a delightful experience. Diana",5,2017,03,25
128,Very Nice Hotel in a Good Location,"Stayed on Business in February - Very nice excellent staff,room and alocation -  price was very good for London and this standard of Hotel - Hey you can pay £200.00 for the Premier Inn at Kings Cross....why bother when the tube fare based on 2 stops is £2.20...save yourself £30.00 a night. Handy places to eat, Tesco Express across the room if you need anything .....as we say ""Bang on Hotel"".....

Would I stay again - Yep .
Would I Pay more than £200.00 per night - NO.

Check all the normal places for a rate as it varies...

But you will have a great time.",5,2017,03,24
128,Very pleasant service ,"The quirkiest hotel layout ever in the old brewery. Very nice reception staff. Room was well equipped as was bathroom but shower could have been better, though lovely Hermes shower gel and teams etc.
Excellent location within city.
I would use again.",4,2017,03,24
128,"Unique, classy and classic hotel in great location",Travelled to this hotel multiple times for work. A unique hotel with winding corridors and lovely room set ups. As a boutique hotel the rooms are unique and not overly large but more than enough space to suit. The facilities are great in the rooms and if you get a top floor room you even have the feeling of being in the loft with loft style windows etc. A great location and the brewery makes it so unique. Friendly staff and the pub downstairs means you get great food service too.,5,2017,03,24
128,Exquisite experience,Hotel is very elegant. One of a kind hotel. A bit pricey but you can get good deals online. The room was small but classy. Only issue I found is some rooms are too far and its like a maze. Always check the signs for direction of you room you might get lost LOL. Staff are very polite and friendly.,4,2017,03,22
128,"Modern,Clean,Classy Hotel","I had the pleasure of staying in The Montcalm at the Brewery London City in late November 2016. I treated my wife for a birthday surprise. I had read a number of reviews for the hotel leading up to my trip and I couldn't quite make up my mind was I doing the right thing. My fears were allayed as soon as we arrived. The building itself is quite beautiful and the welcome was outstanding. The hotel is really up market and the hotel staff can not do enough for you. They were aware a surprise Birthday present for my wife and we were given a few welcoming gifts :) 

The room we got was part of the main hotel and its the most modern room I have ever stayed in...two door to get in meaning that extra bit of privacy...they had a complementary mobile phone we could use for the weekend, you could flick a switch to indicate privacy and you would not be disturbed. The room itself was big, the bathroom oh so modern and big size bath, the minibar as prices go was relatively cheap and overall the room was spacious and quiet even though our room over looked the street. The bed was queen size and quite high :)  

The area itself is very much a business district so by Saturday the streets were empty which was nice. What we quickly realized was that this hotel basically own Chiswell Street :) There is a cool bar at the top of the corner as you walk out to your left and down to the left a nice restaurant which appears to join on to the hotel. We choose not to eat here as we had reservations elsewhere for our stay but it looked nice if a little quiet. The tube is around a 5 min walk. We walked to London bridge on the Saturday morning which took around 20-25 min, it was a beautiful morning for a walk. There is a mini tesco 2 mins walk if you fancy some room supplies :) There are loads of nice restaurants and  bars a short distance away.

I can certainly say when I come back to London in 2017 I will stay here, the area is quiet on weekends which was not a problem for us, the hotel staff are a credit to their profession and the overall feel of this modern hotel made are stay a most memorable one.",5,2017,03,22
128,Amazing experience !!,I stayed here with my boyfriend and good friends. We had the most amazing time and were treated really well by all the lovely staff at this hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a weekend in the city or a business trip. The extra touches especially made the experience. We were celebrating birthdays / engagements and were given balloons and wine and an upgrade which we really appreciated. The bathroom was stunning and the service could not be beaten. Thanks to all the staff that made this trip special. We will be booking again shortly ! Many thanks. ,5,2017,03,20
128,Beautiful Hotel,I have recent stayed at the Montcalm as i was attending a wedding there.  I stayed 2 nights it was lovely the staff could not have been anymore helpful nothing was to much trouble.  The room was outstanding and the bathroom was amazing lol the hotel lived up to its 5 stars,5,2017,03,20
128,A beautifully converted space,"It was only a flying visit, so didn't have time to explore what the hotel had to offer, but I'd be back in a heartbeat! Very attentive hosts (staff), a real pleasure to stay. A good location, with parking close by. An easy walk (or public transport) to plenty of other pubs/bars/restaurants, what more could you want?",5,2017,03,20
128,Average because of some basic problems,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights on weekend and were very excited about our visit here. Everything was good except that -

- Friday night : our room had lots of noise from traffic below at night so I couldn't sleep properly. Complained next morning to front desk. They apologized and moved us to another 'quiet room'. 

- Saturday night : next morning, the fire alarm went off around 6:30 AM waking up everyone on our new floor. Front desk confirmed that this was a false fire alarm (thank god for it but it really freaked us out when it went off).

- beds in both rooms were too soft, resulting in some back pains. My wife and I have preference for hard beds but this could be an issue only for us though haven't faced in other hotels. 

To be fair, location of the hotel is simply awesome but would be good if the management can fix the above. 

Thanks",3,2017,03,20
128,fab weekend,"Booked online for a great price and was better than expected. Lovely staff and good atmosphere in the pub below. Great weekend, will be going back.  upgraded as a birthday treat and the club rooms are spacious for London.",5,2017,03,19
128,Great hotel,"My partner and I recently visited this fabulous hotel again.  We have stayed at this hotel many times and it never fails to deliver. Can't wait to return! 

Visited the club Lounge for drinks and breakfast, as always high quality service.  Great location if you are having a night out in London or just fancy a stay in London in a beautiful hotel.",5,2017,03,18
128,Fantastic stay,"Stayed on 17th March (St Patrick's Day) Although check in was perhaps a little slow. From that point onwards we had a super time. The staff are exemplary and a special mention for Grazia who went out of her way to make our stay extremely special. Room was fabulous, clean well set out and the bed was as good as it gets. I would be very suspicious of people who downgrade this hotel as it is by far and away one of the best we have stayed in for a long while and we will be returning again sooner rather than later.",5,2017,03,18
128,5* wedding party stay,"We stayed at this hotel the night before and night of my wedding (held at the Barbican Centre) as did many of my family and friends. We cannot give our experience a high enough rating and this is primarily due to the incredible service, care and attention that we received by all of the staff that we came into contact with. From check-in to check-out, staff went out of their way to make our stay unforgettable. Special thanks to the front of house staff who arranged a car to take me the 3 minutes around the corner to the Barbican Centre to save me from walking in the drizzle and rain in my wedding dress! On both days we had breakfast in the room which was fresh and delicious (and plentiful!). I really hope the staff (there are too many to mention by name) get the recognition they deserve - it really was 5* service throughout. Thank you Montcalm at the Brewery for such an amazing stay. Kate & Alex (24th - 25th February 2017)",5,2017,03,17
128,Very comfortable night.,"I stayed here for a night a couple of weeks ago whilst down visiting family.  It's a short walk from the tube, and very easy to get to from City airport.  The staff here are all very friendly and helpful.  I had a very quiet room overlooking the courtyard with the comfiest bed I've slept in for a long time!  I really appreciated all the lovely extra touches in the room... fresh fruit, still and sparkling water, nice smelly toiletries and a quirky electric aroma diffuser.  And also a super ionic hairdryer, slippers and fluffy robe.  It also had some sort of free mobile phone to use during your stay although I didn't need it (handy though if visiting from overseas).  In fact everything needed for a luxurious night.  I will definitely book this again next time I'm in London.",5,2017,03,16
128,Fantastic atmosphere,Booked this hotel for its location to st Paul's cathedral as we wanted to try the first dates restaurant. The hotel is near the tube. 2 great pubs near by and a 10 min walk to st Paul's. Very posh with a warm welcome. We had a club room which meant free breakfast and club bar serving snacks and cold drinks and tea and coffee all day. Alcohol from 1730-1930. This was a bonus. The staff are fantastic and friendly. Will definitely go back.,5,2017,03,14
128,A vast improvement on the last stay.....all because of the wonderful Alice :),"I had a bad experience at this hotel a few months ago and Alice promptly responded to my TA feedback and really did follow through with me.  She was very focused on my experience and wanted to ensure this would not detract from a repeat visit.

I stayed again after Christmas and Alice really did go out of her way to make everything perfect.  She met us at check-in, escorted us to a fantastic room and even had a surprise bottle of bubbles waiting for us.

We were tired after a long day and chose to relax in the room with room service and, I have to say, the room service burger was one of the best!  We also had a drink in the lounge and the staff were pleasant and friendly.

Breakfast was lovely, again staff were efficient and friendly but we had an odd experience in the lounge after breakfast that Alice was straight on to and reassured me on departure that it was resolved.

All in all I am glad we gave this place a second chance and we will definitely return.  

Alice is the real star of the place, the hotel is very lucky to have her!",4,2017,03,14
128,One of best hotels in London,"A brief overnight stay but long enough to gauge the quality of rooms, staff and facilities. Not the most central location but more than makes up for that in every other respect. Coffee machine, internet enabled device and Hermes toiletries all ticked the box.",5,2017,03,13
128,Awesome Hotel,"Stayed at The Montcalm this weekend with my husband and friends. Absolutely fabulous hotel, with great staff.
We arrived just after lunch to a very busy reception. Concierge and hotel staff were great and dealt with everyone with a professional, friendly manner. As our room was not ready, as check in time is 1400. We were able to leave our bags. We also had access to the Club Lounge, this was a great addition to our stay. We were able to relax in there and enjoy a hot or cold beverage and snacks. We went out to see a bit of London. On arrival again to the hotel, we collected our key card and found our luggage to be in the room. This is such a great touch. Our room was modern, clean and we also had chocolates in the room again another nice touch. I honestly could not fault a thing with The Montcalm, will definitely be staying here again.
Thank you to you and your staff for making our stay a great one.",5,2017,03,13
128,Very nice hotel and attentive staff,"Just returned from a 2 night stay with my boyfriend. I had booked the hotel as a 30th birthday treat, the staff found out and he had balloons brought to the room along with chocolates and a hand written birthday note which was a lovely touch.

We got a room upgrade to club room on arrival which was a lovely and unexpected surprise. That does lead me to a slight negative though, had we got a standard room I think I would have been very disappointed. The club room was a decent size but not 'big' so I imagine standard rooms are fairly small. The room was by no means a let down but I feel like the hotel is a 5* but the rooms are a 4*. Just little attention to detail was missing for me, like a broken curtain rail coming away from the wall and the queen size bed was actually 2 singles pushed together. That said, the rest of the room was well presented and well equipped with coffee machine, mini bar, iron and board, hairdryer, tv, complimentary fruit and water, even an umbrella to use on your travels which I thought was a nice touch. 

The rest of the hotel is definitely 5*, the entrance is beautiful and you feel like you're stepping into luxury. All the staff have a smile for you and after our first night we were exchanging pleasantries and having a little joke with the doorman, just nice touches that make you feel more comfortable. Concierge and reception were also friendly, helpful and efficient. 

We spent much of our time sightseeing so don't have anything else to report on for the hotel. Would I return? Unfortunately it's out of our 'normal' price range but for a special treat, definitely.  ",4,2017,03,12
128,Quiet & Friendly Hotel,"This hotel was selected by the business group that I was traveling with.  First impressions with staff were great - the doorman greeting us as well as the front desk staff were all super friendly.  I had arrived early (before check-in time) but the front desk managed to accommodate an early check-in, which I was not expecting.  During check-in, they will ask you about breakfast plans (whether you plan to dine with them).  I could not understand clearly what they were asking but got the impression that you must tell them up front of your breakfast plans, because if you change your mind later, it could add cost.  It was super confusing.  I'm there for 4 days and my plans may change; I shouldn't need to tell them if I want breakfast up front.  And I shouldn't get charged double if I decide later to have breakfast at the hotel.  In summary, the breakfast options were confusing to say the least.

Aside from that, the rest of my stay was enjoyable.  The converted brewery means that the hotel is a bit of a maze and it could be confusing to some.  However, signage is very clear.  The public areas are all very well maintained and the staff you pass in halls always say hello with a smile.

The rooms are very nice.  The beds are super comfortable and the bathrooms are nice.  There are a ton of light switches and you'll find that it will take some time to figure out which switches do what, but there is definitely not a shortage of light to fit your needs.

The hotel location is super convenient.  I was able to fly in and take the Tube to the Barbican stop, which meant only about 2 blocks of walking with baggage.  I also found plenty of places to grab food and drink nearby.  For tourists, it's a short walk to a number of great spots (which I took advantage of).",5,2017,03,12
128,Excellent service,"Friendly and helpful staff, beautiful building with an ideal central location. 

The first room we were in (room 12) was very noisy with some fan machinery right outside the room. 

When we alerted the front desk, they were very quick in arranging for us to move rooms and even gave us an upgrade which was very kind. 

Felt very well looked after and would stay again. 

Avoid room 12 however!",5,2017,03,10
128,A bit special ,"Great location, lovely friendly staff and the whole ambience makes it feel a bit special. Good room size and lovely big bed.
Only negative is a horrid smell coming from somewhere when you use the exit door from the lift, Putrid in fact. I should've complained at the time but I could be chosen to use another exit door. 
Really happy overall though and would use again ",4,2017,03,10
128,"Oh dear, again!","I've stayed here frequently previously but poor service at check in and check out (constant trainees) and some basic service errors led me to other hotels. Stayed here this week again, sadly the same issues remain. A premium hotel, but with poor service. Those with a manager in their job title have yet to demonstrate they understand the obligations that come with this title!",2,2017,03,08
128,Location location location! High Quality service and property,"Everything about this hotel is perfect. My only two reluctant sadnesses were the internet connectivity was intermittent at best, and they don't actually brew beer there anymore :).

The staff were excellent! Couldn't ask for more helpful staff. Very informative and willing to assist with any request. Fontina, at the front desk, wore a patient smile throughout checking me in despite my credit card company denying authorization at first due to being outside the U.S., but was at the ready to completing my check-in after a quick phone call to my card company. In my opinion, you can't choose a better overall hotel centrally located near the Barbican and Liverpool station.",4,2017,03,08
128,Wonderful Family weekend Stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm on a Saturday evening whilst celebrating a family birthday, we booked 3 Club rooms which were lovely, clean, good shower, comfortable beds and nice quality Hermes complimentary bathroom products. we did benefit from the use of the Club lounge on arrival for a coffee and snack, then again after 5.30 pm we went in for a glass of wine before we went out for our evening meal and again in the morning we enjoyed the continental breakfast. the staff both on reception and in the club lounge were very helpful and very good with the children. 

The location of the hotel is in the city so a few of the closest restaurants are closed at weekends, however we did have a drink in the attached Jugged Hare pub/restaurant which was nice.

Overall a highly recommended hotel",5,2017,03,07
128,"Amazing stay, maravilloso","The best of the hotel (above all) is the staff that works in there, up to the category. Very attentive and smiling!
Good situation in London city (in 15 minutes using the underground, you can reach any spot in London) and the cleaning of the rooms fantastic and any time of the day.",5,2017,03,07
128,Big Birthday cekebrstions,"I arrived on 3rd March with a work colleague. I had booked a Club Room for 3 nights.
The location was ideal, the concierge/reception area was understated opulence .
The staff went out of their way to ensure my stay was special .
A bottle of Prosecco  on ice was already in the room along with fresh fruit and water .
My family arrived the following day and they too found their Club Rooms comfortable.
The Club Lounge was worth the extra and I can't compliment the attentive staff enough .
The hotel is run with precision and professionalism although it still manages to retain an air of personalisation.
I will most certainly return .",5,2017,03,06
128,Very solid business choice in heart of City of London,"Refreshing hotel option in the City with good location close to Moorgate tube station as well as some of the other main points of interest in the City. Would probably regard it more as a business choice but for that purpose, it certainly ticks most of the boxes. Nice and well appointed rooms (although not very spacious) with a great mix between modern and historical design. You can still see some of the original details of the old brewery, also if you look outside on to the courtyard. One of the few downsides is that the hotel is a bit of a maze so you may get lost. However, receptionist will surely help you to find your way. Also nice casual restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel with decent food albeit staff could be slightly more attentive. All in all, certainly recommendable!",4,2017,03,06
128,Amazing stay! Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Arrived at the Montcalm hotel on Friday 3rd march 2017 for a one night stay. From the moment we arrived it was very welcoming, the doorman, Concierge, hotel reception staff were all fantastic. The hotel is beautiful and the room was amazing. We were shown to our room and got a bit of history about the building and area which was excellent. Nothing was to much trouble and staff were always on hand. It was so clean and well prepared. I had asked the hotel to spell out surprise on the bed in the flower petals that are on there and it was done so so well ! The rooms are a great size and equipped with everything you need, the bed was the comfiest and biggest we have stayed in! Amazing hotel and definitely deserves the 5 stars.

128,"Exceptional Stay! Very welcoming, a nice change on a business trip!","Stayed four wonderful nights on a business-mixed-with-pleasure trip.  
On arrival the charming, bowler-hatted front door staff made for a friendly and impressive welcome. They could not have been more efficient or helpful as I arrived with a few suitcases and bags, in need of assistance – and they swooped in to my rescue.  Check-in was quick and efficient, and soon I was in my Club Room, which allows access to a Club Lounge where in the evening there is a nice selection of canapés and wine to choose from, set in a relaxing atmosphere.
The bedroom itself was spacious, comfortable and quiet.  The amenities were plentiful, from a large, complimentary fruit basket, a surprise bottle of wine and a welcome note from the manager … to the in-room coffee maker, room scent machine, speedy and complimentary wi-fi, and nightly turn-down service.  
Breakfast was delicious with fruits, granola, yoghurt, pastries and other starters to choose from, as well as a Full English Breakfast buffet.  The cappuccino was perfectly made - I had quite a few to sample from!
I stayed in one day, working at the desk, and enjoyed a quickly delivered and tasty room service lunch.  Housekeeping was efficient and thorough, and thoughtful working around me the day I stayed in.
The Montcalm at the Brewery is perfect for a business trip to The City, with easy proximity to the business and banking area as well as The Barbican and a nearby tube station.  I use Uber frequently and found cars to be within 5 minutes at each request; taxis were also easy to catch.
All in all, this is a wonderful hotel and I hope to return many times in the future!",5,2017,03,03
128,Amazing! ,"I had the best time here for my anniversary, Cagri the events manager is fantastic and I haven't received customer service like that in a long time! She even treated us to a room upgrade to the WOW suite. What a brilliant stay I look forward to booking again soon!

Thank you Cagri!",5,2017,03,03
128,Truly exceptional hospitality,"Truly exceptional hospitality. The staff is friendly, capable and efficient. A warm thanks to all the staff of the concierge Mrs.Grazia and especially to Mrs. Fontina.
The rooms are quiet and comfortable and the restaurant offers a good choice for breakfast",5,2017,03,02
128,Excellent hotel,"I stay in London regularly for work and this place is the first place I check for availability. Great location, rooms and service and competitively priced. The bar / restaurant next door, the Jugged Hare, is also worth a visit as it has a great atmosphere and the food is really good.",5,2017,03,02
128,One saturday night at Montcalm ,"In fiew words: totally in love with it! 
Beauty and kindness! 5 stars at the Italian receptionist (called Valentina, if I'm not wrong). The room was wonderful and the service was great! Also, kindest staff ever! Room service's food so good! One of the best romantic well-being night of my life! 
I hope to return at Montcalm one day! ❤️",5,2017,02,28
128,4* but not 5*,"This is a solid 4* hotel, but I wouldn't say it is 5*. Online I've seen it advertised as a 5* which I think is slightly misleading. It's a very good base to explore London and for business, but the luxury you would expect from a 5* hotel isn't there. The room we had was small, and the view was non existent. In fact, it was of another building which was very close to the window. The room did feel slightly catastrophic. The bed was comfortable and overall stay was pleasant and value for money. You can get some good deals to stay here, but I wouldn't pay full price. Prefer Montcalm Tech City. ",4,2017,02,28
128,"Pleasant stay, although wouldn't call it a 5*","I stayed at The Montcalm for a total of two nights in January 2017 for an event that was taking place at the adjacent venue The Brewery. The hotel from the outside looks absolutely beautiful and the foyer is also impressive with the feature fountain wall and luxurious décor. I was very excited to stay at the hotel as it was advertised as 5*, so was expecting great things. The first thing that struck me was the strange way in which the bell-boy lead us to my fourth floor room. I had to take a lift in the main reception to the first floor and then walk to the West Wing and then take a second lift to the fourth floor, then walk down some stairs. It was very strange. Upon arrival to the room I did think it was a very nice space at first. I was given a “Club Room” which was lovely, clean and modern with a huge and incredibly comfortable bed. Robes, pillows and towels were provided along with luxury toiletries and complimentary teas and coffees. The colour scheme was not to my taste – a lot of lime green – but that is personal opinion. One thing I did notice was there were a few practical issues with the room itself. The room was poorly lit which gave a pleasant ambience, but not good for getting ready/putting on your makeup! Also the bathroom had such a huge sink that there was hardly any space to place your toiletries. Also my particular bath’s glass screen only opened inwards and not outwards meaning I had to get into the bath to turn the bath on. I think it was style over substance there. Another thing I noticed was that the room lacked sufficient plug sockets – had to dry my hair on top of the mini bar cabinet as there wasn’t a plug near the wall mirror!  Also the room I was in was situated next to an outside vent which meant that I found it difficult to get to sleep – something a few other guests I knew staying at the hotel also complained of. 

Breakfast was included in my stay which was a bit hit and miss to be honest. My first experience of breakfast was pleasant – there was a lot of variety from fruit, cereals, pastries and an English Breakfast buffet. The English Breakfast was a nice and the bacon was particularly tasty.  My second visit to the restaurant was a vastly difference experience. Because of the event that had taken place at The Brewery next door there was an influx of guests staying at The Montcalm. I felt that the staff weren’t really prepared for the amount of guests having their breakfast and whilst I was greeted by a member of staff on my first breakfast trip, there was no one to be seen upon my second trip. I waited around for a bit but then decided to seat myself as I had been waiting quite a while. I managed to find a table – although by sheer luck as I could see there was others loitering around waiting for a free table, but I was quicker! When going up and getting my breakfast there was a very long queue for the cooked English Breakfast buffet. By the time I had got to the front of the queue a staff member had luckily just re-filled some of the options but honestly I thought it was no way near as pleasant as the breakfast I had the day before. My main concern was the slop that was advertised as scrambled eggs -grey and watery. Whilst I chose not to opt for the eggs I overheard a woman on the table next to me inform her husband she had complained about the state of the eggs and asked them to make a fresh batch. I didn’t wait around to see how the next batch of eggs faired, but the English Breakfast was nothing more than adequate on my second visit. I think that is simply down to being unprepared for so many guests on a Monday morning. 

Overall I had a pleasant stay at The Montcalm at The Brewery. However for the various reasons stated above I would not class this as a 5* hotel. Perhaps a low to mid-range 4*. The breakfast was a real let down and the room I stayed in was such a maze to get to and lacked important things such as adequate lighting or well-placed plug sockets, and was right next to a very noisy vent. I guess it’s the luck of the draw really – if I had gotten a better room and stayed on a weekday perhaps my experience would have been different, but seeing as this is a 5* hotel I would have expected the best regardless.",3,2017,02,28
128,Amazing hotel,"What a fantastic hotel, from the staff the food and decor. 
This weekend was our anniversary, from the moment we entered the hotel it felt special. Our room was beautiful and very big, on our first night we went to the club lounge for sandwiches, canapés and a few glasses of wine, when we returned to our room the staff had decorated it with rose petals and swans made from towel, we popped out for a meal and on return we had been left a bottle of wine and a beautiful note to say the hotel hoped we would enjoyed a wonderful weekend, thanks to them we did, would definitely go back, a truly little gem found there.
Thanks for a wonderful weekend.
Ms s baldwin",5,2017,02,27
128,Wonderful service and overall experience ,"We got married at the brewery and stayed at the Montcalm for the weekend.  Alice and her staff were helpful, accommodating, and friendly to all of our family and friends.  The rooms are clean and the hotel is well situated for day excursions around London. Highly recommended during a visit to London and good value for money considering the location.  Thank you for helping to make our wedding weekend wonderful!! ",5,2017,02,27
128,Another good stay,"Repeat trip tomorrow the Montcalm at the Brewery. Again a very pleasant stay, well maintained room with good facilities. Staff all professional & welcoming. 

Location on edge of city had good transport connections to most areas. 

",5,2017,02,27
128,Still continues to deliver,"Have stayed in this hotel several times since my last review and it still remains consistent. The hotel itself is nicely tucked away and even when it gets busy there is a still a level of calmness. Some of the rooms are noisier than others being road side but a set of earplugs tends to sort that out, great service at reception with accommodating staff and a massive call out to the Guest Relations team, Alice in particular, who always make a special effort to make your trip a special one, still my go to hotel!",5,2017,02,27
128,Nice Weekend in London ...See you soon!!!,"Great location, nice ambience and friendly staff! I stayed here with my boyfriend for two nights but definitely we will go back! Everything was perfect! The continental breakfast in the club lounge was superb. Thank you so much to the whole team but especially to Fontina and her smile. She was so patience with us. I definitely recommend this fantastic hotel to my friends",5,2017,02,27
128,"Splendour, splendid, sheer opulence!!!","From the moment we were met by the bowler hatted concierge to the time we left and bid ' farewell ' by the same concierge we were treated like royalty by the superb staff where nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is ideally situated and is about 5 minutes walk to the nearest tube. The building itself is steeped in history, the information folder in your room is easily the best I have ever read, packed with information which I recommend you read! We stayed in one of the club rooms, it was simply stunning! Quality wherever you looked, superbly appointed, just wonderful with high quality thread count on the bedding! We had a continental breakfast which you can now probably guess was of the highest quality. I'll finish off by saying that the staff at this hotel were easily THE most attentive I have ever come across, a fantastic advertisement for the hotel!!! Well done to all concerned!",5,2017,02,27
128,We'll be back,"My wife and I have just left the hotel after a 3 night stay. Everything was fantastic. We had a club room which was really spacious and had everything we needed. The room was turned down each night and chocolates left on the pillow.
The staff at the hotel are exceptional, always friendly and efficient.
The location of the hotel is a little on the quiet side, but this was perfect for us. It's a 5 mins walk to either Moorgate or Barbican tube stations.
Can't recommend this hotel highly enough. We will definitely stay again when we're next in London. ",5,2017,02,27
128,"Excellent service, comfortable rooms, nice extras","Stayed with a baby and the hotel was accommodating and very helpful.  Service was great and the rooms were very comfortable.  Only challenge is we couldn't get an early check in, but our room was ready right on time so cannot complain.",5,2017,02,27
128,"A beautiful hotel, quality from start 'til finish.","I stopped in the hotel with my partner on a Friday evening. We were welcomed by friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us, offering tea/coffee as soon as we stepped foot into the hotel. I was shown to the room by a friendly gentleman, it was a lengthy walk, granted I was the furthest room away on the floor (201), but was delighted to find a beautifully furnished, classy and elegant room. The room had everything you could need from a bedroom, coffee facilities, toiletries, bath robe, slippers, iron, refreshments, and I could go on. My only quibble would be it was very dark in the room due to the lack of natural lighting. 

The continental breakfast in the morning was lovely, and standard price for a London stay. The staff, as ever were great, very chatty, upbeat and happy to help.

I must say a big thank you to Fontina, she was so lovely and welcoming, and really made my partner and I's stay extremely enjoyable!

We hope to be back soon...

Cameron & Nathan.",5,2017,02,26
128,Weekend visit,"Gorgeous hotel and excellent price. We stayed fri til sun and the hotel is close to barbican and moorgate stations so it is easy to get around. The club room was quite small however it is clean tidy, plenty of water, fresh fruit and plenty in the minibar. The only gripe is that the tv had no signal however we did not mention this as we were out most of the time so didnt really matter too us. We declined the breakfast however we had a girgeous lunch in the jugged hare which is adjorning too the restaurant. ",5,2017,02,26
128,Great customer service!,"Went to London for the first time so this was my first hotel experience there. Have to say as soon as you walk in, the reception area is gorgeous. They staff was welcoming right away. Because the hotel layout is not that easy to follow, being that it was a former brewery, they had someone (Rumen from Concierge) escort us to our room and give us a brief (& very helpful) lesson on the ins and outs of the hotel and all the in-room amenities, etc. Rumen was awesome!! He was super helpful, friendly and knowledgeable not only about the hotel but also about London; gave us numerous tips to get around the city, places to eat and see. The room was great, had everything we needed plus complimentary water, fruit & coffee. We noticed we had a toilet that wouldn't flush, as soon as we called down to reception about it, they sent someone up right away and it was fixed promptly! 

The day I arrived it was my birthday, once Rumen realized this, he arranged a surprise for me! When I got back to the hotel after dinner there was a bottle of wine, chocolate truffles and a nice card from the staff wishing me a happy birthday - I was so grateful and appreciative! So sweet of them to do that for me made my birthday even more special. 

Last night there, ordered room service and the room service attendant, Daniel, was super accommodating. The delivery was timely, efficient and he was very considerate. 

Although the location of this hotel is in the financial district so there were a few places closed within walking distance during the weekend, I would totally recommend this hotel during any time of year because it is super convenient to the Underground (2 min walk to 2 stations) also about a 15 min cab ride to most other parts of the city like Soho and Shoreditch. 

Would def stay here again! You would not regret it!",5,2017,02,26
128,Moved room... twice,"First of all, the reception and the room were stunning. We particularly liked the ""waterwall"" on our way in.
However, after coming back late, the sound coming from the TV in the neighbouring room was unbearable! I rung reception, and ended up speaking to the manager (Gregory) - an extremely friendly chap who wanted to confront the noisy neighbours. I declined with the thought that it would just be awkward for all parties concerned. Instead, we moved room to their sister hotel (Montcalm Royal London House) just down the road. They even paid for a taxi!
To cut a long story short, the new room was very similar to the old one but had AC that was on full blast and would not turn off, so we ended up moving rooms again.
Back to the hotel in point, the noise was not their fault, but their service and rectification more than made up for it, and that is the reason for the 5 stars .",5,2017,02,25
128,Wonderful experience ,"It was my third time staying at this amazing hotel and it will definitely not be the last! From the moment you walk into the hotel you feel welcomed by all. The staff are willing to go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is the best it can be. We asked if it was ok to have a room with a bath and within minutes the staff had sorted a new room out and ensured the rest of our stay was to our requirements.  The rooms are well equipped for an enjoyable and comfortable stay. The rooms are always exceptionally clean and well presented and the beds are unbelievably comfortable. 
I have also dined at The Jugged Hare which is located next door. This is definitely worth a visit, lovely food and amazing staff who go out of their way to create a unique dining experience.
",5,2017,02,25
128,Comfortable but too confined ,"The hotel lobby is beautiful in an old style; very English like.
The hotel itself is a maze, with different wings. Different sets of elevators, different exits. Very narrow corridors;
The rooms have small windows, it can be a little oppressing;
The breakfast in the room is very nice, 30 pounds (better be nice :))
Complementary fruits and water 

",4,2017,02,25
128,THE BEST PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON!,"It was our second visit to the Montcalm Hotel. And I have to say we've never felt so welcomed in our lives! The staff was exceptional!  Our room was so specious with the complimentary wine and chocolate on the Valentine's day. Concierge Vlad advised us some places to visit in London. We were very inspired by his guidance and loved the restaurants and museums he recommended! Manager Olesja  was the most professional and wonderful person, I've ever met. She arranged a room with a wonderful view and a king size bed for us, and for a very reasonable price!!! We also had a truly delicious breakfast in Chiswell Street Dining Rooms ( and it was included!). We felt very happy staying in this hotel. We felt like we were visiting old friends or a family. I RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO YOU WITH ALL MY HEART! And when we go back to London, we will be definitely staying here!",5,2017,02,24
128,Very pleasant stay,My husband and I stayed here for 1 night and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit thanks to the welcoming & helpful staff. We were fortunate to have a room upgrade & were also presented with a half bottle of wine in our room as a birthday treat! Would definitely recommend staying here.,5,2017,02,24
128,Stranded,"All trains were cancelled from Kings Cross so found The Montcalm on a website, as we had to stay another night.
Very reasonable price for London.

High standards and friendly efficient service.
The building, the old Whitbred brewery is a little disjointed and finding your room can be challenging but easy enough. 
However, this doesn't detract and I would definitely stay again as its half the price of a West End 5 star and has a calm modern feel within a historical building.",4,2017,02,23
128,5 star,"Really don't know where to start. From the minute we arrived until the minute we left the staff went above and beyond anything we have experienced before. We were shown to our room and everything about the hotel was explained on route. Its an old brewery so very unconventional lay out which only adds to its character. The rooms are very nice with more than is required to make your stay great. There's a very well stocked honesty bar,you don't get many of them these days. There's also complimentary items. If you get the chance book a club room as this offers a great selection of complimentary items such as breakfast all day snacks and early evening wine and canapés. This is about the 15th hotel we have stayed in around London and i can honestly say its been our best experience. Usually for us next time we visit London we all ready know where we will be staying. Top marks,thank you very much.",5,2017,02,23
128,Always a pleasure!,"It was our third time staying at this lovely hotel and it definitely will not be the last! The rooms are very well equipped for an enjoyable stay, the beds are so comfortable! I also have to mention the staff who make your stay that bit more special. We asked if it was OK to have a room with a bath and within 20 minutes our request was dealt with. They also followed up to ask if everything was to our requirements and if there was anything else they could do. Customer service always goes a long way and this adds to a wonderful experience. We also dined at The Jugged Hare next door which I have been to before and is definitely worth a visit, lovely food! ",5,2017,02,22
128,Luxury-feeling but poor service,"Fresh and nice looking, but they got the room service-order wrong twice and didn't handle it good. Otherwise, kind staff and clean rooms. Quite boring location though, mostly business buildings in the neighborhood.",3,2017,02,22
128,Not all that...,"Stayed here courtesy of a client so presumably they had a deal but just doesnt live up to its advertised price tag.
These sorts of 5*places drive me mad really with the fawning staff that in the end are no more use than me paying someone to follow me round and tell me how great i am at regular intervals. Admittedly the place is a bit of a warren but getting the 'boy' to take me to a room that i am quite capable of finding on my own thank you i basically find syptomatic of 'all mouth and no trousers' hotels.
Checked in very late due to working nearby and rather dissappointed to find the bar was shut. Room service however was available and brought me a very overproced bottle of wine to wind down after a long day. It would have been nice to flick on the tv and relax...but no...tv didnt work and a call to reception got a giggled response leaving me baffled. Seems some of my colleagues had the same response. Perhaps watching tv isnt oincluded in the 'deal'.
Comfortable enough until someone decided that 3 in the morning is the ideal time to empty the bottle bins.
Breakfast was a challenge in orienteering to find. An age to find some coffee and an apparent shortage of orange juice i can only attribute to a spanish harvest failure post brexit. Usual self service full english arrangement which always leaves me sad. I stayed in a pub last week that cooked the whole thing pretty well fresh to order in the time it took to get the coffee.
Come checkout i stood briefly at the desk to settle the roomservice bill before i was pounced on by some sort of duty manager type wanting to know if they could help me. I informed them that i was just settling my bill and would be off thank you. This then required them to hang off my shoulder through the whole process like they wanted my pin number. 
In short the whole experience was just irritating. If you are going to run a hotel of this type then you need to actually understand what service means and not treat customers like an idiot.",3,2017,02,22
128,Fab,We recently stayed to this hotel while in London it's very beautiful hotel rooms are very nicely done and very comfortable the bed especially was comfortable very clean and excellent customer service nothing was too much for them it is within walking distance of moor street tube very quiet area and a quiet hotel could not here people coming and going the staff are fabulous very friendly will definitely go back ,5,2017,02,22
128,Disappointed - could be so much better!,"Stayed here for a night on business. Overall impressions are as follows:
- staff generally very friendly and helpful as tends to be the case at all Montcalms
- strange set-up for a hotel. It's spread across a number of buildings on opposite sides of a busy main road. 
- my room (a suite apparently in an annex) was very small. Cleaning was good apart from two large hairs on the side of the bathtub and an old, partly washed-out stain on the bedcovers (looked like blood). By no means bad, but not really acceptable for a 5* venue. WiFi in the room was also very patchy. Otherwise, the room was good - comfy bed and a good night's sleep (after finally finding all of the light switches which took around 4 minutes!! Why not have one master switch?!), even on a busy road.
- check-out was fine but, why did I have to cross the road and go back into the main building to check-out reception when there's a member of staff with a computer terminal at the front of the outer buildings where I stayed? I had nothing to pay for so would it not be sensible to allow express check-out within each building?
I wanted to really like this hotel, and it is a good establishment, but when you consider it is 5*, there is a greater level of expectation and it's let down by lack of attention to detail. Try the Montcalm Royal London House around the corner instead.
Thanks.",3,2017,02,21
128,Montcalm Brewery London,"The Montcalm is  a very nice hotel located near the Barbican and Moorgate tube stations, in the heart of the city.  The staff was very accommodating and provided service with a smile.  Free coffee, tea and biscuits are provided in the lobby, and room service is available.  Their continental breakfast was very nice.
The hotel is a bit of a labyrinth.  There are many levels, bridges and elevators connecting the different buildings.  Our room was located several minutes away from the lobby and I must admit I got lost almost every time I attempted to get back there. The room itself was on the small side but had everything we needed.
 We attended a wedding in the Brewery and both the space and food were wonderful.
A special should-out to concierge Vlad for personally mailing a package for me on his day off.  That was much appreciated.
I would not hesitate to stay at the Montcalm again if I needed to be located in that part of the city.",4,2017,02,20
128,One night stay,"I spent a Sunday evening at the hotel ahead of a full day of business meetings in London the following day. The hotel is beautiful, with great service. I was upgraded when I checked in to a club room
which had an enormous queen sized bed in - I had the best nights sleep!  So having to give up part of my weekend to travel on a Sunday evening didn't feel quite as bad :). I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,02,20
128,AMAZING 5 STAR SERVICE!! PLEASE BOOK!!!,"A truly 5 star service, stayed for a belated valentines 2 night break for a second time in 2 years and again I am not disappointed! We had been welcomed with a bottle of sparkling waiting for us in our fantastic and clean room, beds are amazingly comfortable. The staff couldnt do more for you, the second night I became ill and the staff had been on hand to help in any way and can not thank Dorina, the Duty Manager and her staff enough, the night manager, sorry we didnt get his name, was genuinely worried and called in  the morning to make sure I was ok and offered a late check out to help. It really did me well to have a nap after breakfast. So thank you all to who helped me that evening, made my husbands night very easy knowing he had the night managers and the staff's support!
Daniella who we met at breakfast and then again for evening drinks on the first night couldnt be a happier and a wonderful person! I am not sure how the hotel employed so many wonderful people! But Thank You for the amazing and lovely weekend, can not fault the hotel in any way. 
Round the corner from the underground and very easy to get to from the Moorgate Station. Most restaurants are about 10-20 mins walk but the hotel has a lovely restaurant and a trendy pub next door. A lovely quiet area to get away from the busy streets of London with a cinema and the high street around the corner. A MUST STAY!",5,2017,02,20
128,Final night in London splurge!,"Stayed at the Montcalm February 2017, it was a nice treat for my final night in London. I normally go budget-end on hotels, because I only sleep in the room, and would rather save my funds for other activities. When I checked in I was upgraded at no additional cos to a larger room. A proper doorman greeted me, and the front desk were friendly and efficient. The hotel is a huge maze, and likely you will have to be escorted to your room to find it as I was. I don't think I could have repeated the journey without assistance, but fortunately, my room was close to a ""short cut"" pointed out to me by my escort (close to an elevator that takes you the the ground level where you immediately exit an unlocked fire exit door, which puts you back near the front entrance to the hotel). Room was splendid, lots of bells and whistles (safe, TV, mini-bar, heated bathroom floor and towel rack, free newspaper in the morning). My only concern was that, despite all the lights in the room, the room still remained fairly dim. I had a window, but any light coming in was extinguished by a tall building outside. Overall, a wonderful place that I would return to.",5,2017,02,20
128,Excellent stay,"Was good to stay in such an interesting old building but still have all the modern touches. 

The staff were great, checking in advance the reason for our stay (Valentines treat) and then leaving us chocolates, wine and towel swans for us to come in to. Nice to see that much trouble taken when we were there just one night.

We also ate at the Jugged Hare which was excellent - good food and service. Plus a top selection of beers including their own to go with the brewery theme.",5,2017,02,20
128,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed here one night, wished we could have stayed for more. From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated like royalty. Every member of staff was so friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable, tea/coffee making facilities. Bathroom with bath/shower and toiletries. Room was spotless, bed the most comfortable we've ever slept in. Would like to give a special mention to Grazia who was very friendly and helpful and made us feel so welcome. Also Daniela and Ililiana both looked after us during our pre evening drinks in the club lounge. Thanks.... We ate at the adjoining Jugged Hare which was reasonably priced and the food and service was good. Hope to stay here again soon.",5,2017,02,19
128,Fantastic Hotel and Amazing Staff,I have used this hotel over the last year on a regular basis and the location staff and environment are some of the best I have experienced in London. Nothing is ever too much trouble for any of the staff or management team. The Bedrooms are of a very high standard and the club lounge is an oasis of calm after a busy day in the city. I cannot recommend this hotel high enough.,5,2017,02,19
128,"Great location, lovely hotel","We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Really good value for London - we didn't have breakfast as that was quite pricey and there are so many places to eat nearby. Would recommend it.",5,2017,02,18
128,Birthday Celebrations ,"This is my favourite Hotel in London. From the time you enter the Hotel you are made to feel so welcome. The staff cannot do enough for you. We stayed this weekend for my 50th Birthday and I was made to feel very special and was certainly a WOW experience. I would like to thank all the staff and Hiral Bhanushali for making my birthday so memorable. You all never fail us. The rooms are lovely with all the essentials for a lovely stay. I would highly recommend this Hotel along with The Jugged Hare, a pub restaurant that adjoins the Hotel. Thanks again x",5,2017,02,18

128,Great place to stay in a lovely hotel,"This is a great place to stay in London, located near the Barbican/Moorgate with good secure park nearby (2min around the corner). This is park of the old Whitbread Brewery with some great history to see.
Our room was in the annexe across the road from the main reception and was a small ""suite"" with a microwave, kitchenette and fridge in a separate little room. 
Very comfortable and quite modern rooms with all the modcons. ",5,2017,02,18
128,A great place to stay,"It was my second stay, and the staff remembered my preferences and accommodated additional requests with courtesy. The facilities are excellent and the bed is one of the best ones I've slept in at a hotel! It is definitely my first choice for return trips to London.",5,2017,02,16
128,Nice and suberb service,"Great location; close to the Barbican centre, old London, and a short distance to Liverpool st. There is a really nice gastro pub next door; the jugged Hare. The hotel is friendly, helpful staff and a nice ambience. We really enjoyed our stay :-)",4,2017,02,15
128,"Lovely hotel, perfect location.","David and I enjoyed yet another visit at this lovely hotel. We were fortunate to have a complimentary upgrade, as usual as we have returned several times over the past few years. The staff are amazing, very helpful and accommodating. Some of the previous managers have left so our welcome was a little more formal than expected but with further visits, we are sure that will change.",5,2017,02,13
128,"Central, equipped, comfy","My girlfriend and I were in London for the night, and came across the Montcalm. Amazingly central and close to tube stations. We hoped it would be nice , and it was. The building from the outside was stunning, old stonework and ancient windows. The courtyard was very shoreditch. Cool, historic smart. Inside the hotel was a bit like a maze, but the room was lovely. Nice tv, a phone thing to surf the internet and book tickets on. Tea and coffee facilities and a mini bar. The bed was really comfy- and I slept like a baby. The bathroom was good. A great big bath - and some nice toiletries. 
Highly recommended! We shall return!!",5,2017,02,13
128,Fantastic Hotel in a Great Location,"Club Room was fab - loved the shower which was visible in the room. Fantastic old brewery building, great restaurants and bars. Bed was really really comfy. Perfect location for city and rest of London. Service fab. Free upgrade too.",5,2017,02,13
128,Everything a hotel should,My partner and I love staying at the Montcalm at the Brewery. It's the perfect choice if you expect nothing less than excellence. The front desk team are superb and extremely friendly. I always find all the staff helpful and nothing is ever a problem to them. I have stayed here a few times and the experience gets better each time I return. I highly recommend the Montcalm for any visitor to London.,5,2017,02,13
128,Superb,"Superb in every way. The staff where excellent, the rooms where excellent, & the whole hotel was unbelievably spotless. The rooms where very well equipped with everything catered for.The Jugged hare pub that is part of the hotel was also excellent the food was top notch. We went to the Barbican theatre on the Saturday night & this hotel is so well located to the venue.  Breakfast is so expensive £25 each. We left the hotel for breakfast & literally walked 100yds to the restaurant COTE & for £10 each full English with choice of juice & hot drink well worth the short walk & over a two night stay I saved £60 (spent it in the pub, happy days). We will be going back for sure.",5,2017,02,12
128,"Lovely hotel, amazing staff. ","Beautiful hotel. My partner booked a room for my birthday. Not only did we get a complementary room upgrade, when we arrived into our room we had champagne on ice and 2 boxes of truffles. I'd also noticed i had laddered my tights on my journey, I asked a member of staff called Gema if she knew the nearest place I could buy a pair, she asked for my room number and within minutes of being in our room she knocked with a pair of tights. Every single member of staff were extremely helpful. Room was a lovely size and very clean. Will definitely be returning. ",5,2017,02,12
128,A delightful five star hotel and a bargain ,"My wife and I stayed here just a year ago. We needed somewhere to stay on our way to Paris. This was the obvious choice, not just because it's close to the Eurostar station in London, but because it's now our favourite hotel in the city. It has all the luxury of a five star hotel, together with the special character granted by the fact that it's an exceptionally inventive restoration
of a beautiful older building. The service is all you'd expect in a hotel of this quality. The rooms are impeccably decorated. And, because it's in the very fashionable and very characterful East End rather than the tourist trap that is the West End, it's an amazing bargain. It's only a few minutes from all the major sites too. I can't think of a better place to stay if you're visiting London.  ",5,2017,02,12
128,Always good,"We returned at least 6 times in the last 12 months which speaks for itself. Good facilities, really nice pub attached for dinner or drinks. Great breakfast also served in the pub dining room.
Staff always helpful and a lovely upgrade for our visit at Christmas. Looking forward to our next visit",5,2017,02,11
128,Fabulous hotel with great service,"This is my favourite hotel in London, the staff are very good and nothing ever seems too much trouble. From check in to the guided tour to your room you are looked after very well. Service in the Club room the last time I visited was a bit chaotic but this time it was spot on and Velizar was superb. The location is great when in the City on business but also handy as a tourist too with the tube not far away. What an amazing building too. I feel lucky to be able to stay in such a fantastic hotel with great staff.

I look forward to returning again soon, thanks again to all the team.",5,2017,02,11
128,Extremely well managed,For the large number being catered for the meal was excellent. All the staff were attentive and overall we had a great evening. I would certainly recommend this venue to any company. The bar was reasonably well stocked and surprisingly for the number of people there was little waiting time to get served. Spot on,5,2017,02,10
128,"If you're staying in The City, there really is no other choice of hotel","I've been using this hotel since it opened, and due to work commitments have recently returned as a weekly guest.  There really is no other choice in this area.  The staff are amazing - I'll confess I'm not the easiest guest so if I'm delighted when I stay here it's high praise indeed!  Rooms are great.  Regular upgrades throughout the hotel and a fantastic noise policy whenever they hold a corporate event (you won't hear a thing when it's time to sleep).  A good bar and restaurant attached if you want it too.  
There's good reason why I return here and rate the staff so highly",5,2017,02,10
128,Interesting place in a good location,"Service and staff all first class. Breakfast was very good but we 4 ended up helping ourselves to  tea and coffee from the pots on the sideboard as staff too busy to go round. Also the tables are too small to have your own tea and coffee pots which is a shame. Ditto condiments. Ditto toast rack but it is a DIY toaster anyway. My hot water request resulted in a miniscule size cream jug arriving, so there was just room for that.
Bedrooms were really spacious and it is surprising that our double bed was not more generous- Queen size I would guess.",4,2017,02,08
128,Fantastic One Night Stay!,"My husband and I stayed here on Saturday 4th February for our anniversary and it was fantastic! 

The service was excellent, all the staff were friendly and couldn't have been more helpful.  

We stayed in a room which was in a separate building to the main hotel. Room was huge! Was very well equipped (comfortable bed, LG TV with lots of channels, lovely bathroom with Hermes toiletries) and the hotel had kindly left us a bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary. 

Location is ideal, good links into central as just round the corner from Barbican tube. We went out for dinner in Clerkenwell and then on to Farringdon and all were 5-10 minute taxi rides. If you drive, would highly recommend parking in the Barbican car park as it's just round the corner from the hotel and much cheaper than the NCP. 

Summary - beautifully decorated and excellent customer service. Can't wait to stay here again!",5,2017,02,07
128,Disappointing 5* hotel one night theatre stay,"We stayed for one night as a special treat to go to the theatre before my husband has a serious operation. We walked into a small reception area nothing too inviting to want you to sit and linger. The front desk staff were pleasant enough upon arrival altho the girl checking us in had badly red chipped nail varnish which didn't look very professional for a 5* hotel.  We would like to have been given some information about the hotel and what the hotel had to offer. It would have been helpful to be shown where the bars or comfortable club lounge were for example for a drink before we went out for the evening, this was not even mentioned! We felt that because we were only staying one night without breakfast the staff did not want to bother too much with us. The room was ok, all the lights were on as there was no natural light, the room only had one window which looked out to another block of rooms directly in front looking straight back at us. The room was very hot on arrival, a sealed unit window so couldn't open it for any fresh air.  It was a very noisy room ,we were on the first floor with the A\C units directly beneath the window going constantly all day and night! The room was small and clean had the usual overpriced mini bar. We certainly didn't feel special and welcome as Montcalm guests and that our experience was not an overall luxury 5* stay. We were very disappointed so we wont be staying here again.",4,2017,02,07
128,"Great location, staff very helpful",I was at an event in the Brewery so this was extremely convenient and the rate was not bad including breakfast. Wee bit of a walk from Barbican Tube and I was in a room that was a bit of down and up and roundabout to find it. Well appointed room though even if no natural light.,4,2017,02,06
128,Always a treat ! ,"This was our third visit to the Montcalm and probably the best stay we have had there. 
It was my boyfriend's birthday and we were spoiled ! For starters I got an email before our stay to ask what the reason for our stay and also the time we expected to arrive. They provided me with a telephone number whom I could communicate with via Whatsapp which made life so much easier.
When we arrived not only had they upgraded us to a suit, they had also prepared a beverage for us in the room and  even gone to the effort if writing a Birthday card. 
Room service was very quick and efficient. We ordered steak and chips although both were over cooked but still very tasty. 
The sauna and steam room are small but cosy. Little tip, it takes a good 10 mins for them to heat up so turn them and then go to the gym or back to your room instead of waiting in your swimming costume..
After an amazing nights sleep we decided we would treat ourselves to another night. All was sorted from the telephone in my room, they made me an offer to stay in the same suit at a cheaper rate. 
After a little issue where by we were asked to change rooms due to a bride wanting her mother to be in the room next door, we were moved into another beautiful suit and even though this was inconvenient when they offered us a free drink and free breakfast the next day we were satisfied with the move, without mention that the room was beautiful !

Overall we were very lucky with the rooms we were given and our treatment was great. The staff are lovely and helpful. And the location is perfect, 5 min walk to Barbican tube station, 10 mins walk to Liverpool street! 

We will definitely be coming back for round 4 !!!  Thank you again Montcalm, always a pleasure x",5,2017,02,06
128,Annual birthday trip.,"How nice it is to come on a holiday and to be treat like family! Since we first discovered the MATB (purely by chance) 4 or 5 years ago we have always stayed here when we come to London. You get what you pay for (and sometimes more). Now the MATB know we always come for the weekend for my birthday we always get an upgrade, we get cakes/chocolates, balloons. We get welcomed at check-in by the duty manager etc. First class hotel first class service. I hope circumstances allow us to keep on staying here in the future. (PS the truffles were gorgeous but I miss the little tins of mints! Lol!",5,2017,02,05
128,"First Class Hotel,In The Top Flight.","I treated myself to a single night here due to circumstances, and was not disappointed. So quiet, all fixtures and fittings are top quality, the staff are what make a hotel at this level and that is so true of the attentive and faultless team who run the hotel. A truly luxurious experience, has to be tried at least once in your life!",5,2017,02,02
128,A Favourite Hotel !!,"I have stayed here on numerous occasions, the most recent being a pre-Christmas shopping and theatre weekend.  One of my favourite hotels and it feels like coming home !!

The hotel has the highest standards but what sets it apart from other 5* hotels is the quality of the staff. From the front door right through reception and into the wider hotel, the staff excel at all their functions. Politeness is taken as a given in this class of hotel, but without exception the staff go the extra mile. 

Food was excellent, particularly breakfast ... we had one evening meal in the Jugged Hare (the pub attached to the hotel) which was good. I have seen the odd review elsewhere saying the bar service was not great ??? Really ? It was 5 days before Christmas when we went in and yes it was a bit hard to get drinks served ..... but go in any bar in London at that time of year and it will be packed with festive activities. Some reviewers need to get out more in a major city with festive party goers all around !!!!!!! Then they might understand how busy a London Pub can get 😀

I also love the Club Lounge - an oasis of calm after a hard day shopping. 

Not wishing to single any section out, but I have to on this occasion mention the Guest Experience Manager ..... superbly organised and a credit to the hotel. She provides the right balance of support and advice to make every trip here so special !!!",5,2017,02,01
128,Bit of Luxury for a special occcasion,"Treated my daughter to a Saturday night stay and it was fantastic. From we arrived we were very welcomed by friendly receptionists and the concierge team who showed us to our room. The room was amazing with luxurious bed, plenty of space and fantastic bathroom. Everything was perfect. We were provided with complimentary fruit and water, coffee machine and pods, iron and ironing board. The Montcalm is interesting as it was originally a brewery tastefully restored to an exceptional standard with lots of interesting pictures in the hallways telling it's history.  It was a perfect location for an fabulous evening meal in Shoreditch, only a short walk away. It is easy to get to by tube and is close to Moorgate station. We had a tasty breakfast to end a pleasant and relaxing stay. Highly recommended !!",5,2017,01,31
128,Excellent service standard,"Pleasant stay at the hotel last week. Impressed by the high service standard - the staff is terrifc, and everyone was polite and helpful.  Special recognition to Mr. Neil Peters who went extra miles to help.",5,2017,01,31
128,Overrated and overpriced,"During the week the location is good. Weekends most places nearby are closed. Most of the Staff is very friendly. Plenty of staff. The design is quite strange, a maze of ups and downs and halls to get to your room. Once in the room a lot of lights, some of which you have no control to turnoff other than removing the room key which turns off most lights. However there are still lights: coming from under door to hallway, along walls, on tv and ceiling. Constant AC/Heater on, so constant noise even though you turned off, again, you have no control. Would not stay again or recommend. Beds are small (double size). Breakfast over priced and sparse. Lunch was the best part. Dinner is good except late night as the staff wants to go home, you will be rushed.",2,2017,01,30
128,"40mins check in, hotels not paid for, issues all round at check in and health and safety issue in room not fixed","Booked 5 rooms, emailed reservations 3 times prior to visit no response at all.  Eventually updated over the phone.  Paid for all 5 rooms in advance, was embarrassment when arriving to find hotel had not taken payment.  After checking my bank account to confirm this I asked for my card to be put across all 5 rooms.  A manager came over to do this.  40 mins checking in time in total!  
Upon checking out all of my guests were demanded they make payment so I had to get out of bed to come down to reception to sort this out and go through the same scenario I did upon checking in again highly embarrassing and made it look like I was on the fiddle having collected the room fees from my guests in advance.
I had also reported the power socket in my room had a screw missing which I had noticed when plugging in my iphone charger and when I took this out all the live wires were showing and very dangerous.  Nobody came to fix this and was the same when I arrived back to my room at 12.30am.  I assume their maintenance teams only work 9-5pm!",2,2017,01,30
128,Amazing staff - Amazing room!,"Birthday weekend stay and all I can say is wow! The guest experience staff and the reception is just simply amazing at their job and really made the birthday weekend special. I hope the GM will recognise the staff and give them all a rise!! :)

The room was amazing - Montcalm club - and the breakfast (full english with a great continental selection too) at the Chiswell street restaurant was worth every penny! They even had almond milk!! Awesome... great stay all in all.",5,2017,01,29
128,Weekend in Lndon,"I thought having  visited London and staying previously around Westminster , Mayfair areas that I would try the Area around the Barbican . I chose the above hotel and was extremely pleased . I stayed in a deluxe room which had more lighting modes than I had experienced before, the bathroom was large and well equipped with beautiful Hermes toiletries . It was my partners birthday and he was welcomed by wine , chocolates and balloons . Everyone was polite and courteous I have no hesitation in revisiting this hotel which was in walking distance to everywhere . Loved the Jugged Hare pub great drinks a very buzzing place . Go visit the Barbican too which is practically next door very comfortable theatre and many other exhibitions to see .",5,2017,01,29
128,50th year,Stayed here for just one night. Good room super comfy bed and quality bathroom. Complimentary wine for Mrs B's birthday. Excellent check in and service from all hotel staff from concierge and bell boys to guest relations and bar staff. Good location for us extremely quiet rooms too.,5,2017,01,29
128,Luxurious stay,"I just stayed for a night but didn't want to leave. 

The hotel is beautifully decorated and very lavish. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

The room has all the amenities needed and more. Breakfast was divine. My only tip is to avoid a room near the pub which I was situated near - the light and noise filters through.",4,2017,01,27
128,"Good location, Amazing food, Excellent personnel","We stayed there twice already, because of excellent everything: staff, rooms, room services, club lounge, ground floor Brewery with perfect beer and exclusive high-end cuisine. The best thing is quietness, and of course closeness to the City of London.
We had our dinners ""downstairs"" at the Brewery and did not regret, as they different game, market fish and starters every night. You can always choose something else. Although, we recommend the ""Jugged Hare"".",5,2017,01,26
128,Overnight stay!,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a wonderful find! 

It was fairly priced and was much cheaper than some of the chain hotels around London. I wanted to find somewhere quite central and this was great!
The hotel itself is beautiful. The staff were so friendly and helpful, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The room was very spacious and clean and cannot be faulted. 
It's not too far from the Shoreditch high street (although we caught an uber), where there are some great places to eat and drink. The station is just a couple of minutes walk, although the hotel was a little tricky to find when we first arrived.  

I really could not find a fault with the hotel, we had a great weekend and the staff could not do enough for us.
I will definitely be returning here on my next visit to London!!",5,2017,01,24
128,"A really special hotel, love it.","Beautifully decorated, spacious rooms with really comfy beds and a choice of pillows. I sleep so well here and it's so quiet! Staff are very polite and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,01,23
128,Weekend Break in London,"Our son booked a night at the Montcalm  as a Christmas present for us, having already stayed there himself. From the minute you walk through the door the emphasis is on the guest and what the staff can do to make your stay perfect. Even in January a warm bright reception with equally warm staff. There are plenty of staff to meet your needs too. Free tea, coffee and biscuits are available and someone checked was it still warm and fresh and quickly made us fresh drinks.  we had arrived early so luggage was stored, maps given, we were shown to the rest rooms where we could freshen up. When we returned we were shown to our room where the luggage had already been taken. The room wasn't large but was very comfortable and quiet having everything you could need, including a free phone to make calls! there is also a turn-down service. We booked out around 9.00am the next day, again our luggage was stored and when we returned later to collect our cases we were again able to use the facilities, have coffee and relax before setting off for our train. Left with a smile on my face and would definitely return!",5,2017,01,23
128,A labyrinth of a hotel,"As the hotel is basically a refurbished brewery (hence the name) the labyrinth of corridors is very confusing and not always clearly marked. It took me two days to be able to find my room easily. 
The hotel is overall nice and quiet. The standard double room is a bit too small but fits a bed, which is very comfy. 
Also, the hotel offers a pre-paid mobile phone featuring international calls, maps etc. 
Among the disadvantages is the gym, which facilities are poor. Also, I am not sure if the hotel is good value for money. Although London properties are expensive by default.",4,2017,01,23
128,Exceptional Value and Service,"We had booked a room at the Moncalm for our joint birthday weekend away in London.

The service we received was exceptional. We were kindly given a free upgrade to a Club Room, free breakfast, and complimentary drinks and snacks early evening. Special mention to the kind lady on reception who took time to greet us at the start of our stay and meet us again on check-out.

The room was spacious and welcoming - especially loved the vaulted ceiling.

Would be very happy to return in the near future and recommend to friends and family.",5,2017,01,23
128,Great find for our weekend stay in London,"We can't recommend this hotel enough. On arriving at the hotel at 10:30, our room wasn't ready so we were upgraded to a room that was ready. We were only expecting to be able to drop our bags off and return to check in later! The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay and we will definitely be staying again. Thank you.",5,2017,01,22
128,A very tired room but good location.,"The location was great but unfortunately I  was let down by the small room size and tired furniture/finishing touches in the room. 
I paid over £160 for a 1 night stay on a Saturday evening at The Montcalm. The room was very small, and the furniture and windows were tired and worn. Whilst the location was great I personally expected paying a premium price would be in a room with first class facilities and furniture. Unfortunately, I felt let down by the quality of hotel room, if managers do view this, please view the photos and respond as I would be interested to know what your thoughts are.",1,2017,01,22
128,Mrs Pimblatt,We have just returned from a two night stay which to start with had its problems.  The room was small but on coming across a problem we spoke to Dorina who straight away moved us to a much better room with the wow factor.  English breakfast not great but continental was amazing.  The staff were really lovely and really could not do enough to help.  Based on customer service and the manner in which our problem was extremely efficiently dealt with by Dorina and its great location for nice restaurants and pubs would not hesitate to recommend them as nothing was too much trouble.  We will definitely return.  Thanks to Dorina and all the team the doorman concierges reception staff what a really lovely team ! ,5,2017,01,22
128,A hidden gem - especially for weekenders,"We needed to stay near The Barbican because we were attending a Saturday wedding and my husband booked this hotel, located in the buildings of a former brewery, just five minutes' walk away. Nothing was too much trouble. Free coffee in the foyer while we checked in (very welcome a we'd left home early). We were allowed into the room early to change at no extra charge. The room was spacious; comfortable bed, beautifully clean with a proper-sized bath, free robes and slippers, and a rainforest shower. Loved the Elemis toiletries, too! Because you're in the City of London there was no street noise and parking was cheap and easy at The Barbican underground. We booked the hotel breakfast which has an excellent choice (especially the granola and yoghurt) and the staff were really friendly and helpful. the room was equipped with everything you'd need; proper iron and board, excellent hairdryer, good mini-bar and tea and coffee for the morning. After being nickled and dimed in so many other hotels (esp in New York) it was an absolute pleasure to stay here and next time we need to stay up for the weekend, it's here we'll be going.",5,2017,01,22
128,fantastic hotel,"From the moment you arrive you're greeted  by friendly staff, which continued every time we  walked through reception.

We were there for 1 night as part of my  birthday celebrations.

When checking out the receptionist was making small talk and asked what the occasion was for staying. I advise it was my birthday and she enquired as to why we didn't say at the time of booking or checking in so they could give us a little something 

I advise it was fine and it weren't an issue, but she insisted on waiting so she could get me something.

It's little things like this that makes your hotel such a lovely place. And even though it was just a small token she didn't need to do it. Unfortunately I didn't take her name but we checked out today 22/01/17. It's staff like this you need working for you and would like to thank her again 

This is an old brewery which has been converted into a hotel which makes it quirky and adds to it'so character 

Moorgate tube station is less than 10 minutes walk which makes it easy accessible 

We absolutely loved our stay and can't wait to come back

We tend to stay in London and minimum of 2 weekends and month and like to try different hotels but would  be happy to stay here every time",5,2017,01,22
128,Plagued with problems,"Upon arrival, I was informed that they'd failed to take full payment during the booking process like they said they did, and I had to use the company credit card. I booked a double room but was downgraded, completely unannounced, to a single! A tiny closet-sized single with the small bed pressed up against a wall. It was a tiny room which was appalling for a hotel of this caliber. This room shouldn't exist, much less be given to a person who'd booked a double. The room was hard to find, and the hotel is a maze of labyrinthine half floors and nonsensical room numbering. The doorman who was supposed to show me couldn't even find it.

Finally complained to the front desk about all the issues, and they were very reticent about resolving the issues. I finally managed to negotiate for another room at their sister hotel since they supposedly didn't have any rooms left, but that was like pulling teeth. Don't be fooled by their faux luxury, they are anything but. Terrible service and management. 

NEVER AGAIN.",1,2017,01,18
128,Lovely relaxing experience in a great location - some room for improvement,"Stayed for two nights on a mini family break recently (2 + 1 baby). 
Good Points:
-The staff were very accommodating and provided a cot with cellular blankets which I found great as many hotels provide duvets only. 
-We were upgraded to a club room which was lovely and spacious. 
-The complimentary coffee and biscuits in the lobby was lovely - however nespresso would have been nicer!
-The free ""Handy"" phone for use in the room was a very nice touch - kettle was great - but would have loved a nespresso machine.
-Location excellent - close to city, st pauls, shoreditch, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted for the weekend - great restaurants and cinema close or more are in 10/15 min walk.
-Had a couple of drinks in the pub (Jugged Hare) underneath the hotel which was lovely and a great atmosphere on the friday night.

Bad Points: 
-The bathroom had a walk in shower but the sink was very badly designed - tiny and the tap leaked - overall a bad use of space in there and was frustrating
- Hermes products were nice but would have preferred English products. Also we were not given any body lotion on first night.
- No bathrobe and slippers for us!
- Waitress in the club lounge for breakfast was not in good form on both mornings and seemed very fed up with her job. Requests for coffee/more buffet were not met with a 5 star reaction!! She also spoke very loudly on her phone in another language whilst clearing tables. Service is the most important aspect of a 5 star hotel experience and this was more 2/3 star.

Overall I would stay again - or maybe try another Montcalm in London!",4,2017,01,18
128,"Great hotel, super staff, convenient to City Airport and old pubs","We've stayed twice now at the Brewery and really loved both times. The staff is friendly and professional, especially Vlad, the concierge, who arranged transportation and reservations for us on both stays. It was great seeing him on our return a year after the first stay. We like the Club rooms with access to food and drink and were upgraded on our 2nd stay, which is always a plus! The rooms are beautiful, with a blend of old and modern decors (but zero counter space in bathroom) and the building itself is an old treasure. Love the City location for early flights to the continent and also for finding some really old pubs in the area. We'll be back!",5,2017,01,17
128,good location,"I stayed here recently for 2 nights on a business trip. This hotel is a little different, it is built in an old brewery so you can get completely lost getting to your room, i got to know the place by the time i was leaving. 
Room was small but nice, really comfy bed and pillows,well done on the pillows. 
I just had the continental breakfast, simple but sufficient and nice.
Gym is very small, 4 machines, but at least there is one. 
Restaurant across the road under the cinema is pretty nice.
All in all good hotel and i will be back.",4,2017,01,17

128,Not a 'knockout' stay..,"I booked this hotel as my husband had stayed before and loved it, and as it was both our birthdays it seemed fitting to stay here. I booked in my name, but since I told them he was joining me (and about the reason for our visit) when my husband arrived first I didn't expect that they would refuse to check him in! He was meant to be meeting an important client nearby and wanted to drop his bag into the room but they caused such a fuss he was late. 🙁When they finally agreed to check him in, they wanted him to jump in a minibus and check in at the montcalm shoreditch as they were overbooked!! 😡Miraculously, they found us a room here, but tried to tell us they were upgrading us, only to find we were staying in a room the size of a rabbit hutch, with a run down bathroom and a three quarter bed. I really wish we'd taken the shoreditch option since we now know it is the modern, trendy little sister to this tired old dear. The only upside to this was the breakfast was as good as my husband remembered and the staff there were friendly and efficient. 🥓🍳.",2,2017,01,17
128,Great hospitality and a touch of class in a location full of history,"This is our second time at the Montcalm at the Brewery and we wil be returning. The hotel is really cool and the fact that it is a conversion rather than purpose built makes it really interesting.... mind you don't get lost walking the halls though ;-) It is thias aspect we love about it as well as the friendly staff, the great food and the re
asonable price",5,2017,01,16
128,Amazing!!,"This is a luxuriously quirky hotel in the heart of the City.  We were here for a friend's wedding and the venue was was perfect.  Guest relations were fantastic from check in to check out.  We got upgraded to a duplex suite which was beautiful, one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in.  Overall, there were plenty of little touches to give it the wow factor.  Thank you!! (Review submitted by Elissa)",5,2017,01,16
128,"Nice, Unique, Good Location, Character = Happy","We were staying at a hotel near the airport during a recent week long visit to London and decided we wanted something more centrally located.  We ended up at the Montcalm at the Brewery.

As the name implies, this hotel is an old brewery.  It has certainly been updated, but in preserving its Brewery pedigree it has some unique challenges.  To get to some rooms, there is a walkway across a courtyard.  And, for 4 rooms on the 3rd floor (ours was one of them) getting there requires going up stairs, getting an elevator to one floor, getting off that elevator and getting on another, and eventually getting to the rooms.  I felt like I needed to leave bread crumbs to find my way back to the lobby.  Seriously.

Although this might sound like a complaint, it isn't.  I like quirky, different, unique places that aren't simply glass floors stacked on one another.  If that's what you're looking for, then you'll be disappointed.  This has.....character.

I've read other reviewers complain about the price but we felt that the rate was good, especially compared with other hotels (we stayed during the week between Xmas and New Years and have no complaints)..  There are several good places to eat nearby.  It's convenient to transportation, or within walking distance of places we wanted to see.  The front desk staff was great, the gentleman who showed us to our room was great, and the overall ""vibe"" was cool.  

The room was small - again, not a complaint just an observation - but we didn't do anything there except sleep so it was fine. 

All in all, it made for a very enjoyable stay.",4,2017,01,15
128,Very comfortable hotel,"The hotel is really comfortable, rooms are big for London standards. Mine had space on both sides of the bed and a good working table + an armrest chair with a small fruits table.
The lighting is quite tricky to understand seems to be 6+ buttons and somehow there is always a light on.
The curtains infront of the window play a big role in keeping the room warm, if you open the curtains there will be a strong cold draught.",4,2017,01,15
128,Pure joy,"Everything you could wish for in a hotel. Great location, lovely staff and good value for money. There are robes in the bathroom chocolates on your pillow and the mattress is really comfortable ensuring a good nights sleep.",5,2017,01,14
128,Not good enough,"Check in was efficient and the staff very welcoming and friendly. I was shown to my room and was given instructions on how the coat-hangers work but not where the bathroom was. A little weird. 

I stayed at club level but unfortunately my room wasn't great. Paper thin walls, windows that you couldn't close and a member of staff who's job it must have been to patrol the corridors on an evening kept jumping down the steps at regular intervals to wake me. 

The bathroom was nice but freezing, my window couldn't fully close. The bath and shower controls were broken so I had to fill the tub with the waterfall shower which wasn't ideal.

The continental breakfast was terrible, they ran out of cups and plates before I got there so I ate some fruit salad off a tea saucer. I got there at 07:30 with no staff in sight and a poor choice of food. Not good enough and possibly the worst experience I've had at breakfast.

I was only here for a night so I wasn't too fussed about complaining and moving rooms, but if I returned I would expect a better experience. ",3,2017,01,14
128,Excellent stay,"This hotel is in an excellent location for the Barbican and the City.  The room was great and the staff were friendly.  The Duty Manager, Dorina, took the time to make sure I was completely satisfied with my stay.  I will definitely go back and would recommend it.",5,2017,01,14
128,A splendid weekend,"A smart hotel in the old Whitbread brewery in Chiswell Street. I can imagine this being popular with guests in the City during the week. At the weekend the hotel is far more relaxed. One stand out experience at this hotel is the level of service the staff offer you. Lots of friendly, helpful smiling faces and nothing appears to be too much trouble. My wife was celebrating her birthday and following a minor problem in our original room, Vlad arranged an upgrade to a Montcalm Club room, thanks to Marcelo for the complimentary fizz and chocolates as well. The small touches made the weekend.  The club rooms are spacious for a city hoteland the bathroom and toiletries are of a very high standard. Breakfast can be taken in one of the club rooms or the restaurant on the ground floor, and was very good. We had drinks in the Jugged Hare and this bar had a friendly buzz about the place. If you are looking for somewhere close to the West End you are out on a limb a little here, but the underground is close and it is about £10.00 in a cab to Covent Garden.",4,2017,01,14
128,"Amazing hotel, great location, lovely staff","We are having a great time at the Montcalm at the Brewery, I genuinely can't speak too highly of this amazing hotel - we don't even check out until tomorrow but couldn't wait to write a review.

All the staff have been absolutely amazing (special mention for Gregory the night manager) who have all gone over and above what would be expected, in order to make our stay very special.

Everything about this hotel is amazing, great décor, everything is very clean, the staff are all very friendly and attentive, and the hotel has a great location being situated in the middle of the finance district, right in the centre of London - it's perfect for either a business trip or tourists wanting to visit the sights of London.

The Club rooms are well worth it, as they come with access to the club lounge which provides complimentary continental breakfast, and through the day complimentary canapés, snacks and drinks (including alcohol).

This is our new favourite hotel, and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,01,14
128,An average experience,"If you have a business meeting near the City (Moorgate is the nearest Underground stop), this is certainly well placed. We were at an event at ""The Brewery"" itself, which is adjacent to the hotel.

The Deluxe rooms are small & quite cramped for two (the Club Rooms are better), but it was clean and the style modern contemporary. The staff seemed somewhat disorganised as we checked in, and it's certainly a rabbit warren as you attempt to negotiate a path to your room. 

It was ok, no more.",3,2017,01,13
128,Mixed experience,"I chose this hotel based on price (I found a good price on kayak.com) and location. When I arrived early in the morning from a red-eye flight, my room was not ready yet. I waited in the breakfast room until the room was ready. The service there was prompt and I enjoyed reading the paper and watching the news while I waited for my room.

When I got to the room - anxious to take a short nap - I discovered that the bed sheets had not been washed. I immediately notified the front desk. After waiting an hour for them to call me back, I called again and was told to wait. It seems the people I spoke to initially were doing nothing about the problem. I finally spoke to Charlie at the front desk and he immediately rectified the situation. He promptly got me a new room and apologized for the problem.

The room itself was small (not surprising for London) but comfortable. The best part of this hotel is the complementary mobile phone you have access to with maps and other helpful tourist apps. This is a feature I hope other hotels will replicate.",3,2017,01,12
128,Excellent stay,Vlad Jefanovs was a huge help to us.  He mapped out where to go and where to eat.  He recommended Poppy's for best Fish and Chips and it was.  Night manager Gene was also a big help.  When we left he had a box lunch for us.  Excellent stay and wonderful employees.,5,2017,01,11
128,Comfortable Business Visit,"I chose this hotel primarily based on it's excellent location whilst attending meetings in the Moorgate / Barbican area of the city and because it was very competitively priced.
i
The hotel was excellent value for money and whilst the room was not that large it was adequate, very comfortable  and fairly typical in size for a London hotel.

I would happily stay at this hotel and if I had to criticise it would be that the room was very warm and I struggled to control the temperature with the in room Aircon.  I also had a bit of trouble switching the TV off and ended up having to pull the plug out of the wall.

All very minor points and overall a great hotel!!",4,2017,01,10
128,Good quality hotel,"Well located hotel, the rooms are very clean and to a high end finish. 

Cote Brasserie cross the road for food and nice hotel pub for a drink. 

Unfortunately no gym on site otherwise would have given 5 stars. ",4,2017,01,09
128,"Very pleasant stay, one to do again someday!","When we arrived, we were greeted by very friendly staff. Who were very kind to guide us to our room and help us with our luggage. Because this hotel was not build to be a hotel (but a brewery of course) there were a lot of corridors and it was not very easy to find our room for the first time. This gives a special touch to the hotel. It was certainly not a disadvantage but it gave the hotel extra charm.

We received a complementary bottle of champagne, as we were there for our engagement. We were also invited in the club lounge for the continental breakfast instead of the English. The continental breakfast was fresh and tasty but a bit simple. 

Our room was clean, modern and the bed was amazing!
A lot of hotels do not have the best beds, but definitely not at The Montcalm at the Brewery.

Overall we had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel to everybody.",5,2017,01,09
128,Summer ball,"A really lovely hotel , very nicely decorated , great room , friendly staff
Parking nearby at the Barbican was not too expensive 
Very reasonable prices for the quality of Hotel
Would highly recommend and we will use again",5,2017,01,08
128,Girlfriend's Birthday! ,"We stayed here for 1 night for my girlfriend's birthday, and couldn't of asked for a better hotel. Would definitely book the Montcalm again! 10/10! All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Thanks very much to everyone at the Montcalm for the great stay! ",5,2017,01,08
128,On the whole not to bad - location service quality fine but could be better,"Location just north east of the city near to the Barbican - excellent transport links for travel in and around London - warm friendly attentive welcome and assistance to the guest room - Room rather small and felt like it should of been a single not a double, standard double bed, with en-suite shower/toilet - poor lighting for the small wardrobe area - room has everything you would need on business or leisure - there was complimentary fruit (one plum, one apple, one clementine and 1 bottle of water) that's why we felt like the room was a single room, coffee and tea tray ok but storage box wouldn't close, we have coffee on arrival and another one later in the day, but on our return to the hotel late at night - after turndown service no replenishment of tea/coffee tray in the room - a/c was good, ample plug for phones tablet etc. sleep quality was ok except as I said bed was like a bed for one person (small double) 4""6 with mattress topper on and so you felt like you were going to fall out of bed if you moved to the edge (Room 208S) not much space in the room for two people to move around - bathroom had underfloor heating which was great, shower took a little time to get hot, again guest amenities were one shampoo, one shower gel, one conditioner, two bars of soap, cleaning low and high levels dusty but generally clean all round, curtains main didn't close completely as to the right end of the room window facing there was a gap and so early morning light comes through, some basic maintenance issues in the bathroom decorative order wise damages tiles around the sink water dispenser, and on the wall between the sick unit and the toilet, also when we showered, the head of the shower sprayed a little water over the shower or it leaks between the shower partition. The room has everything a visitor would need and more but lacks space. Would recommend the hotel but ask for large room or twin as these generally offer more space",4,2017,01,08
128,Un,"North of St Paul, 3 bus stops on the 76, between Barbican and Moorgate tube stations, 300 meters, so every corner of London is at hand. Barbican Center with excellent programming in music, theater, cinemas at 300 m. Historic 18 Th century building formerly Withbread Brewery, a national monument, one of the spots were the Industrial Revolution began with James Watt engine. So it's a place of great character. Perfect staff, attentive and helpful. We had a Club Room, not the priciest, 18 square meters, very cosy and comfortable. Excellent bed. Electric switches system not easy to understand as the ""Don't Disturb"" electric command. Bathroom with large bath, multi option shower. Toilet in the bathroom which is not usual in a 5*. Minibar and huge flat screen TV, smartphone. Air conditioned quite noisy, we switched it off. Room perfectly calm. All impeccably cleaned two times a day, fresh fruits and chocolates offered. Excellent continental breakfast at the Lounge Club, a charming room with a splendid crystal chandelier. For English breakfast pace a few to the Jugged Hare, a lovely place too and an excellent game restaurant. The value of our stay was the best we could fine on Booking. What else?",4,2017,01,08
128,Christmas Over-nighters,"I stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions pre Christmas and can definitely recommend it. I really like its City location - modern and old London muddled together and away from the crowded West End. Plenty of sights are walkable, St Pauls, Museum of London, even the Southbank if you're up for a longer stroll across the River.  Also, right side of London for nights out at the Barbican, Angel Islington and Shoreditch. I stayed on a room-only basis so didn't use many of the hotel's facilities but on both occasions, my room was very comfortable and importantly, very quiet - great night's sleep! Check-in a bit frenetic on one occasion but the hotel was very busy pre-Christmas. Despite this, staff were friendly and helpful. Travelling solo, I felt very comfortable staying there.",5,2017,01,08
128,Amazing Hotel and Excellent Guest experience ,"We stayed here for my Husbands 50th birthday celebration. I booked through hotels.com and when it asked whether I had any special requirements I said it was a 50th celebration. The hotel took this on board and we received free breakfasts worth £25 each and they upgraded us to a suite. When we arrived back at the hotel after a night out they had written 50 on the  4 poster bed using rose petals and balloons on the bed. A card wishing a happy birthday a complimentary bottle of prosecco on ice and a box of chocs. They couldn't have made our stay more special. Thank you Montcalm for a memorable experience. The staff were friendly. The suite was spotless with everything you need. Slippers, robes, hairdryer, even a free mobile phone for your stay. ",5,2017,01,07
128,Great London hotel in a fantastic location,"We stayed for one night in late December, when meeting up with friends for a night out in London. This was our second short stay at this hotel and we were very impressed on both occasions. The staff were very friendly and helpful, despite the hotel being very busy for the Christmas season. There was a mix up and a short delay on check in, which was handled well, and as a result we received an upgrade and complimentary bottle of Prosecco. The room was very smart, clean and comfortable, with everything you could require for a short stay, including quality toiletries. The hotel's location is very convenient for taxis, the tube and a range of good restaurants and smart bars. We would certainly choose to stay here again.",4,2017,01,05
128,Excellent overnight stay,"Stayed overnight before meeting my daughter following a course at The Guildhall. Terrific accommodation and staff were attentive at all times, making my stay a very happy one. Look forward to an opportunity to return. Very reasonably priced as well.",5,2017,01,05
128,Christmas Break,"My girlfriend and I decided to stay at one of the Montcalm Hotels for the second year in a row and this time chose the hotel next to The Brewery. Yet again the service and accommodation was faultless and I couldn't rate our stay higher. As you'd expect the rooms were finished to a luxury standard boasting top quality bathing products and brands within the mini bar. 

The hotel is in a great location with easy access to restaurants and shopping in the St Paul's area and just a short journey from the West End. 

I can't wait for next year trip already.",5,2017,01,05
128,"Elegante, raffinato e super comfort!! Will make your London vacation perfect!! ","Second time to stay in this place, still have a great experience again, the service of the stuff, location, the breakfast, the elegant and comfortable room....make our London days perfect, will be back again definitely!!",5,2017,01,04
128,"Beautiful hotel, close to the City","The Montcalm offers a compelling mix of super-comfortable, spacious, stylish rooms, two excellent restaurants and the wonderful perk of a complimentary mobile phone with internet access and international voice calls. As a light sleeper, I particularly appreciated the blackout curtains. The location is great if you are doing business in the City of London; otherwise, it's a bit off-centre for most London attractions, and there is very little street life immediately by the hotel. Be prepared to walk a little to find a late-night meal. The gym is small and spartan, but functional. All in all, a great hotel, with an 'excellent' ranking earned for the free mobile phone.",5,2017,01,04
128,Amazing as always ,My third visit in 2016 and first visit in 2017. Spent 20 days in this hotel in 2016. Fantastic service fantastic experience! Strongly recommend. Future choice as always. Because it never let me down..,5,2017,01,04
128,Perfectly Accomodating,"After having a fairly bad airbnb experience, I finally made a move at 4 am and decided to just pay a little extra and book a hotel. I liked the aesthetic of The Montcalm at the Brewery, and noticed a pretty reasonable last minute deal. I gathered my things and trudged through the 30 degree (f) London air, tired and cold, until finally arriving at the hotel. I knew check in wasn't until 2 pm, but I was just simply hoping they'd be kind enough to allow me to leave my bag while I killed the morning hours. Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mehar behind the front desk. I briefly explained my early morning arrival, and he was so refreshingly understanding about it. He told me I could leave my bag, and then mentioned that he'll ask his manager if perhaps they could check me in at that exact moment (5 am). His manager Gregory appeared, and Mehar explained the situation. Gregory checked to see if there was an available room. In the meantime, us three briefly discussed various travel experiences and had a very warm conversation. It turned out there was indeed a room ready, and they got me in there which was massive in my effort to sleep and recharge. 

In my opinion, it doesn't matter how nice a hotel is if the people who work there act like corporate machines. Mehar and Gregory were just empathetic, kind humans who noticed I was in a bind and they did what lovely humans do, they helped me. I went in just hoping to leave my bag and ended up sleeping peacefully for hours. The hotel itself is wonderfully charming as well, upscale in a classic way. Couldn't recommend the experience enough. Thank you!",5,2017,01,03
128,2,"A really nice hotel. On arrival we were asked if it was a special occasion. My wife said it was her birthday. Grazia then enquired what drink would my wife prefer. Expecting a glass we ended up with a bottle. We were upgraded as well. Lovely room and a good location for our needs.  Ate at the Jugged Hare, very good. ",5,2017,01,03
128,Friendly hotel,"Well positioned a short walk from the Barbican tube station and converted from the lovely old stables of the old brewery. Room a bit on the small size and a limited amount of storage space. Could seriously do with somewhere to rest the suitcase, and surely one hook to hang your coat on wouldn't be difficult. But I protest too much perhaps. At least for what we paid over the new years celebrations, it was comfortable, friendly and very good value. We would certainly return.",4,2017,01,02
128,A hotel with lots of character.,"I booked this hotel for a one night stay because it was within easy reach of London Liverpool Street Station on foot. The hotel was a bit of a rambling maze, but that added greatly to its character. The staff were really friendly , and the place fully deserves its 5* rating. My room was lovely.........up on the fifth floor....spotlessly clean and well. appointed, very peaceful. If the price is right, I would use this hotel again. One small point for people with limited mobility.....it is a very old building and some floors have a few steps moving you from one wing of the building to another.",5,2017,01,02
128,Lovely friendly Hotel,We stayed at the Montcalm as a treat from my boss for our Christmas party and it was really lovely.   The staff are extremely courteous and the room (club room) was lovely with a huge comfy bed and fab toiletries in the bathroom.  The room was quiet.   The only issue we had was trying to turn off all the lights at bedtime and in the end had to take the card out of the slot to turn off everything and about 6am eventually found the switch!,4,2016,12,30
128,London Visit,"We stayed here for the 2nd time in November. Once again top class hotel with great service and friendly staff. 

Rooms were spacious and modern. Very clean as you should expect. 

Will definitely be staying again. ",5,2016,12,30
128,Great location but no late night bar,"I got a great deal on booking.com and was really pleased with the hotels location. In the heart of the city of London we were able to wander and explore. With easy access to the tube we were able to get around and so I would certainly recommend this hotel for shopping and exploring London.

It also has a great pub attached to it , very handy after a days exploring.

We didn't eat at the hotel but went out and then the disappointment was there was no late night bar on our return (11:30pm) . I should of checked before I booked but in a hotel of this class and one that is built in an old brewery building I would of expected a late night bar. 

If you get a deal then go for it but for standard rates I would shop around.",3,2016,12,30
128,The place to stay in the place to be,"In all those years I've visited London I rarely stayed in such a great hotel as the Montcalm is. Great staff, great rooms, wonderful breakfast and a great location. Within walking distance there are 3 tube station which can bring you in no time to other parts of this mesmerizing city. Until a next time!",4,2016,12,30
128,Amazing stay,"Just stayed at the Montcalm for 2 nights for some shopping and sight seeing with my partner.
Everything about the hotel/service was faultless:
- Got upgraded on arrival
- Wine, chocolates and balloons in our room as it was my birthday
- Smooth & helpful check in and concierge 
- Really cool old brewery building with a bit of culture instead of a usual sky scraper hotel
- Room was lovely & very clean - great facilities
- Breakfast in the Jugged Hare was the best hotel breakfast we have ever had (we've had hundreds)... The times are really good 6.30-10.30am and both days we got there just before 10.30am and it was still amazing choice and service!
- Great location - Liverpool Street walking distance & Barbican station on the same road

Thanks for a great stay - will be re-booking shortly! 
",5,2016,12,29
128,Xmas party location,"Our Xmas party was held at the Brewery so  Montcalm was a perfect location as it is at the same venue. This converted Brewery in the heart of London has been well done using a high specification. The glass partition between the bedroom and bath is interesting. When booking you get to choose your pillow style and room fragrance. The porter service is essential as this place is a labyrinth, my room was two separate lifts and a bridge away from reception and after an evening of drinking I was glad of some assistance from the staff to relocate my room.
The room included an iron and a well stocked mini bar. I did not have the breakfast. ",5,2016,12,29
128,Very Nice Business Hotel,"The hotel is located in the business district and not a touristy area, the neighborhood is very quiet on the weekend. It is located in the middle between Barbican and Moorgate underground station, around 5-10 minutes walk to either station. The service is great with really friendly and nice staffs.
The size of the room is not really big, just fair. But the room is very comfortable and nice as well as its bathroom. The breakfast is served at Jugged Hare, a pub with a very nice and tasty dishes. Would be very happy to come back and stay at this hotel.",5,2016,12,29
128,Really a 5* experience,"Stayed here for my 30th. It was great. The front of house was lovely, really quirky and unique. A porter in a top hat showed us directly to our room, which is a nice touch and one befitting the quailty of this hotel. 

The room was small, but its London. The bathroom was huge, a great size with walk in shower and more than enough room for 2. Or wheel chair accessable. 

I loved the building, it was old with thick walls and period windows. Around the back where all the original brewery building. Great location with only a 5 minute walk in either direction to great pubs and food.",5,2016,12,28
128,Strange Layout,"This is a strange hotel with breakfast served in an admittedly nice looking corner pub, rooms located across the road from the main reception and a general odd ambience that I can't quite put my finger on. Better for business travellers needing access to the City than for tourists looking for a holiday retreat.",3,2016,12,28
128,great charm and comfortable,"The setting is unusual as the rooms are in different buildings on Chiswell and the main lobby is in an old Brewery building.  I honestly didn't know what to expect and after a red-eye flight in I was not in the mood to be inconvenienced.  That said, i found the room very  comfortable albeit on the small side, but the amenities, staff, and charm of the locale made it a great stay.  I look forward to coming back.",5,2016,12,28
128,Business trip,"Its a really nice hotel. The staff are friendly and as they have 2 hotels with the same name the booking address was incorrect. The staff managed to move the booking to the one i was in which was helpful.

Food and facilities were good.",5,2016,12,28
128,Great stay,"From the moment we arrived at this hotel the staff could not do enough for us, when the lady on reception found out it was a special Christmas treat because I would be working away over the holidays, she gave us free breakfast and access to the club lounge which made our stay unforgettable...",5,2016,12,26
128,Good location with friendly staff,"This was nearly the last hotel I could find in this area of 
London in November. I turned up late but there was still plenty of staff on reception. I ate dinner in the pub next door which was also very good. The room was quite small but perfectly equipped.",4,2016,12,24
128,"Perfect hospitality, celebrating our engagement. We have booked our next stay!","We stayed at the montcalm brewery the previous weekend, celebrating our engagement party in London. The hospitality and guest services of this hotel is some of the best we have ever experienced. Upon check in, we were so kindly upgraded to a barbican suite, which had 2 floors, which was an amazing expeirence for us and perfect for my fiancee to get ready for our engagement party. Not only were the hotel thoughtful enough to do this, they also provided a bottle of champagne! It was extremely thoughtful and much appreciated. We would like to thank them for this kind gesture.

We were shown to our room by a member of staff who kindly carried our luggage. Our room was comfortable, we had 2 bathrooms with lovely toiletries Turn down service was beautiful, with lovely decorated towels and roses on our bed.. Our sleep was comfortable and the continental breakfast they provided had excellent quality salmon and pain au chocolats!

Thank you montcalm, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Your efforts to ensure the customer has a good experience as not gone unnoticed. This is exactly what we expect from a 5 star service and on par to some of the hotels we have stayed in dubai. We are coming back for new years eve and are looking forward to our stay.

Congratulations on a good job well done!",5,2016,12,22
128,Wonderful service and beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for a business trip to London City in December 2016. The location is wonderfully close to all the major banks and financial district as well as a very charming neighbourhood. The hotel is also near to the Tube station. 

The hotel building is an old brewery building turned into hotel rooms. The hotel is beautifully refurbished and charming with a club lounge and wellness centre. 

The hotel staff is excellent. I have stayed at some of the finest 5 star hotels and the staff at Montcalm at the Brewery is on the same level. They are incredibly helpful and responsive and seem to be around at all hours to take care of any possible request. 

I will definitely stay here on my upcoming trips in London whether for business or pleasure.",5,2016,12,22
128,Wedding Hotel,"The Montcalm at The Brewery London hosted myself, my husband and many other family and friends when we got married nearby on 17th December '16. The group booking system was absolutely fantastic. The staff could not do anything more to make us feel at home, welcome and special. They made our stay so smooth and checked all our guests in quickly and early in view of our ceremony time. The breakfast was delicious and our whole group was accommodated. I can't wait to stay again! Thank you all forever for the most fabulous weekend! 

Myself and my Bridesmaids got ready in the beautiful Wow Suite and the staff were fab, bringing up champagne glasses and helping carry all our bags! 

My husband and I are so very grateful, as are all of our guests. ",5,2016,12,21
128,First Class,Easy check in with good concierge service. Perfect room but it would have been nice to be able to open a window. Other than that no complaints. Will stay again if the need arises. Complimentary fruit and water along with good quality tea and coffee was a nice touch.,5,2016,12,21
128,One Night  - Two Happy People!,"The Montcalm London City at the Brewery is a very enjoyable hotel to stay at.  Sadly, our stay was all too brief (one night).

Whilst we were there, we found the staff to be attentive, and certainly made you feel welcomed and that your custom was valued – top marks to all concerned.  The nature of the building, and the fact that there are annexes all over, mean that, unless you are an orienteering champion, being shown to your room is essential!

The rooms, whilst small in comparison with some hotels, are reasonably well furnished, with a whole host of little touches that add to the overall experience.  Things like a complimentary mobile phone for use both in the room and whilst you are out, heated floor in the bathroom, floor level lighting, an ionizer/air freshener – we could go on.  Our only (small) gripe is that, in common with many places, there is never enough drawer space or shelf space, and the wardrobe is quite small.

When events are on at the Brewery itself, the hotel does get busy, and you may find yourself struggling for a table at breakfast, but a £5 tray charge is minimal in London, so I’d go for breakfast in your room.  The hotel bars are pubs either end of Chiswell Street.

Certainly worth a return visit from our point of view and we would recommend this place to anyone.",5,2016,12,21
128,Birthday treat ,Superb friendly hotel. Upgraded on arrival. Room very nice. Very well appointed. Comfy bed. Nice decor and bathroom. Quiet location. Pub very busy with Xmas revellers. Restaurants nearby. Will def stay again.,5,2016,12,20
128,Recommended for stays in the City,"I booked The Montcalm for the night of a staff Christmas party, as I would otherwise have been stranded in London due to the Southern Rail strike. Priorities were to get a room that was reasonably cheap and convenient for the restaurant, and The Montcalm fitted the bill admirably on both counts. As an added bonus, it turned out to rather good.

I had booked a single room bit was given a welcome upgrade to a double on arrival. The room was small, but cleverly designed and very modern.

The only downside was that the building is a bit of a maze, and it can be rather difficult to find your room again when you arrive back, slightly the worse for wear, after midnight.

I would definitely use The Montcalm again and recommend it to others wanting to stay near the City.",5,2016,12,20
128,Great value luxury ,"I stayed here for one night and was pleasantly surprised at the size of my room and huge bathroom - then I realised I'd been given a room with disabled access. Not a problem - it had all the things I needed including thick fluffy robes and slippers and plenty of good quality teabags. Unfortunately I overslept in the gorgeous comfy bed so didn't get the chance to sample the full English breakfast which was included in my rate, but the fruit, Greek yoghurt and granola were delicious. The only reason for the 4 stars is the slight inconvenience of walking down the road to the Jugged Hare (which reception staff need to learn to pronounce correctly to avoid confusion) for breakfast. A hotel this size could surely have a kitchen and breakfast room?",4,2016,12,20
128,One night stay for Christmas party,"I stayed at Montcalm at the Brewery as I knew about this place being next door to the Brewery event venue (and my company office is 10 minutes walk from the hotel nr Moorgate - very convenient for returning to work). Booked a double room, but the hotel was kind to provide me with a club double - first class facility with complimentary fruits, water, Nespresso pods, all kinds of plugin points, and bathroom (with two shower types) with Hermes toiletries. Decent bed, and very quiet in middle of the City of London (or right next to Guildhall School of Music & Drama). Wish I'd checked out what the breakfast or food would have been like as Jugged Hare is right next door. Anyway - had a lovely stay, very helpful and friendly staff, can't asked for more. Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,20
128,Great hotel ,"At last I gave found a comfortable good quality hotel in London that doesn't cost the earth. 
Check in was easy. Room was clean abd well equipped with quality products a good bath and shower. Bed was high but comfortable.  Room was quiet.
As this is in an old Brewery getting to the room was like a rabbit warren but thankfully there are signposts back to reception! 
Breakfast was in the pub attached to hotel and service and food was excellent. I will be going back for business and likely personal use.  Recommended. ",5,2016,12,20
128,Very good stay,Really friendly welcoming reception staff ( extremely pretty also according to Husband!) kindly gave us an upgrade especially for our anniversary treat- a mid week stop over in town - the complementary chocs and fizz was also most welcome. The room was a little small but beautifully equipped and quiet. All the little extras and quality bathroom products were also noted and much appreciated . Very highly recommended and will be sure to visit again - Thank you !,5,2016,12,19
128,Small but perfect room,"My room was small but gosh they had seemed to think of everything. Very comfortable, good coffee and free biscuits. The hotel itself is superbly sited for the city but has an old world charm. Very good",4,2016,12,18
128,One night stay for Christmas Party,"We stayed at the Montcalm for our work Christmas Party. Great service and excellent, friendly staff, especially Hiral who greeted us with a complimentary hot chocolate on arrival! Definitely recommend the whole team!",5,2016,12,17
128,Christmas Party,"Stayed as part of my company's Christmas Party . Staff were excellent it's a a lovely hotel . Only criticism with
Ian that the room was a little small but overall a fantastic experience and would recommend!!",5,2016,12,17
128,Good location but expensive ,"The Montcalm is located in Chiswell street close to the Barbican in the city and is a convenient business hotel.
The rooms are relatively small although well appointed whilst the bathrooms lack a separate shower.
The price seems to vary significantly depending on when you book. The same room can range from between £250 and £400 a night.
Some rooms suffer from noise coming from the Brewery function room that holds events at night.
Breakfast is excellent at The Jugged Hare pub adjacent to the hotel and evening meals and lunch are available at The Chiswell st dining room.
Staff at the hotel are friendly and attentive but there are better value hotels nearby.",3,2016,12,17
128,So nearly good......,"I had booked this hotel well in advance of our trip and asked for a good room as it was my wife's birthday. Little did I know that translated as put us in an ok room with a huge bathroom that had a sink the size of a shoe box and a mirror the other side of the room (it was designed to cater for wheelchair users). Knowing my wife normally packs a ton of beauty products and us being perfectly able bodied we asked to swap rooms. They then put is in a tiny room that was a bit tatty and had the smallest bathroom ever. We decided to settle as it was late and it had took them an hour to sort out the first swap (we had dinner booked). 
The hotel is VERY confusingly laid out and I don't think we got from our room to the lobby the same way twice (the signs don't help). On the plus side they did comp us a free breakfast for the inconvenience. The bed was incredibly comfortable but the pillows were some how too soft and too hard at the same time (after two nights I couldn't turn my head to the left).
The staff were very helpful and the lobby is cool so as I say so nearly good.....also got a massive discount on normal prices so shop around if you want to stay here.",3,2016,12,14
128,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed at the Montcalm for one night and will definitely stay again. The reception staff were very welcoming and we were shown to our room where we found complimentary fruit and bottle of water. The room was very comfortable and so was the bed. Upon returning from a show, the covers had been turned down and chocolates left on our pillows.  We had one very small issue with the toilet but a quick call to reception and this was resolved within seconds. Great service. We are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2016,12,14
128,Christmas treat at the Brewery,"The reception was busy when I arrived but I was  offered hot chocoate whilst I waited, what a lovely touch. We booked the secret stay rate, which was an excellent price for a 5* hotel in the run up to Christmas. 

The hotel was fully booked and they were going to move us to their sister hotel up the road. I'm sure it was just as lovely but we were keen to stay at the Brewery, as it is such an interesting building. We also wanted to be close to our function that was just down the road. Anyway the lovely Grazia upgraded us to a suite at the Brewery, she and all the staff could not have been more helpful.

Lovely split level room, with seating area and bathroom on the lower bit. Steep staircase to the bedroom area, so be careful. This probably isn't the best room for older guests. The bathroom has a window, so you can see in and out when you are showering. Don't worry there is a blind that comes down. I eventually found the button which controls it by the side of the toilet. 

We had the free continental breakfast which was pleasant enough, smoked salmon, ham, cheese, pastries, cereals, toast etc. I also had room service which was very nice and came very quickly.

I would be very happy to stay here again, could not fault it ...apart from maybe the many stairs and corridors which were a bit confusing, Bit hey it's an old quirky building, that's part of its charm.",5,2016,12,13
128,Excellent hotel in City of London,"If you can live with a little distance to the epicenter of London, this is a splendid hotel for a weekend stay. The tube is a few minutes Wall away. 

Interior is very nice. Club room was spacy, quiet and very nice. Service was excellent. We arrived early, but got our room immediately - and was even upgraded. Prices are very reasonable for weekends compared to the high standard and the prices closer to Covent Garden etc. ",5,2016,12,13
128,Wedding anniversary ,"We chose The Montcalm at the Brewery for our wedding anniversary and its location close to Liverpool St Station and Moorgate tube station which were ideal. 
We were contacted by the hotel a week before our stay suggesting to use their whatsapp service to make it a more personal service and were not disappointed. When we mentioned we were staying for our anniversary they replied they would make it a special and memorable stay for us, they certainly did! 
All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to an incredible two story suite with 2 bathrooms, a complementary bottle of Chianti, a bottle of sparkling wine and chocolates! When we got back to our room after our night out we were amazed to find some towel swans and rose petals on the bed! 
The personal service extended to our check out when we were personally met by the lovely Grazia, the guest experience host to check everything was ok. 
So overall, an amazing, memorable stay and anniversary (as we were promised!). 
Many thanks to all the staff, especially Grazia. ",5,2016,12,12
128,Good Night Sleep,"Had a room on the 4th floor in the South Wing which was a bit a walk from reception.

Arrived late after a works function the room was lovely quite. 
Some hotels you can here noises from around 6 - 7 am  but not here so had a great sleep.",5,2016,12,12
128,Mr Paul Rutherford ,We stayed at this hotel on the house 10th of December and what a fantastic place it is to. Booked in early treated excellent by the staff and room was amazing so definitely be using this quality hotel again thanks for the stay. ,4,2016,12,11
128,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel looks beautiful and the location is great for the city.  Bear in mind that at the weekend the city closes.  We had a modern room in the suites which are across the road from the main hotel.  I cannot fault the suites, other than they felt a little bit out of the way-that being said, if that is what you desire then this hotel can accommodate you perfectly!!  The hotel is extremely well priced for the location and amenities it offers.
The Jugged Hare is the pub attached to the hotel and it is atmospheric and the adjacent dining rooms are lovely, we will be back and hope to see you there!!",4,2016,12,10
128,Good location near Moorgate ,"Stayed here to go to a ball.
Problems at check in as they couldn't find booking confirmation , had to wait in queue to check out too 😯
Woken up at 7 in the morning by the collection of all the bottles. 
Good quality rooms , good location. But on this occasion not excellent .",4,2016,12,10
128,Nothing calm about this place!,"Really didn't enjoy the experience of this hotel.  Had selected full prepay but on arrival the, rather rude, staff member informed me I had to pay before I could go to the room.  I queried why I wasn't informed of this before arrival but got a shrug in response.  After a bit of discussion I eventually had to hand over a different card despite not being reassured the original card wouldn't also be charged.

The directions to the room were ridiculous and it felt like being in a maze!  After a 10 minute adventure I arrived to a room no bigger than a box.  The bathroom was a reverse in, drive out affair and while the bed was comfortable and large, it involved climbing in from the bottom as it was wedged into an alcove.

Breakfast was ok but there appear to be different rooms depending on what price of breakfast you've selected which feels a bit like separating the upper class from the riffraff.

At checkout I was assured the original card on the booking would be charged, which it wasn't and I then had a long email conversation with various staff about trying to rectify the issue.  It wasn't.

Stay elsewhere.",2,2016,12,09
128,Welcoming,"Well we had the best welcome, we were upgraded also to the suites.  Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever (a man), so lovely and great first impression of hotel this time!! Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional. The breakfast was lovely too and the staff there.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2016,12,09
128,"Wonderful Hotel, Nothing is too much trouble for the Staff","My partner stays at this hotel regularly for work and pleasure and has introduced me to it.  I have now stayed here on a number of occasions and have found it to be excellent.  Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff and the staff in the adjoining Jugged Hare where breakfast, lunch and dinner can be obtained are also excellent.",5,2016,12,08
128,"Superb Hotel, Superb Staff. ""Undoubtedly service at its best""","The most important thing in any hospitality business to be successful is your Staff , if they are great then your business is even greater. I was overwhelmed by the friendliness of all the staff from dear Doina the Deputy Manager right through to the very attentative housekeeping staff. The lovely Spanish Lady who sat at her desk opposite the elevators was so wonderful and extremely friendly too (sorry forgot her name).
This is hospitality at it's best and all the staff should be commended for their hard work and their approach to their guests. Love the hotel, Love the staff. The Breakfast was awesome. I was treated to a beautiful room with a luxurious feel and a bed that was so comfortable it was like a being at home. You can always tell a great hotel just by the luxury toiletries in the bath room. Couldn't fault a thing about this hotel. I would like to visit this hotel soon with my wife and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2016,12,07
128,Excellent stay,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed in the Mountcalm to celebrate our anniversary. I had notified them in advance of the special occasion and upon our arrival, we were given a room upgrade. I was also impressed that the guest relations lady Sandra remembered both our names on check in :)

The room itself was lovely. It was spacious for a London hotel room and I loved the bathroom. We had Elemis toiletries and I think the fancier rooms have Hermes. The underfloor heating in the bathroom was really nice when stepping out of the shower. The bed was very comfortable and we had a good night's sleep. The room also had tea and coffee making facilities, an iron/ironing board, shoe shining kit, hair drier, safe, television, and a phone that allowed you free calls to anywhere in the world. 

Also, when we came back in from dinner later that night, the bed had been made up with rose petals and towels in the shape of swans. It was such a nice surprise! 

I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are celebrating a special occasion. Thanks very much to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable :)",5,2016,12,07
128,Dorzi . And .Dr.karimi,"I'm was in the recepcion and Gema (Guest experience) come to chat with me and she is really nice friendly and smart   I  coming with sometimes with my husband for business and today i was enjoy with her a lot, and Also i really enjoy in this hotel",5,2016,12,07
128,Christmas weekend shopping,"Very easy to find £10 taxi ride from the station Kings Cross , easy check in as we were early , did a bit of shopping went back to get changed , bags in room !! , staff very helpful, room was large bathroom was OK , looked the glasses in the bathroom hadn't been changed for a couple of days , but then i never use them any way , all in all a lovely hotel , bit spoilt by the fire-alarm in our room going off when i got out of the shower but quick to respond",4,2016,12,07
128,We were treated like royalty!,Wonderful hotel with very friendly and helpful staff who will do anything to make your stay an enjoyable one. We enjoyed every minute. Room was huge and bathroom was spotless. Robes and slippers felt very luxurious and the bottle of prosecco in our room on arrival was a lovely touch. Rooms were absolutely silent and bed was extremely comfortable. Rooms spotless and nicely decorated. Couldn't fault a thing about this hotel. We want to return already!,5,2016,12,06
128,Superb London Hotel,The Montcalm London Studios Hotel is located 3 minutes walk from the Barbican and is situated in an old brewery building which gives the hotel a unique feel to it. From the moment we entered the building we were looked after by the many attentive staff and were made to feel very welcome and important.  We were upgraded free of charge and shown to our beautiful room with a luxurious feel and a bed that was so comfortable it was like a dream. The huge glass partition window from the bathroom that looked into the bedroom was novel but the electric blind added privacy if you wanted it. We were offered a bed turn down service and chocolates as well as the tea and coffee facilities or the mini bar. As well as the many extra luxuries The television was large although the hand control did stick a bit. Traditional Christmas decorations added to the atmosphere of the old brewery buildings. It was everything you could need for a comfortable relaxing weekend. We would not hesitate to stop here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting London.,5,2016,12,05
128,Fantastic hotel,"The room was perfect, the service is great. This hotel made us feel so welcome and I truly can't wait to stay again! From the moment we walked in to our room along with the midnight craving for chocolate ,that staff was lovely and 100% accommodating.",5,2016,12,05
128,"The warmest of welcomes, absolute impeccable service and standards","Stayed at The Montcalm for a special occasion. Was given the warmest of welcomes with romantic extra touches. No request is too much, the service they deliver is impeccable. Everything was pristine, the bed was so comfortable. We had room service supper, which was delicious.

Just a perfect stay. The sad part was going home!",5,2016,12,05
128,Comfy Hotel,"Booked for celebration weekend, hotel rooms comfy and staff very helpful although difficult to find your way around the hotel, needs better sign posting.  Breakfast has plenty of food on offer. Good location for getting around London. Sadly bar area for drinks of an evening is a pub, not comfy at all and not what you would expect for a hotel like this, disappointing way to finish an evening.",4,2016,12,05
128,Fantastic stay!,"I can honestly say I have never before received service like it in all my travels. It was personal, but very professional. Just Fantastic! 

I was staying there celebrating (belatedly) my partners birthday, they could really not have been more helpful. I think my partner has now forgiven me for the belated part 😉

The room was very comfortable, the Hermes products was a particular luxury I enjoyed & the location is brilliant walking distance to lots of the brilliant sights of London. 

The only disappointment was that I didn't get to try out the Sunday Lunch in the Jugged Hare, as we had to leave earlier than expected. 

Thank you team Montcalm and in particular to Paola, Hiral & Dorina.

Hopefully we will be back soon!",5,2016,12,05
128,Good all rounder,"Stay at the Montcalm 3rd Dec for 1 night with other couples. It was a Great location, staff were very helpful and welcoming. 
Our room was spacious, modern and clean. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. Very good value, booked through booking.com ",5,2016,12,05
128,Beautiful Hotel with top class service,Stayed here for one night this weekend. On arrival bags were taken staff were amazingly attentive and check in was easy. They accompanied us to the room and chatted to us about the hotel. All staff were really friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious and comfy. All facilities were great especially the rainfall shower! When we were checking out our bags were stored whilst we spent the day in London and once we were ready to collect them that evening they arranged a taxi. The hotel is beautiful but the staff really make the hotel and could not do enough to ensure we were happy. We stayed in a club double room. Will definitely be returning and would recommend. Can not comment on food as we chose not to have the breakfast.,5,2016,12,05
128,Excellent Management Saves the Day,"Stayed in this very nicely situated hotel to attend a local wedding. Beautiful rooms that are very well appointed. There were a couple of problems/issues, however with the help of some excellent management skills from Dorina the duty manager, everything was resolved quickly and easily with very little fuss. This has resulted in a stay that could have been blighted, turning into a 5 star recommendation. Thank you to Dorina and the team for a great stay. I will definitely return on my next visit to the City.",5,2016,12,04
128,"Very comfortable, convenient location & great staff","While perhaps a little over the top in styling, the Montcalm at the Brewery is a very comfortable hotel in a great location for a weekend in London. The staff could not have been more helpful and we would definitely stay again.",4,2016,12,04
128,Nice but overrated,"All the staff were great which helped because it was impossible to navigate around the hotel without their help or going outside and down the street to get to the next available door to approach from a different way. There isn't a lounge for residents unless you have the club booking and otherwise the  nearest offer is to sit in the reception which is not much more than an entry. The Jugged Hare Pub as part of the building ( which I understand is run by a separate organisation ) is wonderful and a saving grace to our stay. The food is very much for the game lover and competes with Rules Restaurant in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden. The Jugged Hare may have the edge. I will go back to the Jugged Hare but not too sure about the hotel.",3,2016,12,04
128,"Fantastic venue , excellent customer service and a top venue in London.","I recently stayed at the Montcalm Brewery and had a truly splendid experience. Firstly the staff are very welcoming , professional, well mannered and do all that they can to make your stay is very special. The guest relations team go out of their way to ensure they do what they can to make your stay a excellent experience.
The room I had was of a very top standard , with every modern facility to hand.
My room was very comfortable and homely , great after a tough day in the city .
What a difference it is to go into a room in a hotel where it feels that you can relax and rest.
I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in central London.
The sister hotel , Montcalm at Marble Arch is also an excellent hotel . I again stayed there recently and would recommend this hotel to anyone.
Check theses places out ....you will not be disappointed.

",5,2016,12,04
128,Ok,"Stayed for two days. All in all a nice hotel with all the amenities. The lobby bar is worth a visit, excellent drinks and great snacks. However an faulty ac mend spending the nights in what seemed a freezer. Also experienced an door key that didn't work on several occasions which required a couple of trips to the front desk and a visit from hotel maintenance. Some of my fellow travelers had the pleasure of an fire alarm going of a couple of times each night. Would I stay here again, not sure....",3,2016,12,04
128,Birthday Visit,"This is the 2nd stay I have had with the Brewery, it is a lovely hotel, the suite that I had on both occasions were thanks to a certain young lady called Alice. To be fair all the staff are extremely helpful, and everywhere you need like the tube station etc is within walking distance. All in all I would highly recommend the stay here, but particularly a huge thankyou on both occasions to Alice for being so professional, always with a smile and could never do enough if one needed for anything. Thankyou again, will for sure be coming back.",5,2016,12,02
128,"Montcalm,, shoudlbe rechristened MontCHAOS","Stayed here a couple of weeks ago whilst attending an event at The Brewery.
On our way to the room at 6 pm noticed a tray of partially eaten food outside a room opposite.. The remains of Room Service.   Returned to the room shortly after midnight food remains still in corridor outside room 6 hours later.  
Having been herded out of the Brewery Event by a gentleman who moved us out in teh same manner that  a sheepdog herds sheep  snapping at us to keep us moving. We walked the few paces to our hotel with friends and sat in the lounge while I went to the night porter to order some drinks. "" sorry we do not serve drinks after midnight""  But we are resident I explained. ""Sorry if you want drink you must drink in room"" .  As our room had barely room to swing a CAT this was not a practical operation.
The next morning off to Breakfast. asking where breakfast was we were advised the best route was out the front door along the street and back in the next door. Only problem it was pouring with rain.. so not practical. The alternative route involved going up in an elevator along a corridor down stars  through woefully signposted corridors. . We eventually found where breakfast was .  When we got there we were told there woudl be at least a 15 minute wait for a table .. We were paying £18.00 each for this breakfast. Others waiting just gave up and went to the buffet and then sat on low stools in the bar with their breakfast on their knee.
The hotel was full, one assumes because of its location .. but one thing is certain I won't be going back!",2,2016,12,02
128,They have you in mind,"I stayed at the hotel on a business trip. Loved the atmosphere. Very helpful and pleasant reception and staff in general. Breakfast was very good too.  

What struck me as most impressive was the mobile telephone they provide for you(in every room).  No need to worry about roaming charges.  I was able to make phone calls and have internet for free.  It had a gps where I could navigate through London and find my way home:)",5,2016,12,01
128,"amazing hotel, great service....","Was there for 4 days,
the hotel is clean, the stuff is nice and welcoming, great service, rooms are big and comfortable, highly recommended....breakfast is excellent, great location... will come back for my next trip...",5,2016,12,01
128,Great Location and Service!,"Very nice room, cozy and comfortable!
The Location was not bad at all. 10 minutes away from Oxford Street.
The staff was very helpful and professional.
I definitely suggest this hotel as a top selection when it comes to London.",5,2016,12,01
128,Great service,"The staff was super helpful, every time I asked for something, they went out of their way to assist.
Walking distance to 2 tube stations.
You can find a couple of nice places to eat nearby and the Hotel has a great bar-restaurant.",5,2016,12,01
128,Beautiful,"I will stay again even not for business.Beautiful hotel,smallish rooms but stunning and you could watch the TV in your bath...bliss!

Restaurants lovely too,I would recommend  the bar as well food yum there too!",5,2016,11,30
128,Struggling to decide whether it's a 3 or 4...,"It's somewhere in between really...it's not average and it's not very good.  Reception area and service there was great, easy check in and got shown to my room which was a nice touch although once I got there, I realised there was no way I would've found it on my own...!

The building is a bit of a labyrinth a I certainly got lost a couple of times.

The room was pretty small to be honest but well equipped.  It perhaps could do with a bit of touch up here and there (moldy bath sealant for instance) and the complimentary smart phone didn't work, but overall, it was a pretty decent room.

Breakfast is served in the pub just down the road (1 minute walk) which feels a bit odd but it was very high quality so I couldn't complain too much (although I never got my tea even though I asked a couple of times...!).

I personally found the bed to be too soft and too short so didn't sleep particularly well and there was some street/background noise too.

So overall, again, it was hard to place.  I can see they are trying really hard for a premium hotel experience but it was just falling short in a number of areas.  A touch up, better signage in the corridors/lifts, making sure equipment all works and slightly better breakfast service and they would probably crack it.",4,2016,11,30
128,Montcalm London City Suites - A Class of it's own,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights, and I have to say it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. 
I was treated to a luxurious service the second I walked through the door. Escorted to my single room, I was shown all the amenities inside which even included a smartphone with free data and calls to 5 countries!
Elemis toiletries, velvety robe and slippers, complimentary fruit and water; I really couldn't have wanted more.
The weekend ended up going very wrong on a personal front (I was due to attend an awards ceremony that got cancelled at the last moment) and the hotel could not have done any more to make my weekend a happy one.
Wine and chocolates were sent to my room when they found out what had happened and the staff were even so kind as to take pictures of me in my red carpet outfit just so I had some memories of what it would have been like.
The room was beautiful and so very comfortable. I had an issue with the cloud like soft pillows (I need a hard pillow for medical reasons) and this was swapped immediately.
Literally anything that was needed, was provided. They kindly held onto my luggage until the evening after I checked out as I had a late train, and when I finally left I was waved off by two of the staff!
This hotel made a difficult weekend a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to stay here again when I am in London. 
This will be my hotel of choice for London visits and you should make it yours, it really is out of this World.
Thank you to all the staff that made me stay wonderful, especially Alice who saw to every one of my needs.
You really won't find a more friendly yet luxurious hotel.",5,2016,11,30
128,"Good location for the Barbican...., but if you are Vegetarian Avoid for sure....","Stayed at this Hotel for two nights on a leisure trip to London.,

Good location , but the Hotel itself, is all corridors and so confusing,,,

My biggest gripe was , the Breakfast, there was no Vegetarian Options apart from Poached egg, and the usual...Mushrooms ,Tomaotes...

The last Hotel I stayed at in London I was spoilt for choice,.,

But this Hotel was the opposite...

Also, sitting eating in the Restaurant surrounded by dead Stuffed Animals, is not really my thing....

Staff friendly, and efficient, room was nice, but cluttered with switches and gadgets,",4,2016,11,28
128,Excellent attentive service but average property,"I recently stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery London on a business trip for 4 days. By the time I reached the room it was post 1130 pm and  the room did not seem like the 340 sq feet club room I had booked. It was tiny and claustrophobic so I  called the front desk and they said this is a 340 sq feet room. Well I was too tired to argue so closed the conversation and went to sleep. The next morning I went to the club lounge for a business meeting ..well all I can say is that this is one of the most pathetic club lounges I have seen in a long time ! its tiny , dingy and hardly any  facilities.   Anyway  I messaged my travel agent to get me out of this place, and he went back and forth with the hotel folks. I then got a call from Neil  Peter , the duty manager. He instantly impressed me with his concern and offered to shift me to another room. The other room 509, was MUCH nicer , so I gladly accepted that offer. He was super nice , came up to check personally if everything was good, gave restaurant suggestions and even offered to have the hotel car drop me off for dinner. I must say that he saved my trip from a disaster. This review is to compliment his service and customer care.",4,2016,11,27
128,Ice is Expensive...,"Nice location, lovely building...

Comfortable rooms, with Hermes toiletries...

No ice Machines or ice in fridge, asked for room service was told it would cost 8 pounds for ice ???? 

So as expected walked down to the bar..

Hotel does feel like a maze....

Would I stay again, Yes, just have to get used to walking to the bar....for ICE...",5,2016,11,26
128,There are better hotels to stay at in the area,"Third or fourth time I have stayed at this hotel. Rooms are nice, there is nothing one can complain about with regards to value for money. Amenities and little details like providing a phone for each guest is well thought out. For me, as I travel to London nearly every month, service is important. Each and everytime, I dont understand the service. Its horrible. There is nothing friendly or warm with the staff. Asking for my Identification should not feel like I am being yelled at. Asking for an invoice by email should not be a stretch, asking where my room is as this hotel is basically a maze of stairs and elevators should not be trivial, and the one thing I am finnicky about, as this something I am a stickler about, do not ask me if its my fiirst time staying there. Your records should show I have stayed several times. It should be a 'Welcome, back and thanks for staying with us again.' I stay here because it is close to work, but I have a list of others I can choose from and this is the last time I stay at this hotel. This hotel calls itself a 5 star hotel, but its so far from one and it shows in the service.",2,2016,11,25
128,Always a great stay here....,"I love coming to London and staying here as the service is always excellent.  This is my corporate hotel, with my office being a 2 min walk away.  Its location is top notch to the city.  This time, I brought my partner with me as we were celebrating our anniversary.  We were given a very nice room and a bottle of red wine and chocs to celebrate along with a handwritten note welcoming us to the hotel.  What I like about this hotel is that that they leave you alone unless you want something.  Housekeeping is great, the breakfasts are simply legendary and I was most grateful to the Concierge who managed to get us a window table at the Oxo Tower within a 2 hour timeframe.  I love staying here and I will always come back here.  It is fab.  If there is anything I could moan about, and it is nothing really - it is I don't like hotel rooms which have an array of documents, leaflets etc all over the room - but it was hardly an effort to gather everything up mysefl and put in a drawer.  Thank you Montcalm and see you soon!",5,2016,11,24
128,Nice touches but some disappointments,Quirky hotel. However good bits were offset by some poor elements. We had a Club Room which was a long way from reception. Check in was overly involved and slow.  The room had exposed brick work in the roof which was lovely but the bathroom was too small and smelt of drains. Overall slightly disappointed as this could have been so much better.,3,2016,11,22
128,Four night stay,"We stayed here for a medical conference at Barts, very close by. Also Barbican Centre almost next door. Grand entrance, doormen and porters, excellent check-in. Then it deteriorated. It's is a warren of corridors, you almost need a porter to take you to your room. During the day, until 10pm, there are short cuts across the courtyard and lifts, but after 10pm, ask to be escorted. 
Another downside is that there is no bar to serve drinks nor to relax with friends. There is a reception area, but this is more to wait for a taxi or meet people and go somewhere else. This hotel desperately needs a centre. The bar is 40 yards down the road, The Jugged Hare, and this is half pub and half restaurant. Far too loud as well, and again no sitting area.
Restaurant ?   - breakfast is in the Jugged Hare!  Excellent breakfast, but surroundings lacking.  The 'dining rooms' were along the street, in the other direction to the pub.
Rooms - we had an upgrade, but no bath. Very clean and the beds were excellent.
Final comment - by the side of the chair in the small second seating area was a cardboard box mouse trap!",4,2016,11,22
128,"Bait & Switch, Bad Location and Uncomfortable","First of all I was super excited to stay a converted brewery. 
1.) Upon check-in we were informed that our ""flex-rate"" allowed them to move us to a less desirable sister hotel as an upgrade. We declined the upgrade and they made a big deal about our booking already being transferred, but they were able to check us in and take our credit card information at the brewery location. (This made no sense and we felt tricked.) After speaking to the manager, they accommodated us at the Brewery, making us feel lucky to have gotten a room at the hotel we booked. 
2.) I feel like we were given the worst room on the property. We were used to small European hotel rooms but this one was uncomfortable and poorly laid out. The bed tiny and dipped in the middle, which was a nightmare for 2 people. The air conditioner and heater are controlled by the front desk, they agreed to adjust it and then nothing changed. I had to call them twice. We could hear every noise in the hallway and street. The Hermes toiletries are no longer provided.
3.) The front desk wasn't able to answer a simple ""How long does it take to get to Heathrow?"" I saw the person googling my question in the reflection from the screen. Don't ask for recs bc they will just send you to the hotel restaurants. 
4.) The location was not walkable to any main attraction. (Minimum half mile walk to anything worthwhile.) 

Stay anywhere but here!!",1,2016,11,21
128,My go to London hotel,"Travelling with business I started staying at the M by Montcalm in Shoreditch. Lovely hotel but service poor, kept losing bookings, asking you to give your details as if you'd never been there before etc. Decided to give the Montcalm Brewery a go and so glad I did. First stay was a bit flaky so raised my concerns and service has been fab since. So impressed I booked a personal trip with my wife and let them know it was for a special occasion, they left us a card in the room with a bottle of wine and gave us a fantastic experience while we were there. The rooms are spacious particularly if you get upgraded to a club room, breakfast limited but fine for a quick get and go. I'm a regular visitor and they make you feel that way. Hotel is a bit of a maze but fine once you get used to it, some of the rooms are over the street so it can get a bit noisy so suggest you pack your ear plugs just in case. Also like the fact that it seems fairly calm even though I'm sure it's at full capacity, had club lounge access for two nights (alcoholic drinks served for a couple of hours in the evening) and a handful of people in there both nights, same for breakfast.

Not saying the hotel is perfect but they do go out of their way to rectify issues and it's the only place I look at when in London for business or pleasure. 

Location is good, 5 minutes from Barbican tube station so nice and central to see the sights, Have been staying there regularly for the last few months and will do so for the foreseeable future!",5,2016,11,21
128,Friendly and comfortable luxury,"My husband and I were attending a function at the Brewery and booked to stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery as we have done for the last 3 years with our friends. When we checked in we were greeted by the reception staff who always make you feel so welcome.  We were advised that we had been allocated a room in the New Montcalm Royal London House Hotel  just down the road. This was intriguing but as our function was at The Brewery and our friends were staying in the same hotel as us, we declined the offer.  We were reallocated a room at the Montcalm at The Brewery with no fuss at all.  Our room, as always was luxurious and for our special weekend we had a Four Poster bed which was so Beautiful and so so comfortable that we didn't want to leave it.  The room was well equipped with hairdryer, robe and slippers, tea and coffee making facilities, complimentary toiletries and you have an option prior to checking in to choose the kind of pillow you prefer and scent for your room. There is a mini bar and nibbles that can be added to the room charge if you wanted. Our event went as planned and when we checked out the next morning we were very sad to be leaving. We will be returning next year I have no doubt. 

While we had the opportunity we visited the Montcalm Royal London House which is only a short ride away. The reception staff were lovely and happy to show us around a little and explain further details of the hotel such as the roof terrace and spa.  We are very much looking forward to a stay at the new addition to Montcalm Hotels and feel certain from what we saw that I will not be disappointed. 

Thank you to everyone at the Montcalm at the brewery for making our stay so special.",5,2016,11,21
128,Fantastic stay !,"Stayed here on the 19 november for my birthday treat! The hotel is lovely the room we had was very clean,big,plenty tea and coffee,lovely toiletries, the staff all very helpful club lounge really nice ,really nice atmosphere, nice to read the history of the hotel to just booked to another Weekend!,,!",5,2016,11,20
128,Wonderful Hospitality,"I stayed on Saturday 19th November and can honestly say that the hospitality offered was absolutely fabulous. Upon my arrival, I was escorted to a marvellous suite that oozed style and was tremendously set out with some wonderful features. The air scent system was very interesting indeed.
Alice Cubostrojeva, Grazia and Daniela were all absolutely fabulous and definitely made my stay very wonderful indeed.
This is a gem of a hotel in the city and makes a wonderful choice if you are looking for a nice weekend stay in London away from the hustle and bustle of the West End. You will be welcomed by a professional team and will be very comfortable indeed. 
Thanks for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,11,20
128,Luxury Hotel,Luxury hotel located in the center of London with beautiful interiors and courteous staff. I love the way they have done the interior room lightings. Looking forward for my next visit to Lodon and staying with them.,4,2016,11,19
128,Lots of Apples,"Stayed in room 215 which was set back from the corridor by a small flight of stairs just leading to the rooms door. The room was well laid out and was very clean. To switch off all the lights within the room we had to remove the card from the main light switch, we tried all the switches but none of them extinguished the 3 down lights over the bed. The AC worked ok but did seem to take an age to get going. Staff were extremely helpfull, a small selection of fresh fruit was available in the room along with a single bottle of water. As we were a couple staying would have expected 2 though! Overall a very pleasant stay. Free fresh Apples are available at reception and within your room. ",5,2016,11,19
128,Excellent stay,"Fantastic hotel with exceptiional customer service. We were made so welcome and nothing was to much trouble. The rooms were spacious and very well equipped including luxury toiletries.  The large bed was super comfortable, one of the most comfy I have had in a hotel. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,11,18
128,Good in parts ,"Online deal of £166 turned into £255 booking only one hour later. Still doable considering location, but  felt like we'd missed out.

Good is the location, bed, great sheets, cleanliness, all mod cons, shaving mirror, massive TV, warm welcome in reception, charming porter Vlad, overall helpfulness of staff.

Not so great was the bath plug not working so no bath possible, some rooms miles away via rabbit warren of stairs and lifts, and the mess up between the travel company and their booking system at check in...no idea who was at fault but quite a wait to get it sorted. And reception is over-crowded and fussily over- manned by people constantly trying to press free coffee in you.",3,2016,11,18
128,Good Stay,"Recent business trip to the Capital staying in the city. Part of the old Whitbread brewery tastefully updated, very good service throughout stay, comfortable room, good meeting facitlites. Also very close to Moorgate tube and local bars and restaurants, overall recommended.",4,2016,11,17
128,A let down,Montcalm Brewery has been my choice for all my business trips for the past one year and at every stay it has been very satisfying and hassle free for a business traveller like me. Things were good till The recent 2 stay I had in Sept and October. Their services and efficiency level have declined. What upsets me the most is that they charged my credit card in November without obtaining my consent and approval for a bill that they have forgotten to charge during my Oct stay when I checked out. I received a call from my bank fearing it was a fraud transaction causing me unnecessary panic as I wasn't in Montcalm Brewery when the card is charged. I have to call the hotel to find out the details. I dislike the fact that they charged my card without my prior consent and that they have failed to explain why they missed charging me the bill when I checked out. It took them almost 3 weeks to realise that! ,2,2016,11,15
128,Great London City Hotel !!!,"Booked in the Montcalm for a weekend stay in order to travel to 02 arena to watch a concert ! Perfect location as you can get the KPMG river taxis from London Bridge which is close by and get right to the 02 arena....The Montcalm is also really close to the central line too so it's easy to get in and out of central London...The beauty of booking a hotel just outside central London is that you can get a 5 star hotel for the price of a 3 star at weekends if you book in advance...Booking.com is a good site to use.
Now here is where it gets good....The room we were allocated had no window but the room was beautiful, however I can not stand being in a room with no window so asked for a room change, quick as a flash we were given a new room upgraded to a club suite and with a free bottle of wine and free breakfast !!! The staff were simply awesome and the manager Dorina is one of the best hotel managers I have ever come across in all my worldwide travels ! This hotel also has its own pub called the Jugged Hare which on a Friday night is absolutely buzzing with great food too....loved this place and will be staying again...thank you Dorina you and your staff are a credit to the Montcalm, Chris & Charliegh...",5,2016,11,14
128,My Birthday!,"Wow! If ever you want a wonderful weekend in the city I can't recommend this hotel as forever being your ""go-to"" hotel. From the second we walked through the door they couldn't do enough for us. They were so polite and friendly. Our room was upgraded as a birthday surprise from them, along with the prosecco, balloons and petals on the bed. I felt like royalty being there. The bathroom was amazing, the bed fantastic, the coffee out of this world! We had 2 nights there and we will be back again and again. Thank you for making my birthday weekend even more special.",5,2016,11,13
128,Remembrance weekend ,"A really nice hotel in the City of London, the staff are very friendly and attentive to your needs and the breakfast in the Jugged Hare was excellent.

Rooms are very clean and comfortable with all the facilities you would expect of a good hotel.

I would recommend staying here.",5,2016,11,12
128,Tolerable if you are a tourist in London - but not for me,"Picture the rainiest of days - no cabs available  and a long walk in busy London carrying extra bags. Then picture entering the Montcalm Reception, trying to check in and being told that I am at the wrong hotel and they want to bump me to their ""sister"" hotel in Frindsbury Square without any prior notification. The receptionist was not only a trainee but did not have the greatest command of the English language. Classic case of asking for the manager - and guess what - after a little altercation they were able to find a room. It's not often this happens but this day was the wrong day to pick on me. 

The walk to the room was then ridiculous. The maze of stairs and corridors was complex and long. I actually went up some stairs and then down some other starirs. I crashed in the room and ordered a burger and fries - which came very quickly. Breakfast was another ordeal. It's not in the hotel but in the pub next door! You had to go outside in the rain to then walk along the street to go to a pub to have your breakfast. The route out of my room to get to the pub was complicated and I lost my way going back and it took me a full 20 minutes. The price of all this pleasure was £205 per night.",2,2016,11,09
128,Conference ...,"A very impressive building with all the necessities for a brilliant conference that i attended. Food was brilliant and all areas very clean. 

Very good location with lots of pubs and restaurants nearby.",5,2016,11,09
128,A successful dry run,We decided to do a long weekend in London and decided to try the Montcalm as we are staying in December at our company's Christmas function. It was superb from the welcome at the door to the attentive staff and interesting layout with quirky rooms that were very well appointed and comfortable. Looking forward to our next visit.,5,2016,11,08
128,Another very good stay. ,"My wife and I were in London celebrating her birthday and stayed here for two nights. We have stayed before and were extremely happy so had no problem booking again. 

I booked directly with the hotel and they were great to deal with. We arrived early on the Friday way before check in so they took our details and stored our cases without any drama. Once we arrived back we received the keys and our cases were already in the room which was handy.

I booked for the Montcalm Club double with lounge access and would recommend. We were on the 4th floor in the south wing which was a bit of a maze getting to but once you'd done it once there was no problem. Room was spacious and the hotel kindly gave us a bottle for prosecco with it being my wife's birthday. Only small issue I had was that the vent above the bed was covered in masking tape and the paint was coming off the sill in the shower. Small cosmetic detais and certainly didn't impact our stay. 

The hotel is located fairly close to Moorgate so max 5 mins walk. We found it very handy to get about London. 

The complimentary food and drink in the club lounge is definitely worth the small increase in price and the continental breakfast was pretty good. Quite basic in terms of selection but no problem with it from us.  

Definitely recommend and would stay again. ",4,2016,11,08
128,"Really nice European Style hotel, strange service","My stay at this hotel was interesting.  The room was nice, although a bit stinky, but the hotel is beautiful.  The gym is very small, and you have to fill out a 3 page waiver to use it (no joke) but they have one, and it works.  The people who worked there were generally respectful, however the service in the club lounge, was, well, strange.  There was no key card access, so you just walked in but then an employee was just standing there, and they would follow you around the room and stare at you (not saying anything).  Even though I had access to the room it made me feel very uncomfortable when I went in to get my free water.  That being said, it was a nice place to stay, close to the Moorgate and Barbican lines with some fun restaurants around it.",4,2016,11,07
128,Our Son's wedding ,"We stayed three nights at the Brewery. Excellent place, "" a city sanctuary"" that's also ""inspired by history."" We felt very relaxed. Members of staff: from Reception desk, concierge to Jugged Hare, were customer friendly, professional and helpful. Very clean comfortable room, with complimentary water and fruits, not too mention the ample supply of toiletries. We fully recommend the place: It is ""reassuringly rewarding.""",5,2016,11,07
128,Brilliant hotel,"Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location.  Hotel décor very nice, hotel and rooms are clean and the staff are brilliant (cant do enough to make your stay special) I can not rate this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,11,07
128,Special hotel,"The hotel is located in a business area, but also really close to St. Paul's Cathedral and the great neighborhood of Shoreditch. Rooms are clean and well equiped. The hotel is based in an old brewery. We especially liked the navigation phone in the room, free to take with you for wandering around the city. Great service!",4,2016,11,07
128,Lovely Weekend Stay,"The Montclam at the Brewery lived up to all the previous reviews i have read! It is in a superbly resorted brewery in the heart of London, the staff were extremely accommodating, the room was immaculate, we stayed in one of the their club duplex suites which was very spacious, this also allowed us access to the Club lounge where complimentary drink and snacks were available between 5.30-7.30 pm, as well as a continental breakfast.
The hotel is approx 5-.10 mins walk from either Moregate or The Barbican tubes stops or a bit further from Liverpool Street. IT has its own pub attached and restaurant. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,07
128,Expensive and bad,"I have to say that I dislike hotels like this one: they are entirely dedicated to design and not to comfort and pleasant stay. They all even look alike: from the smell of the rooms to the piped new age music. My stay  started badly: I got an unheated room, but the staff were helpful and eventually they found a room where heating worked. The room design is weird: you have a transparent window bathroom including the toilet. I was alone so it was not a problem; but if you are with somebody would you like to sit on a toilet or take a shower while your roommate is watching you? The hotel seems like dead (this is another feature that these hotels share) and the staff are both obsequious and cold (it is quite a feet to succeed producing such an effect). Staying there once is more than enough.",2,2016,11,06
128,Fantastic hotel in a convenient location,We stayed here for a Birthday weekend away and to celebrate our recent engagement. The staff (particularly Sandra:) were very friendly and helpful. Our room was beautifully furnished with lovely extra personal touches that we weren't expecting. There were afew communication issues which resulted in us not having an opportunity to make the most of some of the facilities. Also a room service tray charge of £7.50 seems a little excessive and made one sandwich and a bottle of Coke extremely expensive! The location is really convenient with Moorgate station being walking distance away and pubs/coffee shops/pharmacy/shops close by. We will definately look to stay again when we next visit London and would recommend this hotel highly.,4,2016,11,06
128,Veru good choice,"Very good choice In the center of London near The brewery event place. Good and clean rooms and very good price! Perfect english breakfast In the center store. Bacon, eggs, sausage and more. Reccomended choice.",4,2016,11,06
128,Great environment and staff,"stayed here for business as close to my company offices but extremely glad I made the choice. the staff couldn't be more accommodating. I absolutely recommend reserving a room with Club Access. The Club Staff (Adele and Evanna) went above and beyond to make sure the stay was enjoyable and relaxing even if there for work. The hotel is created inside an old brewery and as such, the construction had to accommodate historical guidelines. However this gives it great charm and personality. Explore all the stairwells and hallways and see how they created a beautiful hotel while keeping the integrity of the building. I highly recommend.",5,2016,11,05
128,Nice but noisy! ,"My friend booked a room here for the weekend as a surprise for my 40th Birthday, she asked for an upgrade before checking in and they checked and gave us a club suite which was nice we thought. I was really excited to stay here as it looked beautiful inside and out. 
We were sent complimentary fruit (3 more pieces of the same that was already in the room) and a 500ml bottle of sparkling water,which i thought was a bit odd. 
The room looked lovely and seemed to be in a quiet wing of the hotel... until 12am-2am when the courtyard came to life for people leaving or smoking outside, glass bottles tipped into bins and then dragged across the cobbles and the air con turned itself back on?? I am not a light sleeper at all, so was surprised by how loud it was both nights. 
The bathroom was freezing cold as the window frame was broken. The glass is single panes throughout so a room facing the court yard is not recommended. 
Bit disappointing to be honest. ",3,2016,11,04
128,Exceptional can't wait to return,"Wow, my husband booked this for our wedding night. The hotel upgraded us to a wow suite and wow it was! 

We arrived from our reception and the hotel had stored our belongings. The room was decorated and we were given champagne and a huge bed. The room was lovely and warm and the bathroom
Was amazing. 

We slept well and the bath is fantastic. 

We would love to visit again.

",5,2016,11,03
128,Comfortable and cosy,"It was a very nice experience. Usually we go to a different hotel, but it was full that weekend and we chose the Brewery. It is situated in the city area which meant that it was very crowded on the Friday we arrived but deserted on Sat and Sun. 
Comfortable bed, nice bathroom and nice touches (fresh fruit and complimentary water, nice toiletries). Very small room, but this is London after all, we had a room in the South wing which meant some walking through different corridors. The pub was nice, didn't try breakfast or dinner in the restaurant. Reception was very good, all the clerks were kind and helpful. I mentioned it was our wedding anniversary when asked about the reason of the trip and that evening they left a small bottle of wine and some macarons in the room at turndown with a hand written card. Really appreciated.
The hotel is clearly geared towards business travellers but it can be a nice, cosy destination for a weekend in two. Personnel is really helpful and hotel is very quiet in weeekends (and prices are very good on weekends for this hotel class).",5,2016,11,02
128,Magnificent Montcalm at the Brewery,"We’d stayed at The Brewery a few years ago and welcomed the opportunity to return. Our stay was just wonderful.

Reception looks great and all the staff were smiling; making our welcome most pleasant. 

It’s a quirky building (old brewery surprise, surprise) so we were given a map to help us navigate our way around the corridors.  

Our room was spacious, clean, with lovely bathroom products and some cool tech (more for me than my wife). My wife is lactose intolerant and they dealt with that beautifully (ie no fuss). There was a well-stocked mini bar with premium drinks, no time to try them on this occasion and nice robes and slippers. 

We had a good sleep and looked forward to breakfast. 

The breakfast (severed in the Jug and Hare) was brilliant. A special mention to the chef who made me some of the best crispy bacon ever. We’d mentioned (some time previously) that we liked Marmite and Apricot Jam. There was a jar of each on our table at breakfast, a lovely touch.

Check out was effortless and again the lobby staff were happy, enthusiastic and more than ready to help.

You only get one chance to make a first impression and one chance to leave a lasting impression. The Montcalm at the Brewery did both.",5,2016,11,02
128,Comfortable and relaxed,Great location for City and easy access across the capital. Dining options available including the Chiswell St Dining Room next door and part of the hotel. Friendly and welcoming reception team. Would return for business or pleasure.,5,2016,11,01
128,Its a maze.,"This hotel is built in the old brewery building near the Barbican Centre.
The decor is very nice, the staff are very attentive, but it is too hard to find your way around the maze of corridors.
The room we had was supposed to be a double delux but was very small with a tiny window with a view of a brick wall.
Breakfast was expensive at £24.
Not a hotel I would rush back to.",3,2016,11,01
128,Great hotel,"Great stay at this hotel. Modern and clean, with comfortable beds and fantastic bathrooms. The staff are very helpful and attentive. Worth paying for the breakfast too, it's really good. Location is good too. Subway stops are just a couple of minutes walk away - I took one of them directly to Westminster for a tour bus. Also, it's about 10 minutes walk to the line which goes directly down Oxford Street if you want to shop and look at the main drag, and it's only two stops from the Eurostar terminal.",5,2016,11,01
128,Mixed feelings,"+++ clean hotel 
very central location when you need to go to the city
Nice staff

--- overpriced, done in such a way that you think you're in a maze. 
Room was cold, unable to understand the lightening system.",3,2016,11,01
128,Really excellent staff,"We stayed in a Club Room in the hotel, partied at The Brewery, albeit separately catered and took breakfast in the Jugged Hare  and all the staff we encountered were efficient and friendly and helpful, guiding and accompanying us to our room when once again we were lost!
As others have commented the hotel layout is confusing with ""multiple choice"" short staircase runs then along corridors but suppose that's what you get with conversions. Often a quick walk across the courtyard was the simplest route. 
We found the lighting in the room insufficient, needing to use the torch on my IPhone to  check the inside of the safe and the bath/shower controls over complicated. 
Comfortable king sized bed in a pleasant room but cupboard space would have been inadequate had we been staying longer than overnight. 
Check in and out were simple.
So overall, a very pleasant stay in an establishment probably more suitable to the luxury business traveller visiting the City of London than the longer term tourist looking for shopping.
By the way, check the electric alarm clock hasn't been set for 5 am by a previous occupant! No lol.
",4,2016,10,31
128,Mixed Feelings...,"I took my fiancé here, for what was supposed to be a wonderful relaxing, spoil ourselves evening...
When we arrived, we were greeted by wonderful staff and escorted to our room, the room was smaller than expected, but wonderfully decorated and had a cosy feel to it.

My fiancé and I had a wonderful evening, until about 11pm.
Suddenly there was an extremely loud humming noise, it sounded as If something was wrong with the pipes. We tried to ignore it, but it got louder and louder. We couldn’t watch TV, relax, and we could forget trying to sleep!
I called reception, someone came up to our room in about 5mins…
They heard how bad the noise was, so they offered us another room.
The hotel was fully booked that night, except for one room, which was technically a downgrade from the room I very specifically booked and paid for, but we had no choice but to take it, as the noise got louder. So we had to throw our items into our bags and go downstairs…

The next morning, understandably we were knackered and wanted to stay in bed until check out, but we had heard such great things about the breakfast, we had to try it. We went down an hour before it finished (please note breakfast is served in another building about 3 minutes’ walk away), when we got there, there was a queue to be seated, we had to wait 15mins to get a seat! When we were finally seated downstairs, as it is a buffet style breakfast, we had to keep going up and down the stairs…not fun! To make matters worse, they were very slow at replenishing items, so often I would have to stand by the buffet, waiting...

Obviously, I made my concerns and unhappiness know to reception, who again were wonderful, the manager gave me her sincerest apologies and refunded 30% of the room charge and waived the breakfast charge. 

To summarise, great customer service, however, I unfortunately got a badly plumbed room and a bad breakfast.

If they have now sorted these things, then I would recommend them But, to be honest, I expect a 5* hotel at £200+ a night, to get this right the first time!",3,2016,10,31
128,Really took care of my traveling executive!,"I booked a trip recently for my boss traveling to the UK for a conference.  I communicated via email with Vlad, the Head of Concierge to arrange her car transportation from and back to the airport when she was scheduled to return.  Well, it turned into me relying on him to schedule all of her car transfers for her various appointments.  Even when I once called him from NYC to schedule car pick-ups with little notice he got her service.  I felt like we were working together based on the attention he gave us.  And, I felt that he was looking out for my executive.  Her experience was fabulous and mine through her was Amazing!  I can't thank him enough for being so available and thoughtful.  Even from thousands of miles away!",5,2016,10,27
128,Staying over whilst attending a function at the Guildhall,"Lovely hotel.  The conversion from the old brewery to hotel is superb.  The character of this old building is great. If you want history and quirky this is the place to stop.  For too long these old building have been bulldozed to make way for modern builds.  The bedrooms are not spacious but are comfortable and clean with all the facilities you could require.  The scent box and choice of pillows (we chose the vitamin E anti aging) were a nice touch.
Good breakfast, staff attentive.
Overall a pleasant stay.",5,2016,10,27
128,4 nights in London,"Me and wife stayed over 4 nights and enjoyed the hotel , staff and the location.  This is a nice old house that has been refurbished. The rooms are clean and spacious.  You even get your own mobile phone :)   All service top notch.",4,2016,10,27
128,great location and interesting hotel,"it a great location and the building has been converted in an interesting way. rooms are nice and a decent size for London.
its right opposite Liberties and adjacent to all the shops
the rooftop bar is also a nice place to have a pre dinner drink",5,2016,10,27
128,Excellent,"Stayed for two nights and it was amazing. Easy check in, all the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. Got breakfast included for free both mornings. Rooms very clean and the bed was incredibly soft. The customer service was outstanding. Would definitely go back!!!!!!",5,2016,10,24
128,Another night at the Montcalm,"It was a convenient place to stay and the staff are friendly and normally helpful. (A colleague and I had to eat our dinner sitting at the bar because we were told all the tables were reserved - some of them were empty the whole time we were in the Jugged Hare). We enjoyed our dinner.  At breakfast, although staff kept coming round with jugs of coffee, trying to get cups of tea was difficult.  I would find a guide to the light switches in the room helpful - it would save me running round experimenting.  I dislike the cups they have in the room which I find too small and not suitable for left-handers - so I now always take a mug with me on my visits.   I was fortunate to have access to the Executive lounge which is very pleasant.",3,2016,10,24
128,Everything was awesome.,"The food and beverage service was perfect, staff were very welcoming and helpful. The room was absolutely lovely, probably one of the nicest hotel rooms I've stayed in for a while.
I would stay again :)",5,2016,10,24
128,Superb,"Stayed in room 227 on Saturday 22/10 one of the wow suites. 

Lovely room, great size and all the facilities. 
If I had one small criticism the shower needs more power. 

Had breakfast in the jugged Hare Sunday morning and that was very nice. ",5,2016,10,23
128,"Amazing room, better staff","Previous reviews had comments on the friendly staff, ready to assist at a moment's notice. This is true, but they also can keep out of your way which is exactly what I was looking for. 
Location is near transit, but there is not much charm around the neighborhood ",5,2016,10,22
128,Weekend Trip,Stayed at The Brewery for a weekend away in London. They discounted the rate heavily as I assume it is not used as a leisure hotel. It does comes across as quite a business orientated hotel. But couldn't argue with the price and the staff were extremely friendly.,5,2016,10,21
128,Great visit,"My boyfriend and I took a trip to London for our anniversary and needed a nice hotel near to Liverpool Street as we had planned all our activities around that area and this location was ideal.
We walked from the station which took about 10 minutes and it was easy enough to find as it was right next to the Barbican. 
We booked about 2 weeks ahead of time and got a reasonable price of around £200 for the pair of us for one night. However I did notice after we had booked that there was a cheaper deal that included breakfast so do shop around. 
The service was great and very informative. My partner and I aren't the poshest people in appearance not to say that we aren't presentable but we are late twenties early thirties (look more like early twenties) and in the past we haven't been treated as well when we book into a fancy hotel like this one. However there was no judgement and the service was consistent throughout the whole stay. The team are clearly well trained and led by a strong management team.
The hotel itself is fab. Really interesting building. The bar outside (not sure if it's affiliated) the jugged hare is pretty cool. Didn't go on this occasion but have been before on a work function and it's worth a visit even if just for a nightcap.
We had the basic double room which was all we needed. Nice size and very clean. Bed was comfy but the best thing about the pillows were the chocolates on top. Could have been softer but that's personal preference. No outside noise. Shower was nice two options either rainfall or handheld and my boyfriend enjoyed the bath. Appreciated the magazines particularly the one on Singapore as we are hoping to go soon! 
Nice late checkout at 12 which is rare! Big queue for checkout but it was handled very well. When I was served at the counter it took less than 30 seconds to check me out and we were offered the opportunity to leave our bags for the day without having to ask. When we collected our bags I was asked whether we would like a taxi called but we declined and took the short walk to Liverpool Street. 
Ideal short stay in London. Service was great. Would stay again. ",4,2016,10,19
128,Always a 'welcome back warm welcome',"I use this holiday on a very frequent basis, and when entering reception most people recognise me. So somehow it feels like coming home. And the treatment is accordingly, so when staying in the City it is clearly my preferred hotel",5,2016,10,19
128,Christmas at montcalm,"Beautiful hotel. Just a bit unorganised, had a very specific booking that wasn't well catered towards, had to move rooms 3 times and felt a bit under appreciated in the end. The staff were very helpful but I felt like I had to work towards what I had originally paid for. 

The rooms and the hotel itself are nothing short of perfection. Beautiful. Well maintained. Just the service is a cause for concern. ",4,2016,10,18
128,Amazing place,"Wow what a great place! From the moment we checked in,where we got a free upgrade, the complimentary wine and chocolates once the staff learnt it was partners birthday and the full duration of the stay the staff just couldn't do enough to make our weekend any more special. The rooms are great. The Jugged Hare restaurant is well worth a visit. A decent location where you can walk along the Thames to the west End in about 20 minutes.",5,2016,10,17
128,Fantastic service,"We had an awesome weekend stay. We were welcome by one of the managers and then taken to reception for check-in. Fantastic service and very welcoming, we had an upgrade on our room and offered a lot of help from everyone.
Very recommended and close to two underground stations. We will be back for sure!",5,2016,10,17
128,A little disappointed... but nice hotel ... just not WOW,"We stayed here for our 22nd Wedding Anniversary but unlike several guests who have  reviewed and had cards flowers etc we were not asked if it was a special occasion so didn't feel any of the 'wow' special feeling that other felt :( The room was an ok size for london. 

Check in was fine, porter took our bag to the room with us, which was helpful as room quite hard to find

 There did not seem to be any complimentary mineral water and although we stayed 3 night the fruit was not replenished and neither was the coffee on the first day. 

The bathroom was lovely with nice shower and bath and glass wall between bedroom and bathroom - though thankfully a blind could be shut so I didn't have to watch husband on toilet! 

Staff were polite and we didn't get to eat in hotel as out and about or use other facilities. Handy little hand held electronic tablet in room for internet use and tourist info. Position was good for the city, less handy in wanting theater and covent Garden area, but near tubes on circle line. 

Rooms clean and good standard of furnishings etc, best hair dryer ever in a hotel, bed comfy, slept well .. so nice hotel ... just not a 5 star WOW for us.",4,2016,10,17
128,Perfect stay - perfect hotel,"Have stayed at the Montcalm(brewery) many times and always had a very good experience. Very good value for money, helpful friendly staff. Very good rooms and accommodation, clean, modern and with great facilities. Recommend booking club rooms or wow suites allowing access to club lounge and facilities (so worth doing)
Will be back very soon.",5,2016,10,17
128,Amazing hotel in London,I was not expecting this kind of hotel and was very surprised by the quality and service of it. The room was very comfortable and full of nice details. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Location and price also very good.   ,5,2016,10,17
128,Proper customer service,"We stayed at this hotel to celebrate my birthday-a fact that Gracie from the GEX team at the front desk soon established on check in. Within ten minutes of unpacking, both wine and chocolates were sent to the room along with a lovely birthday message from her...proper service from a quality hotel.
The club room wasn't huge, but plenty big enough for our needs and a very comfy bed meant a good nights sleep. Definitely recommended!",4,2016,10,17
128,Great stay,"Booked this hotel as a surprise for my wife and we definitely weren't disappointed. The check in was quick and hassel free. Barbara the receptionist couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming along with the rest of the staff in the foyer area. We were shown to our room which was lovely and as it was a birthday treat there were petals and balloons on the bed and a nice card wishing her a happy birthday. She was also surprised with a lovely bunch of flowers, a bottle of wine and some chocolates . The room itself was quite small but it wasn't a problem and had a good selection of tea and coffee, fresh fruit, large flat screen TV, docking station. The bathroom had a deep bath and great rain fall shower with nice toiletries. We had breakfast included which was at the jugged hare and again the staff were fantastic and the quality of food good. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel after checkout whiIe we visited the city. I would recommend this hotel and will be staying again in the future. A really big thank you to all the people who made this stay special.",5,2016,10,16
128,Lovely hotel for weekend trip,"Visited here for a quick weekend trip back to London. The hotel had asked why I was visiting and left a birthday surprise of wine, cake and balloons which was very kind. The rooms are small but comfy ..good mini bar and selection of tea and coffee. Decent bathroom. Wifi connection was fine. Had breakfast at the nearby Cote. The hotel is really close to the Barbican and city but also a short walk from Old St/Shoreditch etc. Really friendly hotel staff and they will organise taxis etc for you as you'd expect. Have stayed here twice now and will stay again..",5,2016,10,16
128,Little bit of luxury! ,"This is s lovely hotel in a great location-close to tube links. Hotel itself is quite luxurious. Rooms well appointed with great facilities. Considering you're on a busy road, you can't tell as it's so quiet which bodes well for a good nights sleep. Pub next door is a nice place to hang out, enjoy drinks and go a bit of people watching. Their is s bit of staff overkill in reception though and when checking in, had a porter show us to our room (even though we only had hand luggage) which was unnecessary. Also, when we returned from a night out, a staff member had been into our room to what I can only think, was to make it up for the evening I.E removed all the throws, cushions etc from the bed-nice touch but it would have been good to have been informed of this service when checking in, as it felt a little bit creepy to think somebody other than the daily housekeeping had been in the room. Apart from that, I can't fault this place and would return. ",4,2016,10,16
128,Wonderful Staff,"The staff here was very accommodating.  They were very helpful with reservations, directions, and advice.  Vlad was fabulous!  He helped us many times with walking directions and ticket purchases.  I would recommend staying at the Montcalm.  
The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Turn down service was nice.  The breakfast in the lounge was average.  The Jugged Hare was nice little pub with great atmosphere.",4,2016,10,15
128,Lovely hotel with really friendly staff,"We visited for a birthday weekend celebration and I was really impressed that prior to our visit the hotel emailed me and asked if we were visiting for any special event. I was able to tell them it was my partner's birthday and when we arrived we found we had been upgraded to a club double room. The staff at reception also wished my partner a Happy Birthday.  We were taken to our room and shown around the facilities. There were balloons, some chocolates and bath bomb in the room for my partner. The room itself was quite small but it had a lovely big bed and a good size wardrobe. It had everything you wanted really including an iron, ironing board, tea and coffee facilities, bath robes, hair dryer (one that plugs in in the bedroom rather than a fixed affair in the bathroom!), large TV, safe, minibar etc etc. There was a really useful mobile phone provided in the room which we used on the Saturday to help us navigate around London (without using up our own batteries). The bathroom was quite small but there was a large, deep bath and a rainfall shower. The towels were large which I always like to see and the toiletries were of a good quality and smelt nice. The overall finish in the room was of a good standard and the quality of the tea/coffee etc was also good. The room was also very quiet (apart from Saturday morning when the bin men arrived ! ) and the bed was very comfortable too. 

This was our second visit to the Montcalm and we will certainly keep it on our list of preferred places for future visits to London. It was nice that they put on the little extra touches for my partner's birthday and nice to feel so welcome.",5,2016,10,12
128,An excellent deal,"I booked this through secret hotels on Lastminute.com
It was an excellent choice. 
My room was upgraded when I got there to a club room.
The room was fantastically appointed and had a large bathroom. 
The staff were wonderfully attentive.
It is right next door to The Barbican and so it hugely convenient 
It is 10 minute walk from either Moorgate or Barbican tube stations.
There is an excellent pub attached to the hotel but it is very busy!
I didn't have breakfast (a bit steep at £17) but walked 5 minutes north and had an excellent builder's breakfast at a local cafe for £6!
The hotel was quiet and all I could have wished for",5,2016,10,12
128,Amazing again!,"Second trip to the Montcalm at the Brewery after visiting last October.Don't usually stay at the same hotel twice but made an exception  after last years excellent visit.

So glad we booked again,friendly staff,excellent room and once again couldn't fault our stay.This hotel is looking to be our favourite London hotel.Looking forward to our next stay there.",5,2016,10,11
128,Loved it,"I thought staying in the business district of London might be a bit away from the action. However, there are enough bars etc around to keep most people satisfied. Checking in was very easy, with a very pleasant member of staff who insisted in showing us to our room. The room was bigger than I envisaged, quiet and perfect for our needs.
The reason why I am not giving 5* is because a member of staff burst in unannounced, albeit apologising profusely, and left immediately. Other than that, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2016,10,11
128,The place to be for a Weekend in London ,"Yes this is the place to be! We travel to London every year in October and this is by far the best hotel I have been to yet. 

Friendly staff all happy to see you. Makes you feel right at home.

The room was spacious enough. Bathroom clean. You're not going to spend a lot of time here. But those few hours of sleep are important. Bed was firm. I slept like a rock.

The area is quiet during the weekend. I guess most clients show up during the weekdays (given it's location). 

Just a couple of minutes walking to the tube (Barbican or Moorgate). 

We will be back again.",4,2016,10,10
128,Charming Hotel,"During my stay at the Montcalm Brewery Hotel recently, I found my stay extremely comfortable and surprising.
Staying in one of the hotels suites was a treat for me after a rotten start to 2016.
I have a few queries about the room, in that a few of the tiles in the bathroom were damaged (minor) and in need for replacing, squeaky floorboards, but then it's an old building, bath tub plug didn't want to stay down and due to the fact I was staying at the front of the hotel, noise levels increased due to close proximity of pub, but only for an hour. (Not really hotels fault)
Anyway room was extremely comfortable and cosy and I'd wished I could of taken the very nice four poster bed with me - best nights sleep I've ever had!
Made use of the rooms facilities, TV, tea and coffee and even ordered breakfast to the room, which was good too.
All in all a very nice stay and a good location if visiting the attractions close by: Barbican Theatre, Globe Theatre, St Pauls, etc.
Would definitely recommend a stay here.
",4,2016,10,10
128,Excellent city stop,"Great location with attentitive staff, comfort and style. Ideal for the travelling executive or tourists looking for an upscale experience.

The continental breakfast room has a feel of the grand city home.

Simgle room was very up to date and spotless, although above average size guests might struggle a bit in the shower cubicle.

I will definately return.",5,2016,10,10
128,Amazing experience ,I visited on Friday 7th October for my birthday! First off hotel is beautiful... staff friendly.. they went out their way to make the room lovely for my birthday with petals balloons.. free wine and truffles and a cute box with a bath bomb in and even a birthday card! So lovely and the most a hotel has ever done for our stay before. It was cute and memorable. Also the club room was stunning and the bath amazing loved the layout of the room and the style of it all. All in all perfect ❤️,5,2016,10,10
128,"Fine Hotel, Great Location","I must admit that my wife's and my reason for staying that the Montcalm at the Brewery medical--I was booked for a heart procedure at St. Bart's, which is only a five minute walk away. So this wasn't an ordinary break or holiday. We found the staff at the hotel to be warm, friendly and helpful. The room was above average, clean, well-appointed and with a terrific shower! We did not eat at the pub or restaurant operated by the hotel, because we were meeting friends at the nearby Wagamama. 

A quick glance at the location will tell you that the Montcalm is in an ideal spot for anything in the square mile of London, so is a great hotel for business or pleasure-or even a medical visit!

Now for the main reason that I am rating the hotel five stars. We had originally booked for two nights, as the heart procedure was meant to be 'routine'...but it wasn't. Thus I had to remain in hospital another three days. However, rather than turfing my wife out or hiking up the price, they actually gave my wife reduced rates as she was already under enough stress. How many places would do that? In our eyes, they earned every star.",5,2016,10,05
128,Great location in the heart of the city.,Stayed here for one night with my partner as part of a longer city break. After booking we were contacted by e mail to ask for an estimated time of arrival and if we had any extra requirements. I wish more hotels would do this it really does make a difference to start a dialogue with the guest before they arrive. As it happened we were not going to be arriving untill after 9pm so they ammended the booking to show this and provided a room service menu in advance on request. Room was very comfortable with good quality toiletries. Room service was prompt and delicious. Would like to return and see more of what this hotel has to offer.,5,2016,10,03
128,Full Marks for Customer Satisfaction,"We booked for a Friday night for a special occasion and were 'WOWED"" by the level of customer service we recieved throughout the duration of our stay. Without exception all the staff were incredibly helpful, friendly and efficent. We stayed in the well named 'WOW' suite, beautiful room, immaculately clean and with a VERY comfortable bed. Thank you SO much to all the staff and the management for making my wife's birthday memorable as was the super breakfast buffet in the Jugged Hare! - We will definitely be back!!!!!",5,2016,10,01
128,Brilliant,"Found this hotel via tripadvisor and it looked good.
Hotel itself is lovely, the furniture and fittings are very nice and the staff are lovely.
It's located in a bit of a weird spot but is only a 10 minute walk from the underground.

Only stayed for one night whilst seeing the sights of London. Would stay again.

The only downside was the movies were £15 which I think was way overpriced as was the tiny can of coke in the minibar for £1.50",5,2016,10,01
128,Beautiful hotel,Excellent service and very welcoming staff . Rooms are stylish and very clean . Good value for a 5 star hotel in central London . Helpful staff . Location is excellent and ideal for couples on a weekend break . Would definitely stay again .,5,2016,10,01
128,Ideal for purpose,"We stayed here 6 nights while at a conference in the Barbican.
Although the rooms can be a bit dark, they are spacious and I agree with the reported amazing bed comfort! Perfect sleep. The gym room is small and hot but better than none. There is a great (but busy) 30 m pool 15 min walk away on Golden Lane which made my visit. Also good shows on in the Barbican 3 min walk away. Great service.",4,2016,09,29
128,Lovely stay !,"Our daughter had recommended this hotel to us and we were not disappointed in the standard of our accommodation.
We stayed in the East Wing and enjoyed a quiet and very comfortable stay.
The room was typical of London size as it was a little compact but had all the amenities we needed including good tea and coffee.
The bed was very comfortable and the shower powerful and there was everything we needed.
The room was warm and the whole hotel was tastefully decorated throughout.
The only slight disappointment was the hotel did not acknowledge a birthday even though they were informed.",4,2016,09,29
128,"Helpful Staff, beautiful, comfortable and spacious room","I stay at the Montcalm regularly when I travel for work, and have never been disappointed. The rooms are quiet, dark and comfortable so it's easy to get a great nights' sleep. On my most recent stay I had a suite, and this was at an extremely high standard. I always look forward to a night at here. 

The only thing I'd say is that it would be good to have some hot options for breakfast, such as poached eggs.",5,2016,09,29
128,Location,"The Montcalm brewery was a lovely hotel. The reception was clean and the check in service was very efficient and prompt.

The hotel is spread out over a number of different buildings and floors. To get to my room we had to go through on door, down a hallway, go 2 floors up in a lift, walk down a long corridor and then go up another floor in a different lift. There were stairs along the way also. It was very confusing.

The room itself was comfortable but extremely small - even by London Standards. 

The breakfast served in a bar down the street from the hotel, which we got drenched while walking to it. It was quite tasty and the staff were very good. 

I would stay again purely for the location.",3,2016,09,28
128,Greta city hotel,"Stayed there for 1 night in September, really nice modern hotel  in a great city location with exceptional  service!  I love the lobby  and the beds are very comfy! Complimentary tea, coffee, water and fruit which was a nice touch. Well done all! Will return!",5,2016,09,28
128,Nice room...terrible view ,"Staff on front desk & porters all very friendly. Room was small but nicely fitted out as expected. The view was non existent. Looking out onto a concrete wall, I couldn't even see the sky. The room was also extremely noisy. There must have been the AC unit on the outside walk or something. I had to buy earplugs in the end. I would only stay here again if the hotel could guarantee I wasn't in a room with the same view and noise problems. ",3,2016,09,27
128,Excellent stay at The Montcalm Brewery,"I very much enjoyed my stay and felt very looked after by the excellent staff. The location is quiet at the weekend as the area is in the city but close enough to venues (such as the Barbican) for it not to feel isolated.

The room was very spacious (I booked a Club room but was upgraded to a Montclam Club) and had everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The bed was amazing meaning I slept very well (although it could've been all the walking I did!!)

Nothing is too much trouble for the friendly staff. I very much appreciated the e-mail in advance of my stay to check for any necessary special arrangements and the nice card and gift waiting for me in my room.

I would recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2016,09,27
128,A midweek break in London,Brilliant location!... So central!.. The hotel oozes of character ...old brewery full of charm yet comfortable. The layout of the rooms was somewhat confusing but fun at the same time. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble.  Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at the Jugged Hare... The suckling pig was  succulent ..shared a whole leg!!... Will definetely stay there again without any doubt ..,5,2016,09,27
128,Great weekend deals,"Third visit and again very friendly and efficient staff all round.

Comfortable well equipped rooms.

On edge of city with good access to multiple transport options. Several tube and overland stations in very easy walking distance.",4,2016,09,26
128,Excellent,"As you enter, there are very friendly staff to greet you and take you to your room. The room's area spacious and comfortable. 
Both the rainfall shower and the shower head, were lovely. Perfectly warm and the pull down seat for the rainfall part, was nice :)
Would most definitely go back and recommend to anyone",5,2016,09,26
128,FABULOUS!,"Unfortunately I was only here for a brief overnight trip.  I arrived late at night and had to leave early then next morning, but I enjoyed every minute here.
The service when I checked in was friendly and welcoming yet professional.  The rooms were extremely well appointed and very comfortable and clean.",5,2016,09,26
128,Disappointing,"Being a regular air traveler I pick up quite a few air miles and decided to use some to stay here.  Usually when I use miles for a hotel visit I feel that I'm getting the same service I would as a paying guest, however this was not the case here.  We were put in room 327........literally the furthest room from the front desk, I joked to the porter that it was because we were paying with points......he agreed!!  The room was small which I didn't mind initially, but the tiny window which you could barely open looked out onto a concrete wall about a metre away and the air conditioning barely worked.  The room felt claustrophobic.

Overall a disappointment.  It shouldn't make a difference whether you are paying cash or using points.",2,2016,09,26
128,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff","Very impressed with this hotel.  On arrival we were greeted warmly by the doorman who wanted to relieve us of our baggage. The friendliness continued with reception staff and concierge who took us to our room and provided us with lots of information about the hotel and its facilities. The room was small but clean with some great gadgets including a smartphone which provided free local and international calls. 
Club room beautiful and well stocked with drinks. 
If you want a lovely, friendly hotel in the middle of The City of London, it's perfect.",5,2016,09,25
128,Fantastic! ,"I recently stayed in this fabulous  hotel for 3 nights on business. It was a wonderful stay from start to finish. A thoroughly superb hotel with great, attentive, highly professional  staff. I cannot wait to stay again. ",5,2016,09,24
128,"Marginal in everyway, avoid unless no choice.","For specific business travelers that have to be in the City of London, even then, a marginal business hotel.

The works space / desk in the room is too small, inadequate, electrical outlets are minimal, public areas very marginal, actually non existent.

The restaurant nextdoor is also very minimal. 

Staff are mostly good, then you come across a novice. My room was not made-up until 4pm! But fruit was there!

Layout of room, although a very good shower, bathroom is minimal.

Far from Paddington station, far from and heavy traffic to the places of interest.

The place to stay to be out of traffic of London to visit specific business, otherwise, why this hotel?!",2,2016,09,23
128,Wonderful stay at a top class hotel,My fiance and I stayed in London for the weekend. We took in a show and a concert. We stayed at this hotel and quite frankly it was perfect. Comfortable rooms and beds. The staff were outstanding. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2016,09,21
128,Charming,"A charming place, has character. Also, very high quality interiors, including the rooms - very well taken care of. Bathrooms quite new, bedding and pillows good (more on the soft end), room silent.

On the downsides, the place looks like a maze. Not so practical to get around (fine if you go for a holiday of a few days, less so if you are a business traveller who stays 1 night).

Access to Moorgate/Liverpool street stations good. In the City. So location is good.

On the downside: check in with 3 open desks was slow (personnel efficient, but queue was long). Room service in the morning also quite slow (took 30 mins for coffee, croissant and fruit). Elevators are as busy as the tube (crowded and sometimes you gotta wait for the next).",4,2016,09,20
128,QAnother great weekend at our favourite London Hotel,"Another lovely en suite bedroom. Very comfy large bed, tea and coffee making, quiet room, nice bathroom with Hermes toiletries.   
We like the situation close to The Barbican Centre, tube and bus very handy, cinema and shops close by. St Pauls Cathedral close by and a nice stroll over the Millenium Bridge to The Tate Modern and its new extension.   Once the staff realised it was my birthday,they sent a card and a tray of goodies to my room. A lovely surprise.",5,2016,09,20
128,Fabulous ,"From the greeting at the door everything was 1st class. Comfy pillows and bed. Fab shower, complementary tea like nothing I've ever had. Tassimo coffee machine in the room as well. Great location for the Barbican centre. 
All in all superb",5,2016,09,20
128,Full of character ,My first stay and will not be my last. Staff were excellent throughout my stay. Room was a good size comfortable and clean with lots of character left over from the original brewery. Wifi excellent as was the shower. Breakfast was included a short walk to the jugged hare - plentiful buffet style with additions to order if required a very pleasant stay to be repeated on my next trip to the city. ,5,2016,09,20
128,Nice hotel,"First off, let me say that the room was nicely sized and quiet. The tea/coffee making facilities were nice, and the bathroom was nicely sized. The hotel was clean, and close to the conference I was attending. 
My reservation was for a Club Double room, however I was not given access to the Club Lounge. I was told I have to pay extra for this. Also, my room did not have the Hermes toiletries that were advertised. My room also was not marked as a club room, and I certainly hope I was not given an inferior room despite paying for the club room.",4,2016,09,19
128,Montcalm at the Brewery - Excellent Boutique Hotel,This 5* hotel was amazingly accommodating.  Our rooms were not ready upon our early arrival but the hotel staff worked to get my mother who was not feeling well a room right away and also gave us upgraded rooms.  Customer service is top notch.  Special mention to Adeel in the Club Lounge who went out of his way to make our stay wonderful.  Highly recommend this hotel even though it is not close to the major attractions.  Uber worked great for us.  Never more than a 10 minute wait.,5,2016,09,18
128,Loved it!!!,"It was our 7 year wedding anniversary and the staff were already delightful but once we had let it known they could not do enough for us!  

We really enjoyed the uniqueness and intricacies of the building the decor and outlay were really pleasing.  Would definitely stay again!   

Thought the price was a bargain as well!",5,2016,09,18
128,Birthday weekend ,"Stayed here this Saturday and loved the hotel from the moment we walked in, very plush and friendly, service has been brilliant. However we are staying in a Club Room on floor 1 and looks are deceiving.. Small things count to me and one being the curtains are not long enough for the Windows, the bed looked so comfy but when we arrived back at 1am to find we are sleeping on a collapsed mattress with 2 duvet covers on to to hide it, me and my husband have spent the night falling into a large dip in the middle and feeling like we have to cling to the sides! Normally I would have contacted reception but at 1am we just wanted sleep. Can say we didn't expect such an upmarket and expensive hotel to not up date mattress's when need. Other then that hotel is great but this has massively impacted on our overall experience.",3,2016,09,18
128,It's OK,"Was told breakfast was not included in my room rate whilst my booking showed that it did.
I explained this and was told to take it up with my agent who subsequently told me that breakfast was indeed included. Staff did not seem at all courteous to resolve and just said I had to pay extra for breakfast.
Was charged upfront for my entire trip too; have always been charged on checkout at other hotels which I found odd.
The room was dated, poor lighting and dark even though it was the height of summer. 
Had a room in courtyard building which made the layout awkward.
Won't be staying here again but it was functionally ok and convenient to my office but nothing special.
Having stayed in hotels all over the world - I had high expectations of a hotel in the City of London but this one did not quite meet the standard.",3,2016,09,17
128,Another amazing experience!,This is the second occasion me and my fiancée stayed at The Montcalm and once again it was a second to none experience. On this occasion we stayed in a club room and it was again excellent quality. The staff are all extremely friendly and welcoming. We stayed for my fiancée's birthday and once they knew this they made every effort to make our stay even more special. We love this hotel and will definitely be back again.,5,2016,09,13
128,"Wonderful hotel, even nicer staff","What makes this hotel so great is the staff. From the moment you walk in they are extremely pleasant and nothing is too much trouble. Our luggage was in our room waiting for us when we returned for the day. There was a little delay in checking in, but it wasn't an issue.

The rooms are lovely, though I must admit, our bathroom (Room 152) was showing some wear and tear. There are Elemis miniatures for use in the bathroom and plenty of tea and coffee.

The location is pretty decent, close to Barbican and Moorgate tube stations, but beware the Bank area can be quiet on the weekends.

Finally it's worth noting that we booked 'London City Suites' but there is no mention of this name anywhere. If you have booked a hotel by the same name, you are just looking for the Montcalm at The Brewery.",5,2016,09,13
128,Pleasant stay.,"It was definitely worth the upgrade to the Club room - basic facilities such as coffee machine provided in these rooms.
Staff on reception were really polite and helpful, so a positive welcome. Room was fine, all except the complexity of the light switches! Sounds crazy but I'm certain they'd been incorrectly wired and some just wouldn't switch on at all (despite all many combinations tried!) so the room was a little dark. 
Excellent location
Would stay again :)",4,2016,09,12
128,Best Hotel in London!,The Montcalm is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in; the location is perfect and the staff are really professional and helpful. We had breakfast in our beautiful room which was fantastic - 5 star service from the Montcalm.,5,2016,09,12
128,Great hotel and great service,"The service was excellent the whole stay. The rooms are very nice and clean. The bathroom was very cool with a class wall. 
We liked the location, it was not too far with the tube to the city centre and it was much calmer than the inner city on the weekends which was perfect for us as a couple. 
Special thanks to Vlad who help us with finding good places to visit and got us a great reservation at a wonderful restaurant.",5,2016,09,12
128,Susiep,"I stayed for 2 days and upon check in I was informed I had been upgraded.  Room was spacious and absolutely spotless.  The staff are so helpful and polite to you, nothing is too much trouble for them

It's was a wonderful stay, thank you to all the staff who made it so special.",5,2016,09,11
128,Wonderful!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend on the 9th September for 1 night. Everyone was extremely polite and helpful from the minute we walked in. We arrived a couple of hours before our check in time so they took our bags for us and we paid for our room. When we came back we received our key cards and was escorted to the room. The room was spacious and absolutely spotless, we had complimentary fruits and a tea/coffee bar. The room included an iron, a very powerful hairdryer, 2 pairs of slippers and 1 dressing gown (would have preferred there being 2). The bed was ridiculously soft, the best bed I've ever slept in. The bathroom was huge and came with cute toiletries. We left for the theatre and when we came back a couple of hours our room had been tidied a little, there were chocolates on the bed and we had our towels replaced. All in all I very much enjoyed our stay here and would love to come back again ",5,2016,09,11
128,Great service and perfect location,"We were treated very well by the reception staff as at first as they could not find our booking, it only a few minutes, they were very apologetic and upgraded our room. We were shown to our room and offered some free water, on bringing the water they also bought us a bottle of wine and an apology card for the mix up on our booking. Can't fault the service at all. Breakfast was great a full range of food for everyone's tastes and hunger levels. The hotel was located very well for exploring the central east part of London, only a 30 minute walk to tower bridge and 10 mins to St. Paul's. It was only a 10 minute walk to all the trendy hipster bars on shore ditch too. We had a great weekend and would definitely choose the Montcalm for our next stay in London. ",5,2016,09,11
128,Fantastic Birthday Surprise,I stayed here overnight on Friday 9th September as part of my 50th Birthday surprise. I loved every minute! I've stayed in 5 star hotels before.  This was excellent. Very helpful and polite staff without being operated top. The room was excellent as was the bed. Can't comment on the food or room service as didn't need it. Would not hesitate to book with this company again. Brilliant!,5,2016,09,11
128,its like living in luxury,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Montcalm, the facilities are amazing in every way. friendly staff, delicious food, comfy bed and towels and robes, good tv programmes and loved the free smart phone! definitely would recommend anyone whose popping into London for business!",5,2016,09,10
128,The hotel itself is nice - but some of the bedrooms are windowless,"I got a funny deal here.  It turned out that booking a flexible deal doesn't mean you can change you plans.  It means they can put you in any of their hotels in London - one of them is miles away in Marble Arch.  The prices are reasonable by London standards.

I pleaded with them to let me stay at the Montcalm as I was attending an event at the Barbican and it's over the road.  They let me but gave me a room in the basement where there is hardly any nature light.

That said, the beds are very comfortable and I was able to get a good night's sleep.

The air-conditioning didn't work very well and the room was very hot.  There was also a power cut while I was there.

The hotel has an excellent Mercedes transfer service to London City airport for £35 fixed rate.",4,2016,09,10
128,Great location and well worth a visit,"We visited the hotel and were pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of our room. Our booking was made based on location and we did not have much time to fully appreciate the hotel, but will call again when we are next in London",5,2016,09,09
128,Quite in the heart of City,"Was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel in the heart of City.  Rooms are very modern and well appointed.  Staff is extremely helpful, and the location is great. Tucked away on a quite street very near the Moorgate tube stop, the historic setting is unlike so many other newer hotels in London.  Definitely on my list for a repeat visit.",4,2016,09,08
128,Trip to London for a wedding ,Montcalm was lovely but didn't tell us they'd upgraded us from the suites which left us a bit confused about whether we were in the right rooms. Also the gentleman showing us to our room advised the 1/2 bottle of wine was complimentary and later we were billed £10 for it (was re-imbursed after a series of emails). Room was very nice but quite small (normal sized double). We wanted a treat as we're attending a wedding but we still can't work our whether we did!,3,2016,09,08
128,"Nice hotel, but needs improvements","Stayed here for 2 nights. The service at check-in was excellent, and the room was very spacious and really lovely. Elemis in the bathroom, very good hairdryer, plenty of items in the minibar. We also had breakfast, which was lovely - plenty of items to choose from and all really lovely. However, I was very disappointed with the 'Fitness Centre' - it is essentially a small room with 3 machines in it; it is full with 2 people in there. It was also absolutely roasting and just the worst conditions ever for a run!! Either improve it or just get rid. I was also a bit let down by the fact you only got one complimentary bottle of water for your entire stay, not each day - not what you'd expect from a 5*. Overall though, a nice hotel.",4,2016,09,08
128,"Not a 5*, not even a 4*-disappointing ","Booked two rooms at this hotel for two nights. On arrival was told that we had been upgraded two categories so was expecting something special when we got to the rooms (303 and 304). Rooms were basic, small, queen bed and roasting!! AC wasn't working and minibar wasn't restocked from previous guest. Told reception who said they would have it sorted. Arrived back to the hotel after our day out and show to find that mini bar was still not restocked and AC still broken. Phoned down to reception who said they would send someone to the room. Twenty minutes later, no one had arrived. By this stage I had got into bed as we had been travelling since 4.30am. After another phone call or two, someone came to the room. They said they would reset the aircon at the main controls. Half an hour later, still no aircon. Offered to move rooms at this stage, but we were so exhausted that we settled for a fan instead. Still no minibar restocked. After roasting all night, we asked to move in the morning. We were offered a complimentary breakfast in the club lounge which made it all a little better. Arrived at club lounge for breakfast to find no hot food. Just bread, cereal, ham and cheese. Not the usual 5* hotel breakfast. Eventually moved rooms to 133, which was a lovely spacious room with a king sized bed as we expected in the first room. Shower leaked in this room and flooded the bathroom floor. My parents who's AC also didn't work weren't offered to move room since they didn't make as many phone calls  to complain as we did. Staff were difficult to understand on the phone but pleasant in person. 

Hotel isn't as close to Barbican station as we imagined, 10 minute walk. 

Booked via booking.com and paid using a credit card on arrival. Checked my bank balance only to find that the hotel have held over £300 in my debit account that is linked to booking.com account, even tho the balance was settled using a totally different credit card on check in and an amount of £50 also ring fenced for other charges on the credit card. Very frustrating when my bank confirmed this today. 

Overall a very disappointing- wouldn't recommend and won't be back. Plenty of 3 and 4*s in London that are nicer and better value ",2,2016,09,07
128,Ok hotel,We stayed here from Saturday to Monday we found this hotel to be ok but nothing special. The air conditioning needs a serious overhaul the rooms on the third floor that we where allocated where far to warm. The staff are well trained and helpful. The hotel in in a good location not far from train station. ,3,2016,09,07
128,Great stay,"There is simply nothing negative to say about this hotel!
We had a great stay at this lovely hotel.

The closest Underground station is Moorgate - about five minutes walk.

Be aware that a lot of the sandwich shops/ cafe's in the are are closed during the weekend as this is primarily a business area.",5,2016,09,07
128,Absolutely Excellent Service,"I stayed at the Montcalm when I travelled to London to sit exams, and I would definitely stay there again. I had a ""mini suite"" across the road from the main hotel. It was quiet, clean and comfortable. Every member of staff I spoke to went above and beyond in their customer service.",5,2016,09,07
128,"Great Staff, Especially in the Club Room & Truly the Best Breakfast I have EVER Had","Love the wonderful service, here especially the great team in the club room that hand out free alcoholic drinks for an hour or so in the evening & free snacks & soft drinks during the day. Wonderful ex Gurkha, brilliant Pakistani gent & charming Romanian lady. The rooms are nice & front of house nice , communal areas could do with a lick of paint, but that's a tiny thing. Manager solved an issue I had quickly & lastly the full breakfast in the Jagged Hare is the best I have EVER had with a proper chef on hand to cook eggs properly, truly great spread of quality cheeses, meats fruits etc & everything the best quality. Think how much free coffee & snacks & a few drinks in the evening will save you if your looking at booking here.",5,2016,09,06
128,"Great location & wedding venue, lovely hotel, first class service,","The Old Brewary is a wonderfull conversion.
It has beautifully equiped & tastefully furnished bedrooms. 
Unfortunately, our bed was too soft.
In a flash, management organised boards to be placed under the mattress. 
The staff & management were very polite, efficient & most obliging.
We will definitely return soon & will certainly recommend this hotel to friends & family.",5,2016,09,05
128,Lovely hotel ideal for a weekend break,"We booked this hotel as we were visiting London for our anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by some lovely staff, particularly Paola and were pleased to be given a room upgrade to a club room. The room itself was lovely and spacious which is a rarity in London. There are a lot of light switches and it is confusing finding what each switch does. We found the handy device wasn't great but maybe didn't take enough time trying to work it out.  I wonder how much use it actually gets?
The bed was very comfortable and the scent pumped into the room was a nice touch.

We didn't eat at the restaurant as we wanted to experience Borough Market but the refreshments in the lobby were a lovely touch - very good coffee according to my husband!

The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk from Moorgate Tube Station.

We'll definitely be back!!",5,2016,09,05
128,Montecalm a real gem of a hotel,"We have just left this hotel after a fantastic city break. From the moment you walk through the doors you are greeted with a warm welcome from the porters to reception, which was a quick and easy process. The porter then took us to our room. Yes the hotel is split into all different levels but that gives the place some character. We stayed in a montecalm club room which was very spacious. Yes there was a few small issues the vanity mirror in the bathroom wasn't working. We did report this. But it still was not working when we left. 
You do get complimentary water but they do not replace it if you drink it on the first night. We stay in hotels across the world and all 5 star hotels do not quibble about complimentary water.
There were also some issues with some of the furnishings the glass table in the bedroom had clearly been broken in the past ,and had been repaired badly, also the toiletries shelf in the bathroom was loose.
Breakfast is served at the gastro bar attached to the hotel called the jugged Hare. Breakfast was good with a good selection. The only warning I would say is that it gets very busy and cramped on a Monday morning due to all the City workers having breakfast. So get there after 9am
I am finding it difficult to rate this as 5 star due to the issues that we incurred. It sits between 4 and 5 stars it just lacks the final Polish and finesse. ",4,2016,09,05
128,An anniversary I'll never forget! ,"We booked The Montcalm at the Brewery London to stay over the weekend for our anniversary. 

When booking, we found that it was an incredible deal for a five star hotel, and couldn't believe our luck when we paid just over £200 for two nights in a deluxe double room!

When we got there we were amazed by the grand entrance and were helped in with our bags and well looked after. They asked us for the occasion and we stated it was our anniversary to which they noted down. Our room wasn't ready as we checked in before our time, so we left our bags with the hotel and ventured out, before heading back to see our room. When arrived back we were amazed at the outstanding presentation and quality of the room, and were greeted by two towel swans, rose petals, a card and chocolates for our anniversary! 

Overall our room was absolutely stunning, facilities great, large comfortable bed and refreshments along with tea, coffee and fresh fruit. The bathroom as well was large and clean. The shower was also beautiful and it had a water fall setting where the water would fall from a fitted head in the ceiling! Lovely!

Staff were very helpful, kind and pleasant during our stay, holding open doors, asking us if we needed 'hot flannels' and just generally being helpful. 

The only fault I could really give the hotel is the price of the breakfast. We didn't book breakfast when we booked our hotel stay and asked how much it would be to add it on. We thought £17 per person, per day was a little steep, and decided we would eat breakfast elsewhere which wasn't a problem! It still didn't affect the enjoyment of our stay however as we were absolutely over the moon with our hotel! 

If you are going to London to celebrate, you can definitely do it in style here!  ",5,2016,09,04
128,City break,This is our 3rd visit here and once again very satisfied with all aspects of this very well run hotel. Courteous friendly staff and excellent rooms with key focus on customer service. Cleanliness comfy beds & toiletries all superb. Also great location. ,5,2016,09,03
128,5 star..... Maybe some rooms and where is the pool!,"Booked partially on the strength that it advertised on hotel sites it had a pool, only on arrival and asking for the pool were we told 'no pool' this along with the 3 broken floor tiles in the bathroom persuaded the hotel to first offer to move us the their sister hotel, that does have a pool or upgrade us to a Montcalm club room, we accepted the upgrade as we really could cope with packing up and driving to the other hotel.
The club room was much better, except for the noise from surrounding areas until the early hrs, not the most relaxing sleep!!!

Breakfast was served in the 'jugged hare' next door
Interesting no grapefruit juice on offer but pear juice which I poured thinking it to be grapefruit ( maybe a sign stating the options maybe an idea )
No granary bread but the rest of the breakfast on offer was pretty good and fresh",3,2016,09,03
128,Cracking stay,"Stayed here on our mini moon over the new year.
Fantastic hotel, would definitely visit again.
Situated in London city only 5-10 minute walk to tube station.
Very interesting bathroom with sliding screen.",5,2016,09,02
128,Couldn't Fault it,"Fabulous hotel, bar and restaurant. Service is second to none and nothing too much trouble for any staff. Room was top class with all the lovely touches to make our stay memorable, with the most comfortable bed I've slept in. Will definitely return in the future. ",5,2016,09,02
128,5-Star Business Hotel,"I like the joys and comfort that come with paying a premium for luxury accommodation. Sometimes you get what you pay for, other times you feel terribly short changed. The Montcalm was exactly what I anticipated. Previous stays in London have meant small cramped rooms, bad dining, and poor service.

Not at the Montcalm. From the moment you step in to when you get back into your cab, you're well received and attended to. The rooms were well serviced, clean and fresh. Staff were helpful, pleasant and polite and very very responsive to enquiries. The linen - awesome. I slept like a baby all three nights. The place was dead quiet - nothing to disturb you while you slumber. You have the option of fine dining at Chiswell or great bar food at Jugged Hare for dinner - both of which I tried and enjoyed.

Would I stay there again? Certainly! I hope to make the Montcalm my new home away from home when visiting London and will certainly be looking for their establishments elsewhere.",5,2016,09,02
128,Gracious and elegant,"I've stayed at the Montcalm on my last few trips to London, and it is splendid!
The staff is always warm and welcoming, and they never fail to look out for me. 
Since I am an mature woman traveling alone, this is important to me.
The beds are to die for... you sink into them and drift off with thoughts of Harry Potter, Hamleys, and the palace gardens dancing through your dreams... then wake up 10 hours later.
It's handy to St. Pauls, in the City of London, and even Covent Gardens is walking distance for the moderately fit.  Treat yourself!",5,2016,08,31
128,Quirky hotel in good central London location,"I liked most of what I found at the Montcalm Hotel. Nice service, decor, a great location for central London close to several tube stations and Liverpool Street rail station, and the Jugged Hare pub next door. The hotel is constructed from a number of older buildings and the joins show up in the form of stairs up and down and different wings, all of which creates an impression of confusion at times, but you get used to it. I liked the free and reliable Wi-Fi and the Nespresso machine in the bedrooms. Not so impressed with the shower in a bath as I prefer walk-in showers, but you can't have everything.",4,2016,08,31
128,Exceptional Service!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 2 year anniversary trip to Europe.The staff was amazing, they ensured our stay was extra special. We really enjoyed the club lounge perks. Would highly recommend this hotel, it is close to the tube and the service is exceptional.",5,2016,08,30
128,FANTASTIC! ,"Beautiful building and rooms; very nice, caring and competent personnel; well located; excellent services and equipment, including Nespresso machine in the room and free wifi; delicious food and wine in their restaurant.
Will definitely go back there",5,2016,08,30
128,Worth Considering for as a London base as a value 5 star hotel,"Just returned from a 3 night stay.
We were assigned room 251 which we were advised was an upgraded room.
A few very minor grumbles...old milk in the fridge obviously stored there by the previous occupants, a half used chocolate powder drink...all of which did not detract from a very pleasant room with all the necessary accoutrements for its 5 star basis.
The layout is interesting and always a challenge to develop/convert a listed Building of some merit into, in this instance a first class hotel.
Public transport is a few minutes walk...just about ok...but it may be more challenging if your purpose for the visit is located a distance away. If not the close proximity to The Barbican The City London Wall London Museum is could make this hotel option pretty fantastic.
Did not eat in the hotel. The Jugged Hare was a decent Pub which is attached.
The Weddings and events in the hotel were not too much of a distraction.",4,2016,08,29
128,Disappointing stay,"Hotel is beautiful and started well when given free upgrade. However room had faulty air conditioning and very frustrated at having to contact concierge on several occasions to reach a resolution. This was because had to chase the outcome after initially asking about the issue. Resulted in changing room at 10pm, to the original standard room we had ordered. With a small baby this was less than ideal. This was on the back of being walked through the hotel (with several steps so difficult with the pram) to the wrong room. Human error but did cost a lot of time to resolve and meant we were late getting to a wedding. Did get given a complimentary breakfast and an apology but left still feeling frustrated and expected a lot better for this class of hotel.",3,2016,08,29
128,Birthday Treat,"Booked this hotel as a surprise treat for my partners birthday. I was impressed by the communication from the hotel in advance of our arrival - emails asking the reason for our visit and giving helpful advice about the hotel and the surrounding area. On arrival we were given a free upgrade and also a bottle of wine and some chocolates for my partners special day. 
So far so good. 
However I'm not sure what we were upgraded to as the room was small but then again these are London rooms so maybe not too surprising. It said club room on our door. I see from reviews that others have been upgraded to a club room and have received breakfast included, that's very nice. We were given the option to 'prepay' for breakfast -£17 each (!!) instead of the normal £25 per person. 
So back to the room - quirky in that the bathroom wall is made of glass so you can see the bed, tv etc from the bath and conversely if you're in the bedroom you can see what is happening in the bathroom! Fear not, there is a mechanical blind system that reinstates privacy. 
Iron and ironing board in the room, very nice Elemis bathroom smellies included, bed was really comfortable.
Air conditioning was very effective. The windows were locked and unable to be opened. We didn't have a view from our room as this side of the hotel looked into the offices close by. We stayed over a hot weekend (28 degrees) so thank heavens for the air con. Complimentary bottle of water (x1) was in our room and a 3 piece fruit bowl too. The mini bar was extortionate, don't snack on the nuts without checking the mini bar prices first £4.95! A bottle of water from the mini bar was £3.95, didn't look at anything else after that. 
As others have mentioned the hotel was a bit of a rabbit warren, we had to take a lift to the first floor then walk a bit before taking a different lift to the fourth floor. Not a major deal. 
All the bedroom corridors are lined with mirrors but it's a good idea as it creates the idea of space in otherwise narrow areas. 
I was a bit disappointed to be honest, having stayed in many hotels I wouldn't really rate this as 5 star, but you don't know till you try. If I was coming back to this area I would look elsewhere and wouldn't automatically rebook. ",3,2016,08,28
128,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,"Hotel is stunning and the staff are lovely! The decor around the hotel is fantastic, did feel like the bedrooms didn't feel very 5* but the rest of the hotel is beautiful. We received a lovely welcome and were allowed to check in earlier. The price of the hotel was good value however the room service wasn't. Would definitely stay again, close to the tube and in a lovely area.",5,2016,08,28
128,Perfect City Getaway,"This hotel is perfect for a couple looking for a city break! The staff were lovely, and the room was amazing! We got the Deluxe Room (which unbelievably is the most basic) and we were amazed at how comfortable it was! My only complaint would be that our city view was obstructed, but that didn't matter to us that much! The hotel itself is in a lovely quiet location and is just a two minute walk from Morgate Tube station, so we found it easy to get into the city centre. We would love to go back to the Montcalm, and I have to say I can not fault them in any way!
This was our first time in London and we felt at home at this hotel.",5,2016,08,28
128,Aaron,"This hotel is superb, the staff are really nice and friendly. The room was ready for when we arrived and as it was my girlfriends birthday we had a bottle of wine with a happy birthday card in the room. 
  I would highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling to London in the coming months. 
  The location is in a quite area of the city, its easy to get around the city with Moorgate tube station only 5mins away. ",5,2016,08,28
128,Good place excelleng location,"We stayed for 5 days in a Club room & booking well in advance got a good deal. Room has no view - but us functional and has all the facilities you want. Staying around Barbican/Moorgate is good as you can get brekky at any number of places - City workers - and theres excellent coffee at Taylor St Baristas about 10m walk away. If u dont want or need to be West End, its a good alternative.",4,2016,08,28
128,Puzzled,"I am puzzled by the absence of poor reviews on this hotel.When we arrived we were given a tiny claustrophobic room.There was very little storage space for clothes in either the wardrobe or the tiny cupboards.Amazingly the 5ft mattress was lying on a 4ft6in.base which made the bed dangerous as it was easy to fall out which my partner did.After a poor night we complained and the very helpful staff upgraded us to a large comfortable Montcalm club room.The hotel is a converted brewery.It is the least guest friendly hotel I have been in.It is large and sprawling and consists of wings.It is difficult to find your way around.The way to our first room was up and down numerous sets of stairs with twists and turns in the corridors.The second room was much easier to approach.Breakfast was served in a pub down the road and you had to go into the open in order to get to it.However the breakfast was excellent.The position of the hotel is not really convenient being in the city and near the Barbican.I suspect it is mainly used by businessmen,conference and wedding guests.
",3,2016,08,26
128,Great London hotel,"Lovely venue, great facilities and very friendly staff. Differentiates itself from other business hotels. Innovative features in the rooms, like a glass wall so you can watch tv from the bath.

The jugged hate is their Gastro pub (attached), excellent food but a bit rushed. The starters arrived before the drinks!",5,2016,08,26
128,Just magnificent ,"For a special birthday weekend in London,  we booked the London City Suites but were upgraded to a Club Room at the Montcalm. From the moment we stepped inside we found the staff most welcoming and helpful. The hotel is beautifully decorated and magnificently appointment as was our room and bathroom - everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel. Comfortable bed, great wifi, free handy take away smartphone, fruit, water, chocolates, etc., etc. A great continental breakfast in included with the Club Rooms. It's six minutes to Barbican underground station and just a bit more to Moorgate. Because of our upgrade it was amazing value. 

We'd love to stay here again but feel that when word gets out it will become even more popular and so out of our price range but at least we have great memories of a lovely stay in 2016. ",5,2016,08,25
128,Great hotel highly recommend,"We stayed at this hotel from Friday 12th August to Monday 14th August. The hotel is great, well positioned to get into London centre. We had a club room it was modern,clean,quiet, large for a London Hotel. The hotel is a former brewery and can be a bit of a rabbit warren so I suppose if your are not too fit get a room close to the lifts.
The breakfast at this hotel in the jugged hare was really good and the service great. We also had diner there which was good and also at the Chiswell Street Dining Room which was also good.
The hotel staff are friendly and efficient and room cleaning top class.
In summary this is a fist class boutique hotel which we will stay at again when our travels next bring us to London.",5,2016,08,25
128,Very good ,"It was good hotel to stay. Well connected.
Staff was very co-operative. Especially the manager Neil Peters was very co-operative and efficient. 
Good comfortable stay. Good breakfast at jugged hare.
Can consider for your stay

128,Just delightful,"I've stayed at the Montcalm Brewery on 2 recent trips to London.  It is simply wonderful.  
Everyone is gracious, helpful and full of energy.   I recommend it to anyone... Business or just for fun. 
It's located in the city, handy to St. Paul's, the tube, and the financial district. 
",5,2016,08,24
128,Simply perfect,"As soon as we entered this hotel we were greatly impressed by the kindness and efficiency of the reception and the great atmosphere overall. But what really surprised us was the beautiful room we had and all the facilities that were there. From the iPod totally free at our disposal,that soon became our best friend,the fruit basket,the Hermes toiletries and much more. And the price paid was pure budget! We've decided that going back to London we can't do without our Montcalm.",5,2016,08,23
128,My new favourite hotel,Stayed here for two nights with my fiance and was impressed from the moment we walked in the door until we checked out.  The facilities are second to none. My favourites included sky sports tv channels in the room and a mobile smart phone with a built in city guide for use (with free international calls). The staff were all amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody visiting London. ,5,2016,08,23
128,Stay somewhere else,"I stayed at the Montcalm last week on a quick trip to London. It was my first time staying at the hotel and, based on my experience, it will be my last. 

Good
- The hotel lobby was charming... the photos they have on their site are representative.
- The staff was welcoming and helpful.

Neutral
- The room was very small and cramped. I somewhat expect this from rooms in the UK and Western Europe in general, but this was far and away the tightest room I have stayed in. I was traveling by myself this trip... two people in their king room would have been crawling over each other.

Bad
- The first thing that you find when you get there is that the hotel is split up across multiple buildings on the street. Some may find this quaint, I found it very inconvenient. The lobby was in one building, my room was across the Chiswell Street in another building, the gym in another, and seemingly the restaurant in yet another. The staff describe the hotel as a labyrinth and they're right... someone is actually assigned to you to guide you to wherever you need to go... you would be wandering around otherwise.

- Next, the room was in need of repair. The shower, in particular, had the knob for water practically hanging off of the wall. The charm of the hotel went totally out the window with this. 

- Part of the room being cramped was the ""closet"". It was about 1/3 the size of a normal closet, which would have been fine (I only had one suit and a shirt to hang up). The problem was that into the already cramped space they put an ironing board (in the closet). Basically you can't hang your stuff up without it touching and folding around the ironing board. This is a clear case where less is definitely more. 

- With a little jet lag coming from the U.S., I was up bright and early the morning of my departure so I went to use the gym (I definitely needed an escort to find it). Sadly, the small gym had no air conditioning and shared a wall with their sauna... I'm not kidding when I say that it was about 85 degrees Fahrenheit and about 80% humidity. Not to be deterred, I got on the stationary bike. The left pedal was a little wobbly but I pressed on. About 10 minutes into my ride, the pedal came flying off. Workout aborted. 

- It was about 6:30am when I left the gym so I figured I'd try the breakfast. I navigated my way back to the building with the lobby where they pointed me up a flight of stairs, essentially across a bridge, and back into the building with the gym to get to the restaurant. It wasn't open for breakfast (the folks in the lobby didn't think about that particular detail).

Checkout was a breeze and it will be my last at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City.",2,2016,08,23
128,"Very nice rooms, great service :)","I stayed at the Montcalm Brewery for a long weekend and it was fantastic.
The rooms are great, Big.
The Service is amazing, so I highly reccomend this hotel.
If you want to be down town you should choose another Montcalm hotel, bit I will definitely be back :)

ps. it has one of the best wifi I have had in hotel :)",5,2016,08,23
128,Impressive,"Recently visited for just one night with a friend. Got a great deal and wasn't expecting to be quite as impressed as we were.
Bowler hatted doormen to greet you and a lovely reception area with beautiful flowers and big sofas.
Busy with some sort of 'do' which made it feel slightly chaotic but probably all under control.
Disappointed that our room wasn't immediately available despite it being after 2 but we went for drinks and received a call within 40 minutes. 
We were shown to our room by the splendid Tudor and our luggage was already in the room.
All staff we encountered were highly professional and extremely helpful.
Couldn't work the tv for the life of us but no matter. Nicely appointed room, astronomical mini bar and room service, comfy beds. Great bathroom.
Turn down service provided whilst we were out at dinner. Chocolates on the pillow...
Great nights sleep.
Check out quick and painless. They happily stored our luggage which was very easily retrieved later.
The area is quiet at the weekend with a lot of places closed but would highly recommend and definitely return.",4,2016,08,22
128,Business Trip,Great hotel in terms of convenience visiting the City. Hotel is of a very high standard and has a couple of good value places to eat out at nearby. Highly recommend if you need to be in that part of London.,5,2016,08,21
128,Beautiful and spacious WOW suite,"We came back to this hotel for a 10-day business trip and stayed in the WOW suite. This room is really spacious and perfect for a longer stay in the city. It featured a large four poster bed which ensured good sleep.
The hotel itself is centrally located if you're doing business in the London city area - and for everything else are two tube stations close by.
The head concierge had always an excellent restaurant recommendation for dining and was also very helpful in arranging the reservations. The whole staff was very friendly. The breakfast in the hotel restaurant had a good selection of warm and cold items. Make sure you avoid the ""rush hour"".",5,2016,08,21
128,Fantastic 5 star experience,The minute I walked into this hotel I was made to feel special - the staff were fantastic.  The room was also lovely and quite spacious for London.  I particularly liked the free fruit and water in the room.  Breakfast in the pub round the corner was also great - awesome bacon.  All in a fantastic hotel and a very enjoyable stay - I wish I'd stayed longer!,5,2016,08,21
128,Beautiful Hotel and wonderful staff.,"Beautiful room, very comfortable. We were greeted by very helpful, friendly and welcoming staff member's who showed us to our room and were more than helpful. An exceptionally pleasant stay was had by us both.",5,2016,08,21
128,Very modern and quiet location in the cityq,"When we first arrived at the hotel we were very impressed.  We stayed in a room across the road from the main hotel in a small but very well presented room.

Couple of drawbacks....
1. A garden bar was set up out the front of our ground floor room and was a little off putting 
2. The bathroom looked fabulous, very modern and sleek however when having a shower water went everywhere.  The screen are inadequate and resulted in having to wipe down almost every surface, toilet, hand basin, floors after each use.  
3. Although air conditioned, it did not cope in the ""33 degree heat wave.  Very stuffy and a little uncomfortable.

Overall, the beds were comfortable, modern fixtures and fittings, coffee and tea making facilities and despite the few issues, a very nice 1 night stay was had.",4,2016,08,21
128,Work stay,"Great find in the heart of the Barbican, very clean, modern and super professional staff. Would prefer not to tell everyone what a find it is as I wont get a room next time. Didn't try the breakfast as business meeting held at the greasy spoon nearby.",4,2016,08,19
128,London luxury,"I stayed here for one night for a work trip. The rooms were large and had everything you wanted except curtains!!! The blinds were ok but let quite a bit of light into the room. 
The bathroom and shower were great, bed was very comfortable and the staff were the friendliest I have experienced in London. 
Breakfast was great with a huge choice. Would absolutely recommend and stay here again. ",4,2016,08,19
128,Great location,"This is a very stylish hotel and is in a great location for the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was nice and we even had our own kitchen area, which was limited but useful. We managed to get a very good rate and even had our room upgraded.  ",4,2016,08,19
128,Great experience,"My company chose this hotel for me to stay during a weeks course in London. We were very pleased with the room and the location was excellent, in the heart of London around many restaurants and shops. Staff were exceptionally pleasant. We had a wonderful stay. ",5,2016,08,19
128,Lovely,"Great hotel with very helpful and friendly staff. Room was lovely, with great facilities in it. Room was cleaned in he morning and again during turn down service! Would definitely return here - great value for money. Highly recommended and only a few minutes walk from the closest underground station.",5,2016,08,19
128,Wow suites are excellent,"We stayed for one night in a WOW suite and also enjoyed dinner at the Jugged Hare next door.  The suite was large with a contemporary feel, even though the four poster was quite traditional.  The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable.

The bathroom had a large tub with shower over, with lovely toiletries and fluffy towels, it has a very luxurious feel.

The hotel is located a 5 minute walk from Barbican Tube which was very handy for getting about.  The area is also really quiet, so for a relaxing weekend it is an excellent choice.

Our evening meal at the Jugged Hare was very good, excellent and tasty dishes and a few nice drinks to wash it down with.  

Breakfast is served in the Jugged Hare in the mornings, which was included for us in our room rate, but was a bit disappointing.  The scrambled egg was a bit watery and some of the other hot items were not appetising at all.  The choice of yoghurts and cereals was a bit lacking, with mine being room temperature rather than chilled.  My OH enjoyed the bacon though, which was very tasty and some of the best bacon he has had.  When we were seated we were offered tea or coffee, but the coffee was terrible.  We later went to the club room to have a decent coffee from the excellent coffee machine in there.  The juices at breakfast were in stainless steel jugs with no notes to indicate what they were - bit of juice roulette - some labels needed!

Overall a really good stay, great rooms, excellent evening dining - just a few tweaks at breakfast and then it would be perfect.",4,2016,08,18
128,What a place,"Definitely my favourite hotel I've stayed in London. So many added touches and hands down the best customer service around from the moment you arrive. We had a club room and the additional extras with this were very welcome. I won't go into too much detail as I think it's all part of the enjoyment discovering it all. You won't be disappointed. 

Location wise it's easy to commute around from; the staff are very knowledgeable and approachable to help. 

Enjoy ☺️",5,2016,08,17
128,Wonderful luxury in perfect location ,"I stayed here for a work trip to London, and I'm very impressed.

The building is lovely, and rooms (we had Club rooms) a good size and well equipped.

We required accessible rooms, and both were well laid out and spacious. Only criticism would be the size of the shower seat - tiny!

Continental breakfast was lovely, the club lounge is very relaxing - I wanted to linger over breakfast.

",5,2016,08,16
128,Good hotel in general ,"My husband loved the hotel, it was from return of our disaster hotel overseas. Bed was super comfy and very quiet. Everything is pristine in the suite we had across the road facilitated with high quality kitchen and bathroom. It is a proper high class decor if you are fed up with some the so called five star but shower is not the best even. 
A bit ironic was I ordered Salmon toast etc.... For my breakfast and my husband had simple one too. It took a long time before they could take it over to our room, we end up on our way checking out ate breakfast in the bar. Only to find my breakfast without Salmon I asked for. A bit surprised since everything seemed so perfect up to this point:(  ",4,2016,08,16
128,Worth the money!,"Great overall stay, quality room and lovely service from hotel staff who really went out of their way to make our stay (balloons and complimentary wine for a birthday celebration!). We were upgraded by the hotel staff and the Montcalm Club room we stayed in was amazing. Air-con, blackout curtains, the king sized bed, and being able to watch the TV from the bath made our stay outstanding. The tour guide handset available in our room would definitely be helpful to anyone who didn't know what to do with themselves in London. The immediate area is on the quiet side but its within ten minutes walk of more active areas, Barbican, Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations. Utterly deserved of a 5-star rating and I'd recommend it to anyone!",5,2016,08,15
128,Amazing ,"We celebrated my wife's birthday with a stay at the Montcalm and a few other treats. We were greeted famously and the interior of the reception is incredible. Never stayed at The Montcalm before so wasn't really sure what to expect in terms of service. But they were 2nd to none. After getting in touch a few weeks before arriving and letting them know we were celebrating my wife's birthday they offered so much which was hugely appreciated. We had an upgrade on pretty much everything. Couldn't believe our luck. The room itself was amazing, huge comfy beds, luxury items, big tv, iPhone docking station (old generation). Fully stocked mini bar, everything you can think of. Location of the hotel was perfect, we were going to the ballet in the evening with a stop off at a cocktail bar which was 3mins down the road!
Check out was painless, I had paid online during the booking process so everything was done. Can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2016,08,15
128,Excellent hotel - perfect for weekend break,"This is the second time that we've stayed at this hotel.  The facilities are excellent: quality of the room relative to the price are good.

However, the best thing is the quality of the service of the staff.  They are universally friendly and helpful.  They also took care of little things.  As an example, we left a hairdryer in the hotel on our last stay; the hotel were kind enough to volunteer to send it on.  Through a mishap, it never arrived.  However, when we came back this time - the hotel gave us a new hairdryer as a sorry/loyalty reward.  This is the kind of unique service that stands this place out.

The rooms have good décor - they may start to need a little bit of a refurb soon but still very good.

The food at the Jugged Hare is excellent - both for dinner and breakfast.

Although the location is slightly away from the centre of things (being in the Barbican area), this is actually an advantage.  You are close enough to the centre of town but also can enjoy being away from the hub-bub.

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2016,08,15
128,"Comfortable, City hotel. Modern facilities in an historic building.","I have stayed several times at ""The Montcalm at the Brewery"" and have found the staff to be consistently accommodating and friendly. The hotel itself provides high-quality, modern features within the old Whitbread Brewery, and is ideal for The City (with several major law firms nearby), as well as being literally two minutes from the Barbican Arts Centre and from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Moorgate tube is a five minute stroll away.",5,2016,08,15
128,Nice short city break,"This hotel is in a very central location, having quick connections to both King's Cross and Liverpool Street Stations. It offers a very comfortable accommodation experience as well as an outstanding breakfast. Staff are extremely welcoming and helpful. The rooms are well maintained, clean and provide good isolation from external noises. We appreciate the fact that the hotel puts a lot of thought into making each stay an enjoyable experience. An example of this is the complimentary smartphone available in the room with plenty of useful touristic information.",5,2016,08,14
128,Excellent ,"I have just spent 2 nights here for my boyfriends birthday and I simply can not fault it. The hotel is stunning and the staff are friendly, helpful and attentive. They upgraded us for free and gave us some chocolates and prosecco which was a lovely touch. 

I would definitely stay here again, thank you Montcalm.",5,2016,08,14
128,Convention,"Room nice although there was a pillar support right at the side of the bed so you had to be careful going round the bed as you could walk into it!! 
Breakfast was a nightmare as you had to queue for ages as there were not enough tables . Long walk from the room to breakfast . Choice of food was not brilliant.",4,2016,08,13
128,Amazing first visit - we'll definitely be returning,"We had a superb visit to this hotel. Having stayed in a number of hotels in London, I felt I wanted to write and just say how fantastic the staff are here. I contacted Alice ,the Guest Experience Manager a couple of times before our visit, and she exceeded my expectations of assistance every time, extremely helpful and responsive. The reception welcome on arrival was warm and friendly and everything was just as arranged. I was so thrilled with our room, the champagne I had arranged was already on ice and the room was spotless and beautiful. Around the hotel they had nice touches like coffee and tea with takeaway cups by the lobby lifts in the morning, nice to pick up before heading out.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for a special but very reasonable city stay. Close enough to walk to many London sights and a 10 minute walk to London Bridge and a chance to stand and see the Tower, St Pauls, the Shard etc - a lovely walk along the river on a summers evening. We're looking forward to our next visit already.",5,2016,08,13
128,Perfect romantic break,I booked the hotel last minute due to the weekend looking miserable with poor weather. I opted to upgrade the room and although not a perfect location you are not far from central London even by cab. The room was exceptional and breakfast something you can take time over reading the Sunday paper.,5,2016,08,13
128,Beautifully modern and traditional blend,"So many hotels to choose from in London, so pleased we chose this one. So beautiful and clean, the 'wow suite' is fabulous! Absolutely love it. Also I would like to say a special thankyou to the reception staff, helpful and kind and welcomed with a smile :)

X",5,2016,08,13
128,Fantastic hotel - will definately return,"We stayed for one night only but could easily have stayed longer. The staff are wonderful and couldn't do more for you. Set in an old brewery, the hotel is quirky and interesting. The extra touches, like the turn down service at night with chocolates left on the pillow made us feel very welcome. If you stay here make use of the Cheswell Street Dining Rooms for dinner and the Jugged Hare for breakfast - all owned by the hotel. If you are a visiting for a West End break it is probably further out than you might want but tubes, buses and taxis are plentiful and knowing London well this wasn't an issue for us. The rooms are small but not uncomfortably so and  have absolutely everything you require for a wonderful stay. Very clean, comfortable beds with great pillow all made for a great nights sleep. As a regular traveller having stayed in many hotels across the world this hotel is amongst the best we have stayed.",5,2016,08,13
128,Slightly disappointed,"Good points 1) location - just a quick walk to the barbican or moorgate tube stations.  There's no need for a taxi. 2) it was very quiet at the weekend. 3) lots of nearby cafes for a quick breakfast (mostly closed at the weekend though). 4) very pleasant staff member who showed us the way to our room.

Bad points 1) Disappointed with the size of the room.  It was cramped and there was little room for clothes in the wardrobe.  The bathroom was small too with hardly any room to set out toiletries.  It would have been really annoying for more than the one night we stayed.  2) the bathroom didn't strike me as being super clean perhaps it needs an upgrade. 3) the lay out of the hotel is more irritating than quirky. 4) no view, just two high windows which were filthy.

Maybe we were unlucky with our room.  Overall, it was okay but I wouldn't stay here again.",3,2016,08,12
128,A great stay in a quiet area,"Overall, our stay was really nice. The improvement that we'd love is a better location. It was a tiny bit too remote for us; we took a cab often whereas we'd prefer to walk more often. However, we stayed over a weekend, and as this is the business district, many cafes and shops were closed. During the week, I'm sure it's more lively. There is a grocery close by, and a few cafe's a bit further along. The staff are friendly, and the hotel itself is quite beautiful. We were concerned when we saw large parties booking out the courtyard, as we feared excess noise and commotion in the evening. However, the hotel is well-maintained, and our rooms were very quiet, despite the festivities. I'd certainly recommend this hotel!",4,2016,08,12
128,Great hotel and location,"I visited here with my partner on a weekend trip to London. We arrived into the city around 10am and were able to leave our luggage worn the concierge until we checked in later that afternoon. When we got to our room the luggage was waiting for us which was a nice touch. 

The room was very comfortable and clean with a lovely bathroom and all necessary amenities. 

I had chosen the location as it is in the City so would be quiet on a weekend with no workers around and that was the case - slept like a baby!

We didn't have the breakfast there so can't comment on that. The staff we encountered were all lovely. 

The only slight gripe (which I should really have mentioned when checking out) is that we checked in mid afternoon then went out early evening until about 11. When we got back a laundry bag had been left on the bed. This was a) unecessary as we were staying one night only and b) seemed a little odd that someone had been in the room when we were out. But other than that a fabulous stay at a good price for London. We will definitely stay again.",4,2016,08,10
128,Short visit for one night,"One of the best hotel I've visited, superb beds, luxury bathroom, looovely staff.
The fact I didnt give it 5 stars is that even though its right in the middle of London its quite far from the most popular places so taxi is always the way. The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night (no fire though, thank god!) but hey, its security so I cant be mad about that :)",4,2016,08,10
128,"In the City on business? Here's where to stay.""","This is an outstanding hotel for those working in the City of London on business. Absolutely a great location, and the Montcalm offers impeccable service at an extraordinary value for that part of town. Everything is tailored to the business traveler, and they make it seamless. 

The gym is open 24 hours, should you want to fit in a workout amongst a busy schedule. The attached pub, The Jugged Hare, has great food, a friendly staff, and an even better beer and whiskey selection for those looking to unwind. Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,10
128,Superb Hotel for 40th Wedding Anniversary!,"It was our 40th anniversary and we were given a complimentary upgrade and staff had noted our celebration and welcomed us.The room was extremely comfortable - the flowers and chocolates I'd requested were waiting in the room on arrival and staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Even without the upgrade, the price inclusive of breakfast was one of the best I've found in London at a luxury hotel. I wish I could breakfast in ""The Jugged Hare"" every day! The hotel made our weekend away one to remember - I'm sure we'll return.",5,2016,08,09
128,Great experience,"Good location, interesting and charming.  
standard rooms are small but luxurious.   Staff is always smiling and very helpful/client oriented.  
I had a small problem in the room with the tele and was solved with a smile by maintenance.",5,2016,08,09
128,Amazing romantic night stay at The Montcalm,"My boyfriend and I booked this hotel to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. When checking in, we were told that our room had been upgraded to a Montcalm Club room and that we were able to check out at 3pm the following day. We were so pleased..little extra touches that made our stay even more special.
Our bags were taken up to our room by the porter. The room was so spacious and exactly what we wanted. The bed was huge and probably one of the most comfortable we have slept in. The bathroom was lovely. There is a see through wall which means you can see from the bathroom in to the bedroom. Being a couple, this was not an issue for us. But there is a an electronic blind that will come down if you are not comfortable with this. There was a box of chocolates and a card in the room, wishing us a happy anniversary. When we arrived back to the room after going out for dinner, there were two swans made from towels shaped in to hearts and rose petals scattered across the bed. A lovely touch. Little things like this set this hotel apart from the rest. 

We had some drinks and snacks from the minibar and were not charged for these.  
We had a very memorable stay at The Montcalm and would not hesitate to stay there again. Service and accommodation were exactly what you would expect from a 5* hotel in London.",5,2016,08,09
128,A truly wonderful place,"Have stayed here on numerous occasions with my wife and it never fails to deliver. The staff here are exceptional. The front of house manager Hiral who we've met many a time, always has time for a friendly chat and to make sure that everything meets our needs 👍
Rooms are a very high standard with probably the most comfortable beds  I've slept in.
We always choose to eat in the adjoining pub The Jugged Hare which has always served up beautiful dinners and once again the staff are very attentative. They also serve their own ale which is always my choice. Luckily enough we had a nice sunny day so was able to bask in the sunshine at the Long Arm lounge situated across the road. It's all decked out with furniture and is a great place to relax.

To all the staff at The Montcalm and the Jugged Hare that make this place a truly wonderful experience, keep up the excellent hospitality.",5,2016,08,09
128,Excellent stay,"This hotel was fantastic in all aspects. Smooth check in, great rooms, lovely staff and good value. I could not fault this place, nice rooms and great location.

The breakfast is simple but nice, the bar and restaurant attached was pleasant, tube station 5 mins away, bed very comfortable and really good value for London prices.",5,2016,08,08
128,Great hotel and great location,"We stayed for 2 nights celebrating a friends 40th Birthday. The hotel were fantastic and made my friends birthday weekend extra special with little extras courtesy of the hotel. All staff were very friendly, professional and attentive. Rooms were a little worn but on the whole clean and of good standard.",4,2016,08,08
128,fantastic weekend away,Beautiful building. The best staff very helpful and attentive. They made our stay an absolute delight. The Jugged hare food was amazing. I could not rate this hotel high enough first class. Big thanks to all the Hotel staff,5,2016,08,07
128,Excellent hotel with poor practices,"Stayed for one night in August. 
Positives
- Very helpful staff
-Well run with excellent facilities
- Rooms are well laid out with excellent design and with a comfortable bed and excellent bathroom and shower.
Negatives
- I asked to receive no advertising mail on check in. However within twenty four hours had received just such marketing tripe 
- Was told that a copy of my credit card details would be taken for any unexpected charges. However instead they took £50 from my account and held it in their account. I was told it would be returned once my room had been inspected for any unexpected damage or eating of nuts. However I was told this was not a charge. I pointed out it was and that such taking of money was not appreciated.  I am still waiting for my money to be returned. 
- Nothing in the room should be seen as complementary even the bottle of water, or biscuits. It took some effort to find out but a small jar of cashews if eaten would have cost me £7. 
I feel a clearer marking of costed and non costed items in the room would help avoid unpleasant charges.",3,2016,08,07
128,Beautiful place,We stayed at the Montcalm after getting engaging and shopping at Hatton for a ring. The entrance was stunning the staff were all very nice they threw in a free breakfast and lunchtime snack with drinks they also sent a lovely card and some sweet bit to the room which was a nice touch. The rooms were very nice bed was really comfortable. Really enjoyed my stay there is also a handy tablet you can take in the street to show you places to go ect with free internet connection. If I'm in the area again Hopefully not for another engagement ring Id have no hesitations in going back to the Montcalm.,5,2016,08,07
128,Amazing,"Visited London for the weekend, and this hotel didn't disappoint. The pub next door is a great little place and the hotel it's self is in a really good location. Rooms were beautiful and the breakfast was also included in the price, which was great. I would recommend this to anyone and stay here again. ",5,2016,08,06
128,"Wonderful hotel, brilliant staff!",Building with a lot of character although quite a maze as it was a brewery in its previous life. Very well furnished and comfortable rooms and excellent house keeping. Had to get some clothes washed and ironed late in the night and was facilitated very well. Will be staying there often as I travel to London frequently for work.,5,2016,08,05
128,Brilliant Stay,"My fiance booked this hotel for 3 nights as a surprise while we were in London (as opposed to staying on our friends sofa!!). We had such a great stay - the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was beautiful and the bed was oh so comfy!!! It was great having the pub (Jugged Hare) downstairs also. Whilst this hotel isn't located in the heart of all London's attractions, it is so easy to walk to Shoreditch, and the Barbican tube station is only a few minutes walk away, making it super easy to get where you need to go! The plus side of it not being right in the busy centre was also that it was so peaceful and quiet!! I had 3 amazing sleeps here, which was exactly what i needed after a 30 hour trip and a few hectic days! Will definitely stay again when we are back in London.",5,2016,08,04
128,A very nice Hotel,"The hotel is very close to the Barbican, and is therefore a little bit away from London's main attractions, however this gives it a real air of peace. Rather disjointed inside and is a little confusing when it comes to finding your room, with multi trips in lifts to different floors.",4,2016,08,04
128,Fantastic,"I booked this hotel as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend. What a wonderful surprise it was. He is visually impaired and they were more than accommodating of that. They also surprised him with balloons and rose petals on the bed, a bottle of wine and complimentary bath products as I mentioned how much he loves his baths! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and we will definitely be returning. Thank you!",5,2016,08,03
128,Rather disappointing stay…,"Booked this hotel as a surprise for myself and my boyfriend, as we had heard amazing things it. Upon arrival the hotel is visually beautiful and the gentleman who greeted us at the entrance was extremely polite and charming. Checking in was a quick and fuss free process, an additional £50 is requested to be paid upon arrival, to cover any potential damage/mini bar usage. Following such formalities, we escorted up to our room by concierge. We were staying in a double room and the finishings in the room were a realistic portrayal of what was advertised on the hotels website. The only issue we had with the room was that the air-conditioning was extremely temperamental! Our room was either way to hot or way to cold and when we did try and adjust the temperature to our needs, the air-conditioning made an awful noise which made sleeping extremely difficult! Upon checking out of the hotel we were asking if we had used anything from the mini bar (given that it was extremely expensive we didn’t, but then again we tend not to unless we really need to). It was not until the following morning when I checked my account did it come to my attention that I had incurred additional charges. I rang the hotel to enquire and was told that I had been charged for the use of the mini bar (a bottle of prosecco to be precise, which is funny given that we rarely drink). I explained that the mini bar had not been used and was informed that the supervising manager would contact me later that day to rectify the issue in question. I waited the entire day and heard nothing. I thus took it upon myself to call the hotel again, I was then informed that manager had seen this issue but had no contact details for me, despite me leaving these earlier on the day and providing them to the hotel when booking the room in the first place! I was then informed that it was too late in the day to process a refund and that I would “hopefully” have this authorised by tomorrow but this could not be guaranteed. Until now I remain clueless as to when my refund will be processed accordingly. For a stunning hotel there clearly appears to be an issue in the way hotel staff communicate with one another and this in turn effects the overall service that is provided. It was such a shame given that the stay had been relatively ok. Is it worthy of 4/5 stars? I cant be sure, for us it was a rather underwhelming stay and for the same price you could stay in hotel which is not only visually stunning but has the service to match it!",3,2016,08,02
128,Stay at The Montcalm London City for a friend's wedding,"The service at Montcalm London City was very good, the room was great and we received complementary champagne in our room. I would highly recommend it not only because it's a great hotel but also because the staff catered to all our needs, which really impressed me.",5,2016,08,02
128,Great visut,"Had an excellent time at the Montcalm - we found the hotel excellent value for money, and definitely within walking distance of local tube stops. Our room was comfortable and modern, and the hotel as a whole was very pleasing to the eye. Would stay again next time we are in London. We also had dinner at the attached restaurant - quality was great but perhaps not for vegetarians!",5,2016,08,02
128,Business Week in London,"My experience was positiv. Very helpful and polite staff. The rooms are furnished with style, have a lot of space and are kept very clean. The only thing i was a bit disappointed, the Gym. To small. But at least there is one.",5,2016,08,02
128,Fantastic!!!,Not one negative thing to say about this hotel. It really goes the extra mile to look after you. From start to finish the experience was first class and the beds are to die for. Well recommended. Will definitely be returning.,5,2016,07,31
128,Disappointed at the Brewery,"I stayed here with my fiancé for three nights and despite a very good first impression on arrival with a well presented reception and friendly concierge, I was generally disappointed from then on.

We had booked a superior double and whilst the room (number 011) is pleasantly decorated and the bed was comfy, the room was tiny and we had no view at all. The window is totally blocked by a wall. Only good thing is if you want to sleep as it's basically a blacked out room.

After 11pm they close all but the main reception for access and the hotel is a maze with poor signposting. We were one of three couples who we found also wondering around trying to find their rooms before giving up and going back to reception.

Upon checking out I had asked for my boarding passes to be printed the day before but they didn't have my email so I resent it but gave up waiting after 15 minutes of being passed around different people who seemed very uninterested in assisting. It particularly annoyed me when a lady from reception decided to open an extra desk and check her friend in who was behind me in the queue.. They had a whole team of people to meet and greet but only a couple to actually help with checking in and out which just took sooooo long..

I'm generally very positive as you'll see from my other reviews but I really felt let down. 

To finish on a positive I would recommend eating at The Jugged Hare, a gastro pub they partner with, we went with a big group of friends for dinner and it was awesome with great staff.. ",3,2016,07,30
128,Montcalm hits the spot again. ,"First visit to the Brewery and the name of our suite said it all......WOW. 
Having stayed at the M by Montcalm a couple of times, we knew that our expectations should be on the high side and we were not disappointed. Every member of the team we came in contact with greeted us with a warm welcome and seemed genuinely pleased that we had chosen to return to a Montcalm hotel.
The hotel although in a traditional setting, exudes a quirky, modern yet elegant style with a strong emphasis on service, which is delivered in a non fussy, yet enthusiastic fashion. We were staying in a WOW suite, (you don't struggle to figure where they came up with that from) and it was a haven of style, tranquillity and up to date features like flat screen entertainment centre with lots of options to keep you happy and a handy mobile phone programmed with lots of apps to make the most of the local area and further afield, which also allowed you to use free data and calls that you are encouraged to take with you when out and about. We had a great meal on our first night in the Chiswell Dining Rooms, which is linked to the hotel and also enjoyed a nightcap in the Jugged Hare which is another dining or drinking option, again linked to the hotel. 
Return custom is obviously really important to Montcalm and all of the staff without exception go that extra mile to ensure that your trust in them is not misplaced. 
Daisy Slavkova the house manager popped out to see us as we were checking out, we had met her on our previous visits to the M by Montcalm and were pleased to see that her hard work, attention to detail and exceptional commitment to her guests has rightfully seen her excel at Montcalm. 
Thanks again to all and will definitely make Montcalm our hotels of choice whenever we are in London. ",5,2016,07,30
128,Montcalm Club Double room,"Great accommodations, just as pictured.  About 20 min cab ride from Central London.  I would stay here anytime!  When we checked in we were upgraded to the Club Double Twin and the bathroom was almost as big as the room.  Very clean and modern, staff very accommodating.",5,2016,07,28
128,"Average, not worth the money and hassle","Alright hotel but I  would not stay here again. I dont think its worth the money and I had a few issues.  I felt like I was fighting for everything that I had already booked.

The staff for the most part was awesome, but i also had some issues (from broken AC to miscommunications)

1- i confirmed a king bed via email and requested early arrival which they said they would try to accomodate. Upon arrival they put me in a queen room. I had to show the email from their staff before they let me in a king. It seems like they prepped a wueen for early arrival. The receptionist was able to move me to a king after some computer work, but the room wasnt ready yet so i left my bags and headed out for the day.

2- i also booked the breakfast included with the room. The receptionist told me i did not and said i would need to sort it out with the mgr. he told me breakfast ends at 11.

3- once i came back and checked in, i complained to the bellman who diligently informed his mgr of the issues with my rooms and breakfast. the mgr called me and said he added breakfast to my room.  I went the next day at breakfast at 10:37 (i was told it ended at 11 by receptionist), and learned it really closes at 1030.

4- the king room was on the street and pretty loud. I live in the city and am use to noise, but the motorbikes made it much louder than usual so i asked to switch. They moved me to a very quiet room on the other side of the building. Much smaller but good.

5- we went during the hottest 2 days of the year in London. The AC broke early one morning. Everytime we called the front desk they said it would be fixed in 20minutes. Not sure if/when it was fixed.

6- i also have a billing issue and wrote to the front desk but havent heard back yet.

The rooms themselves were pretty nice and definitely clean. Location is ok if you need to be near Barbican area. Its 5-10min walk to tubes. Not really near the main tourist attractions. Its on a main road near some restaurants and a pub. Taxis are readily accessible.

The hotel has responded about our issues and all they really said is next time they come they will take care of us. I doubt there will be a next time.",3,2016,07,27
128,Wonderful Hotel,My husband and I stayed for our anniversary. The hotel is beautiful looks as good in real life as on the website.  The hotel staff were amazing. Couldn't do enough for us and always with a smile. The bed was so comfortable too! I would recommend this hotel for anyone searching for a luxury stay in London. Location close to tube and only 15-20min walk to London bridge. We will definitely be returning to this boutique hotel.,5,2016,07,27
128,Brilliant place,"Room and service was brilliant shame it was literally just for the sleep as went to a gig at Hyde Park. The welcome at reception and then from the concierge as they showed us our room. The room was high quality with top class fittings in the bathroom and beautiful gallery and boch crockery. We even had a mobile device to use and room fragrance device to choose your scent and strength!
The room was well noise insulated, there was a few local shops for snacks close by and the Barbican tube station was close by too.
Can't wait to stay here again, what a great find.",5,2016,07,26
128,Perfect,"The best hotell we have been in London.
Perfect place and Perfect staff.
Try the bar on the corner for a meal, sooooo tasty.
The room was clean and very nice decorated. 
It was only 10 min form Liverpool station. 15 min tub to Oxford street.
Next time we are visiting London this is the place to stay in.. ",5,2016,07,26
128,decent option in useful location,"montcalm brewery has a characteristic location and premises, right in the heart of the City and ideal if you plan to attend an event at the nearby Barbican. The rooms, even the Club ones, can be pretty small, but that's London for you. Room equipment was top class, unfortunately the mobile phone they lend you during your stay didn't quite work as expected. Front desk staff and bell boys were friendly and competent, even during busy times (stayed over a long weekend in July). Might consider returning, might not, but no real negatives to report.",4,2016,07,25
128,Laid back luxury. Thoughtful staff.,"We have just returned from a most wonderful weekend in London celebrating our 4th anniversary and the staff at this hotel made it such a memorable occasion; Alice made sure that we were treated to a club room and there was a little surprise waiting for us in the delightful room.
The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the linen is the best quality Egyptian cotton. You will sleep like a baby.
All the staff; door, reception, concierge, maids and waiting are well trained, naturally polite and very attentive.
We will be celebrating our 5th anniversary there too....... and many more to come!",5,2016,07,25
128,NEVER BOOK THIS PLACE!! EVER!!,I organised a trip as a present for my mother birthday as a present for her 46th Birthday and since we've gone through a really tough time in the family.. she needed a break. So I booked the Montcalm by Brewery! I've had nothing but HELL.. so rude the staff have been and after sending third party forms/documents I lodged a complaint nothing had been resolved.. don't bother with these people... they can't be trusted with a piss up in a 'brewery' thank you to the Hotel Rafyel for actually saving us from destruction for her break.. highly recommend them.,1,2016,07,24
128,Perfect,"The perfect place to stay in the city. We had a room on the first floor on the main road and heard nothing. Spent most of the time trying to figure out what make the bed was. It was probably the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in. That says a lot for any hotel. Staff were amazing - we were welcomed back every day. You cannot fault this hotel in any way shape or form. And, I loved the retracting blinds for the bathroom. ",5,2016,07,24
128,Very nice,"Stayed here for one night on business and after checking in late afternoon, and only returning late at night, didn't get to experience too much of the hotel itself.  This was a convenient location for me, being 5 minutes from offices in Finsbury square and c. 10-15 mins walk from either old street or Moorgate tube stations.  Check in was relatively seamless, although I did have to be accompanied by a hotel staff member to my room for no apparent reason - nice touch if you like that or if you have bags that need carrying but seemed unnecessary for me.  However the staff were friendly and did explain bits of the room.

My room was a decent size but long and thin so oddly wasn't that spacious but was plenty sufficient for me.  Bed was comfy and room had usual features of tv, iron and ironing board, as well as a mobile device from which (I was told by the concierge, but didn't use myself) you can make international calls to a number of countries free/cheap and can also use the phone to suggest nearby places of interest - good if your a tourist.  Hotel had free wifi throughout.

The bathroom was very sleek and modern and spacious. 

I ate  breakfast in the morning in the jugged hare restaurant and opted for scrambled eggs on toast.  This was included in my hotel price  it had I been picking up the bill separately I wouldn't have paid for it  - food was ok, but nothing special, toast had no butter and wasn't offered any, I was served the wrong breakfast order originally - but corrected without any major issue, and wasn't offered a cold drink.  The breakfast prices were very steep for what they were - but this isn't specific to this hotel as it is common at most, particularly in London.  Personally I'd suggest visiting one of the many cafes, Starbucks etc close by for a pastry and drink and paying a fraction of the price.

I'd certainly stay here again, good location and a decent hotel and room.",4,2016,07,23
128,Lovely hotel,"Good central location, nice attentive staff, high quality transformation from brewery/offices to hotel. The rooms are spread over various levels and wings. My room was pretty small but had everywhere needed. I would prefer not to have a glass panel in the bathroom door, even opaque. Breakfast at £25 per person is expensive, there are places nearby to get a good breakfast at a fraction of that.",4,2016,07,23
128,OK Hotel,"I stayed here and got caught out. The advertised rate does not include VAT and therefore I had to pay 20% more. They make you pay for the room upfront, which makes you feel like you are not trusted. They then after making you pay for the room, take a hold for any incidentals. The whole process took 15mins at check it far too long. The rooms are very well appointed, although sometimes hard to find as you need a map to find them. I would not be in a hurry to stay here again",3,2016,07,22
128,Excellent!,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding in the City. We loved this hotel: friendly staff, clean rooms, very comfortable beds, nice breakfast buffet (offered in the pub next door) We live just outside London, and work in London, but we wouldn't mind staying in this hotel again as part of a 'break'. Definitely recommend.",5,2016,07,22
128,Excellent,"I was completely impressed all ways round with this hotel. The staff were excellent - without exception. I thought it was very tastefully converted from a brewery to a hotel. The wifi is excellent wherever you are in the building. Very important for me. I liked my room - it has all the creature comforts, albeit a tad small, but for a London property it was fine. Also I was alone, so it was no problem at all. I thought that the full english breakfast was pretty good - the scrambled eggs were very good, despite not being cooked to order. I consider that the other methods of cooking eggs, especially fried, should have been inclusive in the price, not extra, but that is a minor issue. I ate in the Jugged Hare twice. Both times I enjoyed it. Negatives? Well - it all depends when you go and why you go. It is a bit out of the centre and to be honest at the weekend the City is dead. It is nice and quiet, but there are not many things open. It did not bother me, but you need a while to get into the centre for shopping and most theatres. I would happily stay here again. It felt quite cozy, despite being a city hotel, without being too much.",5,2016,07,21
128,Special Big Birthday stay,"Professional Personal Perfect. Great stay from arrival to leaving. Different interesting venue, very memorable. Great upgrade for my birthday. Wow what a wonderful nights sleep too. Highly recommended",5,2016,07,19
128,Just shy of excellent...,"I booked this hotel at the last minute (morning of check in) and got a fairly reasonable rate of £195 for a double room. The near-by travel lodge was looking £115 so all in all I felt this decent value. 

The hotel was very easy to get to, being a short walk from either Barbican or Moorgate stations. This also has the added bonus of making the hotel right beside the wonderful Barbican Centre as well as numerous bars and restaurants. 

From the outside, it's a converted old industrial building which spans a courtyard. It's neat and interesting. Inside is well decorated and clean. The lobby is attractive, the reception staff warm and efficient while, despite having only a shoulder bag, I was shown to my room by a friendly and chatty porter. This was particularly helpful because, given the building's origins, the layout is a bit haphazard. For me this added to the boutique charm but for others it may be more a nuisance. 

My clubroom was clean, spacious and well appointed although a second chair at the coffee table wouldn't go amiss. There were a good selection of complimentary teas although the coffee and hot chocolate were of the instant variety which is shame now that similar hotels have moved on to Nespresso machines. The mini-bar was well stocked and not too expensive for drinks while the near-ubiquitous jars of nuts and sweets were as extortionate as always.  

The bed was huge (both in height and other dimensions) and very comfortable. This combined with the climate control really did make for an excellent night's sleep. 

I liked the lighting. It was low, with so many different sources that you could really adjust the atmosphere to your own taste. This was great for me as a leisure guest but when I sat down at the desk to write a birthday card I could imagine how, despite a tiny desk lamp, the lighting could become annoying for a business traveller. 
 
There was free, highspeed wifi throughout the hotel while each room also came with a free-to-use mobile phone compete with city guide, free national and international calls, and mobile internet. This would be a real bonus for international travellers facing high roaming fees. 

The purpose of my visit was a birthday party in the hotel-owned gastropub called The Jugged Hare. It's vibrant and stylish with a great selection of very well made cocktails. We had a set feast menu and the food was good but did have some basic flaws including a lack of seasoning for some dishes. It was banquet style dinning for a large group in their private room so I wouldn't extrapolate to the quality of their usual menu. 

All in all I had a great stay and would thoroughly recommend a visit, even if it was just for a cocktail in The Jugged Hare. ",4,2016,07,17
128,Location and service was perfect for....,".... We booked the hotel for a Friday night, having booked a restaurant close by for dinner, from the choosing of pillows and the guest welcome team email - the service was great. We were made to feel welcome and a valued guest.  The room was spotless and nice Hermes toiletries, a fresh fruit bowl and a Handy mobile was useful for checking our route.  Great coffee and tea in room!  We were on the club room so able to use the lounge for a well stocked and fresh continential breakfast, more than enough after a late night meal.  Only improvement would be to have a little more 'side space'  to place our stuff in both the bathroom and bedroom",5,2016,07,17
128,Dunnhumby summer ball,"The Ball was being held at the Brewery , so staying at the Montcalm was an absolute no brainer
The Montcalm is a fabulous hotel , we were warmly welcomed and also our room was upgraded to a club room
The room was very nice with a great on suite 
The only negatives and they're very small are  ... the shower could be more powerful and the lighting could be a bit brighter , it was fine for me but my better half said putting on her make up would of been easier
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or at the sister hotels",5,2016,07,16
128,Lovely hotel but slightly below par service,"Stayed here as a couple following a works do. 

First thing to say is the hotel is beautifully finished the rooms are clearly higher spec finish, Lovely wood and very comfy bed.
This is not your standard run of the mill London hotel it is more boutique and great for couples to stay.
Having said this felt a little let down with the service. There was a road race and all the roads around the hotel were closed off - not the hotels fault. However it is the Hotels job to tell you this before you book and also their job to work out how you get to the hotel. In the end we had to actually run along the course to get there as almost every viable route was closed off even though we were walking. Would have appreciated the Hotel doing their job and telling us how to reach it.
Would stay here again though as it is well finished and very comfortable.",4,2016,07,15
128,Generally nice facility but not your usual cup of tea,"The hotel is one of those facilities where various buildings have been joined and repurposed into a hotel, with a boutique European flair.  Your rooms could be done a cobblestone street and up a few steps or across he street in an entirely separate building.  There is a club room, but was away a empty and there were refreshments in the room - perhaps you had to request service.  There are lots of stairs up and down along halls to get to some rooms and the lighting in the rooms may be romantic to some, but I had to use the flashlight on my phone to see my clothes in the 12 to 18 inch wide closet.   Turning on and off lights was a bit like playing a computer game.  I felt victorious when I figured out how to use them. The rugs need to be refurbished. They seemed clean but were badly pulled. The room had a bath but I have never seen one fill up so slowly. After fifteen minutes, I had maybe two inches in the tub.  I gave up and pulled the plug at that point.  The fitness center is inadequate. On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable - more so than the average hotel room -- and the wifi is free and worked seamlessly.  Good range of TV stations if you enjoy that distraction.  Easy walking distance to Moorgate. And the Jugged Hare pub downstairs is a lively place for an after work drink.  Would I recommend it?  It is for certain types of travelers or for those on business craving location to the City most of all. ",3,2016,07,15
128,Lovely stay,"My boyfriend booked this for 2 nights as part of my birthday. We stayed in July despite my birthday being in June as we had tickets to see a show. 
When we arrived the staff asked us our reasons for staying. We explained and the staff member wished me a happy birthday. She then passed this information on to another staff member saying it was my birthday last month but is there anything they could do.
They showed us to our room and within 15 minutes a member of staff delivered a small card wishing me happy birthday and a bottle of red wine- lovely touch!!
All the staff were extremely pleasant and went out of their way to make our stay even more enjoyable.
On the Saturday night we arrived back at out hotel at approx 10.30pm, we asked if there was a bar open and they directed us to the jugged hare. However when we walked over it was quite busy so decided to call it a night instead. On our way to the room we were stopped and told if we would like a drink we could sit in the lounge and a member of staff would get our drinks for us! Again doing all they could to make our stay enjoyable.

Our room was fantastic, and just what we needed.

Would definitely stay again!!

Thank you",5,2016,07,14
128,Great hotel in a great location,"My husband booked this and we were not disappointed. At reception we asked if our room was a quiet one. The lady on reception was very honest and said it probably wasn't. She took the trouble to switch rooms for us which was greatly appreciated. The room allocated to us was very tranquil. The service we experienced during our stay was second to none, however, we didn't eat breakfast there or eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on that. 
We would definitely look to book this hotel again when returning to London. The Barbican tube station is literally a few minutes walk away. Central London can be reached within about 40 minutes too. Nice to walk around for a change instead of getting the tube everywhere. Hotel is close to trendy Shoreditch too if you fancy a good night out.",4,2016,07,12
128,Amazing Service and Accommadations,We spent two wonderful nights in this beautiful hotel. The service was impeccable and the rooms were comfortable with extra amenities! It included bathrobes and slippers. It also had a smartphone that could be used to make free calls to a number of foreign countries including the USA. This allowed us to touch base with our family for free!!,5,2016,07,11
128,Beautiful and historical ,Stayed for two nights - staff were excellent and informative. The building itself is full of character - take into consideration it wasn't built to be a hotel so can be a little noisy. Complimentary water and fruit and a free room upgrade. Rooms were clean bath was huge and gorgeous. Housekeeping even went to the difficulty of cleaning  our room in the evening as we were having a lay in when they arrived in the morning. Would recommend anyone to stay that likes a little luxury and not too much of the hussle and bustle of London! ,4,2016,07,11
128,TRULY 5*!,"I treated my husband to a weekend in London for his birthday and cannot praise 'The Montcalm at the Brewery London City', enough for a wonderful overnight stay. What a glorious hotel this is and truly 5*, which a lot of places claim to be, but are not.

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special by the staff, who were always smiling and genuinely couldn't do enough for us.  Our room was stunning from the modern décor, to the well equipped mini bar to the state of the art en suite bathroom, to the music centre and choice of TV channels and in house technology. We found the bed very comfortable and the room spacious enough – if we had wanted more space we would have reserved a club room, but found the room adequate for an overnight stay.

A trip down memory lane for me as I worked in this area for Lord Forte the 'King', of hotels in the 60's and 70's and for my husband also as he frequented 'The Brewery', on conferences in the days before it was a hotel.

Thanks to all the staff for a memorable weekend.  We will return!",5,2016,07,11
128,Excellent in every way!,"Visited London for my partners birthday present alongside a concert. even though we arrived at 9am just to drop the bags off (check in is at 2pm), the wonderful staff still checked to see if the room was ready. Returned after breakfast to find not only had the bags been taken to the room, but we had also received a upgrade to a Club room! This was all before the official check in time, allowing us time to refresh before heading out to the concert in Hyde Park! 
Cannot compliment the staff and the hotel enough! Everything was amazing! ",5,2016,07,11
128,very good position and lovely atmosphere,"The hotel has a very good position, the hotel and staff are are very nice. The bedrooms  are not big, but very comfortable (particularly the bed).
The hotel building was a brewery and it maintenance a lovely atmosphere.",4,2016,07,11
128,Wonderful place to stay a real treat," Stayed in this hotel for two night and found the staff very friendly.  The bedrooms are not massive and the beds are high, but conformtable and have all you need.  The breakfast is served in the jugged hare down the road which is good, meal on the friday night was fine dining, not sure if they had names it correct, most of the food arrived cold, saturday night was better.  The hotel is well decorated and sits in a great place.  Would definetly go again for another visit. ",5,2016,07,10
128,Wow what a venue for an overnight stay,"We had a nice two nights in this hotel, the bedrooms were not massive but comfortable and the bed was really high but also comfortable, nothing was too much trouble for the staff all very friendly.  Breakfast was good too,. the meal was fine dining on the first night,not quite my idea of fine dining, the conference dinner on the second night was good the food was hot, and for a lot of people in the room, i think they did well.  We would definetly return for another visit. ",5,2016,07,10
128,Fantastic hotel and customer service!,"A first class hotel with great customer service. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary. 
The room was very spacious for a London hotel, modern and very well equipped. We were very happy to find a Nespresso machine. The staff looked after us very well and we are looking forward to returning. Thank you Grazia!",5,2016,07,10
128,Fantastic Hidden Gem,"The staff are friendly and helpful
The hotel is vey clean. The rooms are decorated in modern styles. The ensures are modern. There is tea and coffee in each of the rooms - thats great.
We even had a small tv over the bath.
Not particularly central to the west end the hotel is located in an area where there is a little shops nearby that is handy.
Really enjoyable posh hotel at brilliant value.",5,2016,07,10
128,Opulent at a fair price,"Stylish and luxurious place with lots and lots of nice touches. Club Rooms are ok and although they have nicely decorated bathrooms they feature a very tiny desk - definitely not a room to try and do some work in.

Breakfast was simply awesome. For a bite to eat in the evenings do check out The Jugged Hare just around the corner.

Minor annoyance, don't expect them to be able to match your 'Montcalm Club' record with your stay, reception throughly messed this up and I ended up with 2 separate accounts that took some time to reconcile afterwards.",4,2016,07,10
128,Montcalm- The Old Brewery,"A real great find , ideally located and I consider great value
All the staff have a wonderful attitude to service , a pleasure to be there. It must be one of the quietest hotels in central London which is always a benefit",5,2016,07,09
128,Good London hotel,"Stayed here with my husband whilst he was travelling on business. Room was very comfortable and hotel felt luxurious. The only thing that let our stay down was the club breakfast, I'm not sure if there are other alternatives available in the hotel but the club option was limited, essentially a small continental buffet. Also made difficult by the frozen butter - very difficult to spread! ",4,2016,07,07
128,Cannot fault this place,"I took my partner here for a birthday treat and we will definitely be going back.  The staff are all incredibly polite and helpful, introducing themselves by name, shaking hands, offering to help with luggage, information, photo taking, anything we wanted.  I'd arranged afternoon tea with Alice, one of the managers and when we arrived her colleague Grazia made herself known to us and reassured me that all my requests had been catered for (my partner doesn't have a sweet tooth, so they did extra canapes for him in lieu of cakes).  Our room was upgraded and had a few birthday balloons in it (nice little touch).  We requested a late check out and that was no problem, we wanted breakfast even though we hadn't booked it, that was no problem, nothing was too much trouble.  All the little personal touches made us feel very welcome and in a competitive hotel market, it's things like this that make the difference.  We went into the West End on Saturday night, but I was glad to be coming back to a quieter area to sleep.",5,2016,07,06
128,A fabulous hotel with even better staff! A must stay!,"This was my first time at the hotel, staying with my Mam and what a fabulous hotel it is. The staff were very accommodating, helpful and very friendly. Our room was fantastic, clean, spacious and great amenities. Hiarl the Assistant Front of House Manager was especially great - on our arrival our room wasn't quite ready (not that we minded) but on our return our cases were already there, with complimentary champagne and biscuits with a lovely personal note left alongside them. 10/10 hotel, and a great location for all the City sights.",5,2016,07,06
128,Great overnight stay near The Brewery,"We had a brilliant night stay at The Montcalm at The Brewery. We were part of an event at The Brewery, and had excellent service from check in to check out. We were made to feel very special guests thanks to the attentive team. The proximity to The Brewery made our stay stress-free. We would definitely stay at The Montcalm again.",5,2016,07,06
128,One year and counting . . . .,"The team were fantastic. We stayed here on our wedding night last year, and wouldn't have chosen to stay anywhere else to celebrate our first year of marriage this year.
Look forward to staying again next year for the 2nd year anniversary.",5,2016,07,05
128,Delightful!,"Impeccable service and the bed was super comfortable. The only teeny thing was that our room smelled slightly of smoke but otherwise excellent service and customer care.
Staff were very attentive and friendly- printed out some papers for us.",5,2016,07,05
128,"Good experience, shame about the follow up","I stayed in here for one week whilst working in London.  The room was well laid out and comfortable.  The 'gastro' pub that is part of the hotel is also well worth a visit (have the salmon!). 

My only complaints about the hotel are: Firstly, they tried to charge me GBP 11 for a glass of milk at 1am.  I'm glad I was not travelling with child.  

Secondly: I tried to re-book for the week after, I was advised to contact the central reservation team.  The response was slow and ineffective, I was forced to book, instead, the Crowne Plaza in the city due to a lack of response to my emails. 

Thirdly:  the fire alarm malfunctioned one evening at 1am...shame I did not order any milk! 

Providing you book via a website/agent; I'd recommend this hotel. Bell boys and front of house staff are attentive and serve the hotel well.",4,2016,07,05
128,Return visit to The Montcalm,"Having stayed at this Hotel last year, we returned for one night and to attend a Concert at the Barbican.  We were greeted with courtesy at reception and by all the staff on duty.  The porter remembered us from last year - he is Romanian.  Our room was smaller this year but we were able to change it and we were situated on the East side of the Hotel which is not near the road.  The room was extremely well equipped and there was a bowl of fruit on the table.  Slippers, robes, umbrella and iron and board are all available in the room.  The bathroom had everything one needed and the shower and bath was excellent.  This is a lovely Hotel to stay in.",5,2016,07,05
128,Wonderful hotel in a fab city location,"We stayed at the Montcalm Hotel for 3 nights during a weekend stay in London. We area  young couple and found the hotel in an excellent central location for visiting all the highlights of London. The pice of the hotel was excellent value for money, super service and a large room with lots of little perks, such as Nespresso coffee machine and plenty of coffee pods! bathtub and delightful toiletries. The bed was very comfortable and room was serviced daily. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay here again in the future for sure!",5,2016,07,04
128,Excellent hotel and service,"I booked this hotel last minute as I was meeting friends nearby. The staff were extremely friendly and polite.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade. The room was adequately sized and immaculate. The ensure bathroom/ wet room was awesome! Bed was comfortable and room temperature was perfect. The room was impervious to any noise. The hotel was well furnished and staff impeccably dressed. Hiral (assistant front of house manager) personally took time to ask me about my stay. I have not experienced this level of service in a London hotel before.
Overall highly recommended and enjoyable.",5,2016,07,04
128,"Lovely Room, Good Facilites","We enjoyed one night here and were pleasantly surprised at the standard of the room which we thought was good value.  The only down side was the bathroom was a bit on the small side but overall, can't complain and would be happy to stay again.",4,2016,07,03
128,"Lovely hotel, brilliant staff, will return! ","From the minute we walked in we was greeted by friendly staff! So welcoming! 

Free upgrade on arrival which was lovely! 

Gentlemen took Our bags and directed us to our room. 
Room was lovely and spacious , very modern! 

Comfy bed, lovely big shower. Free bottles of water and fruit bowl (mini bar however there is a charge) 

Within 5 minutes of being in our room, grazia had heard from one of her members of staff it was my birthday and sent up a bottle of champagne, a hand written card wishing me and my fiancé a lovely stay and also cute bath bombs ( a shame our room did not have a bath though, which did surprise me seeing as we had an upgrade) however this was all free so wouldn't dare complain! 

Our room looked out onto the road however it was so quite! Air conditioning so was no need to have window open. 

Fire alarm went off at 1.30am in the morning, which was a false alarm. Manager the next morning explained what had happened and apologised! I wouldn't hold this against them as the safety of everyone is the most important thing! He handled the situation brilliant, and offered us another stay at a discounted rate, free upgrade and free breakfast. This I literally cannot complain about. 

Everything was amazing, and I had the best weekend in London. 

Thank you so much to everyone who made us feel so special. 

We will be recommending and returning again. 
",5,2016,07,03
128,Anniversary visit ,"Excellent hotel.Rare trip away for us . Staff contacted us in the week before to find out reason for our vist . Arrived after 10 min walk from tube station very easy check in and found we had been upgraded to a montcalm club room . Hotel is in a great location . We walked to Sky garden and then the next day to globe theatre approx 30 mins .Arrived back at hotel to find champagne and macaroons .Room was very spacious and clean. This is a very special hotel. Its location, architecture and design all help but what makes it exceptional are the staff . A perfect experience and we hope to return soon . (Baby sitters dependant)",5,2016,07,03
128,A lovely way to spend the night,"I visited The Montcalm with 6 colleagues as we were in London for an award ceremony and it was situated perfectly from the venue.

As soon as we arrived to the time we left everyone was friendly and helpful. Being welcomed with a hot towel on arrival was an added bonus!! 

The room was great and very comfortable with a really nice bathroom and interactive TV. 

The only downside was the cost of adding breakfast to your stay but there are a few options near by so it wasn't too much of a problem.

All in all it was a great night (we won 2 awards which helped) and a very comfortable stay that I would highly recommend. ",4,2016,07,03
128,Overnight and shopping,"Fabulous find.  So many London hotels are overpriced and offer very little.  Not so here.  Wonderful setting and decor, service excellent and so many nice finishing touches.  Room was spotlessly clean.  Huge bathroom and good range of toiletries.  Good quality organic decaf coffee sachets (this never happens ever!!). In the lobby was complimentary breakfast coffee and late night biscuits.   Even a fire alarm in the early hours didn't take the shine off the place.  I couldn't fault it.  And I know I have a tendency to be rather picky! With the deal we got, at a price not much more than the premier travel inn, I shall certainly stay again.",5,2016,07,03
128,Weekend Away,"Recently spent a night at The Montcalm at The Brewery Hotel. Great hotel, staff extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms very comfortable and well furnished. We'll definitely be back. 

Good location and easy to access with good pubs and restaurants local to the hotel. ",5,2016,07,02
128,Everytime a pleasure to stay in the Montcalm,"I'be been in the Montcalm several times with my husband.
We booked everytime a clubroom with a special room request and moatly its possible to get the same room.the service at the hotel is excellent and the staff really friendly.
The hotel has a gret athmosphere and is super clean in the hall and aswell the rooms .
The special service you get with the extra payment for the clubroom is briliant.the small breakfast and the afternoon snacks in the clublounge are well served and delicious.
The hotel is close to two tube stations and you are in walkingdistamce to the st pauls cathedral,millenium brige etc.
Aswell you are pretty quick with the taxi at the st pancras international station which is a nice extra feature aswel.
I would never choos another hotel in london again through always good experience.",5,2016,07,02
128,Possibly my new favourite hotel,"This was exactly what I needed after a gruelling day of travelling and meetings. Comfortable, luxurious, with everything you could need. My room had a bath (I am not a fan of the trend for hotels to only have showers), the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept in for ages, there was a proper hairdryer, and the mini bar was stocked with a selection of snacks as well as the usual. There was also a really nice tea selection which was a nice touch (I have taken to travelling with my own tea when I'm on business as I'm quite picky but I didn't need it here)

The staff were wonderful. Only downsides were that there was a slight mistake in my bill which was rectified very quickly, and my room was a bit dark - not a problem as I was on business and only in the room at night but if I had been on holiday I would have liked more natural light.

All in all, I left this place thinking I needed to come back for a leisure trip to properly make the most of it - I would love to have time to try the wellness centre and the food. I have been travelling for work a lot lately and this is not a common feeling when heading home!",5,2016,07,02
128,Great customer service,"The hotel is well located a short walk from The Barbican underground and centre.  The customer service was excellent by all members of staff, especially, Grazia.  The hotel is elegantly styled.  We stayed in a standard room which was small (just wide enough for a bed and two side tables) although well appointed and comfortable.  There is a bar and restaurant attached to the hotel as well as a restaurant (Cote Brasserie) across the road which is very reasonably priced and serves breakfast.  We would definitely stay again.",4,2016,06,30
128,Great Hotel,"Stayed here whilst visiting London for a work function. Found the staff to be exceptionally helpful and really keen to help in any way they can. Rooms are spotless, good location (I think! Was for me anyhow) would definitely come back again. ",5,2016,06,28
128,Faultless and elegant beauty,"upon arrival we were met by friendly and smart staff, dressed to the nines in this historic setting. Upon check in we had automatically been upgraded. After a personal escort to our room with informative and friendly butler service we opened the door and were wowed. After returning from our day I was elated to find a personal birthday card from the staff, wine and macaroons. Wow. That wasn't all, at check out we thanked the staff for such a wonderful experience, we were further rewarded by a complimentary breakfast. If you want a central location, a no expense spared and quaint setting this hotel is for you! The attention, the personable service, the quality, the comfort and the staff are amazing. An awesome night full of wonderful surprises thank you all, especially Hiral Bhanushali.",5,2016,06,28
128,"Well Located, Excelente bedroom","As the name says it is an old brewery plant adapted as a hotel. It is a labyrinth what makes funny to get to the room (not easy the first time). Room is very confortable, silent and clean and the hotel is very well located near the subway. We did not try the hotel breakfast. Employees were very kind.",4,2016,06,28
128,Amazing Hotel & Superb Staff!!,"Me & My boyfriend stayed here for one night during our stay in London for his birthday. On arrival we was greeted by staff who were on hand to carry our bags through. 
   Check in was very simple, and the staff were great, very friendly!! We were then personally taken to our room by Vlad, a very friendly and helpful member of staff!! 
   The bedrooms are a 10/10 for all round cleanliness and comfort and there are also so many added extras, eg. complimentary tea/coffee/espresso machine/ a mobile phone was also available in each room to call anyone in the UK for free. Even though we did not need this we found this was a very useful idea.
  The friendly staff booked us a room at a Italian Restuarant which was recommended by themselves which again we could not fault...best Steak we have ever tried!! 
Arriving back to the hotel after our meal, we walked into our bedroom to find our bed had been covered in rose petals shaped as a flower. We thought it was such a lovely gesture!! 
   The television also allows you to purchase films if you dont want to watch standard TV...we ordered a film - so easy to select!! The beds are 10/10 for comfort and the bathroom has everything you need and more!! 
  The underground station is about a 4-5minute walk away which was perfect for us as we was sightseeing during our stay.
Overall we couldnt fault this hotel, all of the staff are very friendly and more than happy to help, rooms are to an amazing standard!! I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a nice relaxing time in London - we will definately be coming back and staying in this hotel for longer than 1 night the next time!!! ....Many thanks for making our trip so welcoming...Kayleigh & Peter",5,2016,06,28
128,Super staff and Super stay,We had a lovely stay at this hotel after attending a blogging event at The Brewery. The staff were so helpful and as we had a young baby even let us check in very early. They couldn't do enough to help and I never had to struggle with buggy and steps because at least two staff rushed forward each time we left the building. The room was lovely and spacious and everything was clean and tidy.,5,2016,06,28
128,Perfect stay,"Excellent hotel, lovely staff and fab service.  Didn't get chance to sample spa will definitely use on next stay.  Super friendly door men and great concierge service.  They even close your curtains at night and turn Dow bed total wow factor.",5,2016,06,27
128,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Stayed here for a conference.  Everything was perfect.  Had a Montcalm club room which was slightly strange having a glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom!  However, there was a screen which came down at the press if a button in the bathroom.   Staff were fabulous and they were able to accommodate my gluten free diet easily.  Would recommend as a conference venue and as a hotel.",5,2016,06,27
128,Fantastic hotel stay,"My husband booked 3 nights as a surprise, the hotel was everything we wanted and more. The room was excellent, very clean, beautifully decorated and had all we needed. The shower was powerful and hot! All you would expect, tea/coffee, hairdryer, plush towels and robes. The breakfast was perfect, a great start to the day. The staff were polite, courteous and very helpful from the minute we arrived to the minute we left. We would certainly return, a special treat!",5,2016,06,27
128,A wonderful anniversary visit.,"We had a lovely visit to celebrate our fifteenth wedding anniversary, the staff were so welcoming and we were given an upgrade as a gift for our anniversary with access to the club lounge. The room was fantastic and had all you needed during your stay. Including Hermes products in the bathroom. The club lounge was well stocked and the continental breakfast used lovely produce. Our room had a handy smart phone which you could talk out of the hotel and have WiFi access,free calls within the UK and some European countries. The WiFi was very fast. The staff work so hard to make you feel special and your stay exceptional would recommend this hotel in fact our next visit to a Montcalm hotel will be Shoreditch with our daughter.",5,2016,06,27
128,Montcalm Oasis in the city,"I stay here occasionally on business, booked for me by the company and its always very nice. Its  bit of a warren. The rooms always seem to be down long twisty corridors and finding your way to the jugged hare is either very simple or like Hampton court maze. As i say Its always booked for me so i havent ever seen the bill although id hope they do good discounts because whilst it is nice i wouldn't pay the sort or room rates I've seen suggested. 
The location is ideal.
Ive never yet figured out how to turn off all the rom lights so usually end up sleeping with some sort of nightlight left on. The only thing they don't seem very good at is giving you tea with breakfast. I always ask for tea they always pour coffee.",4,2016,06,27
128,"Interesting building, pleasant stay","The Montcalm at the Brewery is, as the name would suggest, in the old Whitbread Brewery right beside the Barbican.  The building reflects its history and is quirky and stylish.  The courtyard is lovely, though it would have been nice if it had actually been possible to have drinks in the marquees set up there.  They must be reserved for special events. Our room (403) was smallish, but had most everything you would need, including slippers and robe (though there was only one robe when we checked in).  It was on the 4th (top) floor with only two other rooms in the wing and had a small window overlooking the courtyrard and the gilded weathervane and clock from the brewery days.  The rooms comes with a smart phone that can be used for touring the city and making free phone calls. I didn't use this, but it is a nice touch. The only criticisms I have of our stay are that the walls are a bit thin, so when the other guests came in around 1am on both nights, we could clearly hear the closet doors and the sound of conversation.  Also, our room had only one bath towel which we only realised after emerging from the shower and there was no bottle opener or corkscrew for the minibar.  The free bottle of water and the evening chocolates were appreciated, but we only had them on the night of our arrival. I rather expected that these would be there on the second night as well.  Overall, it is good value for London, convenient to the Underground, and a well-appointed and pleasant place to stay and I would certainly return.",4,2016,06,27
128,Perfect stay,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service and great location. Will definitely be going back. Was given an upgrade to their Wow Suite....the name didn't disappoint. The breakfast is really nice too, definitely recommend it.",5,2016,06,26
128,Surprise Weekend for Husband's 40th,"Excellent deco, excellent location - could not get any better! I booked the hotel for my husband's surprise 40th Birthday weekend away and did I make the right choice!
We were both very impressed with the deco, the room, complimentary champagne and chocolates!
Had a perfect stay and one very happy Birthday Boy!",5,2016,06,24
128,Magnificent Montcalm,"Lucky enough to stay here for one night. Didn't really get an opportunity to enjoy everything the hotel has to offer but would say that what I did enjoy was fabulous. Room was lovely, very well-appointed and the bed was incredible. Very nice shower in the morning.
Staff who checked me in and out were well-trained and polite.",5,2016,06,24
128,Funny Girl & The Montcalm,"As usual had a fab time at The Montcalm At The Brewery.  Lovely hotel. Spotlessly clean, staff happy and helpful. Stayed for the weekend whilst going to watch Funny Girl. Would highly recommend this quirky hotel Only downside would be that the bar, which is The Jugged Hare pub next door, is very small. Was impossible to get a seat or even stand at the bar. However the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is very good I would definitely stay again ",5,2016,06,22
128,Would go back tomorrow if I could,"We received and excellent welcome from really friendly staff.  The rooms were lovely, modern and well looked after.  Top hotel and would recommend is to anyone.  I'm not really feeling very poetic so I'm just writing now to meet the minimum 200 words.  Oh, I've gone well over now",5,2016,06,21
128,The best hotel in London by far!!!,"I booked here to propose to my partner and the service I got was beyond unbelievable. The staff could not do enough for me in making sure it was an unforgettable experience for myself and my partner. They kindly upgraded my room to the WOW suite, which is the most incredible room I have ever stayed in and followed all instructions I gave to ensure it was a big surprise for my partner. The staff genuinely cared and got involved in my plans and they were incredibly friendly as well. I cannot say enough about how wonderful this hotel is. I would only stay here when coming to London!",5,2016,06,21
128,Mrs   ,"This is a fantastic hotel with a lot of character tucked away in a little street in London. 
I went there for a conference and was wowed by the structure, the character of the hotel and most import of all the staff!!
One of the most friendly and help bunch. Very polite and very courteous and always had a smile on their face. 
Special mention to Hiral, Mariya & Alice who helped make my work weekend a fun one too. 
Planning on visiting this place again on a pleasure trip with the family. ",5,2016,06,20
128,VIP treatment from start to finish,"We stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery on 10 June so this review is a little delayed but only because I wanted to take the time over it to do justice to the amazing service we received. 

I had booked two rooms for my husband and I and my sister-in-law and her husband to celebrate a birthday and a reunion as they live in Canada. There was an excellent deal on the Montcalm website which meant the rooms were only £120 each and right from the initial booking process I felt we were in for something special with the options to customise the scent and pillows in our rooms. I then received an email from Grazia asking if there was anything she could do to make our stay more enjoyable so I let her know about the occasions we would be celebrating during our stay.

On arrival we were all wowed by the architecture in the hotel - you can see the original brick and steelwork and it's very impressive. The staff were very knowledgeable and friendly and told us a bit about the hotel and surrounding area while we were checking in. 

We were upgraded which was a total surprise and the rooms were beautiful - pristinely clean; tasteful, modern decor; quiet; amazingly comfortable bed - we slept so well! The location is great for exploring London - walking distance from Bank and Liverpool St. 

What really stood out though was the service and the unexpected little things that consistently produced 'wow' moments for all of us. Huge thanks to Grazia for making the birthday girl's stay so very special - and when we saw you in the morning your warm greeting meant so much. And Hiral - 'going the extra mile' was a phrase that should have been coined for you, it was like you read our minds when you offered us breakfast! Thanks so much for making our stay so amazing, right down to the last second at your hotel. We'll definitely be back. ",5,2016,06,20
128,Room a show and drinks in the bar,"Went to London for a show and fun. Found this delightful hotel and took a chance. It was a great choice. The staff welcomed us like family, the room was beautiful and nothing was too much trouble. After a night in the west end we arrived back before last orders and had an entertaining hour in the bar with the crew. Breakfast finished off a perfect stay the next day... now our number one choice for London trips",5,2016,06,19
128,Tip top stay,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights Saturday and Sunday and were not disappointed. Staff were excellent treating us like royalty, nothing was too much trouble.  The room was very comfortable with plenty of space and storage. A large bathroom with a great shower. The only down side was that we struggled to find somewhere local to eat in the evening so I would recommend doing your homework before hand if visiting at the weekend. We will definitely be using this hotel in the future 😀",5,2016,06,19
128,disappointing experience,"My last stay in this hotel started already disastrous. The young man at the front desk has first to learn how to serve clients - welcoming and not arrogant.
The room i got allocated was a room for disabled persons and  specially designed for this purpose. Next room had water dropping from the ceiling, the next one had no window, same for the third one where I stayed one night. Next day I got an upgrade for one of the suits.....
The hotel is meant for clients travelling with light luggage. As the hotel is an old and listed buildings you will find countless stairs which makes is very difficult to handle your luggage. 
The hotel  rooms are small. Travelling with 2 luggage of normal size I was not able to open both of them at the same time as the rooms does not provide enough space. There was no problem to open the luggage in my suite .
On the positive side : the entire hotel is very clean. no complains at all and the ambience is rather cosy . 
for breakfast the hotel offers his neighbouring pub/restaurant. this place is loud and far from perfect but very friendly not really trained stuff and the quality of the food is a bid disappointing.",3,2016,06,19
128,"Nice hotel, exceptional service","Nice hotel, with lovely refurbished rooms. Good ambience. Staff were exceptionally attentive and service was great. Breakfast in adjacent 'Jug and Hare' was standard 4 star London hotel fare, but good quality. Would use again",5,2016,06,18
128,Attention to the customers needs was the best,"Great location for the City. The staff were so professional and when I had an issue with my shirt, the iron had marked it, they took the shirt cleaned and ironed fresh for the morning, great service. The room was really well equipped.",5,2016,06,17
128,Montcalm went above and beyond! Thank you,"My husband and I arrived 10th June to a very warm welcome and lovely concierge brought us to our room and shortly after when we asked for somewhere to eat he directed us to 2 of the best places to eat and he was absolutely spot on with the one we chose.  The hotel room was beautiful with fantastic air conditioning & bathroom essentials.  Breakfast in the Club lounge was a treat and the service of the waiting staff was second to none on both days.  On check out I thank the team for a lovely stay but their lovely service didn't stop there.  We headed to Stansted airport where I realised (10 min from the airport and 50 mins from my flight departure time) I had left my passport in the hotel.  I immediately rang the hotel who willingly located my passport, brough it to Liverpool Street train station and passed it to the helpful staff on the Stansted Express train to be delivered to me on their next express train so I could 1. try to catch my flight & 2. save me from coming back on forth on the train myself.  Unfortunately I still missed my flight but the fact that the staff in the London City Suites went to such trouble for me brought a lump to my throat.  I am forever grateful for the efforts the team went to for me.  Needless to say all aspects of my stay here was fantastic because of the exceptional service, friendliness and warm reception everyone on the team had to offer and I thank you all dearly for this.  I will definately be back with my husband soon with a big box of chocs for you all. xxx",5,2016,06,17
128,Great Location + Convenient + Great Price,"Staffs overall are very warm, sincere, helpful and friendly. Hotel has its WOW factor - unassuming from the outside and tastefully decorated from the lobby to the room. Impressed with the quality of toiletries and bath towels and pillow except the 'Princess and Pea' bed! A wee bit high from the normal height bed and small for 2 persons although booked on Club room.
The restaurant was highly recommended sadly no time, stayed 3 nights. I would definitely return and recommend for its great location and convenience and price!",4,2016,06,17
128,Another great stay at the Montcalm !!,"Returned to the Montcalm to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday, champagne in the room on arrival and a display of petals in the bedroom was a pleasant surprise and most appreciated. It is always a pleasure to stay at the Montcalm and the location is perfect for a city break. The breakfast is first class and the rooms are always prepared to a high standard. Another enjoyable stay at this hotel and am sure we will visit again !!",5,2016,06,17
128,Fabulous,"This is just about the best hotel I have stayed in, in London. The staff and very helpful, we stayed in the WOW room, it was just gorgeous.  Love the location and the lively restaurant is just great. I would love to return and would definately recommend,",5,2016,06,16
128,Looking for a special hotel - here it is,The Montcalm at the Brewery is a lovely hotel with unique charm. Located in an old brewery still probably from the 19th century it offers nice rooms and friendly staff. Make sure you book a club room or Montcalm club room as other rooms might be a little too small.,5,2016,06,16
128,Just lovely ,"We stayed as a couple to have a few nights in London and The Montcalm was simply lovely. Comfy bed and a good size room and bathroom. 
The hotel has a nice feel to it as you walk around and despite being in the city it is very quiet particularly at night. ",5,2016,06,16
128,Fantastic Stay,"Thank you to the team at 'The Montcalm at the Brewery'! My wife and I stayed for two days for our anniversary. The check in was quick, the staff were so friendly, and they gave us an upgrade for our special occasion! 

Our stay was nothing but pleasurable. On our first night, the turndown service left rose petals and hearts on the bed, with a complementary bottle of wine.

Our room was clean, tidy and well kept! The shower was probably the best hotel shower I've had. 

One negative was the air-con. It was noisey, but positively, kept the room cool. 
Thank you to all that made our special weekend so worthwhile!",5,2016,06,15
128,Brilliant,Stayed Saturday night and it was brilliant. Built into the old Brewery so lots of interesting features not a modern glass palace but the decor and service were first class. Ideal for the weekend as the area is a bit quieter than the West End as well but only a few minutes in the Taxi or Tube to get into central London.,5,2016,06,15
128,The friendliest Englishmen I have ever met!,"The hotel - a re purposed old brewery, charming, beautiful, quaint.  Although navigating it is a bit of work.  However, you get a nice tour of the maze when you arrive.

The location - steps from the Barbican. 

The staff - who knew the English could be this friendly.  I saw more smiles in this hotel in 3 days, then in all of London.  Fantastic staff, very helpful.

The rooms/bathrooms - very nice and clean.  the bathroom was fantastic, with great amenities.

Extras - the Jagged Hare is an attached pub/restaurant that is not to be missed!  There is a free smart phone in each room for guests' use. It is pre-loaded with maps and apps to help get around the city.",5,2016,06,15
128,"Very good - best if you like softer, queen beds","There are lots of positives: reception staff are very helpful and genuinely keen to ensure guests have a good stay; rooms have many useful modern design features; location is good, with easy access to public transport and taxis. We have valued the move towards king and super-king sized beds in several other hotel chains. Here, the queen sized bed seemed a bit lost in the club room. We also prefer slightly firmer beds than these. The staff suggested very helpfully that they would remove the squidgy mattress topper to help give us a better night's sleep. If, like us, you prefer better support for a dodgy back, you might want to ask about this before booking. Some deluxe rooms have lower ceilings and less floor space than you might expect. So if you feel a bit uncomfortable in that sort of room, either mention it when booking, or pay the extra for a club room or suite. We did find out bit by bit that not everything was working properly - the air conditioning, the safe, a light - and things were not always replaced or delivered - hand towels, teabags, fruit. We were reluctant to keep asking, so, in the end, just managed without a working safe or fruit etc. I can imagine that some guests might be more annoyed than we were by lapses in attention to detail. ",4,2016,06,14
128,Excellent hotel!,"The hotel is modern and elegant with wonderfully presented rooms and very helpful staff. The price is In keeping with other hotels in the area and it offers great access to the City's sights. Tube is 5 mins walk away, and we walked to both St Paul's and Covent Garden comfortably.",4,2016,06,14
128,Two amazing birthdays,"My wife booked us a room for my birthday last month and there were nice little details added as she made a note it was my birthday. On arrival I had complimentar beer and chocolates and when we returned there were towel swans in the shape of a heart, which my wife loved.
On departure, the senior duty manager Simona gave me her card and said to contact her as I mentioned I would be returning next month for my wife's birthday.
I had correspondence with her prior to the booking which she was able to take care of for me. 
On arrival our details were passed over to the other duty manager who informed us that we had a club room and that we had access to the club lounge for drinks and snacks in the evening and breakfast the next day. We were directed to a place to park by Vlad the concierge who was very helpful on both occasions.
The room was fantastic with balloons and flowers on the bed, we were then able to have complimentary drinks and snacks before going out for the evening. Well worth it.
Nice continental breakfast the next day, just shame we couldn't stay longer.",5,2016,06,14
128,My go-to place to stay in London,"The Montcalm has much to recommend it, not the least of which is an extremely friendly staff that is eager to help at every turn. A lot of hotels can say that, of course, but there's something truly genuine about the concern the Montcalm crew seems to show each and every guest. The facilities are top-notch (though I might prefer the fitness room to be larger and a little colder!), and the on-premises dining facilities top-notch. One wonderful touch, as far as I'm concerned, is the availability of free fruit throughout the hotel: in your room, in the wellness centre, in the lobby, in the club lounge, etc. There are bowls of apples, oranges, bananas and pears everywhere. Being a big fruit eater, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that amenity.",5,2016,06,14
128,Perfect,"Stayed here twice this year and going back in August. Lovely hotel, well presented, spacious rooms and really helpful and friendly staff, especially the really nice doormen. Highly recommended and not expensive for London.",5,2016,06,14
128,Great hotel and location,"We went for my wife's 50th and we were up graded which was great. Only thing you need to know is the restaurant and bar is on the corner, I've you have to go outside, but not a problem as it is a busy and vibrant place.",5,2016,06,13
128,Great Use of a classic site,"My partner and I stayed here over the weekend for a family get together, during the queens birthday party, but we weren't invited. From the moment we arrived with the bowler hatted doorman and the greeting from the reception staff to the concierge staff taking my bags to our room through a maze of stairs to our room, number 131 located at the front of the hotel, we felt really welcome and special, to top it off a handwritten welcome card with a bottle of chianti and fruit.
I won't repeat the other comments on this site about the bar choices, and opening hours and its amenities. The rooms are well stocked, great layout and very comfortable. We only had a problem with the automated housekeeping light which was either not working well or was hit and miss if it was acknowledged, but fair to the staff it was rectified promptly when addressed.
We had a great time though, the staff were faultless and attentive and the loan of a brolly on a wet weather weekend appreciated.",4,2016,06,13
128,excellent welcome and service,i arrived early after long flight. excellent check in and they found me a room. service was excellent throughout whole stay. low key but high end. definitely will stay again. convenient location and close to all I needed.,5,2016,06,12
128,Faultless!,"Helpful staff throughout the hotel, room was comfortable and all amenities explained by staff when we first entered our room, lovely toiletries in bathroom, great location and delicious breakfast in The Jugged Hare nearby. All in all a great stay",5,2016,06,12
128,"Fantastic stay-lovely room, friendly and helpful staff","We stayed for two nights for a birthday surprise trip. The hotel was fantastic-clean, modern and stylish. All the members of the team were friendly and helpful. The attention to details made the experience feel more special to us.

The room was well equipped, with sufficient hangers in the wardrobe, a hair dryer, toiletries etc. If we had one struggle it was the lack of useable drawer space, as that made storing some items of clothing a bit difficult. The air conditioning worked well, so the temperature of our room was comfortable. We did have fairly loud neighbours on the first night which was frustrating-our room had the facility of an adjoining room though, so that might have caused the noise to travel more than with other rooms.

Breakfast was served in the pub type establishment at the end of the building, which can be accessed through corridors etc but is easier to find by walking along the side of the building, down the street. The food was beautiful and choice was good. Again the staff were helpful and efficient.

Location of the hotel was great, about 5 minutes walk from the tube station, all of which is a level walk and a significant proportion is under cover, courtesy of pavements running alongside the tunnel for traffic.

All in all it was a really enjoyable experience and, if we're due to be back in that area again, we'd be more than happy to stay there again.",5,2016,06,11
128,Quality Start to Finish,"So helpful and informative and very comfortable rooms. Also located handily to two tube stations so easy to get around. Would definitely stay here again when in London.
Beds are big and comfortable. Didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that.",5,2016,06,10
128,Amazing front of house staff,"My company books me here for business occasionally and the team on reception and the concierge are some of the best I've met. Always happy to go above and beyond for service and always with a smile. 

The rooms are always pleasant and the location is great, it would just help if they turned on the sauna earlier in the morning, I need to get to work!!",5,2016,06,10
128,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for one night whilst on business in the city. Managed to get a very reasonable deal to stay for one night and staying at the hotel was so much more pleasurable than staying at other hotels in the same price range. The reception area is lovely and the staff were very helpful. My room was spacious, very clean and comfortable. There was complimentary bottled water and fruit, tea and coffee. There was also a complimentary smart phone that could be used to access the Internet, make free international calls to a selection number of countries and could be taken out to find places/restaurants etc. The bathroom was immaculately clean and it was nice to have elemis toiletries. I didn't book breakfast as in my view it was too expensive and not worth the price - there are plenty of places very close by for breakfast at much more reasonable prices. However all in all I enjoyed my stay, I would recommend the hotel and would certainly consider staying again as it is in a great location and easy to get to with 2 tube stations within a 5 minute walk. ",5,2016,06,08
128,A superb hotel with exceptional staff,"Myself and 15 friends stayed at this hotel on Saturday 28th May for a special celebration. 
Every member of staff made us feel welcome and helped us with luggage, taxis, room queries and even photographs. 
The rooms were beautiful and extremely comfortable. 
The breakfast choice was excellent and the staff were so accommodating, ensuring all of our party was able to sit together for breakfast, even though we hadn't made any table reservations. 
The staff helped make our visit to London enjoyable and special. We would all return to this fabulous hotel. 
Thank you MontCalm Staff for looking after us all so well. ",5,2016,06,07
128,Anniversary weekend  - Amazing ,"We stayed at the Montcalm at the weekend for our anniversary. What can I say from the moment we arrived the Customer Service was excellent from the check in to the porter who showed us to our room on route he explained the history of the hotel . On arriving at our room  I was delighted to find we had been upgraded and the champagne my husband had ordered was in our room on ice with complimentary chocolates and fresh fruit. The room was gorgeous comfy bed and pillows . After coming back from our evening meal there was fresh rose petals scattered on our bed, a lovely thought. Breakfast at the pub was also very good. Would highly recommend will be coming back. Thank you so much to all the staff who made our anniversary special.",5,2016,06,07
128,A great place to stay.,"Stayed here for my partners birthday on 4th June, for one night.
It was his birthday and the room had been decorated with balloons for this.
The staff were all friendly and could not do enough for us.
The room was very big and spacious!
We would defiantly return and for the price we paid.

Thank you. ",5,2016,06,07
128,Super quality in great part of London,"Friendly staff, super comfortable bed !! Well equippped room and stylish, spacious bathroom. Would love to come back 

Only negative, was difficult to keep room right temperature. In middle of night aircondition went on to freezing temperature. Strange.",5,2016,06,07
128,Excellent stay ,"Everything is perfect. Most helpful staffs ever! It was a pleasant stay. From location to facility, just what we want. The historical building shows us the rich culture of the city. The corner restaurant also provides traditional English cuisine.  Convenient and delicious! ",5,2016,06,07
128,"Brilliant customer service, Amazing room, Great Hotel","Everything was brilliant from the moment we arrived at reception, the room and check out. The staff are all super polite and really helpful. we were upgraded to a Duplex suite on 2 levels with bedroom upstairs. Everything you need is in the room even down to a FREE mobile phone with free local and internationals calls as well as 3G data. Bathhroom is off the lounge with a big glass wall so everything is visible (LOL) till you find switch to lower screen. Did not use any facilities in hotel but seems to have everything you need including 24/7 gym sauna etc.  near to Moorgate and Barbican tube stations so easy to get to and from. I will be recommending you to all my friends and family when they plan a visit to London and we will definitely be returning hopefully soon.",5,2016,06,06
128,Whitbread versus Whitbread....!,"I book the Montcalm because we were visiting the Barbican. Discovered that this hotel is a conversion of a Whitbread Brewery. Our room had a high ceiling, bat floor area was small and there was only a shower. Whitbread own Premier Inn and I think their standard is bigger and most have a bath. The difference of course will be staff. At the Montcalm they all  wanted to please. Breakfast was a short outside walk, just like some Premier Inns. Price difference is of course a matter for the client. Get what you pay for.",3,2016,06,06
128,Excellent hotel with first class customer services and rooms.,Excellent room.  All staff had great customer services nothing too much trouble.  We did not eat at the restaurant but visited the Gourmet Pub the real ale was great.  We looked at the menu which looked really good.  On our next visit we will eat at the hotel or the Gourmet Pub.,5,2016,06,05
128,First class hotel and fantastic staff,"My husband and I spent a night here to celebrate my birthday.  Everything about the hotel is faultless. The staff are so friendly and helpful....this is such a wonderful hotel.  We will definitely be staying here again, and I won't hesitate to recommend it to family and friends.  Thank you for contributing to such a perfect weekend.",5,2016,06,05
128,"Lovely hotel, with a splendid central location","Stayed here on business while at a conference in central London. The welcome and reception are excellent. As this hotel is in an old brewery, the journey to your room can be convoluted - take note of where you're going and don't be afraid to accept  assistance - there can be plenty of stairs between you and the room. 

My club room was spacious, and very lovely. Great facilities - fridge, tea coffee, wifi, plenty of power sockets and a useful smartphone with maps and information. 

Slightly disappointed with the service in the bar/seating area - quite often difficult to attract someone's attention through them not being visible. 

That said, for the room, for the location, for the greeting and front desk staff - a recommended place to stay",4,2016,06,04
128,"first class service, easily the nicest hotel i have ever stayed in!","I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. From the moment we arrived we felt specially treated. The suite was very modern and comfortable an the extras provided by staff for my girlfriends birthday were very sweet. All of the staff seemed very friendly and professional, we will undoubtedly stay here again next time we are in town!",5,2016,06,04
128,Fantastic hotel and fantastic staff,"We had a lovely stay at The Montcalm. I was poorly and had lost my voice so upon check in I was given honey and lemon sent to my room, a complimentary upgrade and continental breakfast! Staff were always  going above and beyond and the rooms were fantastic! Bed was super comfy and the location was really central. Absolutely recommend going. If you go on a special occasion they pull out all the stops. ",5,2016,06,03
128,Luxury place to stay,"We booked this as a base to go out into central London, it's actually not for from the Barbican centre and this is the tube you would use, the entrance and lobby are amazing and so stylish, we got a free breakfast included (as it was a special stay) which we decided to take advantage of in the room... It was fit for a queen!!! 
Fresh fruit, croissants, pain au chocolate, fruit juice, amazing coffee and a full cooked breakfast, would definitely recommend. If you opt to eat breakfast not in your room the downside is that the hotel has no dining area and you have to go to the pub over the road, kind of takes the edge off the 5 star stay-although I am sure it is delicious - Deffo stay here again 👍",5,2016,06,02
128,New year eve,"I stayed here for New Year's Eve with my girlfriend. The property was great value for money and I was more than impressed by the attentiveness of the staff, the rooms are fairly small but modern and clean with many great amenities. A great hotel for a short London stay.",5,2016,06,01
128,Excellent weekend break,"We stayed at the Montcalm Brewery London City for a long weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
The stay was excellent from early check in, friendly staff, proper facilities and even organising a cake and complimentary champagne to help us celebrate.",5,2016,06,01
128,Excellent customer service,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Montcalm where staff was very attentive and made us feel well looked after. We initially had  to change room because it was too noisy (due to an aircon unit outside the room on the courtyard side) but this was done easily. Both rooms were very clean, tea/coffee always replenished. ",5,2016,05,31
128,"Lovely hotel, great service. Few minor niggles","My wife & I stayed here for two nights as a early anniversary treat. Firstly the hotel gave us a upgrade to a Club room along with a complimentary bottle of red wine as a present, which was really thoughtful and appreciated.

The hotel has been really well crafted from the old brewery buildings and fits in well with its surroundings.

The room (#146) itself was very nice and comfortable, great facilities including a smart phone for making free telephone calls and using the internet, although you could use your own phone/laptop using the fast free wifi. The usual tea and coffee facilities were present, along with soft fluffy bathrobes, slippers and (when booking) a choice of pillow types and room fragrance.

The staff were wonderfully attentive and could not do more to help, without being too ""in your face"" and nothing appeared to be too much trouble.

Now to the minor negative points; these would not usually cause me to complain in a lower standard of hotel, but they are not things I would expect in a 5* hotel.

The extractor fan in the bathroom did not work and as a result the bathroom became very steamy after a few minutes in the shower (this was reported on day 1).

The carpet in the room had lifted in places, creating "" air bubbles"".

There had clearly been secondary internal windows fitted to double glaze the existing windows but on the window sill between the old and new windows there was a covering of brick dust and other debris which you would have expected the contractors/maintenance staff to have cleared away.

Our room was at the end of a corridor and obviously near to a waste pipe as everytime the upstairs rom flushed their toilet or had a shower the sound of water coming down the waste pipe sounded like a train.

The TV system kept freezing when being used and had to be switched off.

None of these would stop me recommending the hotel to others, or staying there again but they did take the gloss off a fantastic stay - maybe I'm being a bit fussy and expecting to much from a 5* rating?

One thing about the location; it's a business area rather than a touristy one and therefore, as we stayed over a bank holiday weekend, many of the local bars and restaurants were closed on Sunday and BH Monday so we had to go further afield, but it's London you can get anywhere quickly!",4,2016,05,31
128,Great Place to stay,"My third stay here, its in a perfect location and the hotel itself is fantastic. We arrived early and checked in to find we had been upgraded-splendid! But I have to say that I preferred staying over the road, we got bath robes there!
It was my daughters birthday and the hotel kindly left us some wine and chocolate : )

If you are looking for somewhere to stay for easy access to all that the city has to offer, mega comfy beds and friendly staff, pick here.

I will be back!",4,2016,05,31
128,Good transport links ,"We booked this hotel for 3 nights initially and realised that our flight needs us to stay for another night. Any contacted the hotel by email to extend our stay but the response was I have to contact the website I booked it in which I did and was told to get in touch with the hotel directly. Managed to sort out to extend my stay for another when I checked in. The looks really nice and posh but not welcoming. There were loads of staffs around the lobby that you are not comfortable just admiring the decor.  Which is one of my favourite when I booked a hotel.  Anyway the room was clean, good size,  modern and comfortable bed. Unfortunately despite all of this I end up restless,  my people in the next room had a massive fight at night until 6am. Didn't mentioned it at the reception because it is normal. The following night, we have to listen to the cheering over some game until 5 am. This went on until the day we left. I didn't complain because I thought they will check out the following day. But mentioned at the reception when we checked out which is understandable that they can not do anything about it because I didn't complain. Bottom line is that the room is not insulated enough to block out other room noises. We stayed in room 152 which is atop the Jugged Hare which is a nice busy pub with restaurant on the side. The smell of cooking is sipping in the toilet window. But not in the bedroom so stay away from this room. ",4,2016,05,31
128,50th birthday treat!,"We stayed here following a surprise 50th birthday pressie for me. Myself and my partner had first met working for Whitbreads in the 1980s when this building was their head office.... A fantastic transformation into a stunning boutique hotel. We'd booked a club room which isn't one of the cheapest rooms and I was a little underwhelmed, I've stopped in nicer rooms in London at a much cheaper price. The room despite having numerous lighting options was poorly lit over the wardrobe area. The bathroom although high-end still had an over-the-bath shower which I find a tad old fashioned. 
The layout of the hotel is very well planned but as a consequence of its previous life has numerous rooms up and down small steps... Even on the same level.... We were on first floor yet had to mount 4steps, followed by a further 3. Perhaps the hotel should draw attention to this on its webpage? I would definitely say it is not suitable for the less able-bodied. 
Full marks go to the breakfast arrangement. A choice of hot or continental style with very attentive staff. The continental was heaven for me, Greek yoghurt with fruit/nuts, cheese and meats - fantastic. I would say food labelling is sadly lacking (or hidden) - we witnessed some non-English speakers using small side-plates for their cooked breakfast and were making several journeys back and forth as a result. It wasn't clear where the larger plates provided were located. I also needed to know the gluten free option but had to ask as labelling wasn't in place.
A very beautiful and stylish hotel. 
",4,2016,05,30
128,Excellent break,"Room was very high standard. Staff were friendly, courteous and professional.
Location was also very central, ten minute walk to the city and the Thames.
Booked direct and the price was better than booking.com",5,2016,05,30
128,"Charming, calming and catchy","The location of this was perfect for us as it is close to my husband's office and very close to the Moorgate and Barbican underground stations. I also walked to many attractions such as museums, St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London (a bit far) from the hotel. From the start, the service was superb and added to the efficient calm at the Montcalm. The rooms are well appointed. Staying in a revamped brewery with so much history is a treat.",4,2016,05,30
128,Great place to stay,The location is good as it is near the Moorgate station. Staffs were very friendly and cheerful. It was a very pleasant experience staying at this hotel. Will definitely book again if I come to london.,5,2016,05,30
128,Best hotel!!! ,"Me and my fiancé stayed here for our 5 year anniversary and all I can say is wow!!! 

The moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. We had already been emailed before we arrived asking what our reason for staying was and when we replied that it was our anniversary, we were told we would be upgraded and had a romantic turn down service. They went above and beyond before we even arrived! 

The room itself was beautiful. The bath was amazing and the bed was unbelievably comfortable!!! Best nights sleep in a hotel! 

We just want to say thank you to all the staff who always made sure we were sorted for transport and even when we checked out, they held our luggage for the day whilst we went to London which we did not expect.

But a special thanks to Gabriele who arranged the upgrade and turndown service. Really made our anniversary that extra special, and we will definitely stay here again!!! ",5,2016,05,29
128,great for business ,"Stayed for a business visit as we had a work event at the brewery. fantastic service, stunning building and comfy beds. in a good location and would definitely recommend for business or for pleasure. (would also recommend having a drink in the bar!)",5,2016,05,29
128,Stunning Hotel,"My parents surprised me with a weekend trip to London for my birthday, this is where they decide we would stay, and it we weren't disappointed! The reception area was very classy looking, the staff were really friendly, and the accommodation was lovely. My parents stayed in Room 606, it was all very clean (minus a few slightly broken bits) and I stayed in Room 616, which was amazing! There was a little kitchenette, the most comfortable bed ever, and a stunning bathroom. The only downside of my room was the view but never mind! The price for breakfast was far too pricey for what it was, so we found an All Bar One 5mins down the road and that did the job! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2016,05,27
128,Beautiful Hotel with amazing staff,"The hotel is an amazing building, nicely situated between Moorgate & Barbican tube stations.  The room was amazing and so were all the staff, nothing was too much trouble.

My only slight negative was the breakfast in the club room, not too much choice, a lack of clean bowls/plates etc and hardly any tables, it was in like a lounge, someone stood up from their table to let us sit down with our breakfast.  Only one lady on working and nothing was cleared away off the tables.

Not really sure what a club room was? reading other comments?

Lovely nights sleep, beautiful room & building and very helpful staff.",4,2016,05,25
128,Great service! A very nice staff always willing to make you stay great.,"The room was fantastic, well equipped, very nice and confortable.  The Restaurant and The Brewery were very good. Since I was there for business, The Brewery was the place for the entire event.  It has confortable conference rooms.",5,2016,05,24
128,Delightful Experience,"From checking in and finding out our room had been upgraded, being shown to our room and checking out the whole experience was friendly and attentive. Location brilliant a short walk from transport and ten minutes from St Pauls. Our trip was to celebrate my birthday we would certainly return",5,2016,05,24
128,Good London City hotel convenient to Moorgate and Baribacan,"Adaptive re-use of the old Whitbread brewery on Chiswell Street about midway between Moorgate and Barbican tube stops.  Staff were attentive, friendly and professional.

Rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable.  Working within the old brewery structure results in little odditities of layout but are a nice reminder that you're not in a structure designed as a hotel.  The brick barrel vaults that form the ceiling of my room were a good example of relating to the history of the structure.  

My room came with full English breakfast served at The Jugged Hare, a popular pub on the ground floor.  Service there was also friendly and attentive.

Historical note: Whitbread brewery was the primary sponsor of the original around-the-world sailing race first run in 1973 and now known as the Volvo Ocean Race.

Plenty of options nearby for dining, great central location with easy access to the Tube.  10 min. walk east to Liverpool Street Station for National Rail connections.  15 minutes walk northeast to Shoreditch or south to St. Paul's Cathedral.",4,2016,05,23
128,Very nice but a litte overdone.,"It is a very nice hotel with everything you need, but as I was standing in the lobby there were more then 10 employees and only 2 guests. It looked a little overcrowded with staff.
My room was small room with no view, only a small dirty window looking at nothing.
Breakfast OK, Wifi OK, Staff is really nice and helpful.",3,2016,05,23
128,Fantastic boutigue Hotel Stay in London,"Stayed last weekend in London. Booked this on  line for a reasonable price (especially for London!!), and was not really expecting much. What a surprise when we arrived on Friday night late!. Wonderful welcome at reception, and quickly checked into a most luxurious room with a massive bathroom. Beds, pillows comfortable. Great shower. Excellent wifi coverage
Didn't  eat there, as breakfast is expensive (£25 pp). But adjoining pub Jagged Hare is nice. Free coffee in reception area in the mornings. A lovely stay, and not a bad location right next to the Barbican. Well done London City Suites,",5,2016,05,23
128,Absolutely lovely hotel however .....,"I was in London visiting a friend for the weekend and came across this hotel on Trip Advisor so I thought I would book this as a treat.
We booked just the standard room and it was lovely, plenty of room for both of us, bed was amazingly comfy I would have happily wheeled it home with me. Staff were all super friendly and helpful. We even managed to squeeze a trip to the sauna and steam room - which is perfect for two anymore and you'd be getting up close and personal with someone! 
Loved this hotel however there were a couple of things that ruined it!
We were put in a room with adjoining door into the next room, there was no soundproofing so when we returned to our room on the Saturday night we were treated to the occupants next door having a ball to Eurovision until about 12:30am when they finally turned it down if that wasn't bad enough the TV was switched back on at 7:30am the next morning so it was a lovely wake up call especially when you've escaped your kids for the weekend and were looking forward to an uninterrupted lie in. The second thing that ruined our stay as the room we were in had a courtyard  view which was lovely however roughly 7:15am on the Saturday morning and 9:30am ish on the Sunday morning (after we had managed to fall back asleep) we were awoken by the sound of something being emptied outside and doors banging.
I noted my disappointments at check out and the receptionist apologised and offered to perhaps do something if I was planning to stay again but the experience has totally put me off which is a shame because it is a beautiful hotel with very attentive staff. 
",3,2016,05,23
128,Super hotel in a unique setting,Had a lovely one night stay here. We received a complimentary upgrade to a club room which was excellent. The room was a good size with a huge bathroom.

128,Love it to the moon and back.,"A perfect partnership of history and modernity.

This stunning hotel situated in the heart of the City of London is an oasis of hospitality and luxury. We often stay in London, but this is our first time at the Montcalm; it won’t be the last. We just adored it from the moment we stepped inside the courtyard. We stayed in a Barbican Duplex, which was superb thanks to an unexpected upgrade – excellent. Still, we loved the place so much a broom cupboard would have been okay :-).

We ate in the Jugged Hare, of which more, in a separate review.

We can’t wait to go back to what is definitely our new favourite London hotel. 
By the way – broadband is complimentary, and there are other unique bonuses, such room fragrance. Take a look at the website for more details, I don’t want to list them here and get it wrong.

Recommended. Love it to the moon and back.",5,2016,05,22
128,Wonderful introduction to London!,"We stayed here at the beginning of a three week trip. It was lovely. The staff were friendly and courteous, and the room was a nice size and very welcoming. The breakfast was a highlight. We also found the bed to be very comfortable and the room was quiet. Overall, a great experience!",5,2016,05,22
128,Exceptional Hotel and Service,We stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend. It is a lovely building and the rooms are excellent and equipped to a very high standard. The service from check-in until check-out couldn't have been better. We dined and the Jugged Hare and would highly recommend it to lovers of game and British Classics. ,5,2016,05,22
128,Business turned leisure! ,"Thank you, thank you, thank you to the AMAZING staff at The Montcalm. We checked in yesterday and were chatting to their amazing concierge regarding our plans for the weekend, unfortunately we were in London on business, but our meeting had been put back until later in the day.. The concierge suggested we make the most of our day on Sunday and enjoy a much needed lie in!! She also put our check out time back to 2pm so we had a base until we needed to get to our meeting. She also arranged for breakfast in bed to be delivered from the club lounge for us as I'm a wheelchair user and couldn't access the lounge via lift. Andreea delivered our breakfast and she was so friendly! She brought us a selection of meats, porridge, fruit, juices and pastries which were all absolutely delicious. I rarely write tripadvisor reviews but in this case it was absolutely necessary. The staff really are an asset at this hotel, and the hotel it's self is lovely.. Trendy with old brewery features. If you are staying definitely check out the Jugged Hare restaurant too.. Great selection of classic food, including some great game dishes! THANK YOU MONTCALM for making our working weekend relaxing and enjoyable! ",5,2016,05,22
128,"Great hotel, good location and excellent service","Old brewery converted into a hotel. The route within is sometimes complex but the rooms are amazing, well decorated , clean and a feeling like being home! The service is great. location within reach of 3 subways.",5,2016,05,22
128,Amazing hotel,"We stayed at The Montcalm on a overnight birthday treat to London. The hotel is in a great location just a few minutes walk from Oxford street and Hyde park. As we entered the hotel, we were greeted by the most lovely reception staff and offered a glass of prosecco as we checked in. The lady then took us to our room to show us around and all the facility's. The room was lovely, with fresh fruit, robes, slippers, coffee, tea (in gorgeous cups & sauces) mini bar, water etc....There was also an iPhone available for guessed to use to make free international phone calls or land line and mobile calls to the uk as well as use for Internet access. 
The bathroom was lovely and I was very impressed with the selection of toiletries available and the quantity, not the standard one of each, but two or three of each item. 
The hotel is fantastic, but what made it extra special was the customer service from the staff, honestly nothing was too much trouble. Thank you so much for a great birthday stay. ",5,2016,05,20
128,Beautiful Hotel,"What a beautiful Hotel this is!! 
I attended due to a business trip and will be returning on a personal trip as soon as I get the chance. Lovely rooms, fantastic Breakfast and wonderful/helpful staff! The place has so much Charm and I have fallen in Love with it! ",5,2016,05,19
128,"Helpful staff, quiet but rich location","Travelled to London on a two week business trip and The Brewery was recommended by the local office.  The reception staff was always courteous and friendly, and offered to upgrade me to a club room at no charge.  The room wasn't large (not that I expected it to be) and lacked a dresser (kind of a sore point when staying for two weeks), but was beautifully furnished and modernized.  Most importantly I did not go into the office until 10 AM and not once was I disturbed or awoken.  The Jugged Hare provides the morning meals and was always accommodating and delicious.  The location was ideal, close to both some historical places as well as nightlife.  I will definitely be booking my next business trip here again.",5,2016,05,19
128,Perfect place,"A lovley weekend in London - we booked on this nice hotel and got a Club room with great space. It was our first trip to London an it was great to find a phone (for our use only) we could use to find good restaurants, museums, or use it as an ordinary gps - for instans google map. This hotel is a short walk from St. Paul and London Museum - and in the middle of the business aerea. 
The staff helped us find a very nice restaurant friday night. Thank you so much. We booked breakfast every day. Nice an with all types of food. Perfect. We also got fruit and chocolat at our room as well :) :) 
Clean and quiet. And the staff we met was very serviceminded. 
This  is an old brewery and there is a pub en 2 restaurants in the hotel.",5,2016,05,19
128,Nice quiet location for a weekend!,"The room was a tad tight even for London standards but for £125.00 per night we did not complain and just moved certain items around to accommodate our stay.  Nicely decorated in a modern theme with a glass window through to the bathroom which luckily had an electric blind for those....moments!  The whole hotel's environment has subdued lighting and whilst relaxing it is a bit dark when your bedroom faces a brick wall only feet away and no natural light is available!  Hard to know when morning has arrived - some people may or may not like this so worth asking when checking in if it is something that would bother you.

As we stayed at the weekend, and the local area is mainly financial, it was nice and quiet, had good tube facilities and attractions such as St Paul's  nearby.  The Jugged Hare pub, which is part of the hotel, is very welcoming and has some great bar snacks.

All in all, not bad!",4,2016,05,18
128,Excellent service,"I was travelling alone and the reception staff were friendly and kind enough to ungrade me to a club room and give me a room that was a bit quieter.. Staff showed me to my room because they were doing work and it was quicker through the courtyard. I met  my son in The Jugged Hare where the food is excellent along with the service. It's a very laid back atmostphere and perfect for us. The next morning check out was quick and easy even though I didn't want to get out of my bed it w.as so comfortable. I would certainly stay here again because it offered everything  I needed, a comfortable bed,excellent food and staff that just coldnt do enought for you",5,2016,05,17
128,A little bit of Heaven in London,"My partner and I recently stayed at The Montcalm to celebrate his 50th birthday.
We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly reception upon our arrival and consequent stay at the hotel. 
The room was well equipped and extremely comfortable. The contemporary feel and finishings added to the enjoyment of our stay. It is unfortunate that some of the fittings were a little 'tired' and in need of repair, particularly the loose fittings on the bath which proved frustrating when emptying and filling. Apart from these minor details,everything else was presented to a high standard.
The staff should be highly commended,ensuring that we were happy and comfortable. Thank you for your warm hospitality and friendly approach.
The location is great too. Close your eyes as you walk through the Barbican tunnel and enjoy the splendours of Smithfield market and its lovely restaurants. A great location on the doorstep of the Montcalm. 
Overall,a great location with wonderful staff. Thank you for a relaxing weekend stay.  ",4,2016,05,17
128,"in the city, close to stuff","great staff and they look after you. a little bit OTT, as I could have carried my bag to my room.
I'm being forced by the software to add in 200 words.
the hotel is quirky to the positive, choice of a posh restaurant or a great quality pub food",4,2016,05,17
128,Well-managed unique hotel in a business district,"You are wellcomed at the reception. The way to the room is a bit like a maze but there are indication signs everywhere, so you do not lose yourself in the hotel. English breakfast is served in the adjacent Jugged Hare, a traditional English pub/restaurant.
They upgraded my booked room to the Club Double, which was clean and spacious.
All in all, the staff tried to make guests feel comfortable, which I appreciate.
It is not cheap but the hotel offers very good value.",5,2016,05,17
128,"Great bed, probably for business people, smack in the City center.","The bed was good and the staff friendly. But location and style wise we didn't like it so much. The rooms have an inside stairs, the AC was quite noisy. There was a window in our room with the wall almost right before it. If you walk outside it is high rise offices everywhere. Nothing cosy around. The weekend rate was quite strong: only €150 per room per night. Which is great value for London.",4,2016,05,16
128,A lovely surprise,"We booked a last minute trip and managed to get a night here for £115. What a lovely surprise, a wonderful, clean comfortable hotel in a lovely area of London. Can't wait to return! The only downside is that the hotel bar isn't in the hotel but for the sake of a thirty second walk it's not a big deal.",4,2016,05,16
128,Perfect stay !,"Stayed @ the Montclam for two night last weekend. Staff very , very helpfull ready for your every wish. Room very 2016, quiet area, only 10 minute walk to the tube station. 
Loved my midnight club sandwich :-) 
Would I stay here again ? Yes I would !",5,2016,05,16
128,A well preserved and refurbished former brewery hotel. ,"I stayed a night in this hotel on 15th May because of a job interview just few minutes away from the hotel. I booked the room via booking.com where I was able to reserve a room for half of the original price. The people in the reception were extremely polite and even one of them gave me an interesting background story of the hotel. The room was relatively small but it was only me, so wasn't really a concern. Will definitely use it again if I had the opportunity. ",5,2016,05,16
128,Yet another perfect stay at  the Montcalm,"My wife and I stayed at the Montcalm for one night as part of mine and a friends birthday celebrations. The Montcalm is always our preferred hotel when staying in London.

We were checked in by Paola, who was extremely helpful, bubbly and polite. She very kindly upgraded us to the WOW suite, which was incredible and very generous. The room was one of the best hotel rooms we've stayed at in London. The bathroom was exquisite, the four poster bead was extremely comfortable and birthday chocolates and a bottle of wine, accompanied by a birthday card were a lovely touch. 

I always recommend the Montcalm to friends and family who need somewhere to stay in London. It's location is first class and the standard of the rooms and friendliness of staff are second to none.

Thank you very much for helping to make my birthday a memorable one - I very much look forward to staying at the Montcalm again in the very near future.",5,2016,05,16
128,Mountcalm on the brewery ,"The Montcalm at The Brewery has to be experienced to be believed absolutely everything from entering the wonderful hotel to leaving was nothing short of Heavenly Bliss. We were treated like royalty, the bed, the pillows,  the bath, rose petals, wine, chocolates and the staff couldn't do enough it was a pleasure and we will be returning soon highly recommended many thanks Alice ( GUEST ADVISOR) for helping us make great memories. Just what the doctor ordered ",5,2016,05,15
128,Fantastic anniversary visit ,"This hotel is fabulous, we visited for our 5th anniversary and on arrival we were told we had been upgraded! Shown to our room to find a had written card, chocolates and wine as a present, and just to make it even more special we got back from dinner to find our bed covered in rose petals in the shape of a number 5 and towels as a swan love heart. 

Room was comfortable, room a lovely size and staff absolutely fabulous! 

The only con would be the price of breakfast, we would of loved to have had breakfast in our room but could not have afforded £60odd for breakfast. ",5,2016,05,15
128,Outstanding (with amazing staff),"Absolutely outstanding! Stayed over night as had a business meeting the next day. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming, and were especially helpful when I realised I had left an important document at home and needed to print another copy.
Had an amazing night sleep (as confirmed by my fitbit), helped by the chocolates left on my pillow. Breakfast at the Jagged Hare was absolutely delicious. Hoping that I can one day stay again. Thank you!",5,2016,05,15
128,Wonderful stay,"We booked The Montcalm at the Brewery for my husband 's 70 th birthday trip to London
The whole experience was outstanding. Reception staff were exemplary as were the concierges. The room was spacious and beautifully furnished and clean! My husband was given complimentary champagne and chocolates . The breakfast was excellent. Our thanks to all the staff but especially Graine for organising a memorable visit.",5,2016,05,15
128,Perfect. *Highly* Recommended,"We arrived for one night yesterday. We had booked direct (mont calm secret stay) and we most certainly will be returning.
The room (club) is large (unlike some in London), very clean and we requested a quiet room which we received. 
Checkout is noon which is great. We visited the club room for a drink prior to leaving and it was another lovely experience. 
We returned to a lovely acknowledgement of our 10 year anniversary (piccy included).
We most certainly find this ticks all of our boxes and will return shortly with the family to the studios opposite.
If you like character (converted brewery), polite staff, very clean room, luxury bedding and choice of pillows etc, this is for you. Blows malmaison out of the water. 
Tube nearby and we booked an uber whilst in the lobby which arrived 3 mins later.
Highly recommended *****
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2016,05,15
128,Excellent stay with exceptional staff,"We really had a great stay at the Montcalm.  It was my husbands birthday and they gave us free chocolates and half bottle of red wine. They'd put balloons on the bed and his age shaped out of rose petals.  We were impressed by the room facilities.  Everywhere was very clean and the reception area was opulent and regal.  The hotel is close to the tube and everything is a short taxi ride away too.  The staff were plentiful and very attentive.  In the lead up to our stay, our pre arrival host had been emailing me to ask if we had any questions and to prepare our arrival.",4,2016,05,15
128,First class service,"We have stopped several times at this hotel, and have always found the service and 
attention to detail outstanding. This time we had a Wow suite, and the room was terrific.
Wifi connection was easy, and fast. The Club Lounge serving canapes and drinks early evening is a nice touch.
I had a bad spill of grease all over my suit from a Lunch incident, and when I returned to the hotel late afternoon they had my suit cleaned and back to my room later that evening! Faultless service.
Grazia from Guest Relations made sure everything ran smoothly during our visit, and made us feel very welcome.
If you want a hotel which makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive, pays attention to the details, and sorts out your problems,look no further.",5,2016,05,14
128,Hidden gem,Only here for one night and this was our first stay. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel is set in a converted brewery and it had a nice feel to it. Room was comfortable well equipped and clean. This hotel is in an ideal location for a short or longer stay with easy access to the Circle Line only 5 minutes walk. ,5,2016,05,14
128,Over night stay.,"Absolutely stunning hotel, 5 star service from the minute we entered the hotel. Great deal, gorgeous room and lovely staff. Only 10 min tube journey from Kings Cross. The pub that is attached to the hotel (name escapes me) could really do with getting shot of all the stuffed animals and birds they have on display. Bit off putting. ",5,2016,05,13
128,Quiet restful sleep,"Enjoyed the Montcalm for our 10 night stay. After walking all over town each day the bed provided such a great restful sleep, we were good to go the next day. Room service was quick and easy and the coffee was great. Maid service was very good, allowing weary travelers to come back to clean well cared for room!

The service was good and the people were friendly. Thanks!",4,2016,05,12
128,Outstanding.,"Best hotel service in London and possibly the world. Special thanks to the Bulgarian concierge Voihov, who went way beyond the call of duty to help me with some tech issues; they ain't a problem that he can't fix. The Jugged Hare, the associated 'gastro pub' next door however, needs to up its game considerably in terms of its service and food quality; the exception is waiter/greeter Javier who is excellent and would improve things no end if he was the manager; service with a smile maybe a cliche, but it makes a hell of a difference.",5,2016,05,11
128,Strongly recommend,"Having stayed at other Montcalm hotels before (all of which have been excellent), I decided to stay at the Brewery City whilst on a recent business trip. I was given a Club room, which was very well appointed and spotlessly clean, with a varied range of quality amenities, in particular the fabulous chocolate truffles. The staff were friendly and efficient, so will definitely stay again.",5,2016,05,11
128,A super location for the Barbican,"I spent a weekend at this hotel with my mother as we had tickets to see the ""Hollow Crown Cycle"" (Richard II, Henry's IV.1.2. & V) at the Barbican next door in Celebration f Shakespeare's 400th death anniversary.

The stay was very pleasant, the staff helpful, it is a good, clean functional business hotel rather than what I would generally regard as deluxe five star property.  No place would have been better placed or more convenient for us that weekend at the barbican.",3,2016,05,11
128,Very pleasant stay,"One night stay on a Sat night so area generally quiet. Good tube connection.

Very accomodating with early check in. Room moved to the city suites across the road. Spacious and well equipped if a bit dark with view of service area from rear ground floor room.

Bed comfortable, bathroom good. If staying longer sure the complimentary phone & mobile guide could be useful.",4,2016,05,10
128,Fantastic Service,"My Partner and I have stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery 3 times in the last 6 weeks, each stay has been top class.  We have stayed in the Wow suite a couple of times and was not disappointed.  Most recently we stayed in A Montclam Club Room, the room was extremely large and airy.  It was a very hot day but the temperature in the room was cool and comfortable.  We had complimentary chocolates in our room, it is these little touches that make this a great hotel. You will have to go a long way to have a better nights sleep than what you have at the Montcalm. Each time we are welcomed back by Hiral, his customer care is exceptional, nothing is too much trouble.   From when you arrive and are greeted by the Doorman, to when you leave the service is exemplary.  Hiral and his team provide a truly top class service.  The club lounge is always an asset to our stay. We look forward to returning very soon.",5,2016,05,10
128,Great nights stay,"Superb quality room with everything you could possibly want. Bed was huge and very comfortable with huge duvet making for a very good nights sleep. Service from all staff was second to none. Vlad on the gate was extremely welcoming.
It was my wife's birthday which they noted and left us a small bottle of wine and chocolates which was a lovely touch
",5,2016,05,10
128,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed overnight after attending a family party at the Jugged Hare (part of the hotel).   The room was very comfortable and well-equipped; my only criticism was that the window looked into offices a few feet away, but this didn't really affect our stay.",5,2016,05,09
128,Practically perfect in every way.,"I don't normally return to hotels, for no other reason than there are many out there to explore.  This weekend my wife and I returned here for a quick weekend away and were delighted with all aspects of our visit.  Staff were faultless, and professional at every turn.  Special mention for William in the Jugged Hare, an entertaining waiter. We were in one of the Wow Suites, and there is a wow factor with the four poster bed, not to mention the picture window between the bedroom and the shower... The bed was big and comfortable. The food at Jugged Hare was generous and tasty with good wine list. The hotel is handily placed near Liverpool St station, and a stone throw from Barbican. 

Would I return? Definitely
",5,2016,05,09
128,Full of charm and very friendly,"Beautifully converted building is quirky and modern. The interiors are stylish with some really carefully selected features. Add the comfiest bed with chic linens, lovely Hermes toiletries in generously sized bottles, Jing tea, superb breakfast and the fact that this hotel is conveniently situated right next to Barbican, but the thing is, the list does not stop here. There is also complementary fruit, wine and chocolates in the room on arrival with a handwritten note, impeccable level of cleanliness and often missing in corporate world culture among staff that any criticism is just a useful feedback and requires action. I particularly want to mention Alice who got in touch before our second visit - thank you for making special effort and accommodating all our demands. I am also so grateful to Vlad and his team at the concierge desk. You are making every guest feel welcome and thank you for all the effort you took to locate the lost shopping bag. This goes beyond professional service. 
My husband and I are looking forward of staying with you soon.",5,2016,05,08
128,Stunning ,"My wife and I spent the night for our wedding anniversary. 

I wanted to book something a bit special for the occasion and I wasn't 

Reception staff were very friendly and the manager even introduced herself and welcomed us. 

The room was immaculate and very spacious. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who fancy a bit of luxury. ",5,2016,05,08
128,Luxurious hotel for the romantic and shicky,"I had a good time in this hotel. it is designed in old fashion and it has special, like boutique, characteristics. 
quite close to a tube and very close to a market and pub. 
I would recommend for business, leisure and romantic couples",5,2016,05,08
128,Tranquility in the middle of London,"We've just spent 2 nights here at end of hectic week and can't fault the place. Friendly, helpful staff, extraordinarily comfortable bed and peace and quiet in what is still a busy part of town at the weekend. For the standard of accommodation it was also great value",5,2016,05,08
128,Charming labyrinth,"Very elegant and luxury hotel, with several buildings, different among them: amazing!
Customer service excellent! I don't give the 5th point only because of a person at the reception: he asked me a thing, that I did not understand, so I requested if he could repeat, but he laughed looking at a female collegue without telling me anything. As for me he expressed derision.",4,2016,05,07
128,Beware!,"I have stayed here with my colleagues many times over the past few years as we've been working on a deal and our attorneys and bankers are close by. I have tried to like this place but alas that is impossible. First of all, the housekeeping is nearly non existent. I spent 5 nights and had a clean room and towels for only 2 days. Also the water in the room was not restocked. To top off the last trip, we finished our meetings early and were able to get early flights back to the US. However, this hotel would not let us check out early without a penalty despite the frequent visits and future bookings. For me and my company and I also recommend - we will find another option in the area of which there are many. ",2,2016,05,06
128,Friendly and professional team at this hotel!,"I keep coming back to this hotel. Not the fanciest hotel in the world but great charm and appeal. The real reason I always come back is the team.
The managers - Simone and Alice are two incredible individuals and will do their best to accommodate your needs. They are understanding and very friendly.
Add to this the very professional Vlad that heads up the Concierge team - I often wonder if the hotel will be the same without him!  Courteous, professional and extremely competent and he takes great pride in his role as the first face that customers see.
You will meet Adeel in the Club Lounge - another professional and extremely helpful individual that makes your stay and meetings in the Club Lounge as comfortable as possible. 
Thank you to all the team but in particular Alice, Simone, Vlad and Adeel - you are the reason a lot of us come back again and again!
Ron",5,2016,05,06
128,Quiet and central,"I was originally planned to stay at the sister apartment hotel across the street, but was transferred to here. The service was quite attentive, and the room very nice if rather small (understandable given the central location). Wifi worked without problems. Breakfast was at the pub next door, of good quality but not especially memorable apart from again really good service - my advice is to prepay breakfast the night before (£15) or order something else than the full buffet (which is £25 if not preordered).",4,2016,05,06
128,Weekend Visit,"Stayed here for two nights and found the hotel very nice the staff were very professional, helpful and friendly.  This trip was an early 30th wedding anniversary celebration and we returned to our room the find some lovely chocolates and a half bottle of Chianti which was very nice along with a hand written card wishing us a happy anniversary.  Thank you Montcalm.  The room was on the small side but as we were only there for a couple of nights didn't feel the need to ask for a larger one. Transport links were close by with 3 to choose from.",5,2016,05,05
128,An wonderful overnight stay,"My first experience of the Montcalm at the Brewery and it was delightful. We celebrated a birthday which the staff made very special, they were all aware of the occasion and made us very welcome. Our room was upgraded and decorated to reflect the occasion. We had a lovely time and will definitely book again.",5,2016,05,04
128,A great Hotel in handy location.,"I recently had the pleasure of a one night stay in 'The Montcalm at the Brewery'. The Hotel is conveniently located close to the Barbican centre and a just a quick walk from the Barbican tube station. On arrival I found the reception team and the Guest Experience Manager very welcoming and helpful, which is always a good start to a stay. My room was very comfortable and I'm pleased to say not noisy at all. Thus I had a good nights sleep. The fruit and chocolates in the room were a nice touch and the Nespresso machine was put to good use. Having access to the Club Lounge was handy for a relaxing G&T or two and snacks after a busy day. The Brewery architecture gives the hotel a certain charm that a lot of purpose built hotels just don't have. I'm looking forward to staying here again and for longer.",5,2016,05,03
128,Two night city break,"Second time that we have stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery London City, and planning our next stay later in the year.
Customer service is second to none, reception staff, and door man extremley helpfull and welcoming.
Club room was spacious, and cleaned to a high standard.
Breakfast served in the jugged Hare offfers a great choice from full English to continetal charcuterie, Cheeses, and cereals.
location is great for us, walking distance to St Pauls, tube 5 minute walk.
And to end a great day in London The Jugged Hare serves up some of the best cocktails.",5,2016,05,03
128,My first choice for work trips,"I've stayed here a number of times now for work, and am always very happy with the quality of the rooms and service. The dinner menu at the Jugged Hare is an absolute winner, especially the sunday roast!",5,2016,05,03
128,A five star weekend,"I actually ended up booking this hotel as part of lastminute.com 'Top Secret' hotels deals and I am so glad I did as I have discovered somewhere amazing to stay! 

Montcalm made every effort to ensure our needs were met, which started a week before we had even arrived. I had emailed to double check we would be able to hold luggage there during the day pre/post-check in (you can!) and mentioned that it was a special weekend. I later received an email from a member of the team informing me that they would make it a special occasion - a nice touch, as I hadn't sent my initial query to this person - and they did exactly that.

We arrived to an upgrade, which entitled us access to the club lounge and complimentary breakfast in the morning. This was lovely, with a great selection of food and drinks available and very helpful staff in you needed something extra.

The room was huge, with a generously stocked bathroom, great facilities and probably the comfiest bed I have ever slept in.

The cherry on top? Being sent champagne and strawberries shortly after checking in to mark our special occasion :)

Thank you so much Montcalm, for all of your efforts. We had such a wonderful weekend, made perfect by your thoughtful contributions. We hope to be back soon!",5,2016,05,03
128,Excellent Hotel,We were going to the O2 Arena to see UB40 and found the hotel to be first class and the location convenient for transport purposes plus dining out and socializing. We could not have had a better experience with the staff being very attentive.,5,2016,05,03
128,Truly wonderful hotel & exemplary staff,"Stayed here with my wife over bank holiday weekend as a treat for my wife's birthday.
I honestly cannot say enough good things to explain our experience at the Montcalm.
We arrived very stressed and upset due to our daughter not being well, and close to possibly having to go home before the weekend even started!
We were greeted by Grazia (Guest Relations Host) you reassurance, warmth and professionalism were overwhelming! 

You could see my wife was upset and were so kind to us, which I am so great grateful for.

The Montcalm is a beautiful hotel in a former brewery and I though it was stunning. Rooms were fantastic, modern with some really lovely touches.

We got upgraded on our second night to a suite which was unexpected and a real joy! The suite was so good we both said we would love to stay for ever!

As beautiful as the hotel was, it was the team of staff at Montcalm that really made our stay extra special. We were made to feel so special and could not have been looked after any better. 

We were so impressed with all the team and would like to say a huge thank you, especially to Grazia & Neil. You really did go above and beyond.

It's a great base for exploring Lindon, yet it's peaceful for relaxing at the Hotel.

Your club lounge was fabulous, and much appreciated.

We will definitely be returning soon and cannot wait to see you all again!

Regards

128,A happy experience,"Happy smiling more than helpful staff.  Decent sized rooms.  Very comfy beds with good linen.  Not convinced about the glass partition, but the blind works just fine.  Lovely effort made by all the staff to ensure a pleasant stay. Met our needs and exceeded expectation.",4,2016,05,02
128,Nice friendly staff,"Booked on the spur of the moment thought we would treat ourselves to a nice hotel.
Room was quite noisy with outside noise and other guests talking loudly as they walked past our room.
Room was quite small but the bed was comfortable and the facilities were good. 
Room key did not lock our door when we left but the staff were quick to fix this once we pointed it out.
Well stocked mini bar and helpful friendly staff. ",4,2016,05,02
128,Excellent hotel,"Fantastic stay at the Montcalm as part of a wedding party. Staff were all so friendly, helpful and welcoming. Rooms were lovely and luxurious. Great facilities in hotel. Food excellent in Chiswell Street Dining Rooms and also breakfast in The Jugged Hare.",5,2016,05,02
128,London Suites = the lovely Moncalm Hotel!!,"Booked through Booking.com who market the rooms of this hotel as London City Suites. However they never refer to The Montcalm Hotel. Is this a deep secret or a marketing ploy. So I was surprised after 40 minutes of searching the area to find they were one and the same. A totally unnecessary waste of time and acquisiton of sore feet  if Booking.com had been transparent.  

However this hotel is a gem .. great service, lovely room and a beautiful breakfast at reasonable cost the following morning .. nothing was too much trouble for the staff once I'd arrived!  

There were several others with the same perverse issue cause by Booking.com's miss-labelling or the Montcalm's marketing ploy to fill rooms?",5,2016,05,02
128,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here as part of a birthday surprise from my partner. Nice little birthday treats in the room waiting for me. When we had a slight issue with the bath in our room and reception were so quick to help. They quickly arranged for us to move rooms to one more suitable and even gave us a free breakfast. Breakfast was tasty although not a huge amount of options. 

Super attentive staff, lovely rooms, excellent central location. ",4,2016,05,01
128,First 5 Star hotel visit ,"We booked this hotel for our birthday weekends and for the special occasion booked our first five star hotel. I'll write this review in three parts; The experience, the room and the food! 

Arriving at the hotel was a pleasant experience having our cases taken to the room and having all the rooms gadgets explained to us. All the staff are very polite and will do anything they can to make your stay a good one. I mentioned in the booking stage that it was our birthdays and we arrived to the room with balloons on the bed and complimentary wine and truffles and a nice note from Gracie the experience host! Perfect! 

The room is full of all the luxuries you can think of; designer soaps, underfloor heating, dressing gowns and even a mobile phone!! A few niggling points; a hole in the wall where a socket clearing used to be, marks all over the Windows where they were installed (permanent marker) and a wobbly tap and soap holder. Other than that the room is perfect and the bed is very very comfy!! 

The breakfast in the Jugged Hare is of extremely good quality, full English, continental and cereals available. Service is quick and polite, an absolute pleasure. 

I would stay in hotel again however I'd book a more expensive room in the hope that the niff naff I mentioned above won't be present in that room but other than that this hotel is very good!!!! ",4,2016,05,01
128,Cosy upperclass hotel,"A classy yet cosy upperclass hotel that goes an extra mile to please in its service, I am very happy with the rooms and concierge service. London City Suites is also managed by the same management including its check-in premise.  We stayed in both and loved both. London City Suites which is just across the small street from Montcalm has double glazed windows that eliminate street noise while Montcalm's Club Room suite has old, probably original windows that gives an authentic London street noise feel. 
Would have given 5 star, but housekeeping replaced the suite's Hermes toiletries collection with Elmis toiletries collection on 2nd day.  ",4,2016,05,01
128,It takes ages to switch off all the lights,This is a bit of an odd hotel.  The rooms can be very noisy as the hotel holds events with loud music until midnight and it is attached to The Brewery events venue.  The rooms have an amazingly complicated lighting configuration - it takes ten minutes to work out how to switch off all the lights.,3,2016,04,30
128,The venue was excellent! Great location,"I wanted to send a review to cover the events part of this venue as it was really good! The food was excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful which isnt always the case in London. I would definitely reccommend this hall to anyone looking for a large venue to run a congress, symposium or company meeting",4,2016,04,30
128,Perfect hotel for a special occasion ,Stayed at this hotel for anniversary celebrations and can easily say this hotel is perfect. Staff could not do more if they tried and every part of this hotel experience was amazing. Porter's always had a welcome smile on arrival ready to offer there services whenever it was needed. The reception staff were happy to offer congratulations and seemed genuinely interested in making every part of our experience something to remember.  Lastly the room was perfect in every single way and overall has made this hotel my number one place to stay in the capital. Will hopefully come back as much as possible and would recommend this hotel to everyone. ,5,2016,04,30
128,Great stay!,"Booked an overnight stay for a leisure trip. We arrived much earlier than the stated booking in time and the room was ready - always a bonus! All the members of staff were friendly and efficient and there's a nice feel to the place. Our room was clean, the bed very comfortable and there were Elemis toiletries in the bathroom. We were pleasantly surprised to find at night that the bed had been turned down, chocolates were placed on the pillows and a bowl of fruit had been left for us. The hotel is well located and is only a short walk from Moorgate tube station.We had a great stay at this hotel and would definitely return.",5,2016,04,30
128,Beautiful Hotel & Great Hospitality ,"Stayed here on New Years Eve at a great price. The price was the going rate for any hotel on New Years Eve so was happy to pay. The welcome was very warm from all staff from the receptionists to the concierge. The room was very spacious and decorated very well! Didn't get to eat in the restaurant as I was in a bit of a rush but it looked great in there.

Would 100% stay again!!",5,2016,04,29
128,Trip back to the Montcalm chain,"Me and my parter planned to stay in London over the weekend normally we stay in the Montcalm a tech City however we decided to give one of the other montcalms a try, since arriving we were welcomed warmly however as we arrive before the normal check in time we had to wait which was absolutely fine.
When returning to the hotel to check in the check in was smooth and we were shown to our 'WOW suite' by the concierge who was extremely nice and friendly . I highly recommend to treat yourself to the wow suite in Montcalm at the a brewery as the room was extremely spacious, lovely four post bed and modern bathroom. Throughout our stay we were looked after by the front of house manager , nothing was too much trouble for him . My partner and I can honestly say our stay here was unlike any other, we can't wait to visit again!

",5,2016,04,28
128,Excellent location,"Very well located hotel with friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms are stylish and comfortable, each somewhat different.  Close to the Barbican for entertainment and transport links, handy for a good french restaurant, Cote, across the road.  My choice of hotel in central london.",4,2016,04,28
128,"Great place to stay in town, very quite and comfortable","Friendly, warm and attentive staff.

We stayed here for 1 night before i ran the London marathon. The hotel is ideally located near Moorgate  and Barbican tube  stations. Pub/restaurants nearby. Nice and quite area.

Staff very friendly and room had all the mod cons. The hotel has a great history and the theme and pictures reflect this to make it a very unique experience.

Our room was on the south side of the hotel and was a bit of a walk to reception .

Will stay here again if the price is right

.",5,2016,04,28
128,Special Trip to London !,"The Montcalm was a perfect location for us on our recent trip to London. Having booked the hotel direct with Montcalm, the communication was superb from the start - including excellent customer service from Gabriele - their Guest Experience Host - who looked after us superbly.
The room was excellent as were the hotel facilities and ambience. If we have one constructive comment this would be that the Club Lounge looks a bit tired and is not a particularly enticing area. It was cold and felt a bit like a Doctors waiting room with it's furniture - also not helped by the fact that there is a constant stream of traffic coming through as guests go to and from their rooms. This meant that the Club Lounge is hardly a place in which you want to relax and unwind.
But that's the only 'negative' - we would thoroughly recommend the Montcalm as a great location for any business or romantic trip to London !",5,2016,04,27
128,The Best Place To Stay In London,"I have just had another fantastic stay at the Montcalm Brewery  on Chiswell Street in London. 

This hotel and their staff continues to deliver an impeccable service in a tastefully decorate environment.

The Guest Experience Managers Alice and Grazia worked tirelessly to make my stay perfect. From the simple hand written card welcoming me back, to the chocolates and fresh fruit in the room, it all added to a wonderful stay. 

For visitors to London, the rooms come with a portable handset which can be taken out of the hotel. This handset is like an I phone and can make local and international calls as well as providing sightseeing and theatre information. This is a fantastic innovation that would be invaluable to any tourist or visitor staying at the hotel. 

Needless to say the rest of the rooms are great too. Very comfortable beds and powerful showers all in a contemporary appointed bedroom and ultra-stylish bathroom. 

For me, this hotel is the best in London and is always my first option. Most of my visits here are on business and I need the assurance that I will have a comfortable nights sleep, an invigorating shower and tasty breakfast. I have never been disappointed with any of my  stays at the Montcalm Brewery.",5,2016,04,27
128,Lovely stay x,My husband and I decided to have a night away during a week off work. I picked this hotel and was very glad I did. Very welcoming staff at reception and throughout the hotel. Our room was spacious and even though it was by the road the traffic noise was minimal and the bed was extremely comfy. Dinner in The Jugged Hare was delicious as was breakfast there the next morning. We may just have to go back and celebrate our wedding anniversary there in May x ,4,2016,04,26
128,Simply Amazing!,"Just returned from a one night stay.Great modern hotel conveniently situated in the business district. Rooms were spacious, clean and modern. We eat in the restaurant  and the food and service was first class.

The all  staff here were uniformly smart, polite and helpful specially Karolina with gorgeous smile and professional attitude BIG THANK YOU! 
Will definitely plan a return visit.",5,2016,04,26
128,Quiet and Accommodating,"We stayed at The Moncalm over a weekend in April. The staff were amazing, looked after and anticipated our needs. They remembered me from a previous visit too! If you want some peace after the hectic West End, this is your place. Excellent!",5,2016,04,26
128,Excellent position and elegant comfortable room,"Perfect location for a sightseeing or shopping weekend in London. The hotel is in the business area of Barbican, well served by the public transportation, really quiet in the weekend and not crowed by tourists. The staff is fantastic: really friendly and helpful. The room are very comfortable and elegant, recently refurbished. We were located at the first floor directly above the reception with the windows showing on Chisweel street. Not the best accommodation in my opinion, but we have had a good stay anyway. Only one little problem with the wardrobe which was really small and without any tray.",5,2016,04,26
128,Excellent Stay - Great Value,"First of all I have to commend this hotel on its excellent customer service, from start to finish the attention to detail was spot on! Extremely friendly members of staff, very helpful and would go the extra mile to ensure your stay was unforgettable. The room itself was quite small, however had all the amenities you needed plus more! Complimentary fruit, water and tea - a mini bar stocked with a great selection of reasonably priced drinks. And, something I absolutely love in a hotel, champagne and wine glasses in the room without having to request them! Perfect if you are bringing your own bubbly! Lovely Elemis products in the bathroom, an extremely comfy bed, gown and slippers. I would highly recommend this hotel for the price you cannot complain! Would be ideal for a short break away to the city with friends, or even for a romantic retreat. We shall definitely return!",5,2016,04,25
128,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for a night away after a show. Stunning hotel. Great location. Room was perfect. Very clean. 
We particularly liked the wall that went up between the bath and the bedroom. 
My only gripe would be the cost of the mini bar and films for the room. I've stayed in many hotels and know they are generally expensive but these were extortionate! 
Lovely breakfast included the following morning too ",5,2016,04,25
128,Excellent night's sleep and breakfast,"The Montcalm is close to the Barbican and is very accessible by public transport.  Prior to our arrival day, we had received several emails checking on our anticipated arrival time and any particular requests.  

The Montcalm prides itself on its service, with several uniformed doormen and lobby porters.  All of these are keen to welcome you, take your bags, usher you to reception, etc.  Personally, I found it rather over the top, but my wife loved their approach.  

Our room was spacious and well-appointed - the free mobile phone for the duration of your stay is an interesting development which I'm sure will be very useful for overseas visitors.

The bed was supremely comfortable and I slept very soundly; rare when I'm only in a hotel for one night.  This being the City, there is a lot of building work nearby and this commenced (noisily) at 8am sharp on Saturday morning.

Breakfast was in the adjacent Jugged Hare pub and took the form of an extensive buffet.  Everything was excellent, especially the scrambled eggs (and keeping these fresh and soft in a buffet is not easy!)

A very, very good hotel which is well worth considering.",5,2016,04,25
128,All that you need is here!,"A warm welcome greets you here. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room we had was very well equipped with everything we needed and more. There was a complimentary selection of fruit, water and chocolates waiting for us in the room. We didn't have the breakfast as it seemed to be only available in the room, and we hadn't got the time to sort out how much it was and where it was. Having read other reviews, we decided to eat it at Cote Brasserie over the road and had just what we wanted.
Everything was of a high quality, and we had a good night's sleep. We will be back!",5,2016,04,25
128,Classy Central London Hotel,"We stayed on a Saturday night in room 419 - lovely room, bright and airey. All mod cons included - large wall mounted tv, coffee machine, kettle, mobile phone(!) to use, huge bed. We had use of the club lounge which gave us free sandwiches, cake, crisps and snacks along with free wine, beer and spirits from 5.30pm to 7.30pm. Very popular as you can imagine so standing room only. We also had full english breakfast included at the nearby pub - make sure you order your eggs before you get the rest of your cooked breakfast. They were delicious.

All in all a hotel we will return to again when we visit London next - special mention to Vlad the doorman who was a delight and only too happy to help you.",5,2016,04,25
128,london  stay,"this is in a very good location. Easy by underground to where ever you want to go. The rooms are lovely and we were upgraded to a club double. The staff are very friendly and extremely polite and the breakfast is very good. Staff always attentive, we shall be returning",5,2016,04,25
128,EXCELLENT STAY AT THE MONTCALM AT THE BREWERY,"The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of London, conveniently close to restaurants, shops and theatres.  
The building is unique, the rooms are luxurious, the breakfasts delicious and the service is impeccable.",5,2016,04,25
128,"Lovely hotel, great location","We were visiting London for a weekend treat and I booked 2 nights at the Montcalm as part of an offer.

We received an exemplary welcome - our room wasn't ready but we were very early and when we returned our luggage was in our beautiful room and our porter was very helpful.

We had booked a club room, and we visited the club lounge for coffee and breakfast.

Couple of gripes - we visited the club lounge for drinks in the evening, but in arriving 15 minutes before the cut off point of 8, there were no drinks left (quite a few empty bottles of wine lying) and no one about to ask. So get there early!

Also, we were out and about and returned to our room at 4pm to shower and change for our evening out.  Our room hadn't been cleaned.  I called housekeeping and they sent a lady to our room - who told us she didn't speak English so couldn't help.  I went down to reception to be told that they cannot guarantee when the room will be be cleaned - they often turn rooms over up to 11pm at night!  I'm sure that won't suit many guests!!  Anyway we received some clean towels and they did return later in the evening while we were out to clean the room - but how odd!!

Neither situation spoiled our lovely weekend, but still, the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars.",4,2016,04,24
128,Simply the Best,"My daughter nieces and granddaughter took me here on Friday for our 2 day London trip. I cannot praise this hotel highly enough.
From the doorman to the Front of house manager Hiral Bhanushali. Excellent customer service, friendly staff, beautiful rooms and lovely surroundings. 
We were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble.
Thank you for making my stay so wonderful.",5,2016,04,24
128,Fantastic Hotel with outstanding customer service.....,Wow........what a fantastic overnight stay. The customer service is outstanding and nothing is too much trouble. Extremely comfortable beds and polite and helpful concierge. Will definitely return without a second thought. See you soon Montcalm at the Brewery.,5,2016,04,23
128,One of the best in London,"We celebrated my wife's birthday at the hotel, on arrival we were informed of a complimentary upgrade in room. The service was very good, and the porter helped show us all the things we needed in the room. The bed was super comfortable, and you get all the luxury and modern touches that you expect from a 5 star hotel. The architecture and decor is what really makes the hotel, if you like your history whilst also all the convenience of the modern world this is the place for you. My one complaint would be check in could have been shorter.",5,2016,04,23
128,"Nicely renovated, great location.","I stayed one night and had a pleasant stay. A great location next to the Barbican and nicely set in the historic former Whitbread Brewery. The room was maintained, decorated and cleaned to a high standard (but perhaps too many lightning options in the room...). The fruit and water was a nice touch. The bathroom was a decent size. Reception and concierge were helpful. I was able to leave my luggage for a few hours. All in all a fine stay.",4,2016,04,21
128,Hassle free Business stay,"I chose Montcalm Brewery since last year for my business trips and at every stay has been pleasant and satisfying. They offer value for money rates with excellent customer service. My most recent stay this week, I received personalised customer service from Ms Kritztina, a front office staff member. I have some minor issues with my online reservation. Ms Kritztina has extended her assistance to ensure that those issues are sorted for me when she checked me in. She has given me all the convenience that every business travelers would appreciate. Once again, an excellent hassle free stay with Montcalm Brewery! Thank you Kritztina!

Pleasantly satisfied customer - Ms Teng",5,2016,04,21
128,Superb hotel,"Must be one of the best hotels in London, as I see it and I have spent many nights at hotels in London during the last 30 years. A very friendly staff during our visit. The room (we had #318) was clean, everything worked and nice decorated. As a plus there is a gastro pub adjacent to the hotel, we actually walked through the pub to reach the elevator to our room",5,2016,04,21
128,Great London Hotel,"Fantastic location near the Barbican, friendly staff & beautiful interior. The only criticism was our room was quiet small and the bathroom was huge. We only stayed for one night and that seemed minor .Breakfast was very good and a good choice of hot or cold foods.We Would certainly use ThebMontcalm again.",5,2016,04,21
128,Comfiest bed you'll ever sleep in and great staff,Stayed here for 3 nights on business trip. Beautiful hotel door porters helpful staff. Best bed ever and lovely room. Please do not think there is a gymnasium though as its a very small sweaty room 3 machines and one didn't work but that aside well worth a stay. Breakfast lovely and staff couldn't have been better. Well done all just close the gym (loosely called gym) sauna wasn't switched on either and far too small.,5,2016,04,20
128,Customer experience,"I stayed two days in The Montcalm. I had arranged a taxi with the hotel-concierge  to collect me at the airport (Heathrow). However after arrival nobody was there due to circumstances. I was not informed and tried to get in charge with the hotel-concierge. I could not get him on the phone. After an hour I decided to book another taxi on the airport (total cost GBP: 105,=).  When I arrived in the hotel the concierge made excuses. They brought me two bottles of beer with a sorry-letter and they arranged and paid the taxi to go to the airport. What a good experience was this. 

Besides this, it is best class hotel with very kindly people, good rooms and beds.

Together with the congres-centre The Brewery, a lovely place to be.",5,2016,04,20
128,Fabulous hotel with 5* rooms,"The hotel really is beautiful and the room I have no hesitation in rating as 5*. I also received excellent service at reception throughout my stay. I felt pressured into accepting a porter showing me where my room was (even though it was only a 30m walk along the ground floor) though and that, along with a relatively pricey room rate are the reasons for my overall rating of very good.",4,2016,04,20
128,Bit of a let down...,"Stayed there on business on Monday evening.  Went to check in and they said I was actually at a different hotel in the chain.  No communication from them apart from confirming my stay at this hotel.  Took 20 minutes for them to sort out their issue.  Room required a map and two lifts to find.  Hotel very spread out and not easy to navigate.

Room itself was nicely furnished, however very dark (even with the lights fully on).  Air con very noisy.  Not sure why they bothered fitting windows as they were so small, let in no light and were very dirty on the outside.  To be honest, the darkness would probably be OK in Winter, but on a sunny London day having to have every light on and still not be able to read properly is a joke,

Final insult was checking out.  They do not advertise very clearly that VAT hasn't already been added onto the hotel rate they advertise online.  It is there in small priny, but I have never seen this done for a European hotel before.  Felt very fleeced.  They couldn't print out a copy of the bill on checkout (printer broke) so instead emailed me a copy which was a blank document.  I asked for another copy which hasn't been received - but they have enrolled me on their membership scheme without asking.",3,2016,04,20
128,Luxury at its best,"We've stayed here twice and loved it both times. This award winning heritage building is an outstanding example of how you can revitalise heritage buildings. Once a brewery it's now a gracious hotel. Offering the best in customer service, the best designed rooms one could wish for in the best possible location (right in the middle of London city). Great value for money.",5,2016,04,20
128,A wonderful welcome back,"I booked a return visit to the Montcalm for my partners birthday weekend. As usual we were welcomed by a lovely front of house team who made us feel extremely special. We were upgraded to a Montcalm club room and had access to the lounge with complimentary drinks in the evening. The room was very elegant with the usual Montcalm touches and some chocolates in the room as a treat. We also took advantage of the hotel room service for a relaxed breakfast in bed which was delicious. I will definitely return to Montcalm, they certainly know how to look after their guests. Montcalm team, you really live up to your 5 star rating. Well done and thanks again for a wonderful stay",5,2016,04,19
128,"A wonderful romantic hotel with friendly, welcoming staff.","My partner and I visited the Montcalm for a midweek stay and had the most wonderful experience.  This place is luxury through and through with the friendliest hotel staff we have ever experienced.  We arrived to rose petals, truffles and a bottle of chianti - such a lovely romantic touch, and the room ( a WOW suite!) was just gorgeous!  The breakfast in the morning was also excellent.  We couldn't have asked for anything better and we can't wait to visit again soon.  Thank you so much for a perfect stay and in particular thank you to the general manager Simona, the host, Alice and the doorman Vlad for being so welcoming and making us feel so special.",5,2016,04,19
128,Far from luxurious,"What do you value most in a hotel: a glitzy lobby or a good night's sleep?

That was the question I found myself pondering as I tried to fall asleep in the Montcalm London Brewery. In case you're wondering, it has a glitzy lobby.

The décor is great and the service is friendly, although not especially efficient. My room was rather small and included a shower in the cramped bathroom, but no bath. The room was at the standard of a good 4* hotel... but this is meant to be 5* luxury is it not?

I was relieved to get a room without a street view, since I thought it would be quieter. However, I was awoken at 3am (and I'm a heavy sleeper) by the sound of storage trolleys being rattled across the courtyard cobbles outside. This persisted until c. 5am.

I could also hear the conversation and/or snoring coming from the adjoining room. I say adjoining and not adjacent because we were separated by a door, not a wall. Clearly this was part of a larger suite being used as a single room and the sound-proofing was what you'd expect from that set-up.

Bottom line: I was travelling for business and had around 2 hrs sleep in my night at the Montcalm. Needless to say, I would not stay here again. I have tried other 3* hotels in the local area (e.g. Citadines Barbican) and would go back to one of those before returning to the Montcalm. The décor there is far inferior, but you'll get a good night's rest.",2,2016,04,19
128,Just Perfect,"Rose petals, chocolate truffles and Chianti were all wonderful touches provided by The Montcalm at The Brewery which made our stay so very special. My husband and I are celebrating a ""big"" birthday plus our 25th wedding anniversary all in the same week. We arrived at The Montcalm to be pleasantly surprised to find that our room was available some 3 hours before our expected check in time. I can certainly recommend the Montcalm Club rooms which are very spacious, modern deco, immaculately clean with everything you need (even an umbrella). The staff are amazing, everyone taking time to say hello and making us feel so very welcome. Breakfast in The Jugged Hare was absolutely delicious with an amazing choice.
This beautiful hotel is one not to miss, first class service at a very reasonable price. We would like to say a massive thank you to Alice and everyone at The Montcalm for making our stay such a memorable one - it was fabulous! Xx",5,2016,04,18
128,Cruise Liner Accomadation,"Spent a night here Sat 16/04/16 on a 'Show - hotel and ticket' deal and they obviously allocate rooms on this basis. We travelled with another couple and were given rooms that required 2 elevator rides and Bear Gryls to guide you through the maze of corridors and 2 flights of stairs(as well as the lifts) to get to the adjoining rooms we had.
The rooms were tiny and akin to cruise cabins. About 15 inches between either side of the bed and the wall. Generally the room was 'tired' with a large split in the 'desk chair'. (See Photo). Bed was comfortable (for one) but simply too small for two adults. No windows to open which made it claustrophobic, no natural light at all and most worryingly no information inside the room to explain the evacuation procedures in the event of fire. (Bit like steerage on the Titanic- you were not going to make it.)
The hotel staff were at pains to 'bull up' the full English breakfast which they describe more as a brunch and not to be missed. Oh dear! We were shown to a seat and directed to the buffet. Sorry but in a five star hotel there should be no buffet. The hot food selection was unimpressive . The sausages were ok but the bacon , please will someone tell these hotels that this is ENGLAND and what they serve as bacon is not what is considered bacon in the home of the English breakfast. You know what I mean - scrag ends that I would not give to a dog. You can cook it or glaze it any way you like but it will still be scrag ends.
On returning from the buffet the staff had cleared our table of our fruit juice and tea. (fair enough with the tea because that was luke warm at best. Tea is supposed to be HOT.
So the table was re set but there was little they could do about the ripped upholstery. (See photo - 5 * NOT)
The staff (that could speak English) were friendly enough.
So beware being fobbed off with a cruise cabin, let the fire brigade know which room you are in, take a needle and thread for repairs, your own bacon and kettle and you'll be fine.",3,2016,04,18
128,Birthday weekend,"Stayed here for my birthday in February. Slight issue with the online booking, so i had to phone them to confirm our booking. My Boyfriend told me he left a note about it being my birthday when booking, hoping he could arrange something in the room - that didn't happen. 

Stayed in the Montcalm Club room, which included breakfast, got room service which was great first day. On the second day they messed up our order, and when they brought the correct thing the eggs where very underdone, obviously because they rushed to correct it. 

The room its self was nice and clean. Coffee and tea always kept stocked up. The staff where helpful and friendly every time we spoke to them, and answered everything we asked. 

Bathroom was nice and the shower was good. The toiletries supplied smelled lovely.

The location is good, short walk to the tube stations or not too far to take a taxi to where we wanted to be.

Overall, i would stay here again, and hopefully without the few small hic-ups.",4,2016,04,18
128,Very amazing place,"The best place I have stayed in London.
Excellent value for money and the staff are amazing.
The bed is very comfortable, the pillows are amazing and I like the touch with the room smelling to how you want it.

The only I guess negative, is the movies were quite expensive.",5,2016,04,18
128,Outsatnding Hotel,"The hotel was value for money for the club room, the breakfast in the jugged hare was the best that I have had on both service and quality. We booked an evening dinner as well and again it went the extra mile.

All staff in the hotel, attentive and extremely helpful, the room and especially the bed was again far more luxurious than anticipated.

Found the mobile travel mate excellent, well done to you all and we look forward to our next stay for making the weekend exceptional.",5,2016,04,17
128,Cosy and agreable,"I love the interior design. It's both traditional in terms of English heritage and modern. I stayed for one night and the service was very good. The staff at the check in counter gave me a complimentary newspaper the next moring (on my door). 
The doorman told me to have my credit card ready but I only used the televison and the wifi. Both worked in a splendid way. My stay was paid for by the organizer of an event at the next dood Conference center. I couldn't spoil myself any more than visiting this hotel.",5,2016,04,16
128,Great,"I have stayed at The Montcalm on several occasions and recommended the hotel to few of my business partners. 
Recently, I have stayed  with my partner. Unfortunately, the room we were given were very close to the entrance (No 001). Because it was meant to be a special celebratory  night ( we also booked informal dinner at Jugged Hare). We went back to the reception to request the change of the room. I We both were pleasantly surprised. 
Not only Karolina was super lovely and understanding about our needs but she also gave us a beautiful room in a quiet wing. I could not be more pleased about hospitality, kindness and service we have received.

Even during check out we were treated with upmost respect and attentiveness and Simona shared her details with my partner for our future bookings. We will back again!",5,2016,04,15
128,"A wonderful return visit, the Montcalm at the Brewery once again exceeded our expectations...","We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery last year and it was truly memorable... having a 'last minute' opportunity to visit London this Easter we booked without question and once again our expectations were exceeded!

Upon arriving early the friendly concierge appeared delighted to tell us that we had received an upgrade to one of the Club Rooms. Our room was clean, spacious and well equipped with a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates - quite a treat! The room was located centrally on the 3rd floor (near the main stairs and lifts to reception) and I'm happy to report that we were not bothered by any noise at all during our stay. 

Before going out for the evening we popped into the Club Lounge, I asked one of the hostesses if they offered any gluten free alternative breads at breakfast and she assured me some would be available. The next morning we were greeted by the same hostess who had a plate of bread in hand ready and waiting for me... a wonderful personal service. 

I highly recommend the Montcalm at the Brewery, for the wonderful comfortable  facilities, the beautiful buildings, its great location (being just a short walk from London Liverpool St, Moorgate and the Barbican tubes) and more importantly the friendly and attentive staff who did all they could to make our stay special.",5,2016,04,14
128,Quiet and Friendly,Although the rooms were slightly small they had everything you would need including a free mobile phone for our stay. They were clean and very comfortable and the staff were friendly. The hotel is a bit of a maze but we didn't find that to be too much of an issue. Our only downside was a group of noisy guests in the middle of the night which were heard easily by the rooms around them. ,4,2016,04,12
128,WOW,"We arrived on the Friday early and didn't expect to get a room only wanted to leave the luggage and come back later. The receptionist asked if it was a special occasion as staying at the hotel was a gift from a family member. This is where the service started a room was offered right away  our luggage was taken and put in the room always a good sign rather than trying to manage by yourself, excellent. We did have a minor problem with the flush in the bathroom.I was upgraded to a WOW Suite,cake and Champange were delivered to the room. My stay was wonderful. Breakfast and Dinner in The Jugged Hare were very good. Gabriele and Alice were both very professional  as were all the staff we encountered. It does take a bit of time getting your bearings as there are so many areas in the hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel it is such an interesting building.",5,2016,04,12
128,Excellent Hotel...totally 5 *,"We chose this Hotel because of its location and boy are we glad we did. We were celebrating both our special Birthdays and our 42nd Wedding Anniversary and wow the Hotel made us feel so special. Our room was beautifully decorated with complimentary champagne and cake. We chose the Montcalm club room, which i would definitely recommend. The club lounge provided everything we needed for a first class stay. The staff were very courteous and knowledgeable. The building itself is amazing and very historical. Only a 15 walk to spitalfields area if that is of interest, but i would recommend. we so look forward to our next visit to the Montcalm City Brewery and would like to take the opportunity to send our grateful thanks to all the staff and management...your staff training clearly works!!",5,2016,04,12
128,Excellent Stay,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night in April (a surprise gifted by my son and daughter-in-law for my birthday).  The staff were friendly and attentive and we wanted for nothing, even returning to our room in the afternoon to find a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate truffles with birthday wishes from the establishment.  We were both very impressed with this hotel and will be returning later in the year to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We would like to extend special thanks to Alice.",5,2016,04,12
128,Excellent hotel and experience.,"We stayed here for a special birthday celebration and had a really memorable time. The hotel is full of character and very beautiful. Our room was of high standard as were all the facilities. Staff are very charming and helpful. You would be hard pressed to find anything to fault at The Montcalm and if you did the hotel responds in a suitable 5 star manner. Our room had a broken blind and as we left to go to The Barbican, we mentioned it to the front desk. On our return, we found we had been upgraded to a superior room, had a complimentary bottle of wine delivered as well as a invite for complimentary drinks in the lounge which is excellent customer service.",5,2016,04,11
128,Inner city gem!,"Ask most people about the cost of accommodation in the city of London and watch them politely break into a nervous sweat. No mean feat on a 3 degree day. 

With the London Coffee Festival coming up, and fancying a weekend city stay, my wife chanced her arm at this challenge, booking us a twin room at The Montcalm at Brewery.

The building itself is nestled in a quiet part of the CBD and attractively presented, with rustic but well-maintained charm on the outside, and a grand foyer where you are warmly greeted on on arrival. Staff are sharply dressed, engaging and friendly.

Our room, 'over the bridge' and maze-like in location through a series of steps, halls and lifts, was located in the south wing of what is actually a deceptively large property. 

The bedding was comfortable and clean, albeit perched high enough to give one altitude sickness but comfortable nonetheless.

Bathroom was well appointed with a medium sized bathtub and rain shower with heated towel racks.

The room was well sized but confusingly lit and a little bit stuffy as minimal natural light or ventilation (reverse cycle AC fitted though) was available. Complimentary fresh fruit and bottled water in room refreshments and mini bar on hand.

Wi-Fi was free, worked and was easy to piggyback onto the network. 

Hairdryer available for anyone wondering whether they need to pack one.

Walked away with change from £300 for a two night stay.

Loved 
- Location (nearby Old Spitalfields Market on a Sunday)
- Fit out, friendly staff and 24 hour room service
- Good wi-fi

Loathed
- More natural light and fresh air needed
- Complicated floorplan 
- Phone for room service by the bed didn't work!",4,2016,04,11
128,The touches that make it 5 star,"Having worked in hotels before I do find myself in search of the little details, and this place had them all.

check in was lovely especially as i was fortunate to get a room upgrade. the room was spacious as well as the bathroom. there was fresh fruit and bottled water complimentary as well as a lovely array for tea and coffee. in the wardrobe were carefully folded bathrobes and slippers and an umbrella which i have to say was most handy on a miserable Saturday morning. when we arrived back at 5pm the room had already been turned down with nice lighting, curtains drawn and bed pillow chocolates. The decor in the rest of the hotel was modern meets sheek with brickwork and artwork on the walls, giving it a luxury boutique feel. Also having free wifi was a nice touch and they even have a phone in room where they recommend places to eat if you are not local to the area. 

My only small comments are the hermes toiletries were perhaps a bit too masculine so would recommend taking your own. There is also no great view, but for an over night stay, or for business i would fully recommend this hotel and if in the area would happily stay again.",5,2016,04,11
128,Superb stay!,"Fantastic staff, impeccable service, and extremely comfortable and - by London standards - spacious Club room in the South Wing. Breakfast was good.....once we'd managed to find our way there! Definitely recommendable and we would return without hesitation.....",5,2016,04,09
128,"Good location, great service, very comfortable","We spent one night here, whilst I spent a few days showing family from abroad around London. Consequently we spent little time actually in the hotel other than sleeping at night, so I cannot comment on ameneties etc. From the welcome at the door to check in & eventually check-out, the customer service was exemplary. (I even left my mobile phone charger behind - it was posted to me within 4 days!)
The rooms were very comfortable and clean with free wi-fi. 
London is a big city, so location is very much a personal thing. Moorgate tube station is barely a 5 minute walk away which was very convenient. Although the area is busy in the day, the evening (Friday night) was much quieter with less people and far less traffic. This makes for a quieter night, yet location is still quite central. Overall this was ideal for our purposes. It is easy to get to the various tourist sites in London from this hotel. St Paul's cathedral can be reached in a 15 minute walk. 
Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,09
128,Best hotel ,"I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel while visiting London for business.  The accommodations are beautiful, very clean and comfortable.  Room service is prompt and the food is delicious.  The manager Hiral is courteous and very concerned about his guests always making sure everything is to their liking. I will use this hotel as my base when in London. ",5,2016,04,08
128,Valentines Weekend,"An unusual but stunning hotel! Reception decor and lighting really sets the tone for the hotel. Check in was fast and easy we had a room on the first floor located near the stairs the room was brilliant with tall ceilings and the bathroom was big and spacious with Hermes toiletries! I was however let down with the view of a brick wall, not quite sure what I was expecting with it being an old brewery but I didn't quite expect to be greeted by a brick wall!

Probably not the best hotel to book on a weekend with a lot of cafes, bars and restaurants closed due to it being the weekend, the area was very quiet and eerie during the evening and the closest tube was also closed due to maintenance having to walk an extra 5 minutes to moor gate.

I would definitely book another montcalm hotel maybe shoreditch in the future just not this particularly one",5,2016,04,08
128,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights during a trip to London. Everything from the door service through reception to room service was excellent. Very well appointed rooms and again the staff were fabulous. Close to tube and shopping.
Excellent bar, not stuffy at all, it was like a proper bar to go and enjoy a beer in. Even better was the superb restaurant on site, The Jugged Hare, absolutely loved it and ate there twice.",5,2016,04,08
128,Birthday weekend ,"We stayed here whilst spending a weekend in London. Firstly a very nice touch, a couple of days before our stay a member of the Montcalm called me to enquire about our stay and if any special occasion was being celebrated,as it was my wife's birthday they upgraded us to a larger room and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates which we thought was a lovely gesture. The room was immaculate and very nice and roomy. We had a great weekend and the staff were very attentive and friendly and made us feel very welcome. I unfortunately mislaid my phone and had to go and collect as luckily someone found and kindly returned to me but whilst I trecked around London the staff at the Montcalm when out of their way to make the wait for my wife as pleasant as possible, so thanks again to all their for a memorable stay. ",5,2016,04,07
128,Great Location Excellent Service,"Great location at the top of Park Lane and close to Oxford Street but without any of the hustle and bustle - very quiet. Staff were efficient and very friendly. Room very comfortable with every possible amenity although this does mean it can appear quite cluttered as the rooms are quite small. The dressing table is full of ""stuff"" before you put anything of your own on it.  WiFi quick and free also a selection of pillows and an iPad. ""Magic"" glass between bathroom and bedroom is amazing - gives an illusion of space. Quite honestly it took me a while to figure it out - a button in the bathroom turns the glass from clear to opaque instantaneously!  Bit pricey but you get what you pay for. ",5,2016,04,07
128,Lovely Hotel,"A very high standard hotel, everything about the stay was excellent. Staff welcoming and helpful, rooms immaculate. Attention to detail great and we couldn't fault the hotel in any way. A very lovely building and a great place to stay if you want to be spoiled. ",5,2016,04,06
128,Birthday  surprise,Everything about my weekend was perfect every member of your team were very pleasant helpful my room with my balloons  and petals made into a fifty And card from Gabriel  was awesome I can't wait to come back and stay again Vlad stood out as he remembered our names and was very charming thank you,5,2016,04,05
128,We will return!,"We have just returned from a weekend in London staying two nights at the Montcalm at the Brewery. The hotel is in a really good location for exploring this side of London on foot, and is located very near to two tube stations. We were delighted with the reception on arrival. The gentleman greeting us on the door on arrival, the receptionist, and the gentleman who showed us to our room were all very welcoming, polite and friendly. We loved our room which was very well appointed (lovely Elemis products, robes and slippers, hairdryer and even an umbrella!) as for the bed - wow! Super comfy! We didn't opt to include breakfast as we planned to be out early, but we did enjoy late evening drinks in the Jugged Hare. We had a minor problem with the servicing of the room which was entirely our fault, but we were treated to wine and macaroons whilst the issue was resolved. A really nice gesture and much appreciated. An example of the effort to take that extra step which was evident at this Hotel. We loved this hotel and will definitely return in the near future.",5,2016,04,05
128,Visit to my sons new shop in the CITY.*,Totally SUPERB stay (3 nights) great service wonderful staff ( so many).Breakfast fabulous  JUGGED HARE V good food Will certainly stay here again our club room was very nice well appointed with wine fruit on arrival a very nice touch on the first evening was a pair of swans and rose petals left on our HUGE bed along with chocolates i will most certainly pass on my delight with the MONTCALM to all of my friends incidentally my wife left something behind i called GUEST SEVICES it's on it's way as we speak that's SERVICE☆  HIGHLY RECOMENDED ☆  EXCELLENT VALUE*.D.,5,2016,04,05
128,Amazing Hotel,The Montcalm at the Brewery is an amazing hotel with great professional staff.  I stayed there over a weekend whilst doing a course nearby.  The hotel is of a very high standard and the staff are warm and welcoming.  Looking forward to my next stay!,5,2016,04,05
128,Fantastic hotel with great staff,"Just spent the weekend with my girlfriend at this wonderful hotel.

The reception gives a great first impression, we had a warm welcome and all staff were genuine and keen to ensure we had a great stay.

The room was amazing, great facilities with complimentary bottled water and fruit. You can even choose the type of pillow and room fragrance which is a nice touch.

As we were celebrating our anniversary, there were some much appreciated extra touches.

The layout of the hotel can be a little confusing especially after a drink or two, but even that adds to the experience.

If you want to treat a partner (or yourself) this hotel is perfect, it's midweek prices would be out of my price range, but at the weekend the rooms are surprisingly affordable and excellent value. And being just a few minutes walk to Moorgate station  it is in s great location

I honestly couldn't fault it and will definitely be returning ",5,2016,04,04
128,Luxury Home from Home!,"I stayed here overnight on a work trip, but wish I could have stayed for longer! By the time I checked out, I felt as though I'd been on holiday!! The hotel staff and service was outstanding, friendly and helpful. The hotel was stunning and I loved the quirky layout. Everywhere was clean and to an exceptional high standard, definitely value for money. The rooms were spacious, and the beds were so comfy, I had a great nights sleep. Will definitely be returning, and can highly recommend. Overall a fantastic stay and experience!",5,2016,04,04
128,Fabulous Stay,"My Partner and I have Stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City on many occasions as well as their Marble Arch hotel.  The City Montcalm is our personal favourite. Unfortunately on our previous visit we had a few problems, but this did not deter us from returning to the hotel.  On arrival at the hotel  I checked in and the details of our previous stay were on our file. I was greeted by Hiral who apologised for the problems we had on our previous visit.  I was very pleased to be informed that we had been upgraded to the Wow Suite and had access to the Club Lounge.  We had chocolates and wine in our room on arrival.  I was taken personally by Hiral to our room, he could not have been more attentive.  The rooms are spotless and the beds extremely comfortable.  We enjoyed using the Club Lounge as this is a quiet relaxing area, a real asset to the hotel.  Breakfast was well organised and provided a great variety of choice as always.  We were in London to enjoy a celebration and the service at the hotel helped to make our stay fabulous. Hiral and his team are efficient, helpful, welcoming and extremely professional with a personal touch. This is a beautiful  hotel in a fantastic location. My partner and I will be returning in the next couple of weeks. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,04
128,A fantastic London stay,"Stayed a the Montcalm a few weeks ago and couldn't fault it.

From the on-site restaurant, the staff to the fabulous rooms every aspect felt 5-star and definitely felt like good value for what you pay.

Would recommend to anyone staying in London.",5,2016,04,04
128,Try the club formula,"Centrally located in The City of London, modern yet charming. Friendly staff. Try the club formula. Breakfast, drinks and snacks à volonté. Worth every penny. 

The bathroom can be turned in a romantic hotspot.",5,2016,04,04
128,Not quite 5*,"Check in very convoluted and certainly not paper light! Three signatures on different documents required despite payment having been made at booking. Shown to room in building across the road not even attached to the hotel so actually only saw reception area! Very polite staff member showed us to our room only to take us back to reception for an upgrade. Eventually shown our room which was very stylish, quite a small double bed for 5* accommodation but was extremely comfortable. Shower and bathroom facilities very good, heated floor a nice touch. Not quite 5*, cracked tiles in bathroom, torn seat at desk. Concierge in annex very helpful with restaurant recommendations and directions. Location good 10min walk to tube",4,2016,04,03
128,Ideal location,"The staff were very friendly and attentive, and gave us a lovely welcome. The hotel is in a great location being only a 5 minute walk from Barbican tube station. The hotel is nicely furnished, the rooms are very clean and bed was very comfy.",5,2016,04,03
128,Perfect guest experience,"There is lots to say about this hotel but I would like to make it brief!
Special...

Why because the staff from when you walk in to the Montcalm are fantastic!

Why because from check-in till you leave they addressed you by name ( how they remembered each time was a revelation)

Why because the room's are lovely, comfortable, spacious and very well equipped with everything you need!

Why because it is!

I loved it here!",5,2016,04,03
128,Amazing stay at The Montcalm,"As regular visitors to London, my wife and I sometimes stay overnight and we have stayed at the Montcalm on a few occasions. I felt compelled to write a review based on a slight mishap upon check in and the way it was dealt with by the staff. I usually book through a travel website but found that the Montcalm have an app so decided to use that. Upon arrival I was informed that we had booked the day room, however on my confirmation it stated that it was in fact an overnight stay. The lovely check in assistant, Valentina, assured us not to worry and that it will be sorted. The front of house manager, Hiral, explained that this was maybe the fault of the booking process and apologised for the inconvenience this may have caused. He then informed us that he was upgrading us to the WoW suite and offered anything he could do to make our stay a pleasant one. I can't thank them enough for their kind gesture as the room was amazing as they all are at the Montcalm, however this was very special indeed. When we returned to our room later that evening a handwritten note along with a complimentary bottle of red wine awaited us and we were simply overwhelmed by the professionalism and kindness with how they dealt with our small issue. Hiral and Valentina, thank you both once again for making our stay so very special.",5,2016,04,03
128,"Great Service, very nice place!","We had a very pleasant nights stay here. The room was quite small but we got a very good rate on booking.com. We had everything we needed for a comfortable night and I loved the little touches, like a hair scrunchie with the shower cap and Elemis toiletries.  Obviously very well run as service was excellent with staff welcoming and friendly and nothing too much trouble For them. Well done to all the front of house staff who made us feel special and the place was spotless. ",5,2016,04,02
128,Fabulous hotel,Can't praise this establishment high enough. We have just returned from a 2 night stay and the whole experience was superb. Friendly hospitable staff and great location. The room was lovely and clean with fresh fruit provided and good quality toiletries . Great value hotel lots of smiley faces to greet us on arrival. Stayed in many London hotels and not experienced such great personal service. We will definitely return on our next visit. ,5,2016,04,02
128,Nice stay but not amazing ,"We booked here as we wanted something a little special, paid for a Montcalm club room and to be honest not really sure what the difference from a normal club room was? This type of room supposedly allowed us access to the club lounge, yet this wasn't mentioned on arrival and we weren't told where it was or any other information. The room also stated it offered a 'complimentary mini bar' but again, I'm not sure how this differed from other rooms as all rooms have mini bars in and there was nothing complimentary about it, there wasn't even water in the room on arrival. We also found it a bit odd that there were 2 pairs of slippers but only one bathrobe.
That said, the room and bathroom are a good size and the bed is amazing - good size and really comfortable. Staff are nothing but polite and friendly and the location is good - not too busy and only a short walk away from at least 2 tube stations. 
Overall, a pleasant stay but don't go expecting the wow factor.",4,2016,04,02
128,Good value and location. ,We stayed for one night as we were attending an awards ceremony at The Brewery. The hotel was very good value possibly as this part or London is quieter at weekends. The hotel was well appointed but lacked internal character from the former brewery. The glass wall from the bathroom to the bedroom was weird. ,4,2016,03,31
128,Great for some....but lacking for others,"
Spent a weekend with friends and found the service, comfort and location all very good. The ""lacking"" part was the lack of a lounge bar. We did use, for both a drink and a meal, the attached ""Jugged Hare"" which was very nice as a pub but not somewhere to sit with family or friends at the end of a busy day. It is a pub and not, in my opinion, a lounge facility suitable for families.
",4,2016,03,31
128,Very high quality customer service and environment,"The hotel is amazing, the standards are exceptional.

The only fault I could have is that it is advertised as having a spa... it is down in a basement across in a different building and is a very small sauna and steam room, which you have to request is turned on 30 mins before you want to use it! it really isn't worth the effort, just stay in the hotel and enjoy!",5,2016,03,31
128,Great value for London,"A room in London for £100 that's as close to 5 star with out all the bells and whistles is incredible value.

This is my second trip there and it's perfect if you are arriving into Liverpool Street station.

The staff are friendly and helpful.

It's also close to the City and not miles from the West End.

Rooms are small but comfortable and well appointed.

We will stay there again!",4,2016,03,31
128,Excellent stay!,"My huisband and I spent our Easter holidays in London and stayed at the Montcalm. This is a great hotel, great service and very nice staff. The place is immaculate, the breakfast in the pub is lovely and the Club Lounge is really nice. The hotel is only a 10 minutes walk to Moorgate or Liverpool St. tube stations. The only negative for us was the bed (a bit too small for a club room and definitively too soft), but other than this no complaints at all.",5,2016,03,30
128,"Excellent Service, Spacious Rooms","Stayed here for Easter Weekend 2016 and have to say the service was fantastic, everything one would expect of a classy London hotel. It's situated just under 10 minutes walk from the nearest tube stations. We had a standard double room which was nice and big for a London hotel, the only small negatives were a very dark bedroom even with all the lights on and an inexplicably tiny wash basin in the huge and spacious bathroom!",4,2016,03,29
128,It's a pleasure to work with you,"Very helpful and friendly staff!
Many thanks to Dorina Galatanu (Guest Services) for all the cooperation!
She is nice and real professional, with hers brilliant work she assisted promptly with any request we had!
It's a pleasure to work with you!",5,2016,03,29
128,Always outstanding,"This was our third visit to the Montcalm and it is the best hotel. What makes The Montcalm at The Brewery unique, apart from amazing rooms, is the staff and their attention to detail. They are so lovely. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. We will be returning soon. Thank you so much for a perfect 2 nights. ",5,2016,03,28
128,Again and again and again,"Well it's been a while but...here is my next review.

As my home away from home, in fact I probably spend more time here than I do at my house, this place just continues to excel!

Firstly huge respect to Simona and Alice, if you need anything I mean anything then these two are the best, they make you feel so welcome, nothing is ever a problem, these two are my go to in the hotel, big high five ladies.

The girls in the club lounge are excellent, all guests are treated with the same exemplary level of service, as a returning guest however everything that you know and like in the lounge is anticipated, high five girls.  

The hotel also likes to see staff progress and develop, Vikki who used to be in the lounge is now training on the front desk, hesitant at first she has now found her stride, well done Vikki and well done Montcalm for developing your staff.

As for the rooms, well none will disappoint, each has its own quirkiness but delivered in the Montcalm style, great standard guys well done.

Food is exceptional, room service great, Jugged Hare is awesome and uber cool for dinner and breakfast.  Room service team also deserve some kudos for the service they deliver as well.

As for pictures....this is a wow suite

Well done team, see you soon",5,2016,03,28
128,Could Have Been Better,"We booked well in advance and notified them of a special birthday celebration and we found first impressions when we arrived were brilliant. 

The concierge took our bags up and showed us to a lovely room, I feel possibly we were upgraded but they didn't confirm this. They had laid out the champagne I had pre-ordered and also provided a slice of chocolate birthday cake which was a nice touch.

However we just felt that this wasn't quite a 5 star experience, despite the best efforts of the staff in the hotel reception. A few things went wrong and in all fairness, they were sorted out promptly and with apology. 

However, I wouldn't stay here again. ",3,2016,03,28
128,"Trendy, good size rooms","I had a very comfortable and spacious first floor room overlooking interior courtyard for a 2 night stay. Reasonably quiet although a gentle ambient buzz of machine outside, possibly main A/C, overnight. Very comfortable bed, large well appointed ensuite bathroom, desk and accessible power points. While wardrobe hanging space OK, a lack of clothes drawers inconvenient. Good free wifi. Location would suit business traveller working in City of London. For tourists, Barbican and Moorgate tube stations a 5 minute walk.",4,2016,03,28
128,Great stay - excellent choice for a London trip.,Hotel service and room were excellent. Breakfast could have been improved with more variety but the club lounge was a lovely environment for breakfast. Would certainly recommend the hotel and stay again. Superb food in the Jagged Hare but booking ahead would be a good idea as it was very popular.,5,2016,03,27
128,Have totally warmed to this place,"Have stayed here 3 times recently on business.  I did not like it initially because the rooms are spread out over several buildings meaning the layout is quite confusing and there is no real heart to the hotel in terms of a lobby area beyond where check-in is.  However I came back because the location is just so good and it has now become one of my preferred places to stay.  

On each occasional the rooms have been excellent.  Nicely decorated and with excellent beds.  Bathrooms are ok but not much wow factor.  Beds very very comfortable though!

I also find the staff really welcoming and engaging with none of the plastic manner you sometimes get in London hotels.

There are two dining options-the dining rooms and the less formal pub.  Both can be very busy with non-residents especially in the evening.  Aside from that I found the food and service to be very good in both.  Breakfast served in the pub is pretty good but get it in your rate or prepay the night before for better value.

Overall recommended.

",5,2016,03,26
128,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for two nights. I cannot fault the hotel, super helpful staff and the deluxe room was superb with plenty of space for the 2 of us with our luggage and room to move around. Lovely big bathroom and the room was amazing. Would definitely stay here again if in London again.",5,2016,03,26
128,A genuine home from home,"I'm a weekly visitor to London and have tried many hotels down the years. The Montcalm at The Brewery has become the only choice. Great staff, always attentive and help with all the personal touches you don't normally get from hotels. I'll keep coming back!",5,2016,03,26
128,Course in City of London,"So had a course to attend so booked in here, never stayed here before and was not sure of where to go, as work had booked the city suites but was reliably informed it was on the other side of the road in the brewery part. Everything about this hotel from the minute we walked in to when I eventually left some four days later was first class. The rooms are really smart with lots of quirky touches. One small issue is our room was a little on the dark side but it was not enough to spoil anything. My wife came with me for the Sunday and Monday and she loved it too. We will be back to try it out again.",5,2016,03,26
128,Lovely quiet hotel,"We stayed at the Montcalm at Brewery for 2 nights for a leisure break with some friends. 

We booked a Club double room. On arrival in the room my first thoughts were how dark the room was. The decor and bathroom was lovely. I went immediately to throw open the curtains to let in some natural light but we had another building straight outside our window, so no view or natural light available. A shame really. 
Lack of lighting is my only picky fault about the room. As with many London hotels I've stayed in, there is not enough light at the dressing table mirror which is where us ladies like to sit to do our hair and make up. The only lighting available for this was a touch lamp that gave out very little light. I understand there are two mirrors in the bathroom, however this is not always convenient to use when your partner is showering as the bathroom is quite small. 

The bed was very comfortable but with a 6foot2 husband a double was way too small and he was hanging off the end of the bed most of the night. This is no fault of the hotel, we chose our room, but just be warned if you're tall, book a room with a bigger bed! 

The coffee machine in the room made the most divine coffee. 

The hotel and corridors were very quiet. 

I do agree that the hotel is very much a rabbit warren. We managed to get lost a good 2 or 3 times during our 3 day stay but the staff were. Wet helpful and always willing to point us in the right direction. 

We made use of the complimentary drinks and snacks on our first night. This is a lovely perk of staying in a club room. 

Our room rate included a full breakfast which is taken in the Jugged Hare. This is a buffet style breakfast with a wide range of choice. The food was of high quality and always plentiful. 

Overall, the hotel was really lovely but please management, sort the lighting out in the rooms. No one wants to get ready in the dark.

128,Birthday Weekend Treat,"Stayed at the Montcalm with my partner as a birthday treat to myself.
From start to finish they entire experience was amazing .The service was very good and they were very accommodating to my needs .
They left me a nice birthday treat .The Pillow from the pillow menu was very comfortable and a nice touch.The room was clean and very comfortable beds . If your looking for 5 star treatment at reasonable price book here.
The turn down service was also a nice touch definitely recommend a booking to this hotel",5,2016,03,25
128,Stunning,"I absolutely love this place and is my preferred hotel when I travel to London. 
From the minute you check in to the minute you checkout the service is outstanding. A lot of hotels need to go here in London to see how it is done. Keep up the great work and thanks for the great stay.  Beds are to so comfy and great decor of the rooms makes your stay even better on top of the great service.",5,2016,03,25
128,Classy and comfortable,"Just stayed one night.  Room very well equipped and lovely comfortable bed.  Good rainfall shower too.
Despite being very central and my room road facing, I didn't find it noisy with the window open.
Service very pleasant.
Mini bar pricing fair except the water which, although supporting a very worthy cause, was much too expensive.
A very nice stay and hotel us obviously very handy if you are attending an event at The Brewery next door.",4,2016,03,24
128,Very easy & convenient,"Nice room although it was a long walk from the lift with steps in between. 
The reception was heaving every time we walked through which just became irritating if you are wanting to get something sorted. 
Staff were nice and friendly. 
Shame there isn't a better foyer to have a drink or cup of tea or even to wait for other guests. Shame you have to leave the hotel and go to a pub.",4,2016,03,24
128,I really wanted to like it,"Not my first stay but perhaps my last.  It's not that the staff aren't pleasant, or it's great to have 2 restaurants linked to the hotel with good food but.....

I just can't feel the love for the Montcalm.  The constant up and downstairs from one wing to another is pretty poor.  Granted I wasn't around much to enjoy the eclectic feel of the hotel and staff try really hard to make this feel like a luxury boutique but the quirky navigation to your room and the bundles of students across the road late at night a bit off putting.

Perhaps if it was a holiday where I could have engaged more it would have felt better",3,2016,03,24
128,Superb London hotel,"Attending a function at the Brewery , so we decided to stay at the adjoining hotel.
What a great decision . The bedrooms are very clean and tidy. The bed was so comfortable I actually had a lay in . As for the staff , well brilliant , always nice to be greeted with a smile what ever time of the day. Will definitely stay again",5,2016,03,23
128,Did not meet our expectations.,"I had high hopes for our weekend away but unfortunately the experience did not live up to these hopes. Our first night was spent in a ground floor room across the courtyard and next to a very noisy air-conditioning unit. We arrived late and were tired so put up with the drone. On mentioning this to reception next morning they did change our room, admittedly to a larger and better appointed room than the previous night, but why put us in a room that noisy when we were staying two nights, surely they must have had complaints about the noise before. When checking out the receptionist asked if we wanted to check the bill, which I thought was strange, why wouldn't we? Whilst the bill was correct it did include lots of entries that had been zeroed and then put  back on again, giving us the impression that they can't produce a bill correctly and that most people don't bother to look at them. The room we ended up in was lovely, the gentlemen  who showed us to our rooms and delivered room service were a credit to the hotel, it was just the overall experience that we had expected better of, that has lead me to this average review.",3,2016,03,23
128,Beautiful looking hotel,"Stayed here for a night with the wife as we were catching a show and doing a river cruise and sightseeing weekend.
Easy to find within a five minute walk of the tube station. 
Has a bit of wow factor in reception as you enter. Lovely looking entrance and reception area.
You are given hot towels while checking in
The room was a little small and felt a bit cramped in, however the bathroom was large, almost as big as the room itself, both were very clean and had good amenities. 
Quite expensive for the size of the room but it is in the city so it's not a surprise. 
The staff were all friendly and attentive and didn't come across snobby as some luxury hotels staff can.
All in all a good hotel would stay again.",4,2016,03,23
128,"Good hotel, location means good valie","Small rooms if you're in the standard rooms, but they're well equipped. A great selection of amenities, very high quality. Breakfast in the club lounge is genuinely disappointing - poor selection of supermarket breads, pastries and admittedly nice yoghurts. Instant coffee in rooms - I would have expected better. Staff are excellent though, very good service throughout. ",5,2016,03,22
128,A bit hit and and bit miss,"Lets start with the negatives...The Standard double rooms were so small you couldn't move around in them. There was no hotel lounge area, only an adjoining pub which you could not bring a small child to in the evening so we were stuck in our room.

We were upgraded to a larger room as the porter went back to reception and told them the room was not big enough for us. (Were not big people and I did phone in advance to ensure the room was suitable for a couple with a baby, so the advise over the phone was incorrect) 

The Club rooms were lovely and spacious. The travel cot provided was clean and of a good standard and the staff were very helpful in regards to our requirements to heating up our babies food. The bed was very comfortable and they had a good election of TV channels available.  The wifi is free and the bathroom facilities are lovely.",3,2016,03,22
128,"Simona, Kirsztina and Karolina make everything tick","I stay at the Montcalm almost every week as I work in London part time.  I have stayed in a number of hotels until I found the one I wanted to ""live"" in.  And the reason?  It feels more like home than the others because of (a) Simona - the most efficient and caring duty manager I've encountered (b) Karolina - who always has a warm welcoming smile when you arrive and of course (c) Krisztina - from whom there's always a hug and an enquiry as to how my family are all doing.  

When I was ill one week they called my room to see how I was feeling and sent me tea, hot water, lemon and honey.  There are countless other examples.  

Put simply, these guys make the difference and make it the place I want to return to.",5,2016,03,22
128,Beautiful Hotel at a good price,"We got a fantastic deal at this hotel in London at the weekend. It was only for one night so not too much to report, but positives were the location, style, cleanliness and room which was really quiet for central London (actually no noise at all). 

The only downsides were that the bar wasn't open when we returned at about midnight on Saturday, and it feels a bit weird on arrival with people offering hot towels, being personally shown to our room, etc. I think its trying to be a Dorchester, but there's actually no need, I'd just stick to good service (which this hotel has), rather than trying too hard. Would definitely stay again though...",4,2016,03,21
128,Another enjoyable stay,"A warm welcome and great service as always - an oasis of calm in amongst the hustle and bustle of the city! The rooms are comfortable, showers work well. I use the business lounge for breakfast, which has a good continental choice and all I need.",5,2016,03,21
128,Excellent guests services,I received a great message from guests services prior to my stay which immediately made me think about the hotel in a very positive light and made me even more excited about my pending trip. On arrival the team were very attentive and my husband and I were even lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade! As it was a rare occasion that we had a night to ourselves away from our young children this was even more appreciated. The duplex suite which we stayed in was stunning and immaculately clean and there was plenty of space to leave our cases out of the way. The only criticism I could possibly make would be that the room seemed slightly more biased toward men as there were no mirrors above any of the dressing tables and no clear point from which you would base yourself to dry your hair/ apply make-up. This was easily solved but perhaps another socket and mirror above the dressing table would be useful? I would definitely stay in this hotel again though - the professionalism and attention to detail from the staff was fantastic and the hotel was great value with a stunning reception area.,4,2016,03,21
128,City weekend stay,"Loved it here unusual lots of character, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms lovely can be bit small but the hotel is fitted into an old brewery yet very modern. Breakfast enjoyable too. Only downside weekend in the city is quiet but not sure closing the bar/restaurant is acceptable in any London hotel on a weekend? Will use again.",4,2016,03,20
128,Average for the price,"The room I was allocated was very dark and only had one window high up. It was clean, modern and reasonably spacious expensive for what it was. The hotel is conveniently located for the city, and the staff were friendly and professional, but there are better hotels for the same price or cheaper.",3,2016,03,20
128,Elegant Hotel with excellent standards,"From the second you arrive, The Montcalm welcomes you with an air of comfort and professionalism, polite friendly staff, speedy and efficient booking in and that little bit extra that makes it an experience worth remembering for all the right reasons. The rooms are well laid out with an attention to detail that others should follow, thought has gone into delivering a complete package with the guest in mind, this hotel is now one of my favourites in London and is somewhere that I would recommend and will definitely visit again",5,2016,03,18
128,Highly recommended,"At the time of booking I had made a note that our visit was a wedding anniversary, amazing response from the hotel as they had upgraded our room and waiting for us when we walked thru the door was a lovely card, chocolates and champagne. We even had rose petals on the bed.All of the staff very extremely friendly and polite. We stayed in a duplex suite with access to the club lounge, we enjoyed drinks in there on our 1st night and continental breakfast on both mornings, the club lounge is a real perk and helps make the stay. The hotel location is within very easy walking distance of 2 tube stations. We ate in the jugged hare on both nights, a fabulous pub and great food. I am so glad that we have discovered this hotel and will certainly be back",5,2016,03,17
128,First class all the way,"If you are given the opportunity to say at the Montcalm at the Brewery, you will receive the warmest of welcomes.  This has been my hotel of choice for over four years and it has never missed, not once.  The rooms are presented to the highest of standards with Guest Relations Team on hand to support your stay.  With superb entertaining facilities, nothing has been left to chance.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,16
128,Beautiful stylish hotel,"Location was ideal for sightseeing, quite area over the weekend period.  Stunning hotel, excellent service from all staff both in the hotel and Jugged Hare restaurant attached to hotel. Room was fantastic & bed extremely comfortable. Can't wait to stay again.",5,2016,03,15
128,Amazing stay at this beautiful hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel for a short break in March. I cannot rate this hotel high enough!! 

We stayed in the most beautiful room, and the staff were amazing!! In particular one of the Guest Experience managers, Alice- who went out of her way to ensure we had a perfect stay. 

This was a very special trip for my husband and  I, and we left feeling relaxed, rested and happy! We will 100% be back and i would not stay anywhere else in London now. One very happy guest.Thank you Alice and team!",5,2016,03,15
128,Birthday treat,"I made the reservation 3 months prior to our travel date after reviewing many London hotels. Although the location initially appeared a little away from the action, we quickly got to grips with the tube, and with Moorgate less than 5 minutes away (when we went in the right direction) it worked really well for us. We arrived at check in just after 10 as we had caught the early train from Leeds. Although the room was not ready, we checked in and our luggage was secured away. Then we were onto the circle line to embankment and ready for lunch on the strand. From there we went to the theatre for a matinee of wicked. Straight rom the show it was back on the circle line and to the hotel. We got our keys and were shown to our room by Vlad, who showed us all the facilities within the room. He also explained that we had access to the club floor where we were entitled to use the facilities, including alcoholic drinks from 5:30 to 7:30, a lovely range of snacks all in a really nice setting. The bed was exceptional and a wide range of pillows were available along with being able to choose a fragrance in the room. So after a wonderful nights sleep it was down for breakfast in the attached mugged hare. A wonderful selection of breakfast fare was on offer and left us feeling set up for the day ahead. We have stayed in London many times and this will be a hotel that we revisit in the not too distant future.",5,2016,03,14
128,"Very nice hotel, but a little too far out","Montcalm was beautiful hotel and staff was helpful.  The room was large and very nice.  There is a restaurant and bar on site and some restaurants nearby that are ok.  The hotel is pretty far out from main attractions but close (2 -3 blocks) to two metro stops.  Overall, great stay, but I will probably stay in a more central location next time.",5,2016,03,14
128,Wonderful stay and service is first class,"This was our first stay at the London Brewary Montcalm and I must say we were really happy with the hotel. Check in at reception was the best we've ever had and the assistant duty manager could not have been more helpful, courteous and genuinely wanted us to be satisfied. All other staff we came accross were very helpful and friendly so you get the impression that management really take their clients satisfaction seriously.",5,2016,03,13
128,2 nights for business,"This is a hotel close to the city/ financial district, beautiful historic building, quite central if your business takes you to the area. It has an extremely confusing labyrinth structure, finding your room is a challenge. Hence they help you out to find your room. I had a peculiarly depressing stay overlooking a tight construction alley thru a small window in a supposedly delux room. Try to get a room overlooking the alley in the middle of the hotel. The restaurant - breakfast arrangement was around the corner, next building - not very convenient. For the price range - it is worthwhile looking for alternatives. ",3,2016,03,13
128,Very modern,"Confusing at first given the address, check in is across the road in the brewery. The room was very modern on the 3rd floor, very clean and staff very helpful, breakfast was £25 each, didn't bother to try as across the road you can have it for £8:50. 
",4,2016,03,13
128,First class all the way,I was down in London for my girlfriends birthday and our 6 month anniversary. Prior to the stay i was emailed by the hotels Guest Experience Host asking the reason for the trip so I informed her. On my arrival i was told my room had been upgraded and upon entering the room saw that the hotel had organised balloons wine and cake tell help us celebrate. It was this sort of personal touch that made this hotel such a treat to stay in and at such an affordable price. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.,5,2016,03,12
128,"Wonderful stay, fantastic meal and attentive service. The mont calm is the best in London, by far.","It was our 21 st wedding anniversary and my husbands 50 th birthday. We booked a luxury night getaway to see Les Mis and have a romantic meal in the Jugged Hare. 

We were bumped up to the WOW suite unexpectedly and what a lovely surprise that was, a gorgeous large room with four poster bed and a small bottle of champagne awaited us. The Windows actually open which gives a lovely fresh breeze (a release from stuffy air cond) we arrived late 11pm to Jugged hare and was given a table in the packed restaurant. Had a lovely meal, wonderful service, great atmosphere. The breakfast the next day was really delicious and beautifully presented.

A fantastic luxury stay, in a really comfortable bed. Also loved the jet, rain, maker shower. Thank you Mont Calm, the Brazil's will see you again real soon!",5,2016,03,11
128,Business trip very comfortable ,Had a great second stay and appreciated the evening manager who is a stellar individual.  Bravo to him.  I was there for a second visit and its convenience makes it ideal for my work.  Interesting architecture. If you need to stay in city of London I think this is a great choice.  ,5,2016,03,10
128,"Clean, Comfortable, Peaceful, Reasonably Priced but Over-stylized","The Montcalm at the Brewery is a great choice if you have business in the financial district of London.  Rooms were clean, comfortable, reasonably priced and beautifully decorated.  I would love to give it an Excellent rating but a few items prevent me from doing that.  First, you WILL get lost the first time you try to find your room.  The signs are only a little helpful.  After the first day, you will get the hang of navigating the maze of hallways.  It is a typical charming hotel that has been retrofitted into an old building.  The rooms are absolutely beautiful with high-end touches.  However, I found it over-stylized to the point of being impractical.  For example, each bathroom has a rain shower head and above counter sink bowl.  Yet, it is impossible to turn on the shower without getting your arm wet or washing your hands without splashing water all over the counter.  Finally, beware of the reservation switch that has happened to two of my business colleagues over the past month.  In each case, they made a reservation at Montcalm Brewery but were switched to a ""sister"" hotel when they arrived for check-in.  I will stay at Montcalm again due to its fabulous location near our London office and reasonable price but will always call ahead to make sure I'm not bumped to another location.",3,2016,03,09
128,Amazing service,"What an amazing experience! Staff very attentive, made us feel like we were famous or something! The room and the facilities were very good, and the bed, oh my days the best hotel bed I've ever stayed in. It was so comfortable. Cannot fault our experience at all.",5,2016,03,06
128,Handy hotel for London sight seeing,"As a hotel conveniently located within walking distance of the Barbican and Moorgate tube stations, The Montcalm is a charming hotel that proved ideal for a short weekend resting place and will no doubt prove useful for future adventures. The only downside with giving sterling reviews is it will become more popular and prices will surge! No review could ever come without a whinge on my part and that's only because i like a really hot shower but the killjoy safety police have put a limiter on the ""rainfall"" experience so not quite to my liking but there you go. The fully stocked mini bar was a temptation but you'd be hard pressed not to choose something if it took your fancy. The bowl of fruit was also a nice touch. Very rare to see these days and just one of those things that make it stand out as something special.  The staff throughout the stay were warm, friendly and did all the right things. Try it yourself...",5,2016,03,06
128,Super charming for a romantic weekend away.,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at in London for under 200£/ night,It was charming, super comfortable, old-world-y but with modern flair. The building was interesting, and although a bit of a labyrinth to navigate, well decorated and maintained. The staff were very of 5* service and the gym was very small but modern. Breakfast a la carte was good. Although the vegetarian choice was very limited.

The club double room was superb. It had good space for a London room, was modern, and very, very plush. The bath was luxurious. Recommended for a weekend away.",5,2016,03,05
128,Amazingly Quiet (Weekend!) City Stay near the Barbican,"I stayed here with a friend for a weekend treat in London and can honesty say the service was First Class! The staff cannot do more to provide help, advice and a friendly chat. I was upgraded to the Club floor rooms and my partner was treated with lovely food, use of the lounge and access to the gym/sauna area overnight which was divine. 

As with all city hotels, parking is a bit of a pain, you can choose to go to the Barbican and pay around £9 per night (very reasonable) or street parking which is free over the weekend but at your own risk. Lots of things to see and do locally and a stones throw from the cinemas, trendy shoreditch and tube to Central London",5,2016,03,05
128,It's great,"2nd stay here, what a great place, almost tempted to not give it a great review though as I'd rather it was a bit of a secret! Stayed two nights in London, one here after a night somewhere else, at another 5 star place which is two star compared to here. Staff are great, big shout out to Enza who was exceptional but also to Alice for her help with organisation. Jugged Hare is good, wish we'd gone in a bit earlier. Love this place, will return time after time. ",5,2016,03,04
128,Enjoyed our time at the brewery ,"Stayed 26-29 Feb
Lovely hotel
Great staff
We were upgraded to a club room with all the benefits that entailed 
Room was beautiful 
The tube was a couple of minutes away
Would recommend and go  back tomorrow ",5,2016,03,04
128,Thank you for making our weekend super Amazing!,"We have stayed at the Montcalm at The Brewery on various occasions and every time we absolutely love staying here! On this occasion we were having a black tie event at the Brewery and we had a very special celebration, so we booked to stay in the WOW Suite. I cannot thank Daisy and her team enough for their amazing customer service, very attentive in all of our needs and for spoiling us with their attention. We were looked after with great smiles and 5 star service, and had a super weekend....Thank you and see you soon x x",5,2016,03,01
128,Best hotel I've stayed in - ever!,"Stayed here for my birthday with a group of family and friends, had the best time! Wish I could have stayed longer. The rooms were all lovely, with slippers and robes and VERY comfortable beds!  I would recommend a club room, they are excellent value.

The staff were so friendly and helpful and really made my birthday with flowers in the room and a cake too! They are such an asset to the hotel (Daisy, Vlad the doorman, and the others whose names I didn't get) - make the most of them while they're there as they're sure to be head-hunted by the Savoy or Ritz any time now!

The breakfast in the Jugged Hare was exceptional, the best full English I've had in a hotel!

I will definitely be back next time I'm in London. Thanks to all at the Montcalm for making my 18th (+22!) birthday so memorable!",5,2016,03,01
128,AMAZING time! We'll be back.,"A lovely hotel with really friendly staff for whom nothing seems too much trouble. I arranged a surprise delivery for my boyfriend beforehand and they set it all up in the room for when we arrived which was really nice of them to help arrange. 

On the second night, a really loud group of people decided that it was totally acceptable to have a shouty lively conversation at 2am in the corridor right outside our room. We gave them a few minutes to see if they were just on their way back to their rooms, but they carried on being loud for a while. A quick call to the concierge and literally 30 seconds later we heard some shushing and no more noise! It wasn't made a big deal, and the staff handled it really smoothly and quickly.

The bed was super comfy, the bathroom rain shower so much fun to shower in, and the room was a good size with nice decor. There were lots of extra little touches that really made it feel welcoming and comfortable. I'd have happily stayed there a lot longer, and will definitely be coming back next time I visit London. 

This is a hotel worth the money, and while it's usually out of my budget it was a lovely treat to go to - and I'd save money to make sure I could stay there again.

A special shout out to Gabrielle in guest experiences for helping make arrangements for our trip; the cake was delicious ;-)",5,2016,03,01
128,Luxury for an amazing price,"Stayed for a friend's 40th in February and was really impressed with the friendly staff and beautifully appointed rooms.  All felt so luxurious in our twin club room - where else in London are you greeted by a doorman, have your bags taken to your room and enjoy the luxury of slippers and dressing gown and so many other wonderful treats for just over £100pr!  Will definitely stay here if I ever need to stay in London again. Thanks so much.  ",5,2016,02,29
128,"Wonderful stay, wish we booked longer","Stayed one night to celebrate our anniversary as we were having dinner in London and didn't want the hassle of traveling home late. Wish we had booked 2 nights, as the whole hotel experience was wonderful.
The staff are all fantastic, polite, friendly and very helpful. The room was great, very clean with all the facilities you might need. The club lounge was lovely, just wish we had arrived a little earlier to try it in the evening, but had to rush off to dinner after arriving.
The bed was fantastically comfortable, and it was great to have a nespresso machine for a great coffee in the morning. Club lounge breakfast was fine (yummy chocolate croissant and some nice smoked salmon amongst the choices).
Only a 10 minute walk from Liverpool st station, and the number 76 bus nearby takes you to St. Paul's or Somerset house, so great for a base if staying in London.
Was booked in a rush, and wasn't sure what to expect, but they exceeded all our expectations and we will certainly be returning. Thanks.",5,2016,02,29
128,Perfect spot to land in London,"It was a stumble away from many fun spots, loads of options for public transportation and nightly offerings at The Barbican.  I did not like the first room offered on the lower floor with a view of an airshaft, with accompanying noise.  But they graciously reassigned me to the 4th floor, which was perfect and quiet!

Because of this consideration and the comfortable bed, I will be back! It was a great 5 nights in a great city!",4,2016,02,28
128,Friendly and well run,"First stay at this hotel and we would definitely go back. From the moment you walk into this elegant converted old brewery, the welcome remains until you depart. Club room was smart, very comfortable and peaceful.  Breakfast in the Jugged Hare was fantastic, there was something for everyone.  It's an excellent location for site seeing. We would also give the hotel five stars for customer experience as we had a slight issue with our room but the hotel acted on it quickly and with least disruption, they couldn't do enough to help. We appreciated that sometimes things can go wrong but thank the hotel for making  our stay remain a great experience throughout.  We felt very well treated and look forward to returning later in the year.",5,2016,02,28
128,Overpriced for what you get.,"I've stayed here 3 times.  It's quite nice,  but certainly nothing very special,  especially considering the rates on a weekday- think it was over 300 a night last time.  There is a big difference in room sizes and it seems to be the luck of the draw.  The last time I was in a small room with a brick arched roof.  Was far from impressed.  Time before I was in a much larger room overlooking the  street at the front.  Very little in the immediate area in terms of bars and restaurants later on in the evening. I've always stayed here when attending an event at the Brewery which is adjacent- and I wouldn't come back for any other reason.  Sorry,  didn't want to sound overly critical but for the top dollar charged I just expect more.",3,2016,02,27
128,Lovely stay in London,"A great location and a great place to stay in London.
I had the pleasure of staying at The Montcalm at the Brewery hotel while on business in London. The hotel is extremely well located, next to Barbican Centre and convenient to public transport as well as shopping and great restaurants. My Club room was large, super clean, and comfortable. The staff was great... they make you feel at home.
A special thanks to Grazia Berardi, our Guest Experience Host, for being so kind from our arrival to the last day.",5,2016,02,27
128,Not what I was expecting,"If Tripadvisor had the option of rating somewhere between average and very good that's what I would have done for the Montcalm at the Brewery. The location is great, only 15 minutes on the underground from Euston and less than £10 in a taxi from Shoreditch so in that respect is was perfect. The staff on the front desk were extremely helpful and friendly, I had a friend with me from overseas and they were very forthcoming with offering extras to make his stay as welcoming as possible. The room however was a little disappointing considering the price and other reviews on Tripadvisor. It was quite small and the bathroom was pretty low spec. The toilet had a problem with it and flushed all night. I'm also pretty sure the bed was supposed to be a king but was a standard double, it was however extremely comfortable! I wouldn't want anyone to be put off by my average rating as it is a nice hotel and I wouldn't be put off staying again, just not up to the hype I was expecting.",3,2016,02,26
128,Lovely!,Stayed here for two nights on a quick trip to London. Just a few minutes from the tube stop. The hotel staff was lovely and so helpful. The design of the lobby is stunning and the room was comfortable and well equipped. I'd love to stay there again.,5,2016,02,25
128,Exceptional ,"Very good rates. The hotel staff is wonderful. Pleasant and helpful and cheery. The room is nicely sized for London. The attached Chiswell Dining Rooms and the Jugged Hare are both excellent. 

Don't let the funky layout deter you. This is a great property at a great price",5,2016,02,25
128,Valentines weekend ,"What an amazing welcome, amazing staff. It's a really lovely hotel the best one I've been too.
Definitely will go back again.

Parking is not far from the hotel it's less then 5 min walk.

It's peaceful neat and tidy.

Breakfast was amazing too so much different thing to choose from.

I'll be planning to go back again to spend more nights because we only spent a night.",5,2016,02,25
128,Fabulous Friday Night,"This was not our first visit to The Montcalm at The Brewery and on every occasion, 3 to date, we have received a warm welcome and made to feel like a special guest from the moment we approach the front door. Having booked on line the check-in process was straightforward and uncomplicated. We were shown to our room and had all the facilities explained to us (a brief recap as he thoughtfully asked if we had stayed before). Our room was fabulous, immaculately clean, warm, well equipped and possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The turn down service is always a nice touch which adds that little something. Although our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the road, the location of the hotel just far enough off the main thoroughfares for evening revellers resulted in an undisturbed sleep. A buffet breakfast in The Jugged Hare was a great finish to our stay, a hearty breakfast setting us up for a day exploring the city. I love this hotel and will be first on my list for our next night in London.",5,2016,02,25
128,Made to feel like Royalty,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday to have a fun packed weekend in London. 
For the hotel I was looking for luxury, something different yet affordable. I definitely found it with The Montcalm! 
The room was spotless, spacious and super comfy. Breakfast in the morning was plentiful, really set us both up for the day. 

The one thing I really must mention is the staff. Every member of staff we met throughout our time, even before we walked through the front door until the time we left were smiley, friendly and couldn't do enough for you. They are a great asset to the hotel and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. They tipped off our weekend perfectly. 

Price wise it is more than reasonable. The other hotels I was looking at wanted almost double for the same thing. 

For all the above reasons, next time I plan to stay in London this will be where I stay. 

",5,2016,02,24
128,Wonderful weekend,"We stayed at the hotel for one night on 20th February with friends.  We had one of the deluxe rooms and cannot fault anything.  There were dressing gowns and slippers in the room and a lovely large comfortable bed. The use of the club lounge was a bonus too, complimentary snacks and drinks between 5.30 and 7.30.  Breakfast was very good in the Jugged Hare, you don't even have to leave the hotel to get there! Staff were very attentive and friendly throughout the hotel including the doorman.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel especially if you are visiting the Barbican it is so close.",5,2016,02,23
128,quality,"Only stayed for the one night,but would have liked to stay longer.All the staff with out exception where very helpfull and polite.The room was very cleen and the shower was great. The breakfast choice was superb along with its quality.Would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure.",5,2016,02,23
128,"Awesome hotel superb service throughout, staff amazingly helpful","Nothing left to chance here. Our stay was made very special, once Daisy heard it was our daughter Anna's 40th she was on a mission to make it a weekend to remember. So glad we chose this well staffed  beautiful Hotel with it's attention to detail everywhere you looked! In a very good location next to the Barbican and near Moorgate tube station. Once inside the calm atmosphere takes over and one relaxes totally. The Club Lounge is such a good experience Daisy provided a beautiful cake and Champagne on ice !!!

Cannot fault this Hotel. Will be well recommended by us.

Nothing was too much trouble, they really do want your stay to be the best it possibly can be. The 4 rooms we had were all beautiful Upgrades very much appreciated.
Thank you so much everyone",5,2016,02,23
128,"Nice idea, just need to be a bit","I really want to like these hotel but I don't. Do not get me wrong, the hotel staffs were very nice (I gave all the five stars to all of them) The design of the hotel is just wrong. I felt like I was in the maze. It was so confusing inside the hotel. There was a lot of guests got lost in the hotel. 
The room size was OK. I understand that the hotel is in the financial district of London. This was an appropriated size. However, the interior design of the room also confusing as same as the location of room itself. There are a lot of thing. I am not quite sure why the design came out the way it was such as the million light switches, weird design of bathroom shower, etc. 
I just give 3 stars because after the long day of sightseeing, I had to come back... frustrated with room and the location of the room. I also concerned about the fire hazard. How can I be able to escape from these place if any incident really happen? How can I get from point A to point B or point A to point C....???    ",3,2016,02,23
128,Exceptional - A wonderful hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel. Our most recent visit was made an absolute pleasure by the staff (especially Alice) and their willingness to be both warm, effiicent and highly responsive. The rooms are lovely with the WOW suite being a real highlight, the dining in the Jugged Hare for breakfast is wonderful in the evenings and made for a lovely place to take breakfast. Having use of the club room was a real positive this time around. Having just arrived back, the stay there made so pleasurable by the staff and setting has made us already look to stay again and make this gorgeous hotel our regular base for exploring London.",5,2016,02,22
128,What a great Hotel,"Stayed at the Montcalm for 3  nights and found it a great hotel and location, the food was outstanding the rooms very clean and well equiped the staff very friendly and can't do enough for you, we had snacks and drinks in the club lounge between 5:30 / 7:30 and must praise the girl serving the drinks & snacks as she was very polite and friendly ( sorry can't remember her name ) Defiantly found a great hotel.",5,2016,02,22
128,A gem just around the corner from the Barbican Concert Hall,"The people could not have been more pleasant, polite or helpful. The Hotel has a stunning Reception area and the room we were allocated - 617 in the London Suites opposite - was exceptionally good, very well appointed and extremely comfortable. When we returned to the room after the concert we found the bed turned down, a ""Goodnight"" card and two chocolates on the pillow. The Hotel gives one a choice of pillows and there is a fragrance generator in the room - the scent of which again to your choosing. The whole ambiance gave a feeling of tranquility and calm. (It's not called Montcalm for nothing!!)
The pub opposite provided an excellent pre-concert meal and an absolutely superb breakfast. 

We shall return, without doubt.

Thank you to everyone at the Montcalm and the Jugged Hare.",5,2016,02,22
128,Very nice hotel in a convenient location,"Stayed for two nights in a Montcalm Club Room. The room was a good size, very clean and well appointed. The staff were friendly and attentive. We did not use the Club Lounge, but did enjoy the complimentary hot breakfast buffet which was very nice. The hotel is located approxiamtely 5-6 minutes walk from both Barbican and Moorgate tube stations and a 15-20 minute walk from the Tower of London. Altogther this hotel represented good value for money and we would definitely return.",5,2016,02,21
128,Fantastic Value supported by exceptional Staff!!,"I decided to treat my partner for a surprise weekend in London for her birthday.
We've reached a time in our life where we don't want too 'slum it' but also like value for money. . .The Montcalm gives you this in spades!!
Ahead of the trip I contacted the hotel and asked what was possible to put into the room as a special treat. Promptly, I was contacted by Alice from 'Guest Experiences who furnished me with a comprehensive list of possibilities.
The choice was made and confirmation recieved.
On arrival you walk into a warm and sumptuous reception and are greater by a 'gaggle' of attentive staff. Whilst checking in Alice appeared, introduced herself and wished Catherine a Happy Birthday and a wonderful stay and then advised that under the circumstances she had upgraded our room. . . a lovely surprise for both of us.
The hotel has an unusual layout but this is due to it being a conversion rather than being purpose built. . .that said it makes it far more interesting.
The decor and furnishing as exquisite and there are small details that raise it from an 'nice' hotel to something special. . . one of which are it's staff.
They are knowledgeable, well presented, and attentive without being overpowering.
Nothing was too much trouble!
We had planned too spend a majority of time meeting friends and doing 'touristy things', but adjusted our venue with friends to spend time in the 'Jugged Hare' and enjoy the venue.
The breakfast is reasonably priced (for London!!), and although on the Monday I think they were overwhelmed by a conference of people all landing at once, they coped admirably. The choice and quality of the food is extremely good both breakfast and evening meals. . .and I can advise that the Eggs Benedict is only surpassed by the 'Blue Room' @ the Shangri La Singapore. . . praise indeed to get to No2!! lol
Overall, a great hotel, great staff and a great experience.
I would stay again in a heartbeat!!",5,2016,02,21
128,Fantastic value in the heart of the City,"We stayed here as a family of five over Valentines weekend. We were attending an event at The Brewery next door and took two interconnecting Club rooms. Aside from its proximity to the event location, the Montcalm turned out to be perfect in most every way. We always like staying in the City when in London and the Montcalm's location was perfect. It's walkable to lots of things, close to the tube and black cabs were easily hailed on the street outside.

The entrance lobby was stunning and staff helpful and solicitous. We opted for the prepaid breakfast offer, which was delicious, ample and charmingly served in the Jugged Hare, the 'City pub' next door, also part of the hotel. The club lounge was quiet, traditional and comfortable with newspapers, hot drinks and snacks available. The 'gym' was nothing much - a very small windowless room with a broken treadmill - the boys ran outside, along the river to St Paul's and back, instead!

Our only gripe? Our club rooms were rather small and dark, though stylishly appointed and luxurious. It didn't help that we had an extra rollout bed in one of the rooms, I guess ... Still, the beds were dreamily comfortable and overall, this was the least of our concerns. 

But the best bit? As this is primarily a business hotel, rates for a winter weekend were competitive and the whole stay turned out to be fantastic value!",5,2016,02,20
128,Kindest service,"Excellent service: when they discovered it was my husband's birthday, they gave us complimentary breakfast, so kind! The room was cozy and well furnished, kettle, iron, even an umbrella. Super comfy bed. ",5,2016,02,20
128,Disapointing,"I had high hopes for this hotel, but I have few good things to say about it. First room I got had the tiniest window imaginable (I specifically asked for a room with light), and was really depressing. Second room seemed like whoever designed it never really tried to spend a night there. Good luck figuring out which of the dozen or so light switches are connected to which lights. It was impossible not to flood the bathroom floor while taking a shower because of the angle of the shower door. The front desk people kept greeting me like I was checking in, even though they had spoken to me every day for 4 days. One of the bellmen was apparently mortally offended at not having been tipped and was downright rude next time I needed something. Definitely not coming back.",3,2016,02,20
128,Very nice and comfortable hotel,"This is a bit of a quirky hotel. Being in such an old building its layout is challenging to navigate your way around to start with but I found I got used to it quite quickly.

The room was very nice and not too large or small but the detail touches were very good. The air-conditioning worked very well to whatever temperature I wanted. There was also underfloor heating in the bathroom which was very nice. The ""view"" out of the window was of another building about 10 feet away but I wasn't here for a view anyway so that didn't bother me at all.

The bed was comfy although it was only a double rather than a king size but it was fine with good quality linen and pillows. The rooms were very quiet and I slept very well which isn't guaranteed for me but it was nice to wake up refreshed. The bathroom was really nice - a very good sized bath and nice waterfall shower with lots of nice towels.

From a business perspective, the free wifi was very good and the mini-safe was large enough for my 15"" MacBook and other bits which isn't always the case in some hotels.

In terms of location - the hotel is right near the financial heart of London rather than that many of the main tourist attractions. It's a good 30 minutes from the West End but there are tube stations in both directions within about 10 minutes walking so getting around isn't bad at all. If I was staying in London as a tourist the location wouldn't be my first choice but I was actually at a conference in the same venue so it was fine.",5,2016,02,19
128,Valentine's,"Had a fantastic stay at the Montcalm.
The whole team are a credit to the hotel..they couldn't do more for us and the upgrade to the suites was appreciated. 
Vlad the doorman needs a special thank you too.. he showed us to our room an remembered our names the following day at breakfast.. really nice guy.
Thank you Montcalm we will definitely be staying again..",5,2016,02,18
128,Had a great room ... In the end,"Stayed over on Valentine's night. When we checked in we were told that we were upgraded to a club room, however, it was tiny, with a tiny bed. Not very romantic and not much of an upgrade!!

We complained and then they gave us a lovely room. 

The breakfast was nice in the gastro pub and there are 2 tube stations in wAlking distance. Very accommodating staff too.

All in all, pretty good.",4,2016,02,17
128,Third time around!,"We stayed in room 032 and are just back from our wonderful valentines break at our favorite London hotel 'Montcalm the Brewery'. Everything was exactly as we expected special attention, comfortable and tasteful surroundings and wonderful staff greetings.   The staff of the hotel gives everybody the feeling that nothing is too much trouble. This was our third visit to the hotel in less than a year and each time has been an absolute pleasure, I’ll go so far in that the staff treat clients like VIP's! We were upgraded to club room status and have to say that this is so well worth it. It's like being a member of an elite club. The breakfast was fantastic as usual and our welcome from Puma who showed us to our table. The guest relations representative Alice made us feel so welcome and presented us with a little present for Valentines which my partner loved (chocolates!). The breakfasts are taken in the Jug and Hair which is a pub attached to the hotel. This works so well and is loaded with character and ambiance. It gets very popular at night and being on the fringes of the city of London you can imagine all the city workers using it as a very social watering hole. Really love the Montcalm and especially the staff. Well done for making our third visit as special as our first, see you again very soon!",5,2016,02,17
128,Best hotel in London by far,"Stayed at the hotel on Friday 12th February with my wife! This is now my 6th stay at this wonderful hotel. Everything from the moment you walk into the reception area where you are warmly greeted, to the stay and continued customer service, there is nothing more you can ask for from any hotel. Alice (the duty manager) is probably the jewel in this crown. She has been fantastic every time I have stayed. When we come to London for a night out, the Montcalm at the Brewery is the only place we book.  So much so we have planned our meal around the location of the hotel!",5,2016,02,17
128,a great stay,"This was our second visit to this hotel.
 The room was great for my wife's wheelchair
 We had a roll in shower
 The breakfasts in the nearby Jugged Hare are real quality
 The staff are really friendle.
 Access for a wheelchair is by a side door but this present any problems",5,2016,02,17
128,Wonderful stay,"We stayed for 2 nights over the valentines weekend (I wish it was longer!!) the hotel is lovely. We had a Club room which was really nice with the comfiest bed I have ever had in a hotel. Every thing you require from a good hotel was provided.  All staff were extremely friendly and attentive, I can not recommend this hotel highly enough.  The location was great with just a few minute walk to Moorgate tube station and short walk to the museum of London and St Pauls cathedral. I will definitely be staying on my next trip to London.",5,2016,02,16
128,Lovely hotel in decent location,"We stayed for only 1 night for a Valentine's treat but would have liked to have stayed for a little longer.  The location was quiet and relatively easy to reach via tube.  The reception staff and the doormen were absolutely delightful.  The room was nice, albeit compact, but was more than adequate for a very comfortable stay.  Although we didn't have dinner in the hotel we did have a drink in the Jugged Hare with bar food for lunch which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Breakfast the following morning was a little chaotic to start off with as we seemed to hit peak time traffic, but with a little wait, all worked out fine.  The breakfast itself was absolutely delicious.  I would definitely book to stay at this hotel in the future.",5,2016,02,16
128,The best hotel I've stayed in the city!,"I booked the Montcalm @ the Brewery for valentines weekend and honestly I cannot fault the service. We were given an upgrade upon arrival and stayed in the wow suite- the name suits!
Would also like to personally thank Alice in the Guest experience team. She made our stay that extra bit special and went above and beyond to make sure my partner had a stay to remember. The level of service was excellent and if anyone wishes to make any special arrangements for their stay I would highly recommend they contact Alice. All in all i cant fault the hotel.",5,2016,02,16
128,A lovely night in a lovely hotel.,"We stayed here for a Valentines night break. We were in a club room which was spacious and tastefully decorated with everything that you would need for a stay. There was one small issue in the room which was dirty marks on the curtains which were quite unsightly. My other gripe was that it cost £12 pound to watch a film many of which are quite old. But that is where the moaning ends. The service was excellent and all the staff were very attentive. The club room entitles you to use the club lounge which serves finger sandwiches and canapés along with beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic. This is all very relaxed and a nice touch. The breakfast served in the adjoining Jugged Hare gastropub was top drawer and this pub has a great menu and a great atmosphere. This was excellent value for a five star hotel in a central London location and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",4,2016,02,15
128,Ok,"Booked a 2 night theatre break which we do regularly and decided to try this hotel. On arrival staff were very friendly and helpful. The room (club) was very small in comparison to others we have stayed in as was the en suite. I would not class this hotel as a 5 star more a 4 although I'm probably being over critical. Small things (attention to detail) had not been thought about properly. The batteries in the remote barely worked and the cups for the tea/coffee weren't great. Also the lights took some working out(loads of different switches all over the place!) and we couldn't seem to get the room temperature right, either too hot or too cold and again not easy to adjust. There were also a couple of bulbs out in the en suite. In all fairness none of the above issues were mentioned to staff and I'm sure they would have been sorted if we had. The breakfast was great, really delicious but on day 2 we had to go downstairs as there wasn't enough room upstairs. Fair enough but I think the basics ( orange juice, sauces etc) should also be downstairs to avoid having to keep going up and down (having only one pair of hands!) The tea/coffee was also luke warm. Would we stay again.....probably not.",3,2016,02,15
128,Good City Location,"Very pleasant hotel in the City. I stayed here for 3 nights recently and found the service very good. Their restaurant / pub adjacent to the hotel had a nice atmosphere and served good food. The room was a little dark despite having a lot of lights, and finding the light switches to turn them off at night was a treasure hunt. Would very happily stay again.",4,2016,02,15
128,Lovely hotel and great quiet location within very easy reach from tube,"We Had a very comfortable stay in a montcalm club room,Very clean with a great bed and a good size room.
Read that some people are not happy with the walk to the tube where as we on the other hand were very surprised how close it was!
Hermes toiletries what a bonus! Only other place we have stayed that provide these was a 5 star hotel in Dubai! All the staff were very helpful and friendly,the club lounge was ok but i would say out of all the club lounges i have been in that it was at the bottom of the scale,The staff in there were great and kept you topped up but the food was a bit lacking at times,especially the sandwiches and you expect a club lounge to be a private place to relax and not form part of a corridor for guests to walk through so for that i would say it takes away from the whole club lounge experience.
One other small note was on the website for our room type it said complementary soft drinks and beer in the minibar but these items were listed with a price on the minibar price list and no where did it say complementary,when i asked about this on leaving the lady i spoke to said that yes what it means is that they are the ones in your minibar? but why do you not just make this clearer the guests as this made me keep clear of the minibar all together as i wasn't sure!!
I would definitely stay here again though as in all it was a great hotel(great breakfast also in jugged hare)great location and exceptional staff who dealt with any niggles or requests promptly.",5,2016,02,15
128,Lovely hotel,"We like to stay here when we are treating ourselves, and really like this hotel. Stayed on weekend just gone, was really nice as always and staff can't do enough to help you. Really handy for anywhere in London as right by Barbican tube station. Will be staying again. My only tip would be do not park at the nearby Barbican car park (just in case you find it online like we did). You can pre purchase tickets on the internet for it at £8.50 a day, but when you get there they say ""we keep meaning to take that off the site as it isn't right"" and it will actually cost you £42 for your overnight stay!! We argued it and did not have to pay but others might not be so lucky. Please do not let this put anything off this wonderful hotel, just not sure where else to let others know about this car park con so they don't get caught out!",5,2016,02,14
128,What an amazing night.,"I booked a night at the hotel for valentines and contacted the hotel to see about getting some Champagne in the room. The staff (Alice in the Guest Experience department) were amazing, not only did we have the Champagne but also chocolates and a romantic turn down service with rose petals etc. And the crowning glory was an upgrade to one of the WOW Suites, huge four poster, Chesterfield sofa and an amazing bathroom, really could not have asked for any more. The whole staff made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived until we left. Will absolutely be coming back.",5,2016,02,14
128,Second fabulous birthday stay!,"Visited this hotel for the second time on Friday the 12th of February for my sons birthday. 
On arrival we were upgraded to a Barbican Duplex Suite room 135. This was on 2 split levels and the height of luxury! The hotel provided a popcorn treat for my sons birthday, which was a nice touch, and a personalized card.
Plentiful towels, and complimentary hermes toiletries. 
We had access to the club lounge, which served canapes,sandwiches and alcoholic beverages, between 5:30pm and 7:30pm. This was again with very friendly staff, nothing was any trouble. 
The following mornings breakfast was superb, with wonderful choice of food, and attentive staff. 
All the staff are a total credit to the hotel, from the doorman to reception. On departure, we have to say a special mention to VLAD and ALICE, who arranged for my son to bring some of the fresh flowers from the hotel display home, as a memento of our weekend.
We cant recommend this hotel highly enough, and can't wait for our next visit, hopefully at the end of April for our anniversary!

128,"Beautiful hotel and venue, customer service could use some help.","Stayed here for two nights with a colleague in Jan, the hotel it's self is lovely. We arrived at a bad time I think as there was a power cut in part of the hotel, the lady on the desk was polite but deffinatly required more training. She made quite a few mistakes but eventually the supervisor came to help. We had two really small rooms (I think due to the power cut). The rooms were small but had everything we needed. The beds were comfy and the shower was lovely. Over all I would recommend it. ",4,2016,02,14
128,Great hotel with helpful staff ,We enjoyed our 10 day stay at the Montcalm. The staff were very friendly and knew our names after the first day. The breakfasts are lush with The Jugged Hare staff very friendly and professional.  The rooms are comfortable and clean and overlook a beautiful old courtyard. We will definitely stay here again. It is also really well paced for business and tourism alike. ,4,2016,02,14
128,brewy fantastic,one of the best hotels I have stayed in staff very help full  will always go back to moutcalm at the brewery the porters were fantastic helped all the time room great the little detail made the stay they always put the customers first,5,2016,02,14
128,"Great hotel ,great vibe , wonderful happy staff .........5 star staff.","We spent a wonderful Friday night in the super club room, from the moment you first arrive you are greeted by happy, smiling staff who go out of their way to help and make your experience a VIP one.From Vlad the ultra helpful doorman to the wonderful reception staff . Thanks for making our stay with you such a special one.
We both loved how you set up the room for us on our evening return.
Many thanks once again and we look forward to returning soon.Ultra comfy bed too!

128,40th Birthday Treat ,Lovely lovely lovely - this a very special hotel. The hotel team are very professional and helpful. The room had a glazed bathroom with a screen when needed and the bed has to be the best I have slept in. We were surprised by a birthday card and cupcakes as a birthday treat - nice touch😊 You do need GPS to find your room which provided a lot of fun returning after a few drinks..... Our room gave us access to the lounge so you can enjoy free drinks and bar snacks - warning don't fill up before a meal !! The breakfast is served in the jugged hare go early as this is very busy !!! There's a good spread - buffet style and menu to order. I would stay again when we have something to celebrate 😁,5,2016,02,13
128,Professional,"It was a fantastic place, clean, professional staff, and was in a good location for me.  This would be a great place for a business trip.  The staff were very attentive and made me feel like I was a VIP guest.",5,2016,02,12
128,Amazing Value at a Quality Hotel,"Not usually one to write reviews but felt I had to take 5 minutes to rate this place. From start to finish this place is amazing value for money and staff can't do enough to help you. 
We were given an upgrade to a club room which was modern and luxurious, public areas were well designed and the breakfast is absolutely top notch. 
OK, the ""gym"" is pretty dire but who cares, I've got all week to train so forget about that and indulge in the flesh croissants at breakfast!
",5,2016,02,11
128,My Birthday room,"We stayed from the 26th December, and new it was my Birthday, so we got upgraded to the ""Wow"" suite, it was fantastic, the room was so luxurious, and bed so comfortable, we also used the Sauna and steam room. The breakfast was tasty and plenty to choose from.

Thanks to all of the staff, they were so helpful in making it the best stay ever.",5,2016,02,11
128,Large roooms,"We booked this room based on reports here of course and the good price (Good for London at least)
And we was not disapointed the rrom was large and the bathroom was also very large for a hotelroom in London.

But some details could be better. When in bed we heard the next door room flush their toilet not so nice.
The bathroom had floor heating but only worked on some parts and even for me the bed was to soft.

But a nice hotel",4,2016,02,11
128,Would definitely stay again ,"First impressions were fantastic, stunning hotel and friendly staff. However, once we got to our room we realised there must of been a mix up as we paid extra for one of the better suites which came with a few extras and a larger room. None of the extras were there and the room was tiny. My husband went down to sort it out and got told we had been upgraded (we had not) and said they would send the extras to our room. However, we wanted the room we had paid for. After speaking to them again they did put us in the correct room and apologised for the mix up. From then on we had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend. Clean room, spacious, powerful shower, very comfy bed and the breakfast was lovely in the morning. Plenty of choice. ",4,2016,02,11
128,Good location near Barbican ,This hotel has good quality rooms with a boutique feel. Much better than other large chain hotels.   Layout is confusing despite my frequent use as the rooms are seemingly across a range of older buildings  on different levels and via a range of lifts and stairs.  Breakfast at the jugged hare is good quality. Check in and out could do with speeding up with high numbers of staff with trainee badges. ,4,2016,02,11
128,Thank You Montcalm at the Brewery,"We returned again to celebrate my Birthday and treat ourselves to a Montcalm Club Room booked through the Montcalm Club only to find on arrival at our room that we had been upgraded and would be spending our weekend in a Barbican Duplex Suite along with complimentary cakes, wine and balloons! We are always made to feel special when we stay here but this weekend was something else. Appreciated the hand written card from the management welcoming us back. Thank you, you certainly went the extra mile on our behalf this trip.",5,2016,02,10
128,Lovely Hotel,"From arrival to departure my stay was excellent, one negative, breakfast on a weekend can be a bit chaotic due to the limited tables in the pub/restaurant,apart from that I can not fault. Would highly recommend",5,2016,02,09
128,In terms of a 'building' - the hotel is nice. Very disappointing service.,"I've stayed here a couple of times in the last few weeks. On the first occasion I quite liked it - the room was well furnished, albeit a little small compared to other London hotels in the same price range. Had a small issue on check out - due to a problem with printers couldn't get an invoice, but no-problem - one would be emailed to me. It took around 5 days and 3 chasing emails from me before that happened. But hey-ho, thought I'd give it a second chance.

However - the last stay felt like Fawlty Towers. On arriving at the hotel, I found out that I didn't have a room. I'd arrived quite late at night (had requested late arrival) and I suspect the hotel had sold the room. The solution was to transfer me to a sister hotel. Normally not a problem (other than the obvious inconvenience), but on this occasion I was travelling with colleagues and was hoping to get some work done in the lobby ...

After much discussion, I was put in a taxi and transferred. Actually the sister hotel (near Old Broad St.) is really cool - good modern rooms. They've replaced normal lightswitches with tablet devices to control curtains / lights / tv's etc.. Only issue - they weren't working, so couldn't turn lights on/off. So - ended up sleeping with the curtains open and the bedroom lights on, and had to shower in the dark .... chaos.

Oh - and on checkout - they couldn't print my invoice.

Won't be rushing back to this one.",2,2016,02,09
128,World-class,"This is a very impressive hotel that feels typically London-esque from the location to decor, it has character. This is my first stay at the Montcalm having never heard of it before... and I'm not a huge fan of London hotels in general. 

From the time you set foot in the hotel, the staff make you feel like an honoured guest. The overall professionalism and service is fantastic. 

The standard room is very well appointed, has all the amenities you need as a traveller including a very comfortable bed... extra blankets and pillows available. Quite spacious for a city hotel.

Breakfast is in the Jugged Hare ten seconds from the front of the hotel. Again, friendly staff, great service and a very pleasing breakfast.

I will certainly be back and would recommend to anyone.",5,2016,02,09
128,A great hotel at the side of the Barbican!,"I have stayed in lots of hotels in London and rarely go back to the same one twice but I really will with this one. The building is quirky, full of atmosphere and if you book a club room it is very spacious and luxurious. The staff were a delight, from Vlad at the front door, to all of the staff on reception.  The club rooms have access to a small private lounge that serves complementary drinks and snacks in the day and alcoholic drinks and canapes early evening - a really nice place to refuel and chill.  The beds were huge and very comfortable, the Hermes toiletries were gorgeous, the room was very clean and my husband loved the Sky sport channel in the room.  Breakfast is served in the jugged hare restaurant below the hotel and the food was excellent (although we did eat there in the evening and that wasn't quite as good an experience).  Would highly recommend and I understand they are building another hotel nearby and I look forward to trying that one out too!",5,2016,02,09
128,Weekend in London,"This hotel is above average from the moment you walk in until the time to leave!
Great staff who take time with you. We really liked Vlad the doorman who called us by name every time we left or returned & asked how our day had gone.
The room was a little small but ok. Nicely decorated with all the things you need.
The bathroom was very good.
We would definitely return for another visit!",4,2016,02,09
128,Londonbusiness trip,"Great service and amazing room. front desk staff were very friendly. Will use again in a few weeks.
Would have been better to have breakfast in main dining room as had to sit in club lounge which was located up a number of flights of stairs",5,2016,02,09
128,Quality and luxury,"Stayed for two nights at The Montcalm for pleasure purposes - in the heart of The City, but not that this was relevant as we were there at a weekend.  However, don't think that the location means it is deserted - Canary Wharf this is not!  It is a 1 minute walk to The Barbican, 5 mins to St Paul's and after that, the rest of London is there to take in.
Hotel was fantastic - the room was excellent (although if you are a light sleeper then don't sleep with a room overlooking the street as the windows are single glazed and it can be noisy).
Staff were fantastic and the room facilities were really good.
Breakfast (served in The Jugged Hare) was amongst the best we have had.  It should be said that the breakfast was better than the evening meal we had - The Jugged Hare is a much heralded restaurant, but frankly I couldn't understand why.The menu was OK, but the meal was probably about average, but only just.  I ordered the Venison and it was tasty, but the 'neets and tatties' were simply mash potato.  The starter menu was limited - more so if you don't like horseradish!  I opted for a pickled walnut/cheese/parsnip starter, that was simply a salad and wasn't great to be honest.  That set a disappointing tone - as did the rather surly girl who was on 'meet and greet' duty.  There is someone who appears to not enjoy her job and sees customers as an interference in her prime activity of flirting with the waiters.
That said - The Jugged Hare is really a separate entity to the hotel - so my advice would be, stay at the hotel, enjoy the breakfast, but go somewhere else for your evening meal.",4,2016,02,09
128,First time in London -- Highly recommended!,"Very nice place with in a great location. Stayed here for one night on a business trip and will surely come back. Great service, awesome staff and nicely kept room. Can't really come up with anything to complain about.",5,2016,02,08
128,"Cool, Calm, Collected at The Montcalm","This is without a doubt one of the best hotels I've ever experienced. Friendly staff, posh rooms, great bedding, a ridiculously large and well appointed bathroom with heated floor and heated towel racks, English tea and Nespresso espresso, and fine amenities at the Montcalm Club level including appetizers and drinks in the early evening. Breakfast at the Montcalm every morning was the best way to start a day of touring a great city. And the on site Jugged Hare pub provided the perfect way to end the day with a brewski or special cocktail. The hotel's location is perfect with easy access to the Barbicon Underground stop and just a half block from the Barbicon Theatre where we saw the Henriad (Four History Plays of Shakespeare) performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company. O. what. fun.",5,2016,02,08
128,Nice Hotel but not 5*,"Positive: Central location; good value for money when compared to avg London prices; comfortable bed; kindness of staff

Negative: Room was small and dark; bathroom way too small and no separate shower (in a 5* hotel I would expect it). Overall I would rate it a good 4* hotel, not a 5*",4,2016,02,08
128,fantastic review and great service,"really impressed with this hotel. We arrived before our official check in time, but the staff allowed us to check in and leave our bags, so we could go out and they put our bags into our room. Its in the financial part of London but easy access to both Barbican and Moorgate stations. Staff were so helpful, and the room was great. The big screen between the bathroom and the bedroom was fantastic - it meant you could watch TV on the toilet!",5,2016,02,08
128,The Brewery,"I spent a week at The Montcalm, Vlad was very helpful and delightful person. He remembered my name and provided great advice on restaurants, sites and daily activities. Thanks for a great visit and making me comfortable!",5,2016,02,08
128,Amazing service,"We treated ourselves for our 5th year anniversary and we were very pleased! At first as we had never been to such a luxury hotel we were quite intimidated but the staff made us very welcomed. Everything you could expect from a 5 star hotel, down to a pillow menu and in-room food delivery :-) The bed are the most amazing beds I have ever been in my life, and the bathroom with the rain shower was really nice! We had access to the Club Lounge, which was nice as we had in the evening access to free wine, beer, drinks and little snacks, which made us feel very special.  We will definitely be back one day as it was an amazing experience (and because I'd give anything to sleep in these beds again!!! :-) ). ",5,2016,02,07
128,Beautiful hotel in central London with helpful staff.,"The hotel is an amazing gem in central London (financial district) where it's peaceful at night.

The staff go beyond the extra mile; Simona in particular was keen to ensure our stay was more than magnificent. 

The rooms are of impeccable taste and the pillows are so soft offering an amazing sleep.

All in all a worthwhile stay with tube stations nearby and all the attractions of central London on your doorstep whilst retaining a calming and relaxing atmosphere.

Highly recommended.",5,2016,02,07
128,Business Trip,"I stayed at this lovely hotel last weekend. And I am very glad that I was able to do that. The rooms were amazing, the staff was very caring especially Diana. Also the options available for breakfast were absolutely exceptional. Even the location of the hotel is perfect with so much stuff to do and discover. So overall this is definitely one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in and I highly recommend it.",5,2016,02,06
128,Lovely!,"Stayed here for two nights in July 2015. Wedding anniversary treat. Lovely hotel, amazing breakfast, cooked to order. Enormous bed and very comfortable. Very friendly staff, made you feel very special. Such good value. We ate in the joining restaurant, which was expensive, but very high quality, so if it is a special occasion I would recommend it. Lots of lovely fresh fruit available. We were given some fancy cupcakes in our room as a treat for our anniversary which was a lovely personal touch and very much appreciated. This is a delightful hotel and I have no hesitation in highly recommending it. We are already planning on returning for a weekend stay later this year.",5,2016,02,05
128,as 4 stars indicates 'very good'.,"Had 2 days at the montcalm and had a lovely time. No major issues and the staff were lovely. A few little niggles with the property itself, but not enough to cause more than a moments 'grrrrr'. These included a loose carpet strip between bedroom and ensuite which both myself and my wife stubbed our toe on. The room has buttons to push for 'room to be serviced' which light up on the outside, because ours didnt light up we had to contact reception to organise the room to be cleaned. But as I say, nothing to concern me in the greater scheme of things. Will certainly return if appropriate.",4,2016,02,05
128,"If This Isn't the Best Hotel in the City of London, You Find a Better One Yourself","Start with the fact that the Montcalm's team are all on the same page. Serving the guest is not a job, it's a calling. You've flown overnight from the States, but your luggage didn't make the trip. You've ridden the Heathrow Express to Paddington, trudged to the Hammersmith line, ridden it the wrong way for a stop or two, gotten off at Moorgate and trudged a few blocks to this hotel. And from your first step in the door, you're taken care of. To say the Montcalm is charming falls short of what the guest experiences. The 19th Century structure, its brickwork, its corners and alcoves, its courtyard place you such that you now that you're in London, and not merely Anywhere. The rooms are comfortable, equipped with sufficient outlets (this can be an issue in London) and very spacious for the price range in which the Montcalm competes. They offer a continental breakfast. In some hotels that means some baked goods from a Tesco warehouse, watery juice, and three types of Kellogg's cereal. At the Montcalm, yes to the Kellogg's, but baked goods that were crafted by actual human beings, but add fine Scottish cold smoked salmon, prosciutto and other cold sausage - pretty much everything except eggs. I had a ground floor room facing the sidewalk that was QUIET. This is a hotel that does the little things well. But it's the sense that the place, the people, and the philosophy that guides the business day to day function together as a seamless whole. As a business traveler, I can ask for no better. As a guest, I felt at home.",5,2016,02,04
128,"Beautiful Room, Fantastic Service, Rubbish View","I was very pleased with my stay at the Montcalm.  The check-in experience was fast and efficient, and I appreciated being shown to my room which ended up being across Chiswell street.  The room was very well appointed, a comfortable bed, a nice desk, a helpful kitchenette and a fantastic bathroom.  The bathroom was equipped with an extra-long bathtub with a rainfall shower head.  It was brilliant!

My view outside my room was of the rubbish bins (hence the title of my review).  I can't be fussed to have a view in London anyways, most rooms don't have one, I just thought it was funny that the bins were right outside my window.  

Otherwise a fantastic stay.  Breakfast at the Jugged Hare was excellent as well.",5,2016,02,04
128,Old fashion charm with contemporary facilities ,"Ultimate experience. Wonderful welcome.came with my son for his graduation at the Barbican.The best location.West end 10 minutes,right in the centre of the city.Club rooms and suites wonderful and the facility of the Club Room a great attribute. Only issue was check time was 2pm but it was 3.30pm before the room was ready.Suggest they move check in to 4pm to change expectations. Best to order breakfast in the room before retiring as the queue for breakfast was a bit too long.
Thoroughly recommended and I will be back.",5,2016,02,04
128,Superb,"I was moved from Montcalm Shoreditch to Montcalm Brewery, as there was an electric fault at the Shoreditch hotel. The Montcalm at the Brewery was simply superb!

The building is absolutely stunning and maintained to a very high standard. 

The food was ok, I'm not a fan of pork belly but it was an awards do so I'm sure they had catering in. 

Staff friendly. Over all very impressed. A fantastic day shared within a place offering a great atmosphere ",4,2016,02,03
128,The Montcalm at the Brewery London City,"Outstanding welcoming Cristina and George where fantastic with big smile and really helpful tips. professional staff, attention to details, beautiful building.

The sliding curtains in the bad room was very cool:)
 Montcalm is the best:) we will be back",5,2016,02,03
128,Business Trip,"I stayed at the Montcalm brewery for 2 nights in Jan, what a disappointment. Firstly they messed up my reservation, had to refund the original card then take payment from my card, half an hour later changed their minds and refunded my card(which I am still waiting on), the TV didn't work and none of the 'perks' I was promised were there...I also had to leave the hotel if I wanted any breakfast!",3,2016,02,03
128,Excellent London base,"We stayed here one night between Xmas and new year. Great for us travelling into Kings Cross and going out between City and West End. We've also stayed at M by Montcalm in Shoreditch and loved that location too. Great value for money! Lovely hotel, super friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable! modern room. My only little moan is navigating your way around the hotel to find your room is a bit of a challenge as its on different levels and areas of a very old building - and we got lost! Highly recommend ",5,2016,02,03
128,Montcalm at the Brewery,"I have stayed numerous times on overnight trips and always found the hotel staff friendly, courteous and helpful, this is rare nowadays when alot of hotels lack that personal touch and contact, in fact lack staff at all.
The rooms are generous and charming, warm and tasteful, the beds wonderful, pillows scented and bathrooms great.
My only slight criticism is that the rooms have small windows so lack natural light and have a bewildering array of light switches for the large variety of lights which takes about 10 minutes to turn off before going to sleep.",4,2016,02,03
128,Great Experience,"Staff was very welcoming and helpful. The staff was ready for anything even on a very busy day like New Years. They got us to our rooms even though we were a bit early for check in. Only problem was that room service took a little longer than it should have. Overall, great staff and hotel ",5,2016,02,02
128,5 points for the staff,"All staff members were helpful and friendly, good that there is always somebody who will listen to you at the reception. The decor and rooms are certainly very attractive, the club lounge very pleasant when not overcrowded and I loved the toiletries. As I got a wonderful rate, the slight feeling of shortage of space (from room to bed to wardrobe) can be overlooked.",5,2016,02,02
128,"Business or liesure, it's my default choice.","I'm a frequent visitor to the Montcalm and use it for Business and Leisure and it suits both purposes wonderfully. 

In January, I visited with my son(3yrs) and from arriving at the hotel, he was made to feel very special. Vlad(doorman) remembered my son by name from an earlier visit and asked him what he was looking forward to etc. Our room was available early and was upgraded. 

Upon returning from a little sightseeing, we were delighted to find a couple of cupcakes and a handwritten note to my son wishing him a great time. This was followed shortly thereafter by a knock on the door and one of the housekeeping team delighting my son with balloons and a Montcalm teddy. He had a lovely time as did I.

While the hotel is right in the City and perfect for business, it's the visits I've had with my family which make it particularly memorable and see me return regularly. The staff go out of their way to make the stay enjoyable which, on top of the location and great rooms makes this my primary choice when in town.",5,2016,02,02
128,ありがとうございます!,"Hi Montcalm Brewery London City, 

Good stay last weekend, we laugh good with team and hilal. So 5 stars. Very good checkout and very helpful with luggage. Very friendly even though my english not good! 

Will come back soon!

ありがとうございます!

Arigato gozaimas!

128,Contemporary luxury,"Stayed here for business visit as it's ideal location for my office in Liverpool Street which is walking distance from here. Since it is by nature a busy hotel with lots of corporates near by so I guess it must be prefers hotel for few. Nevertheless,the hotel rooms are of contemporary nature as it a converted brewery. But the hotel gives a very Victorian look. Service is over all good with efficient staff at check in. Didn't had breakfast but i guess a take away breakfast option would be great for corporates who are in rush. 

I have stayed in other chain hotels like Hilton who do have the option of online check in which is very handy for busy corporates. 

",5,2016,02,01
128,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here with my girlfriend to celebrate our 11th year anniversary together. On first impressions the hotel is very smart and clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful.
I had booked the Montcalm club room with breakfast included.
The room was very nice and a good size with a large bed the bathroom was also very nice with a heated floor (only around the toilet though)
Breakfast is severed in the pub just outside the hotel and has a large selection from cereals fruits fresh pastries to cooked breakfast and all was very good.

A few bad points about our stay at the Montcalm
1, Our room was freezing cold after about half an hour I realised there was a window open in our room being only about 5 degree outside this made the room very cold and it never seemed to warm up over our stay.

2, When checking in we were told that breakfast was not included in our stay and I had to prove that it was by showing my booking confirmation.

3, There was a black mascara stain on the white bed covers.

4, Both bathrobes had no ties on them I found this a bit odd.

I know a few of these points are only minor things but this is a 5 star hotel and you don't expect them.

Over all our stay at the Montcalm hotel was nice and would rate 4 out of 5. 
",4,2016,02,01
128,Amazing hotel with excellent staff,"The hotel is located 7-8 minutes away from a tube station which was handy. We were welcomed with a refreshing welcome drink which was a great start. From checking in til checking out, Valerio was helpful, kind and generous; gave us an upgrade being a special occasion. A lovely hotel and the staff really makes it even more special. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2016,02,01
128,Fantastic Hotel,"A former Brewery this hotel has been really well converted, check in was friendly and painless and the room was available well before the check in time. Opted for a club room which was £130 on a Saturdays night and included breakfast. The room was very spacious especially for a London hotel with a lovely bathroom. Hotel staff are a credit to the hotel friendly polite and nothing is to much trouble. Breakfast is served in the pub on the corner of the hotel and is the best breakfast i have had in a long time, buffet style so you can help yourself. A first class hotel which doesn't disappoint.",5,2016,02,01
128,Wonderful,"Spent two nights at the Brewery for my Wife's birthday treat visit to London.
Lovely welcome by front of house everyone very attentive, Our room was in the south wing had everything you would need comfortable bed good shower.
Breakfast in the Jugged Hare was very good.
On the Friday night we dined at the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms we recommend a visit the meal was wonderful.",4,2016,01,31
128,Anniversary ,"Amazing stay from the moment we walked in the door, was upgraded to the wow suite and Wow it is. Breakfast was hot and was made to order if required.
We spent 2 nights and could not fault the hotel and staff. A glamorous hotel but still had that cosy family feeling, very welcoming. We could not thank you enough for your hospitality and will look forward to visiting again soon. ",5,2016,01,31
128,Would have liked to stay longer,"We needed a weekend overnight stay in London and I try and avoid the usual chains. This place is quite unique, the convertion from a brewery (several hundred years old) has been very cleverly done. All the staff, without exception, were very helpful, and there were always someone available (without pestering you).
As we had little time to spare we weren't able to sample very many of the facilities, but a lightening tour was rather impressive. The breakfast was the only meal we had and that was very good indeed. The facilities and supplies in the bedroom were all of a high standard and it was difficult to think of anything that was missing.
I think that the final bill came to about five pounds more than one of the ""cheap"" chains would have been!
I would certainly recommend it to anyone who appreciates something a little different.",5,2016,01,31
128,Visiting O2 with Montcalm at brewery. ,"We were visiting concert in o2 arena and decided to stay here with a group of friends based on some mixed reviews, so didn't knew what was coming through. 
Arrival was smooth and quick though it was busy with people all around. The welcoming door man offering his assistance as soon as we stepped in was a good gesture. The room was nice and clean with a good selection of toiletries by Hermes. 

Next day breakfast was busy but again good selection of items had it been a little bigger space that would have been even better. 

The staff at check out were very pleasant and efficient who were keen to get our feedback and gave us the feedback card by trip advisor which I guess is a good reminder. 

All in all a good stay with good service. Will be back. ",5,2016,01,31
128,More 4 star than five star ,"Had high hopes for this hotel. Good location, but not five star. We had a Club room, it was very dark due to a tiny window at floor level and bad lighting & the room was in average condition. Although breakfast items were of a good standard its served in the small pub room below. There are nowhere near enough tables & we had to wait 25 mins just to get seated. For these reasons cannot describe it as 5 star, hence why I give it 3 stars!",3,2016,01,31
128,Very good Experience ,"Stayed for 1 night as our anniversary date night out. Very welcoming hotel, front of house manger and his staff were fantastic. Good room and very efficient service. Worth a visit once if you are considering and like us you won't be disappointed.",5,2016,01,30
128,not the standard you would expect,"I was there, as my standard hotel was not available at that time.

Special architecture, which makes it difficult to cater for clients.
Small, unspectacular room.

Not to be recommended.
Fortunately I was there for only one night.",3,2016,01,30
128,Unique hotel and grounds,"Staying in a hotel in London will always be an expensive experience, but this hotel is a great choice due to its unique nature. We stayed in the South Wing and it was very quiet. The hotel buildings that formed the old brewery are very attractive and I really liked the cobblestone courtyard (that they stop cars from using). We stayed in a club room and it was what you would expect. The staff were friendly and helpful. We tried breakfast in both the club room and the Jugged Hair pub. The club room breakfast is only continental, so the pub offers more - but I really enjoyed both.
Really what I love about the hotel is the old building and the history.",5,2016,01,29
128,Fabulous hotel with outstanding customer service,"Fantastic club room where we made full use of the club lounge facility: worth paying more for the larger room and these additional facilities.  Staff were absolutely excellent and couldn't do enough to help, especially in the club lounge.  Dining in the Jugged Hare at evening was also superb.",5,2016,01,27
128,Husbands 60th birthday treat,"The weekend started extremely well as we arrived at the hotel very early and we were able to access our room. We cleaned ourselves up after our journey and proceeded to exploring the area we were in. unfortunately it went downhill after that. If you wanted to see a show at the Barbican you are perfectly positioned but not much else. We were not advised this was an office area so everything was catered for Monday to Friday only. The dining room attached to the hotel did not open at weekends. The Jugged Hare pub was where the breakfast and evening meals were served on the Saturday. Unfortunately for us they had won some sort of award and on the Sunday they closed for a staff party to celebrate. The last booking was 5pm and by the time we found out it was fully booked.
Outside restaurants were also  closed so we ended up going to a local supermarket for picnic food for our evening meal. We had a top priced room so we had the club lounge but it was totally full to bursting as there was nowhere else. It cost us over £200 in taxi fares over the weekend so it turned out to be a very expensive and disappointing weekend.",3,2016,01,26
128,Bad Experience,"I stayed at the Montcalm for 4 nights last week. While overall experience was OK, they need immediate help with their front desk team. Here is the break down:

The Good:
1. Location is great, 10min. walking to barbican and old st. subway stations. Tesco one block down the corner and a couple decent eatery options around.
2. Clean rooms
3. Good breakfast, which is either served within the hotel or a bar called Jugged Hare down the street. Good variety for a breakfast such as: bacon, eggs, sausage, various bakery snacks, fruits, cheese, lox etc..

The Bad
1. Rooms are very dark (Stayed at the club room) with a tiny window - the lack of lighting makes the room (even when the lights are switched on) feel like a mini dungeon
2. A/C unit somehow would not heat up the room as much as I would have hoped - the week we stayed at this hotel, the weather was pretty cold
3. Cleaning staff: their cleaning staff can't speak english. I had one lady come in to clean my room but she spoke no english which made things difficult because I wanted to ask her to come in later and that I was busy in the room at the time. No success...The HR person at this hotel must be trying to cut some cost...

The Worst 
1. Front Desk...I do not even know where to start from. They all sounded and acted unexperienced. They cannot get their work done. You have to explain yourself multiple times. They all sounded like they started their jobs that day. I have to particularly drop a name here...Mark, the front desk supervisor. Either him or his boss should be lectured about ""CUSTOMER SERVICE 101"". After staying 3 nights, our stay needed to be extended and it was all done through the company. Although I had a +1 day reservation on the same room, Mark could not find my reservation and said that on the system it was my check out day and tried to convince me that the hotel was all booked - including my room and that they cannot accommodate me. I repeatedly told him that I have a booking and that he needed to check in the system or with someone. He gave me quite the ""hard to get"" attitude for the hotel before I had to pick up my cell phone and show him a confirmation. Then, suddenly, the same hotel that was ""All booked"" became available and my room was granted to me for one more night. When I asked him why he told me everything was booked earlier, he had no response. I do not know how these employees are trained. This hotel management should spend more money on training then the guy they pay to open the hotel door to guests...Seriously, there is a gentlemen (in fact many) whose sole job is to stand by the door all day to pull the door for the guests. Really? Finance should reallocate some of the money to ""more professional"" front desk staff...",3,2016,01,26
128,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10 year wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to the Wow Suite which was amazing and the complementary champagne a very welcome surprise.  
The room was fabulous with a large comfy four poster bed; the Club Lounge was lovely to have a drink and canapés and the hotel is a lovely maze of rooms with history but very modern. The staff were great and very friendly - the couple of times we did need help (getting the coffee machine to work) they cane quickly and were courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend it. Breakfast was very tasty too in the pub next door and served until 10am which was a good bonus!",5,2016,01,25
128,Very nice indeed!,"Central to the business area of London, though not a problem, meant it was quiet on a Saturday night. An old brewery so lovely roomy areas in brick.  We were going to the Museum of London, 5-10 min walk, very close, and then to a Jack the Ripper walk in Whitechapel, again close. Very modern, very clean, smallish room but fine as we were only sleeping there one night. Very polite and accommodating staff. All amenities in the room, lovely bathroom and shower. A lovely getaway in darkest January!",5,2016,01,25
128,Excellent,"I've never experienced a hotel like the Brewery and I honestly have the say it's the best one me and my partner have ever been to. We definitely plan on coming again in the future, but in summary amazing rooms, hospitality from the staff, good location and just an overall great place to celebrate something or relax.",5,2016,01,25
128,One nighter,"Like others say, the hotel is a maze of corridors, and is easy to get lost in. But it is a lovely place. The staff were extremely courteous at checkin, checkout and throughout our short stay. The area is actually rather quiet (which was a surprise), the room was clean, the bed comfortable, and breakfast exceptional. Breakfast at weekends can be manic and we were required to eat in the pub which adjoins the restaurant, but the staff remained attentive. We saw no kids and nothing that even resembled a stag/hen weekend, and nobody in sports clothes and trainers either - so another bonus/plus! We would definitely return.",5,2016,01,25
128,could learn from premier inn,"Dear sir
           Me and my wife had planned a getaway to London since before Christmas,thought we would stay somewhere special and make a weekend of it.
 We decided on  ' the brewery' montcalm in London city.we booked to stay in a deluxe double room on Sat 23rd Jan..Booked in the staff was all great,got shown our room 012 when we got in we could hear a noise coming from outside the window but we was shattered after our travel down and a day in the city
 The noise just carried on ....and on...and on...all night .There is a large air con unit right outside the window going 24/7.At 2 in the morning it was unbearable .You are supposed to be a 5 star hotel this was so shoddy ,,this room would not be in a Premier Inn .In fact a Premier Inn states ""a good night sleep or your money back""you cant do this as you would lose cash from room 012.
 Also if you look behind the kettle in the room you will see a series of vertical cutouts in the panneling these have NEVER been dusted EVER .Also the shower screen dose not fit to the bath so if you shower it runs on the floor.So we went for the bath option ...It says turn an pull........we did the blooming thing came off in our hand .Its laughable really you have the smart foyer,good staff but you are rubbish at the basics,just rubbish
Why didn't we complain .The noise didnt wake me till 2am (what would you have done then) ,
You are a 5star hotel,,all we wanted was a room without a load of metal ducting outside the window making a noise all night ,a clean room ,and washing facilities that work.This cost me alot of money a spoilt a special weekend.
 Hope to hear a reaction to my comments.

128,Weekend Trip,"Stayed at the Brewery prior to Christmas and had a lovely time Xmas shopping and a meal out in Covent Garden. The hotel is a maze of corridors, easy to get lost but a lovely place. Would return for sure another weekend in London.",4,2016,01,24
128,Nice,"The staff was extremely courteous at checkin and checkout - my only times for interaction.  The room itself was fine - clean, comfortable bed, etc. - but being in the south wing, I needed to take 2 separate elevators and walk a bit more before even getting to my floor in the assigned wing.   Given the pricing and proximity to my office, I would consider a return stay, but only if I could get a room that more conveniently situated.",4,2016,01,24
128,Awesome hotel.,"Great hotel, great rooms, great location in the London city. I booked the hotel for a business trip - the conference was right inside the brewery. The room was super nice and calm and i felt right at home. The pub inside the building has excellent food.",5,2016,01,24
128,"great value hotel, with some history attached.","We had a great stay here for my wife's birthday:- we were upgraded to a montcalm club and had a few goodies in the room which was a nice touch, also good value.
The room was nice, very clean and tidy, although the bed was a little on the small side, also there is not much clothes storage space.
Quiet at weekends as the hotel is located in the business district and no one is at work, although unusually a lot of the surrounding pubs and restaurants are closed too.The Jugged Hare attached to the hotel is really good gastro pub, great food and a very relaxed atmosphere. We never tried Chiswell street dining rooms as it is closed at weekend.
We had English breakfast included in the Hare which was very good.
All the staff were friendly and helpful, both in the hotel and the pub

Negatives:- The hotel is built in the old Whitbread brewery, which adds a bit of character, but its a bit of a maze of corridors and stairs, so may not be ideal for older clients. Also the part which I would have been most interested to look in (the brewery itself and the tun and vats etc) is owned separately and although attached is 'out of bounds' or so the rather proud of himself doorman in a bowler hat told me when I was having a look round, I was almost ushered away!
Expecting to have a quiet nightcap after the theatre, we found that there was no residents bar/lounge as such just a seating area in the foyer where staff would serve drinks.
Overall I would say that the hotel is very good and trying hard to be a 5 star but lacking in some areas.",4,2016,01,21
128,A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff,"We stayed one night in a Deluxe Room and loved it. As per the pre-arrival form, the room had the delicate scent i selected and a specific type of pillows - which by the way were very comfortable. I had a lovely night's sleep - the room was extremely quiet and the beds were very tall and comfortable. The deluxe rooms are on the other side of the road, and are in the same buildings as the suites. I think there were about maybe six different suite/deluxe buildings, each with their own mini reception. 

When checking in, the staff was incredibly nice and very friendly. We arrived around 5pm and when we got into our room, the housekeeping team had already passed by for the turndown service. All was cozy and nice! We requested a room with a bath, and the bath had a giant shower-head fitted to the ceiling - it was amazing! 

All in all, it was a very nice stay. I will definitely be back! Thank you for the lovely weekend!",5,2016,01,21
128,"Luxurious, but only so far","The Montcalm is advertised a five star hotel. It is located in a beautiful building, an eighteenth century brewery, and is in the City, which is convenient. It feells like a boutique hotel, but it has over 200 rooms, so it really is quite big. The room was excellent: great bed, very comfortable sleep, nice decoration in the hotelly way. The bathroom was of a good size, with lots of nice touches and good products. Good minibar too, which is lucky. All in all, the room was very nice. My problem with the hotel is that for a supposed five star hotel it rather lacks five star amenities. We were staying a Saturday night, and that night the only bar and restaurant was the Jugged Hare. This is an excellent gastro pub, good enough to be a destination in itself. I've eaten there many times: the best roast widgeon in the business. But it isn't a quiet place, and what we really needed after checking in late on Saturday was a quiet cocktail bar. And there isn't one at the Montcalm. That's a pity.",4,2016,01,20
128,Fabulous welcoming hotel.,"We booked the hotel through their website very easily and got a much better deal than on travel websites.
The Brewery was recommended to me by my sister and I wanted somewhere special  to stay whilst in London to celebrate my recent retirement.
The hotel is a short 5 minutes walk from the Barbican Tube Station so really easy to get to. On our arrival all the staff were very welcoming, they also congratulated me on my retirement and gave us a complimentary room upgrade. A lovely surprise to start the weekend! Our room was beautiful and filled with lots of luxury extras such as an expresso machine, an aroma machine, a state of the art bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The thoughtful staff had also left a hand written card, balloons and a bottle of wine to start my celebrations. We also had access to the club lounge where we could have complimentary canapes and drinks every evening up till 730. The drinks were premium brands and were served by very cheerful attentive staff. A great way to start your evening.
There are lots of things to see and do within a short walk of the hotel with great cafes and pubs close by.
The breakfast was delicious and of very high quality.
We really enjoyed our weekend and would highly recommend this luxurious and very welcoming hotel. The wonderful staff should be congratulated for going that extra mile to delight their customers!",5,2016,01,20
128,Amazing!,"The staff and facilities at this hotel were simply fantastic! We stayed in the Club Room where we received complimentary champagne, wine and sweets! We had explained that the nature of our visit was for a birthday and the room had been decorated with balloons, cakes and even a birthday card! I'm only sad we couldn't have stayed for longer and we'll certainly be making another visit! One of my friends is already planning a trip after our recommendation! Such a lovely, wonderful stay made that bot extra special by attentive staff!",5,2016,01,20
128,Fantastic,"Fantastic experience from start to finish. You couldn't meet more helpful or friendlier staff. When they found out it was a special occasion they kindly decorated our room while we were out, we were amazed :) I, stupidly, left a bag behind in the room after checkout and they have kindly offered to post it to me, I'm extremely grateful! fantastic location too, highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,01,18
128,Highly recommended,"From the moment we arrived my husband and I knew we'd checked into the city's best kept secret. The staff were most helpful, splendid rooms finished off the next day by an amazing breakfast and all a quick cab ride away from the West end or a short stroll into Shoreditch......Fabulous",5,2016,01,18
128,"Great beds, showers and a hearty breakfast to start the day well.","After encountering a glitch with their website we booked a double club room directly with the Montcalm front desk. I was informed that confirmation would be sent directly to my mailbox. It didnt arrive, and I had to chase it up a number of times. When confirmation arrrived it was for twin beds initially, then it was changed to a queen sized bed! After a number of emails and telephone calls we got confirmation of a king sized bed - a welcome upgrade!  All correspondence was courteous from start to finish and our Montcalm Room (no 207) was great.   It was spacious enough for an extra single bed for our son, it was bright with large windows overlooking the road and facing a gymnasium. It was very quite and dark at night and we all slept soundly - the beds and pillows are wonderful. Breakfast was served up until 11am and was a comfortable pleasurable experience with marvellous attentive staff. The staff are all very polite and professional and derserve commending. We enjoyed our stay 2 night stay and will certainly rebook when in London again.",5,2016,01,18
128,"Stylish Hotel, quirky shower!","Beautiful hotel, very stylish and the staff were very helpful.  Interesting shower, with glass wall into the bedroom...... could be your thing or maybe not.
The rooms very comfortable and well equipped.  Would come back, (they do have an blind on the shower if you prefer your modesty!).",5,2016,01,18
128,Lovely place to stay,"From the very beginning of my stay (check-in) I knew that I’d enjoy my short holiday at the Montcalm at the Brewery.  The staff were extremely courteous, helpful and attentive.  The room had everything I needed and the bed was very comfortable.  The location was perfect for my purposes.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - I will certainly be going back.",5,2016,01,17
128,5* hotel and service,"Stayed here on NYE for my girlfriends birthday. We got the birthday package which included champagne, cupcakes and even a room upgrade. Soon as I checked even the manager came an introduced herself. The staff were very polite and friendly from the start to finish of the trip. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying again. ",5,2016,01,17
128,Without doubt our favourite new Hotel!,"You are made to feel special from the moment you walk through the door.  The wonderful staff feel very real and personal.  I have been to hotel after hotel where (no matter star rating) the check in and out experience feels like a tired out routine - but at the Montcalm it was genuinely a very nice experience.  The whole experience from start to finish was truly a joy.  My wife and i had planned to go out for the evening before we arrived - but we didnt because our room, the club lounge and the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms were just too good... we both decided we wanted to stay in the Hotel.  This is definitely not just a bed for the night - thank you Alice and all the staff for making it a fantastic night - only negative point is that we couldnt stay for longer!",5,2016,01,17
128,Beautiful Hotel; Most Comfortable Bed We've Ever Slept In!,"Had a amazing stay in this hotel. Staff were very helpful. Lovely feel to the hotel, and had a lovely breakfast at the attached pub the Jugged Hare. Very close to Barbican tube station, took 15 minutes to get to West End.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,01,17
128,Spoil yourself,"Great hotel. Great location for the Barbican, CIty of London Guildhall ( worth a visit & it's free,) St Pauls not too far. Spitalfields Mkt, Brick Lane, Petticoat Lane...and more.. Rooms a Modern, Beds super comfy. Free wifi. Big telly. Mood Lighting. Two Restaurants are within the hotel, ' The Jugged Hare' ( Also where you get your hearty Full English ) & ' The Dining Room ' Both were busy when we went so we wandered 5 mins walk to a lovely Turk/cypriot/ Mediterranean mix match Restaurant which was lovely and very reasonable- ' The Iskele ' was a nice casual atmosphere too.  What made the stay so nice were the fantastic staff headed by the Lovely Alice. Thank you and we look forward to coming again soon. Regards. Peter & Karen R320",5,2016,01,17
128,Amazing!!,"Unbelievably friendly staff, so helpful and upon finding out it was our first anniversary they left us this in our room after a day out in beautiful London, I would recommend everyone to stay here also very close to two tube stations, I can't possibly say enough about this hotel, amazing! ",5,2016,01,17
128,West End and Barbican,Great hotel and interesting building retaining many of original features.  Lovely chandeliers in most of the main areas and very helpful staff.  Excellent breakfast selection in the Jugged Hare.  Quiet location even considering how convenient the location is for many attractions.,5,2016,01,17
128,Stay in you love the smell of hamster saw dust,"We didnt book to stay here, we had booked the sister hotel the Brewery. When checking in they told us they had ""upgraded"" us to this hotel. Fortunately we had our car as it was a 15 minute walk on a bitterly cold night. To make things ""easier"" we were asked to check in at the original hotel & the keys would be waiting for us at the new hotel.
On arrival at the new hotel, we had to check in again & were told I'd left my card behind at the other hotel. Technically I hadnt left my card behind, they hadn't given it back. After some discussion, they relunctantly agreed to send the card over as I hadnt chosen to move hotel or check in twice. They had ""upgraded"" us to a club room, however as standard this comes with breakfast but we still had this excluded. The room we were given smells like a hamster cage, is opposite the lift & is a disabled room. In short, not an upgrade but a down grade from what we would have got. There are much nicer hotels with far better service in London & I would recommend staying at those instead",1,2016,01,16
128,Superb value,"My wife and I stayed here while we visiting our daughter I'm East London. It's a wonderful hotel. Situated in an interesting and historic building, the rooms are beautifully and luxuriously appointee. The facilities are excellent. And the service is first class. Because it's not in central London (but in close distance to the centre)', it's not nearly as expensive as you might expect. It's certainly much better, in every way, than other, much more expensive hotels closer to the centre where we've stayed.",5,2016,01,16
128,Nice hotel ,"Very well located if you need to stay in the City area. The breakfast is served in a pub close to the hotel but it is really reach and of an excellent quality. The hotel is nice and the staff is really helpful and kind but at least with reference to my booking I'm not convinced about the value for money, given the very high rate for the rooms. ",4,2016,01,15
128,Barbican neighbour,"With tickets for Richard II we choose to stay here for our one night stay given its proximity to the theatre. Just two minutes away it proved a great decision with a very reasonable room rate that included breakfast and access to the club room.

The bedroom was large and well equipped with a very comfortable bed. The club room provided a great continental breakfast after arriving off the overnight sleeper and some drinks before we went for a pre theatre meal at the embedded corner bar. The only disappointment was that despite getting to the club room 1/2 hour prior to closing time in the evening there was no drinks available nor staff to enquire as to why that was the case.

The hotel arranged an early check in and the room was reasonably close to the reception as my wife uses a stick but the nature of the original building does mean a fair bit of walking and stairs. The Barbican tube station is only a short walk away but as the area is in the heart of the financial district it does have a 'dead' feel about it at the weekend.

All staff were very helpful and friendly and made our stay most highly enjoyable. 

",5,2016,01,14
128,Superb.,"Stayed here for a post Christmas night in the city. Less than a 10 min straight walk. The hotel has a stunning reception. We were welcomed in by a concierge, who also offered to help carry our luggage. We were early for check in, but the reception staff were extremely helpful, and checked us into our room. We were shown to our room by one of the staff, and all of the hotel facilities explained to us. The room itself was a little small, but perfectly adequate, and very nicely decorated. The bed was comfy, and we had no complaints. I did get the room at a good rate and it was a nice experience. The service was impeccable throughout. The Jugged Hair is a great gastro pub.",5,2016,01,14
128,Truly Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommended - Great Staff,"I have had the pleasure of staying at the Montcalm at the Brewery on several occasions over recent months.

I cannot rate the hotel highly enough.  It is truly a pleasure to stay when I am in London.

Firstly I would like to thank all the staff at the hotel.  Everyone whom I've come across from the front desk, concierge, guest relations, restaurant staff, all have been absolutely fantastic.  I can't remember everyone's name but a particular thanks to Laura and Krystina on reception, Vlad Head of Concierge who has been extremely helpful, Alice and Laura in guest relations, the front door staff and not least Simona who has ensured each stay has been truly fantastic.

All the hotel rooms are extremely comfortable with plenty of amenities including complimentary mineral water, a platter of fresh fruit etc. If you are a regular guest there may also be an extra something from time to time which is a nice touch.

Both restaurants that adjoin to the hotel are fantastic - the Jugged Hare which is more of a Gastropub and the Chiswell St Dining rooms which is more of a traditional 'fine dining' restaurant which is my preference both serving really great food.

If you are looking for a hotel in the area I genuinely cannot recommend this hotel enough.  There are plenty of other options, and I have tried several, but there is a reason I keep returning to the Montcalm at the Brewery.

Thanks once again and I look forward to my next stay.",5,2016,01,14
128,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here as it was conveniently near the Barbican tube station. Less than a 10 min straight walk. 
The hotel has a beautiful reception, and we were welcomed in by a concierge, who also offered to help carry our luggage. 
We were a couple of hours early for check in, but the reception desk staff were extremely polite and helpful, and even managed to get us checked into our room. 
We were shown to our room by one of the staff, and all of the hotel facilities explained to us.
The room itself was a little small, but perfectly adequate, and nicely decorated. 
The bed was comfy, and we had no complaints.
I did get the room at a good rate, and it was a nice experience, but not sure I'd be willing to pay the full asking price if I was to stay here again, just due to the room being a bit underwhelming for a 5 star. 
Must say that the service was impeccable throughout. ",5,2016,01,13
128,Beautiful but small,"I stayed here last December with my husband while on holiday and had a great time. Since we came in late December the hotel was decorated beautifully. The concierge and the hotel staff were always very friendly and assisted us with directions when we needed them. The restaurant that is located on site was undergoing some construction, so we did not have a chance to eat there. The room was very lovely and clean, although the space was very tiny and we even upgraded to ensure a bigger room. Since we were celebrating our anniversary the hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and some fruit, which was very thoughtful. Overall it was an wonderful stay but only tip would be is you are use to hotels in the U.S.A. the size of these rooms do not compare.",4,2016,01,12
128,"Nice, but not as convenient as expected","I stayed for 3 nights here while visiting a friend in London.  Overall, all staff interactions here were lovely and the room was completely satisfactory for being so central- not huge, but lots of nice amenities.  The shower was great, the bed was comfortable.  I ordered room service one night and while prompt, the food was just ok.  

Major downsides included distance to the tube- it was a further walk than expected, and honestly i felt somewhat uncomfortable walking here late at night as a single woman.  It's a financial district so completely empty on weekends- even nearby coffee shops were closed.

Also, and this may be nitpicking, but it really bothered me- the toiletries smelled awful.  Just like the worst strong, heavy cologne scent.  I tried to use the shampoo the first day and almost gagged at the strong odor.  And then noticed it on other guests throughout my stay.  it was overpowering.",3,2016,01,12
128,Great for Event Delegates for next door,Was working next door at the Brewery (keynote session on customers and customer service) and this was bang next door. Everything pretty much as it should be at London prices. Nothing to grumble about.,4,2016,01,12
128,Thanks,"Travel weekly to London and often stay here. The reception staff are very friendly and recognise a regular visitor without needing a name. As are the Club Lounge breakfast team. Occasional upgrades are a treat, I like the quirky rooms at the Montcalm - many different layouts & sizes. Recently in 137, a duplex which would have been great for a personal visit as I wasn't around long enough to fully enjoy it!",5,2016,01,11
128,Wedding Night,"We stayed over at The Montcalm for our wedding night as we celebrated our Wedding Reception next door at The Chiswell Street Dining Rooms.

The Montcalm were really attentive to us and as they knew it was our Wedding Night they upgraded us to one of their Suites and it was a wonderful experience. 
Laura (Guest experience) leave us a really nice and personal note wishing us all the best in our future together which we think it was a really nice touch, next to it was a bottle of champagne (complimentary as well)
The suite was really spacious and with lots of attention to detail, spotless!
The staff the next morning were really helpful, and even if we over slept and missed breakfast time, they kindly put together a continental breakfast for us.
So over all it was a truly fantastic experience!",5,2016,01,11
128,"Great Location , Service , Room and Breakfast","Booked the hotel as it was near a function , everything was excellent. Almost the price of a London travelodge you can stay here for first class accomodation. There is a pub as part of the complex and you can have breakfast there . Stay in a club room and you can use the club lounge and enjoy a free drink ! Great location in walking distance of moorgate tube- will stay here again.",5,2016,01,10
128,Fantastic,"Have visited quite a few hotels in London for overnight stays and this time we fancied something a little different to the usual hotel. To say we were impressed was an understatement. It really is a special find. On arrival the staff were welcoming and helpful, taking your case, opening doors etc. We checked in and were escorted to our room with a little history of the building. On arrival to the room we were really pleased. A large room, huge bed, lovely bathroom and everything you need whether it be for an overnight stay or a week. The room was so comfortable, quiet, and the bed was amazing!! On the evening we left it a little late to get something to eat so the gentleman on reception recommended a restaurant, booked the table for us and printed off the directions!! Breakfast in the morning was lovely, full English Buffett style. The hotel is easy accessible to all places, with 2 tube stations nearby. The only thing I regret is only booking one night. Definitely be back and would recommend anyone to give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",5,2016,01,10
128,Mrs Lynda ,"Excellent stay . We love this hotel . Our favourite hotel in London . ! It s very well situated for central London . 5 mins walk from Barbican tube station . The staff make us feel special , and nothing is too much trouble . The jug and hare do a fantastic breakfast with happy smiling staff . Going back for valentines . It's the only hotel we have ever been that feels like home . ",5,2016,01,10
128,Expensive for what it really is,"Although in Central London I felt the rate was excessive for what I received. The hotel is as you would expect a refurbished brewery and that causes the hotel to be split across numerous parts. A good five minute walk from reception to my room was incredibly annoying if you forgot anything! 

The rooms are very small and although the bed and furniture is of high quality you literally just have room for the bed. 

Also strange was the breakfast location at the local pub just down the road, again food was good though. 

For a cheaper price I would book again but I think there are a lot more well priced hotels to choose.",3,2016,01,09
128,Good hotel with lots of character ,"Located in the heart of the City, it is a good location after offices and business close for a good night sleep with not much noise. Not a lot of entertaining around it but everything you need walking distance, including subway lines. 
The hotel is very different and it s layout very peculiar as it used to be a brewery. Extensively renovated, they had to keep the original layout. The only downsize is that the rooms are located on different levels with limited elevator access so pack lightly and have a roll away! 
The pub served good food and breakfast while the lounge is a perfect spot to chill and also serves continental breakfast in the morning. Nice decor, comfy beds and well appointed bathrooms with toiletries.
",4,2016,01,08
128,Great hotel with a good location for business or pleasure ,"Great boutique hotel with grest quality rooms and excellent staff. Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped for you stay with luxuries as well as the basics. 
Breakfast is ok with limited seating in the club lounge but the service is quick and food superb.",5,2016,01,07
128,Such a special building,"Went back to this lovely hotel just before Christmas when we were visiting London for festive shopping.  I just love this place - the staff are so friendly and helpful and the rooms are quietly luxurious.  I like the quirky lay out and the breakfast is very good as well (apart from no teapots on the table!)
We don't often go back to the same hotel, but this one is so special that it was a real treat.  Great location as well - quiet but lots to see within walking distance.",5,2016,01,06
128,Luxury at Affordable Price,"Just had a 1 night stay at this hotel, staff were extremely nice and helpful, room was very clean and comfortable. The Jagged Hare offers good local food and some nice beers.

Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,06
128,The best stay ever!!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel it was simply just AMAZING. I booked the hotel for 2 nights for my sisters birthday. I emailed them and told them I wanted a letter printed off and put in the room for when we arrive and they did this for us without any hesitation. From the moment we walked in staff were very welcome and friendly and we was told that we had been upgraded to the 'wow' suite. We were so happy to hear this the room was beautiful. We absolutely loved it. Bed was comfortable although a little high but their customer service is the best. We enjoyed it so much we decided to book the Montcalm Marble Arch for the night we checked out of the brewery and we had a good stay but I would definitely recommend the brewery more for sure! 

The only few downfalls were the hotel is far from the station when your exhausted and have loads of bags, the breakfast wasn't all that and the mini bar is very expensive.

Other than that this place is faultless. ",5,2016,01,05
128,Second visit and once again a wonderful stay!,"Back in September 2015 my partner and |I decided we would celebrate our 5th anniversary together in style, this is when we found The Montclam. What a find that was, from the word go when we arrived we knew this hotel was special! We enjoyed our stay so much that when New Years came we decided to treat ourselves again to some well deserved luxury! Well done the Montclam you didn't disappoint us in any way. From the start the welcome to the Montclam makes you feel right at home, the staff at the Montclam are so attentive and very professional. When ever we required their assistance you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble and it felt genuine. The breakfast in the Jug and Hare was fantastic with such a good choice of food and if they didn't have what you wanted they would do their utmost to provide it! Our room was a club room which was very spacious and most importantly very clean! The bed was just perfect, excellent size, excellent bedding and very comfortable! My partner commented to me that if she could live there it would make her a very happy person. I have to agree the quality and luxury of the hotel makes the Montclam extremely good value for money! The Montclam is great for access to the west end being no more than a 1/2 hour trip using the London underground at the Barbican. This makes The Montclam a perfect base to explore London from. All in all our stay on our 2nd visit never disappointed us in any way, and we have already booked a 3rd visit for valentines.  we love the Montclam and wouldn't hesitate to return. This will be our base each time we come to visit London, It's and great hotel with wonderful staff and a very homely and comfortable atmosphere. Well done the Montclam you really know how to look after your guests!",5,2016,01,05
128,Wonderful stay,The service was exceptional from front desk and throughout. High quality accommodation that matches Hotel Du Vin etc. Excellent location. We live in London but chose to stay centrally. We spent the weekend wandering Smithfield.,5,2016,01,04
128,Nice hotel,"Stayed December 2015 to attend a Christmas party, lovely large rooms with robes and slippers provided. When I emailed to confirm my booking the hotel asked if I was celebrating anything special, when I advised I had just been promoted they upgraded our room and delivered me a bottle of wine and some cupcakes which was a lovely surprise.
We had breakfast within our package and this was provided in the jugged hare pub two minutes down the road, this was not so good it was extremely busy and poorly managed. Guests were squeezed in and everything seemed to run out, trying to find staff to order another cup of tea for example took forever.
I have no complaints however regarding the hotel itself and would certainly return.",4,2016,01,04
128,Amazing Honeymoon at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City Hotel. A story for life to tell.,"That has been the best stay in an hotel in our lives. And what stay. After getting married in Paris and being disappointed by a Parisian hotel, I decided to offer to my bride a surprise and go to London for the New Year Eve and stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City Hotel. I noticed at first that there was a good ranking on TripAdvisor and I called them to mention the fact we were a newly married couple. Without any regret!!!! Evira (working at the telephone customer service) advised me to mention the marriage on the reservation page since I booked through a third party website, once arrived at the Hotel, the welcoming was warm. The woman who received us at the desk was more than nice, gave us great advise for NYE spots in London. We were upgraded to the WOW SUITE which was... WOW!!! Roses petals and Swan shaped towels on the bed, chocolates on the pillow, bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with delicious home-made cupcakes and fruits... with a small card of congratulations signed by the hotel manager. All these intentions, plus the quality of the room : large room, bed with 4 columns ""colonial era"" style and wood also colonial era style furnitures, leather comfortable couch, large bathroom with tubes having italian shower and jets... we will surely come back. Congratulations to this hotel that knows how to take care of every details!",5,2016,01,04
128,Disappointing First Impressions,"Stayed here for one night as an NYE treat.  The room was situated on the first floor at the far end of the building.  The room unfortunately was beset with problems, my partner noticed an unpleasant stain on the underside of the toilet seat (they did come to clean when called), the safe did not work and then when we came to leave the room to use the spa facilities the room would not lock. We called reception and the man came to look and seemed very surprised about this but could not fix the problem. We then waited and after 10 mins or so received a call asking if we wanted to change room.  As we could not stay in a room with open access we said yes and then a few minutes later the concierge came to provide us with a new room and keys for the third floor.

The room on the third floor was very nice with everything in working order, safe and a door that locked! We then ventured down to the club lounge for the drinks and buffet. The room had the interior of an old gentleman's club, had a big chandelier and wasn't busy.  The buffet itself was nothing special, a few spring rolls and sandwiches with cheese and ham / crisps / nuts.  We were enjoying a glass of Prosecco when we saw a shape running across the floor, it was a mouse, a lady in the room screamed and it disappeared somewhere.  I wouldn't expect mice to be seen running around a room in a 5 star hotel where food is served. The staff were notified and apologised for this.

After this we left the club lounge and decided to skip breakfast the next day.  We tried the spa facilities which is a very small sauna and larger steam room (that wasn't very hot), also no drinking water was available outside the facilities which would have been nice to re-hydrate.

I would say the staff working in the hotel were very helpful and friendly and they did their best to resolve the issue with the first room quickly. It is just disappointing these things aren't checked properly before a room is allocated.  

The location of the hotel is handy for the city and right by the Barbican Centre and about 10 mins from St Pauls.  At the weekend a lot of the places are not open though.  The Chiswell Dining Rooms was unfortunately closed over the Christmas and New Year period but there is a good pub The Jagged Hare on the corner which is part of the hotel.  There is also a good Cote restaurant a few mins away where we ate and is part of the Barbican Centre.",3,2016,01,03
128,Not your normal hotel - it's a ex-brewery,"Booked direct for a two night stay from New Year's Eve. Effectively used the Hotel as a sleeping quarter as we had breakfast in the City. The attached Jugged Hare is conveniently attached to the Hotel. Menu selection had a strong bias to game food - all very nice though. 

Though accessible to the Tube you have to decide if its location works for you. Quiet at the weekends. This is office workers territory. 

The Classic room was lovely though a tad small - OK for a single occupancy. Great service in a converted old brewery.",5,2016,01,03
128,Upgraded as part of our engagement. :),"Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant!!! From the moment we arrived to the final check out the staff were friendly, helpful and happy. My partner secretly arranged an upgrade and the room was as it was titled...The Wow Suite was spacious and perfect for our city getaway.",5,2016,01,03
128,Great City option,"This was my first time staying in the financial district near our offices.  While this was a “preferred” hotel of our company, many of the guys in the office were not familiar with the location.  I mentioned the brewery and they knew what I was talking about so I can only assume the hotel is fairly new.  Nice boutique hotel.  My room on the 2nd floor was interesting as it was only accessible by a few 5-step staircases.  The room itself was small but very comfortable and modern.  The location is great for the business district and you can grab a coffee and a pastry at a number of places within two blocks.  The restaurant situation becomes more complicated after 5.  The Hotel is linked to the Chiswell Street dining rooms. This was literally 15 second down a flight of stairs from my room.  

The staff at check in was great and overall everything was top notch.  This seems to be one of the best options in the area and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,01,02
128,NYE experience,"An overall very good experience. I stayed at the Montcalm previously and I was looking forward to an excellent dining experience as before. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the closure of the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms around the New Year period, which only left the Jugged Hare for on-site dinner. The rest of my stay was otherwise excellent, the room, the service and the location are certainly five star!",4,2016,01,02
128,Outstanding,"Perfection. That's all I have to say!
Slept like a baby in a beautiful modern take on an old brewery. The staff were all friendly and helpful, as soon as you walk through the door you know your in for a special stay.",5,2016,01,02
128,Excellent Boutique Hotel in London City,"With an attention to detail and modern décor on an old building that used to house a Brewery The Montcalm Hotel is set to welcome guest to Lovely London. Away from the hustle and bustle of the more touristy areas this calm hotel is an excellent choice for a peaceful escape to the UK. There is always staff ready to exceed your expectations. I particularly love their Christmas décor which made for a very 
“homey” feeling when your away from home on the holiday. You see and attention to detail literally when you step into the lobby since they change the entrance rug from “Good Morning” to “Good Evening” depending on the time of day. Since its and old warehouse there are long and winding corridors to get to your rooms which are a fairly good size for European standards. At first you might get confused but by the last day of your stay you will have the fastest route nailed down. We chose a Clubroom with a double bed which was more than enough space for the amount of time we were gonna spend on the room. The bathroom was BIG for European standards and came equipped with a rainfall showerhead which was perfect for a nice bath after a long day sightseeing. The room is equipped with a usb port for charging your phone, free wifi, iron with board, mini bar, complimentary coffee, shoehorn, shoe brush and what my wife describe as a top notch hair dryer. The restaurant is adjacent to the Jugged Hare were you can have a traditional English breakfast or there are some brasseries close by which you can try such as Cote which is a 2 minute wallk from the entrance of the hotel. The Montaclam sits between two underground stations, Moorgate and Barbarican which will make it easy to move around London using the tube. Just make sure to find out if any of the station is close for maintenance beforehand.",4,2016,01,01
128,NYE stay,"Absolutely fabulous service at this hotel. The team really know how to treat their guests well.
We stayed for one night on NYE and the bed was rather small in the normal room and despite it being one of the busiest times of the year they managed to find us an alternative room with a larger bed, with no fuss or hassle. Really made our trip far more comfortable and was very much appreciated. ",5,2016,01,01
128,Fantastic hotel.,"Fantastic hotel, it's the second time we have stayed and we will defiantly stay again ! The staff are all very friendly and helpful and made our stay a very pleasant experience.  
We have stayed at many hotels in London but for us this is our favourite!",5,2016,01,01
128,"Beautiful hotel, great location, amazing staff!",We loved this hotel. From the moment we stepped foot in the lobby we were treated like royalty by the staff. They were very helpful. It is a beautiful hotel with modern luxury. Very comfortable and spacious suite. We slept well and could not hear any noise from adjacent rooms or the street. It was perfect. Great way to wrap up our honeymoon. I recommend this hotel very highly.,5,2016,01,01
128,Good value for money but not really a 5* hotel,"We stayed here for a week during a business trip in one of their club rooms. The room was really well equipped and clean, but was quite small (for a week's stay) and not what we have expected after reading the club room description on the web. Especially the bed was not kingsize at all, being barely 140cm. In contrast to other reviewers we found the bed far to soft and it left us with backaches after a couple of days. The windows opened directly onto another building, not letting in any daylight and for privacy reasons the curtains were closed. As the young receptionist told us during check-in - after having problems locating our reservation - that they were fully booked, we did not asked for a different room - which we regretted later!
The breakfast was served in one of the hotel's restaurants and offered a very good selection of warm and cold dishes. But the space of the restaurant was fairly limited and thus tables were packed in order to accommodate all guests. The mostly unexperienced staff made it even worse by moving around quite uncoordinated. This is really sad and not matching the food quality and location.
The location of the hotel is excellent if you have business in the London city area and tube stations are really close. The price was reasonable and therefore we might give it a second chance on our next trip, but in a larger room with windows and a larger bed - even if it would be more expensive.",3,2016,01,01
128,Not bad...,"We stayed here for one night during early December in a standard room.  The room was  a bit of a trek from reception...up in a lift, through a corridor to a bridge then another lift, down another corridor, you get the picture!!  The hotel used to be a brewery so doesn't have a standard layout.  The room was modern and clean but very compact.  The view from the window was a brick wall!!  As we were only staying one night and were out of the room for most of it we didn't ask to be moved.  However, It would not have been acceptable for a longer stay.  When you book, you can request complimentary things for the room such as fragrance, special pillows etc.  We got none of the things we requested.  The staff were all very friendly and check in/out was quick.  We would stay here again but would definitely request a room closer to reception and one with a better view!",3,2015,12,31
128,Great city hotel,"I've stayed here numerous times when I'm in London for business and it is truly a great experience every time.   

On arrival, the doorman, is always so attentive and check-in is always seamless and the rooms are superb.

Bathroom, showers and amenities are first class.

It cant be a bit confusing at the beginning to navigate around the hotel but easy to get used to. 

I recommend paying the little bit extra to get the breakfast in the Jugged Hare next door.",4,2015,12,31
128,"Great city hotel, a bit of a journey to west end","Stayed here with the better half I between Xmas n New Years as got a very good deal.

Hotel is lovely, great rooms, good breakfasts, helpful friendly staff, so perfect if you need somewhere based in the city... We did however find it just a bit of a drag to get into the west end, which was the hotels only downside, if going to the west end is what you want.

One big plus was the hotel bar, the Jagged Hare pub, even though the city was dead, the pub was always lively and so better than most hotel bars you end up with!

Great hotel...",5,2015,12,31
128,Absolutely perfect !,"Had to be in the City for a few meetings so we thought we'd try a different hotel, one closer to the City and within easy walking distance from where our appointments were located.

On arrival, the doorman, Matthew, was so attentive. Nothing was an issue.

Check-in was seamless (for me the sign that everything is going to go well) and the room was superb.  The most spacious room we have had in London and the best shower !!!

Staff are totally service oriented.

The bed (king size) was perfect.

Bathroom, showers and amenities are first class.

This is a top hotel and I look forward to visiting it again .... soon.",5,2015,12,24
128,Beautiful hotel,"Staff here are very friendly and polite and professional the rooms are beautiful and it has a very unique atmosphere. I really enjoyed my stay here.

I actually booked in for another day as I didn't want to leave LOL.

They have these really nice mini burgers too, The only comment I would say is that I wish the bar area stayed open longer but apart from that it was a good place to stay. Parking is quite far away also that is the other downside but I guess if you're on public transport it would be fine.",4,2015,12,23
128,Very good City hotel,"I stayed at this charming hotel for 5 nights and found the experience to be extremely pleasant.  I was fortunate to be booked into a Club room which gave me access to the Club Lounge which was useful for breakfast and for an evening snack/drink.  The room was spacious by London standards with good storage space.  Staff were courteous and accommodating.  The hotel is well located within walking distance of Barbican, Moorgate and Liverpool Street Stations.
The pub, Jugged Hare, is attached to the hotel - in fact one can access or exit the hotel through it.  I had a very nice meal at the Jugged Hare and would recommend it as well.
There is an issue around vehicle access to the hotel.  Taxis cannot access the hotel and have to park in the busy street outside while bags are unloaded and the same inconvenience has to be undergone when leaving the hotel.  Hotel staff are helpful but there needs to be a better solution to this.  
The fire alarm went off twice during my stay - once at midnight and once during daytime.  They were false alarms but there was no communication or information provided by the staff during or after the alarms.
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2015,12,21
128,"Super friendly, great service, excellent location","A truly excellent stay in central London. 
Alice from concierge ensured our stay was excellent (many thanks!), the room was perfect (upgrade to Club Room - thanks again!), and all the staff friendly and helpful. 
Location-wise it was perfect for a Saturday night exploring The City's restaurants and bars.
We will definitely be staying again and would thoroughly recommend.",5,2015,12,21
128,Small but packs a punch,"A had a one night stopover here on business before meetings in the City. Check in was efficient and I was shown to my suite which was in a row of terraced housing opposite the obvious brewery entrance. I was very impressed with my room in terms of furnishings and level of equipment. The bed and duvet were probably the best I've ever slept in. The room had a bowl of fresh fruit, Hildon mineral water and a bathroom with Clarins toiletries. The TV was a modern LG with smart freesat. The room came with great lighting options, with the busy noisy London streets below barely noticeable 

I didn't take breakfast so can't comment on the catering but there are a number of eating establishments that open first thing, so you can economise and eat out if you wish as at £25 for breakfast I would want three courses served by Princess Beatrice.",4,2015,12,21
128,Interesting hotel in a great location,"This hotel is a bit of a maze and you almost need a trail of breadcrumbs to find your way to and from the room, but this is actually some of its charm. The rooms are an excellent size for central London business district. The staff are really helpful and welcoming. And the location is great - a real oasis in off a busy London street.",5,2015,12,21
128,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed in The Montcalm for my wife's 30th Birthday. We were upgraded to the Montclam club and lounge area and was also provided with a bottle of champagne and sweets which was a really nice touch. The staff were extremely helpful, as we ordered breakfast in bed and was charged, but reimburse immediately as we didn't realise that this was in our package. ",5,2015,12,21
128,"Great hotel, excellent staff","I've stayed at this hotel 3 times now, this time for 9 nights. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating and there is always someone around to help with any request or enquiry. The rooms are of a decent size, have wonderful amenities and cleaning is always quick and effective. The gym is small but under-used and the club lounge offers great value. I would highly recommend staying and intend to again on future stays in London - this is a luxury hotel at a budget cost.",5,2015,12,20
128,Good location and good value,"Stayed for just one night as we were going to the Barbican. We were upgraded to a club room in the south wing, it was quite a walk but we were shown the way so that was not a problem. The room itself was well equipped with a well stocked mini bar and free tea/coffee (nespresso), bed was very large and very comfy.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, with the concierge finding us somewhere to eat at very late notice.

As we were in a club room we had use of the club facilities; free continental breakfast and on par with other hotels we have stayed in.

Although we stayed on the last Friday night before Christmas, and there were lots fo office parites the level of service was  very good and we didn't notice any additional noise level.

Would recommend the hotel, especially if you're going to the Barbican as it is only a two minute walk.",5,2015,12,20
128,Decent but way overrated,"Decent Hotel. Rooms are well equiped and have a very good lighting concept, comfy beds and good toiletries. Some rooms have minuscule windows however and the poor quality of the materials takes a lot of the initial wow factor away again. 

The gym is subpar: 2 treadmills, a bike and a few free weights all in a minuscule room -hardly acceptable for a hotel of this price range. Another problem are some of the rooms which require a 5-7 minute walk from the reception area to get there -do recommend to ask for a room close to he reception, which they generally comply with when asked. 

Service is very average. One example: I forgot a book in the room and it took them over a month (an countless email exchanges) to get it back to me.

All in all a comfy hotel, but the price quality ratio is disproportionate since all you get here is equivalent to a 4 star max hotel and not to the 5 stars advertised. Good for a short stay but you can get better hotels for the same price.",3,2015,12,17
128,Perfect location for a business stay ,"If you are working in the Moorgate area and on business the Montcalm is a great venue. The welcome you get from the front of house is very good and the escorting to your room is engaging and pleasant. Rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are well presented and clean. The views in some rooms are limited but that's not really an issue!!

Great place to stay. Have stayed more than 10 times over the years and the hotel is a good choice.
",5,2015,12,16
128,Nice room but noisy,"A very warm welcome with friendly doorman and helpful receptionists. The hotel is very pleasant and the rooms were modern and well equipped. 

Wifi was free (something I expect nowadays but annoyingly find is not the case in many hotels) so that is a big positive. 

Personally I prefer a firm bed and so that and the road noise ensured I was awake early and ready for work.",2,2015,12,16
128,Comfort and Luxury in a small space,"I've stayed here 2 times, both for work. The staff is very accommodating. The experience at check in is nice as I was greeted with a hot towel upon arrival. The rooms I've stayed in were both very small but completely updated with modern fixtures. I really enjoy the daily coffee and tea available in the rooms as well as the touch of fresh fruit for the stay. This hotel is quite expensive so if you can find a good rate I'd say it's worth it but I probably wouldn't stay here on my own dime if I was vacationing.",5,2015,12,15
128,Absolutely perfect!,"Totally and utterly recommend this hotel, especially Alice from Guest Relations.  We booked a room for one night and I pre-ordered wine and strawberries for our room.  We had a lovely upgrade and a lovely stay.  The rooms are great and more importantly, the bed was so comfortable.  We'll definitely be back.  Thank you.",5,2015,12,14
128,Outstanding Service!,"I have been to Montcalm several times in 2015.The staff treated me like a VIP.Calling me by my name.Service is above the standard benchmark.When I accidentally left my valuable document in the room,Ms Cristina (the Duty Manager) personally returned my call with speed,went to search and keep the document until I returned to the hotel to collect it.Am so grateful,truly appreciate the honesty & outstanding service. 
Keep it up!",5,2015,12,14
128,"Friendly, professional, great location. Super!","We really enjoyed our stay at the Brewery. As we were in London, we did not spend much time in the hotel, but the time we did spend there was comfortable and relaxing. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a slight problem during check-in, but this was solved promptly. 

The room and environment was clean and tidy. The room had a lovely wet room and all the usual amenities. 

The hotel is in a great location, close by to affordable car parking at the Barbican (£8 ish a night Fri-Sun) and a short walk from the tube. 

So yeah. All good. ",4,2015,12,13
128,Nothing was too much hassle...,"I arrived on a Friday afternoon and was greeted by really friendly staff! My girlfriend was due to meet me later in the afternoon as I was actually planning to propose to her! I explained this to Alice (guest experience manager), who quickly asked me what time she was arriving. Without any hesitation, I was upgraded to a larger room, given a bottle of champagne and staff came up to my room to ""get it ready for the proposal"". 

I was really impressed with Alice and her colleagues as they made my stay really memorable. Not sure I would have got a yes if it wasn't for them!!!! :-) 

The room was great, particularly the modern bathroom. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with, was not being able to get brunch / breakfast at 11.15am as the connected pub / restaurant had stopped serving...

But overall, massively recommended...",5,2015,12,13
128,Great experience,"We spent a very nice weekend at the stylish Montcalm. We'd like to thank all of the staff for their exceptional service and for making us feel very welcome, nothing was too much trouble and this enhanced our overall experience. Very nice evening meal in Jugged Hare (would highly recommend the spit roast suckling pig) and also next morning for a lovely breakfast with relaxed, friendly service on both occasions. We will return.",5,2015,12,13
128,"Beautiful hotel, excellent serivce","This hotel is opulent yet very comfortable, in the heart of the City of London, right next to the Barbican. The hotel has every amenity for a luxurious stay - lots of relaxing spaces, spa, two associated restaurants (we ate in both; one for dinner, one for breakfast - great quality British food) and great service. Very friendly staff. The room was lovely, modern and cosy with excellent tea and coffee selection (very important!) and not too bad prices for room service drinks. Would recommend!",5,2015,12,13
128,Amazing Experience every time!!!,I spend every week working in London and I have to say this hotel is the best you can book! From start to finish the experience is outstanding!!! I recommend you pay slightly more and book the Club Room. ,5,2015,12,12
128,Hotel in an old Brewery,"Stayed here while attending a conference at the Brewery.  The rooms are classic modern and the amenities are Hermes (you can smell the shampoo for hours after taking a shower).  The building was never built to be a hotel so getting to your room can be a challenge, especially after 10 PM when they close all doors except the front door which is part of the fun staying here",4,2015,12,11
128,Best hotel in London !,My second business trip stay here and really can't fault it. I would highly recommend a stay here as everything is just perfect and how a hotel should be with fantastic customer service throughout the hotel making your stay a 5 star experience.  Laura the trainee on the front desk was so helpful and friendly and remembered me on checking out so great attention to detail when the front of house staff remember guests.  Breakfast is superb and I felt I was treated very well here on my stay. I will hopefully be back down on business again in 2016 and look forward to another stay and if I was to visit London for pleasure rather than business I would definitely stay here as it is very central.,5,2015,12,10
128,Interesting and Friendly hotel right in the City of London,"We recently stayed for a long weekend at this hotel which is very near The Barbican in EC1. I had lived in London before but didn´t know this part of town well. What a lovely surprise this hotel was. Our welcome was very efficient and friendly, we were booked in quickly and given a good tour of the hotel. Our room was comfortable and modern and perfect for our short stay. The hotel is in an old brewery and has a pub attached with great beer and a good atmosphere. All the staff were very helpful and friendly and I cannot fault them one bit. Our bed was comfotable and we had a very nice stay. The local area is really buzzing now with lots to do and loads of places to eat and drink. I recommend this hotel whether you are coming to London as a tourist or on business. It´s a very nice place!!!",5,2015,12,09
128,Engagement stay,"I booked the brewery for Friday night planning to propose to my girlfriend. The hotel reception put me through to the guest experience manager, Alice. I explained what I had planned and she took the experience to another level, free upgrade to the WOW suite with champagne and strawberries on arrival. The room and hotel along with the staff were first class. A big thank you to Alice for making our stay so special, this lady couldn't do enough for us, and is a big asset to the hotel.",5,2015,12,08
128,A good stay on the whole,"Stayed here for two nights at the weekend at the end of November while visiting family.  An easy walk from Moorgate station, the location suited us perfectly.  
Check in was quick and the concierge on the door were both extremely courteous and pleasant - always a good start.
As others have said, the hotel is a bit of a maze and we were quite a way from reception so if you have mobility issues, bear this in mind.  The concierge however, pointed out a quicker way through a fire escape to our room which saved my poor arthritic knees going up and down steps!
I have to say that the room didn't wow me - we had a 'basic room' which was rather small and very dark (not helped by the furniture being dark stained). There was a window in the corner but it overlooked another building. The bed covering was also quite masculine - you can see this from the pictures on the website.  From the reviews on here, the Club rooms seem to be very much better.
My biggest issue though was the height of the bed which provided my family with great amusement as they watched me (at 5' 1"") launching myself on the bed like a beached whale because it was too high for me sit on.  It was hilarious.
The bathroom was rather small also and would only accommodate one person at a time.  Lovely Hermes toiletries and a hand held shower (great for just washing my hair) as well as a lovely rainfall type shower over the bath.
Absolutely loved the soft snowy white towels and bathrobes - I so wanted to take them home - first class.
I did have an issue with the heating, it was very hot and I didn't sleep well.  I was very grumpily trying to work out how to turn it down at 3 in the morning.  We worked it out the the next day and got a better night's sleep on the second night.
The room and location was very quiet and we didn't hear anyone else nearby - a big plus in central London and so nice not to be bothered by other people's doors opening and closing at night or early morning.
We didn't use the restaurant (I thought breakfast at £25 each was rather steep) so can't comment.  We appreciated the biscuits with our tea tray but rather poor to have UHT tiny cartons for tea/coffee - that was rather a let down for a five star hotel. 
So. Some niggles but The Montcalm delivers on the points that matter, so I would stay here again.
",4,2015,12,07
128,Tasteful and quirky conversion of the old brewery.,"This is the first time I have stayed at a Montcalm hotel and it was a real treat from beginning to end. As our room was not ready when we arrived we were upgraded by the very helpful and thoughtful reception staff. We then had access to the club lounge which was an unexpected bonus which my daughter and I really enjoyed.
I love historical buildings and hadn't realised that this is a beautiful and tasteful conversion of the old brewery, around three hundred years old, and full of quirky features. It is also really handy for the Barbican Centre and the Museum of London, both of which we visited. There is also and old fashioned pub, the Jugged Hare, attached to the hotel which was a great place for a drink in the evening and packed even on a Sunday. 
When I needed to get back to Kings Cross station in the morning the reception staff then pointed out that Barbican station was only a five minute walk and closer, whereas I had planned to walk to Moorgate. Very helpful!",5,2015,12,07
128,Excellent hotel,"Having good a really good weekend rate, we stayed here for 2 nights, Friday-Sunday. The service was excellent from start to finish, though it is a bit of a maze to get to your room if you're in the South Wing. The rooms were designed to a high spec, great bathroom, one of the comfiest beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. The room was a bit small for a high quality hotel, and the working chair was very uncomfortable, but these are only small gripes. I'd deffo stay here for both business and leisure in the future.",4,2015,12,07
128,Lovely setting and aervuce,"Really enjoyed it our stay.
Lovely setting and close to Moorgate tube.
We were upgrades which was a lovely touch.
There was a wedding on the night we stayed but that didn't bother us at all.
The staff made sure we were looked after.
The breakfast was fab, we were seated downstairs as it was busy.
This did mean we had to go upstairs to get the food and drink but this was fine.
We enjoyed a drink in the pub.
I would stay here again.
",5,2015,12,07
128,Amazing,"We booked through an app for a anniversary weekend away and was delighted to find such a stunning hotel with great staff at such a reasonable price. Also - the breakfast is simply amazing. Just a brilliant stay. To
Quite simply - it's well worth a visit and we will be back soon. Many thanks 
",5,2015,12,07
128,Perfect and reasonably priced ,"A lovely hotel with excellent service. Stayed here for one night with a friend. A good location as there is a car park within a short walk which only cost £9 for the Saturday night. Trendy but luxurious, clean, all the amenities you need, comfortable bed, breakfast at the lovely pub on the corner and snacks were also included in the Club Room. Loved it and would definitely stay again. ",5,2015,12,07
128,Hidden gem,"Arrived on a Saturday night for a one night stay to see family.

Got a good rate via booking.com so was intrigued to see what the hotel was like.

Well I was very impressed indeed.

The doorman was exceptionally polite and courteous as we're all of the checkin staff

The walk to the room was by a very nice typing gentleman who kindly told us about the history of the hotel.

We arrived at the room and again was very pleased by the quality of everything.

Would we stay here again??? Of course we. Would I would thoroughly recommend it.....

Well done to all the staff.

128,Calmness at montcalm,"We arrived early at 11 am not expecting to be received favourably but calmness itself, we were given an upgrade and taken across the road to the hotels apartment suites where a room was ready. It felt like we were the only guests the place was so calm and quiet ! The location was excellent with the Barbican  one minute away where I parked the car for 23 hours for £9 !!. Taxis were plentiful too. Breakfast was served at the jugged hare pub on the corner which was excellent fare and cheerfully served without delay. Really impressed and would certainly return on a weekend for both cost comfort and convenience.",4,2015,12,06
128,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel, lovely staff. Brought us a bottle of wine to our room when they heard it was my Birthday. They couldn't do enough for us. The room was beautiful, clean and very nice bathroom with great products. Would 100% stay here again.",5,2015,12,03
128,Fabulous from start to finish. Highly recommended,"I surprised my sister for her birthday with a stay at this incredible hotel. The staff were amazing from the word go. I liaised with them prior to arriving to ensure we had some special treats in place. On arrival they had kindly upgraded us to such a special room which was beautifully decorated and included access into the club lounge which was an extra added bonus (free drinks and snacks between 5-7pm). The maid service was the best I've ever experienced. The Montcalm room was exceptionally large for London with amazing amenities. 

I would highly recommend the Jugged hare especially for Sunday lunch. Yes it is slightly more expensive but well worth it. Plus the bar is just such an experience in itself. 

Top tip, order breakfast to your room, better choice and you can enjoy at your leisure. 

Location is amazing, so central but so quiet! 

From start to finish we received such excellent customer service, we will certainly be returning.",5,2015,12,02
128,Ideal for the royal artillery gardens,"Awesome hotel, beautifully presented, staff were amazing....5 star service. Food was amazing in the dining room best burgers iv ever had. It's quite expensive but u get what u pay for and it is London!! 5 mins from the barbican tube, we got a taxi from kings cross for £15. Only downside it's like a labyrinth!! ",5,2015,12,02
128,Great place for a relaxing stay in the heart of London,"The hotel is a brilliant mixture of a classic building with modern facilities. Our room was very comfortable and clean.
The Club lounge was very cosy and relaxing. The staff were very helpful and the service was excellent. We had an excellent stay and will be back.",5,2015,11,30
128,My favourite hotel in london,"This is hotel is just fabulous. They have such beautiful rooms, each time I've stayed every room as a new quirky difference to the last. 

The beds are the most comfy beds I have ever slept in. Fit for royalty!

The staff are outstanding and couldn't be more helpful. 

Me ate in the jugged hare for dinner and again we can't fault it. 10 out of 10. Just a fantastic place to stay.",5,2015,11,30
128,Nice and trendy,"Nice hotel with a friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is located in an old rebuilt brewery. Pretty cool an kind of ""old meets new"" style. But be prepared to walk a bit. It is built like a brewery. Not as a hotel. Our room was way of from the reception and when the key card didn't work it is really a long way back and forth.... 
Our room was small but nice. Unfortunately no view from the window. The bed was comfy but a bit to soft for my back.",4,2015,11,30
128,Stunning Fusion,"This hotel has nailed it!
The fusion between classic and modern is outstanding. The template of the old Whitbread Brewery is the perfect backdrop for elegance and sophistication! (who would have thought?!)
The moment you set foot in the door the pampering and luxury begins.
The staff were helpful in every way. Even down to the snap shot history lesson by the porter, and reception continual asked if there was anything else they could do to enhance our stay.",5,2015,11,25
128,"Great, friendly service","We arrived early on a Friday morning after indicating at time of booking we'd be arriving before the check-in time and were checked in straight away, much to our surprise (and delight). 

The reception area is stunningly decorated and the staff were all wonderfully pleasant and helpful. 

Our room was clean and well-presented, albeit a little small. The bathroom was large and tastefully decorated and the shower was one of the best I've had. 

The only couple of gripes I have is that there's no mirror at the desk for drying/styling hair and applying make up - I managed nonetheless but would've been much easier and less of an arduous task had I been able to sit and see what I was doing at the same time. And the other thing - the mini bar. Ridiculously overpriced nibbles with nothing complimentary to eat upon arrival (we had been travelling since early morning and I was ravenous), a little packet of complimentary biscuits to go with a coffee would've been lovely as I refused to pay £5.75 for a little tub of nuts/gummy bears. 

All in all we had a comfortable stay and would probably stay again if we got as good a deal again.",4,2015,11,24
128,A great hotel,"This hotel was fantastic. The staff were friendly and helpful. Stayed overnight in one of the suites opposite the hotel which was gorgeous. Had a seperate lounge and bedroom area which was great as the bedroom was in the back, away from any road noise. The room was well equipped, nicely furnished and comfortable. They also gave me some balloons and cupcakes as it was my birthday which was a sweet little touch. The only thing was that the bathroom was very cold and although we put the heating on as soon as we got up, it didn't warm up.  
Breakfast was nice, with a good hot and cold selection. The scrambled eggs and sausages were particlarly nice. We also ordered room service late on Saturday night and although expensive (what room service isn't?!), it was tasty and arrived quickly.
Would definitely use this hotel again.
p.s We drove in and although the hotel has no car park, we parked in the Barbican Centre, practically next door, for a very reasonable £9.50 for 24 hours (we arrived after 4pm on Saturday).",5,2015,11,24
128,"Amazing service, great placw","First visit here but will not be the last! What a great building for a starter, the old Whitbread Brewery. Lovely room, some guests may struggle with the high bed and it was a bit small but it was lovely. Concierge staff really helpful in advance of our visit with advice on parking and also on breakfast. Continental breakfast in the club room was lovely, Nespresso coffee is great, why not have machines in the rooms? Very near to the very interesting Barbican complex and the Museum of London. St Pauls an easy walk too. Clearly will be popular in the week for business people as it is right in the City but a short walk to Barbican, Moorgate or A bit further to St Pauls will get you to the main tourist spots very quickly. Delighted to have found this gem! ",5,2015,11,23
128,So very close to being outstanding,"Extremely well situated, close to Moorgate tube and the Barbican.  We were there for a Saturday night gala dinner in the premises next door - The Brewery.  
On-line booking was easy peasy; requested an early check-in and rang the hotel a couple of days before arriving to confirm early check-in was OK.  They politely said they couldn't guarantee but were 90% sure it would be OK.  So we rock up at 12.30pm and sure enough there was a room ready for us, but was on the small side and the windows were high on the walls so it was a little dark and imposing.  And it was designed for people with disabilities, which meant the bathroom was huge (for access) but the washbasin was tiny and the toilet itself had an emergency pull cord.  Terrific design considerations but not if one is able bodied, particularly the sink. Rang down to reception - profuse apologies, mix up with the booking, was asked to wait for another room to be available.  Long story short, had to wait approx 1 hour, but eventually allocated a fabulous room (129 i think), king sized double, mega-comfy mattress, leather suite, big windows, the business.  Felt like royalty and treated with efficiency and politeness by staff, especially Rumen, who was so keen to ensure all was OK.  Bags transferred to new room without having to ask; just about to relax when theres a knock on the door, in walks the duty manager with more apologies, a complimentary bottle of wine and some crisps and biscuits. Frankly, I was bowled over with the service.  Having made the initial cock up with the booking, the staff were outstanding in making amends.  
The only thing which let the place down was that the bar closed at 1am, which was too late for myself and friends to get a night cap having wandered back from the do next door.  So we sat around in the well-lit foyer and chatted without drink, although the chef rustled up some chips and sandwiches.   If the bar had been open and we'd had the chance of a night cap to end the evening then i'd have given this place 5*s.",4,2015,11,23
128,Christmas shopping,"Room lovely although across road from Hotel, staff perfect, however the bar was closed both evenings.  Handy for tube stations although not much directly around the hotel.  Bar unbelievably expensive! We booked on hotels.com so the hotel was reasonably priced, all was lovely but would not stay again due to location and the hotel in house prices i.e. breakfast £24.99",5,2015,11,23
128,Exceeded my Expectations Again!!!,"I have stayed at the Montcalm Brewery on Chiswell Street on many an occasion and they never fail to impress me. 

I both work and socialize in London and for me, this hotel is one of London’s finest. The location is great for my office, but more than this it’s a great central base for any visitor and as my wife joins me from time to time its perfect for her too. 

Areas such as Bank (Bank of England, The Royal exchange, Leadenhall Market), St Pauls (St Pauls Cathedral) London Bridge (The Shard), Tower Bridge (Tower of London, St Catherine’s Dock), Liverpool Street (Jack the Ripper area) and many many more tourist area all within a 2 – 15 minute walk away. 

The $64,000 question is why is the hotel so good and why do I keep coming back. Here are my top 5 tips why I think it’s a great place to stay.

1.	The beds and pillows are the most comfortable I have ever slept in (including my own home). This is a really important point for me and the hotel have very firmly ticked this box.

2.	The shower and or baths in the room are great. Never short of hot water and a good drench from the shower heads. The bathrooms, as well as the hotel room itself, are all impeccably decorated with great colour schemes that are welcoming and relaxing. I have stayed in all classes of rooms and they are all excellent with the higher classification rooms having more space and with some having split level accommodation for the lounge and bedroom (Duplex rooms). 

3.	The staff!!! They must go through some rigorous training scheme as they appear to be really happy in their work by their warm smiles and welcoming attitude. They are all polite, efficient, and cannot do enough for you. From the moment you approach the hotel and have the door opened for you, to next discovering the beautiful vaulted ceilings of the reception, opulently decorated with a chandelier that oozes class and sophistication. 

4.	At one end of the hotel is The Jugged Hare and where you get a cooked breakfast which is to die for. A great selection of other breakfast food such as fruit and pastries etc. can be found here or in the club lounges throughout the hotel. The Jugged Hare is also a pub too and is open for lunch and dinner with an amazing selection of beers and wines. It’s very vibrant and a must for any visitor.

5.	Chiswell Street Dining Rooms is at the other end of the hotel and offers some fine wines and dining. A great place to share with someone special.

Alice Cubostrojeva is the Guest Experience Manager is a star and has great attention to detail. She is always happy to help and nothing is ever to much trouble, so thank you Alice and please extend my thanks to your team also.",5,2015,11,23
128,Best hotel visit ever,"I had sent email before arrival asking about car parking and mentioning it was our anniversary, Alice emailed back and said we would be given an upgrade for the occasion to  Club room so we were already looking forward to staying at The Montcalm. We were greeted in reception by Alice herself who made us feel very welcome from the moment we walked in. We were given hot towels to warm our hands as we signed in. We had arrived early so our room was not quite ready but the concierge offered to look after our suitcase while we we and had lunch.
On our return we were shown to our room by a lovely concierge ( sorry I did not remember his name), he was very informative and told us the history of the hotel, because it used to be a brewery it is very quirky and can be difficult to find the rooms but staff are always on hand to assist and it added to the charm to be honest. 
The room was fantastic, there is a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom and speakers in the bathroom so you can lie in the bath and watch a film, my only complaint for the room would be the blind between the rooms was not working so there was no way for privacy in the bathroom, I have been assured this will be fixed promptly, we did not complain at the time as we did not want to get moved and it was no biggy to avert our gaze when privacy was required. 
When we came back in the evening the bed had been turned down and there was a gorgeous pair of towelling swans with rose petals on the bed, see pic. There was a complimentary bottle of wine and strawberries and chocolates too.
There was a coffee maker in the room as well as usual kettle etc. We had robes and slippers, beautiful smelling toiletries (Hermes). A well stocked mini bar, iron and ironing board. We could have had breakfast in our room for a £5 tray charge but we went down to the Jugged Hare which is the gastro pub attached to the hotel and breakfast was lovely. The Barbican car park is only £9 a day at weekend and a minutes walk from the hotel.
All in all it was a brilliant hotel, the staff are so warm and friendly and attentive, can't wait to go back. It was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.",5,2015,11,23
128,Weekend away,"This was our first visit to The Montcalm. We booked for a belated anniversary weekend.

The hotel staff were all welcoming and very helpful. Our room was a bit of a trek from the lobby being in one of the wings, but there was a more direct route via The Jugged Hare below. We stayed in a Montcalm Club room, which was a good size and had all we needed.....plus the pleasant surprise of prosecco, chocolates and strawberries and various quality hot drink options. We later went out and returned to a turned down room, with towel swans and petals over the bed and a tidied room (bit embarrassed as not expecting that we left our things all over the place). The room was comfy, quiet and we would happily choose to stay there again.

The only comments I would make are 1) the direct lift we called and waited for it transpired was not operating (a couple saw us waiting and said you're better of walking, staff are doing something with it downstairs), it would have been good if signage was displayed and 2) The rain shower was nice, but it wasn't very powerful.

Overall, a great stay and would highly recommend if you are visiting this part of London for business or pleasure.",5,2015,11,22
128,Superb levels of service make for memorable stay,"Conveniently situated an easy walk between both the Barbican and Moorgate tube stations the hotel is in a good location yet on a relatively quiet road for central London. With door staff at the gates and on the door there was a welcoming reception, and throughout the stay plenty of staff members in the lobby area meant there was never a need to wait for get assistance. Lots of sofa seating in the lobby including a water feature on one of the walls made it relaxing and comfortable. The check in process was swift and a porter helped with the bags whilst leading us to our room on the first floor. There are multiple wings and areas to the hotel which made it easy to get lost, and many of the corridors feature small steps so do mention this when booking if it could pose a problem.

The corridors of the hotel were clean and had a modern sophisticated feel with plenty of mirrors and floor lighting. Our room, a standard double, was at the front of the hotel on the Eastern side overlooking the main road. After being given the ‘guided tour’ by the porter I did feel that the main room area was a little small. The bathroom wasn’t too bad, but the main sleeping area had little space around the bed and storing more than a small weekend bag would mean stepping over it daily to exit the room. It certainly is worth upgrading to one of their Club rooms which are noticeably bigger and much more comfortable for a longer stay.

The room was clean and nicely decorated though. The TV was a decent size with great picture quality, along with a multimedia interface panel for connecting up personal devices. Lighting was good with lamps at both bed sides, overhead lighting as well as floor lamps. The bed, although very high, was amazingly comfortable with plenty of amazing pillows available along with cushions. Relaxing with the TV would be delightful should this be your desire! One particular nice touch in the bedroom area was an automated ‘aroma machine’ - a small electronic box which you can set on a timer to activate a pleasant fragrance which slowly fills the room. A minibar and kettle was of course present.

The bathroom was spotless and very nice and modern. The shower had a waterfall head as well as separate handheld unit both with decent power and was spacious, acting more as a separate wet room than shower. Plenty of toiletries were supplied and restocked along with a range of towels and everything else as to be expected for a five star hotel. The only major lacking feature of the bathroom was an actual bath, although given the size of the room it wasn’t a surprise to be missing! Again, an upgrade to the next level of rooms features a large bath.

The breakfast is served in the restaurant at the end of the hotel, accessible through the corridors without having to go outside. There was a fantastic range of hot and cold options all of which were well presented and delicious. The service was attentive, tables large and the general atmosphere pleasant making for a great start to the day.

Overall the hotel provided a comfortable weekend stay, and I’ve returned a number of times now as a result. The key selling point to this hotel however is the staff. Always on hand to help, very friendly, nothing is ever a problem and happy to go the extra mile to make a stay rememberable and personal. Some of the little touches I’ve received have been beyond anything ever expected and for that reason I have to recommend the hotel to anyone else.",5,2015,11,21
128,Great hotel all round,"Stayed here for business. Room was great, bar and restaurants excellent. Meeting rooms were top class and the service in each department was excellent. Would definitely come back and stay again. Great history and location.",5,2015,11,21
128,Extraordinary staff,"The staff was amazing. I stayed for business, however, I got sick on the first day (gastroenteritis) and the staff was extremely helpful. They recommended the hospital, arranged the cab so I could go, offered to provide something that I could actually eat (please note that the gastroenteritis had nothing to do with anything that I have eaten in the hotel) and let me stay for a couple of hours longer so I could rest. In complicated situations like this it is a life saviour to have nice and helpful staff.",5,2015,11,20
128,My favourite London hotel,"An old brewery building transformed into a charming, elegant hotel with bundles of character, located very close to the Barbican and within walking distance of Moorgate, Liverpool Street and St. Paul's.  The hotel staff are excellent, providing a warm welcome and are always attentive and professional.  Rooms are spotless, nicely appointed and spacious, especially if you are lucky enough to be upgraded to a club room, Duplex or Wow suite.  Chocolates on the pillow, free bottled water and fruit are a nice touch.  I cannot praise this hotel highly enough and am already looking forward to my next visit.",5,2015,11,20
128,"Nice hotel, great service","Stayed here for a weekend break with my boyfriend. Architecture and rooms are beautiful - nice mix of old brewery building with modern decor. Staff was very friendly and went out of their way to answer our questions. Only downside was the location - a little out of the buzz. Having said that, it is only a 15 min walk to the nightlife center of Shoreditch, and the tube station is very close, so is still very accessible. Overall, good value for money for London!",5,2015,11,18
128,Very Good!,Stayed for business - found reception very accommodating and professional.  Nothing was too much trouble and I would definitely recommend this hotel both for business and pleasure.  The room I was given was clean and what one would expect from a 5* Boutique Hotel.,4,2015,11,18
128,"First class hotel, sexy breakfast in the city","Amazing service. First room was a little small, but we were immediately switched to a larger room without hesitation or question. Loved the shower, the giant bed, and the Nespresso machine which they rustled up for us too. Finally, breakfast was possibly the most amazing fare I have ever helped myself to, again with first class service, and top quality ingredients.",5,2015,11,17
128,Family short break,"Hotel staff were very helpful, rooms were adjacent with interlocking door. Food was excellent. Rooms service staff were excellent. Breakfast was great and again the staff were excellent. The whole team were always there to help.",5,2015,11,17
128,Chic comfortable hotel near Barbican,"Just spent 3 nights in a Club Double.  Hotel is well located, just a few blocks from Barbican and Moorsgate stops, and not far from Liverpool Station.  Borders both a business area to the east and a more residential neighborhood to north.  You enter through an old stone archway that was once part of a brewery and are immediately greeted by one or two doormen.  Enter the lobby to find brick vaulted ceilings and more staff than are offered by most hotels I've been to, all friendly and anxious to help. We stayed in Room 401 which looked over some roofs and had plenty of light.  Room was decent size with a nice bathroom.  Bathroom door was glass, so at night if you turned on bathroom light it could wake up your partner (what's with this latest hotel design feature in hotels  (we've encountered it in a few hotels now) - don't they think about light at night?).  Adequate storage in wardrobe.  Never quite figured out all the light switches in the room and what turned on what.  Club Room permits you to visit a nice club area on 1st floor (that's 2nd floor for you Americans) with newspapers,  drinks and snacks and, between 5:30 and 7:30, drinks and tea sandwiches.  Gym had 3 pieces of equipment and freeweights, plus a room with small coed sauna and steamroom.  Didn't get to try restaurants (Chiswell was closed (only operates M-F), Jugged Hare was booked solid on a Sunday night) but both look very good.  Ate at Iskele, Turkish place on Whitecross a 5 minute walk from hotel- great food and reasonable prices.  Caught a nice free jazz concert in Barbican on Sunday afternoon - Barbican is around the corner from hotel.  Overall, would not hesitate to come back.  And for a weekend in November, we got a great price on the hotel.",4,2015,11,17
128,Great stay ,"I booked this after seeing some great reviews on trip advisor. We were greeted with a free upgrade after a long journey and arriving fairly late on a Friday evening. Our first room was pleasant however it smelt very strongly of food, neither my boyfriend or I wanted to make a fuss but after a while of settling in we asked if we could move rooms. The staff were very efficient and helped move us very quickly. Our second room was excellent, breakfast was great and the location is perfect for easy access to the tube and sightseeing. The staff here are fantastic and a credit to the hotel, every one we came across was polite, friendly and very helpful. It is evident that this is a hotel where customer satisfaction is the priority which in a busy city can easily be forgotten. ",4,2015,11,15
128,Helen Briars,"We stayed for our Wedding Anniversary, couldn't fault the hotel, service. We were given a bottle of complimentary champagne, the food was fantastic. We chose to stay here as close to the West End as we had a theatre trip planned. We would definitely stay again 
",5,2015,11,15
128,Great new hotel in the Financial District,"We stayed here for 4 nights for our 8th wedding anniversary. The hotel is very long as it spans an entire block, but it is not that wide. Our room was a few floors above one of the restaurants so to go to the lobby, we took the elevator down to the restaurant and walked on the sidewalk to the lobby. The Concierge staff was very well versed for any and all travel requests. It is the financial district so it will be quieter on the weekend and they are between the Barbican and Moregate Tube stations. Also a short walk to the Tower of London. The bed was comfy and the Nespresso machine in the room was used each morning, Bathroom was BIG for a London hotel room. We would stay here again but because this is a hotel in an old brewery there are many different ways to get to the lobby and this does not have a traditional hotel layout. So if you have mobility issues, make sure that you mention it.",4,2015,11,13
128,Good choice,"I can recommended it, very good central location, friendliness of each individual employee, the size of the room and the bathroom, breakfast buffet, everything you could wish for. I hope that I will come back in next years :-)",4,2015,11,12
128,Something a little different in London,"I've stayed at the Montcalm a few times now, so I feel I know it well enough to pass my comments on. 
As most people will know, this property was formerly a brewery and because of that, the hotel is spread out over a large area, with a large courtyard in the middle. 
The reception area is a visual delight and the staff are always very welcoming. My one criticism at this point, is that they take full payment upfront, rather than settling the bill with extras at the end, such as food and drink, which means you then have another bill to settle at check out. 
Because of the design, some of the rooms have large windows and some have very small, high windows and those on the lower floors, looking on to Chiswell St can be noisy. 
The added benefit is that there is a pub attached to the hotel called the ""Jugged Hare"". This is accessible directly from the hotel lift and serves in-season game, as well as other nice food. It can be very busy, especially early evening with non-residents. 
They also have a club lounge, which serves evening drinks and canapés, as well as a continental breakfast. On the subject of breakfast, rather confusingly, they offer a continental option in the club lounge but also a cooked breakfast in the Jugged Hare. It's not always made clear at check in which option is available to you. 
All in all, the staff are very friendly and do go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one.",4,2015,11,12
128,Excellence at it's best!,"I won't stay over in London unless I can stay in the Montcalm. Mainly due to the proximity of our London office but also becuase of the excellent client service they offer, cleanliness of the room, facilities within the rooms and the comfort it offers......home from home though very elegant. If you want to dine you can participate in the 'buzzy' Jugged Hare atmosphere for bar food! or you can take a more relaxed approach in the Chiswell Street Dining room for a more formal dining experience. Though the bar area does get quite busy too. Don't be disappointed with the windy corridors as you have to remember it is an old brewery with character.",5,2015,11,12
128,"Well located hotel close to the Barbican and ""legal"" district",New hotel with great service and modern décor. Rooms were very functional with modern bathroom and luxury toiletries. The room service was of very good quality and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I would stay again,4,2015,11,11
128,Nice stay,Stayed for one night on business. Lovely comfy room. Bed lovely and comfy had a good nights sleep. Room looking a bit frayed around the edges now but nothing that detracted from my stay. Everyone I met staff wise was lovely. Would deffo return.,4,2015,11,11
128,"Hotel personnel were unbelievably kind, helpful and gracious.  They went out of their way to assist.",Location is excellent.  Quick walk to the Tube and many attractions.  Our concierge was very knowledgeable and expertly guided us to many restaurants and sites.  The wait staff in the Lounge were very personable and cordial.,5,2015,11,10
128,Very Enjoyable - Super Design/Location ,"This is a really great hotel. I will book again. The location is good - not far from Liverpool street. Close to lots of restaurants and a cinema but you won't want to leave the hotel. It's lovely.

The rooms are built in the grounds of an old brewery. Many features remain, including arched ceilings and exposed brick. The lobby is gorgeous, low lighting, leather chairs, lots of wood and a beautuful wall water feature on entry.

My room was very nice. I loved the bathtub  because it was so long, a rare treat.  The bathroom wall was made of glass on one side so I could watch TV while soaking in the water. Heaven.

Room service was good but smallish portions. Don't expect soft crusty bread with the soup. The mini bar was superb! Very well stocked - wine/champagne.

Prices were very reasonable and concierge was extreamly helpful but the two girls I meg on reception during check in/check out did not represent the hotel very well. Please fix this. Staff make a huge difference to the lasting memory of a customer when they consider booking again.",4,2015,11,10
128,great  weekend,"A wonderful weekend spent at your Hotel the staff and amenities defiantly five star, the quality of the food in the Jugged Hare was top class, as an ex gamekeeper  I loved the theme of the pub, The doorman and reception staff very helpful, I will definitely consider staying with you on a regular basis. only one complaint. My wife requested a hairdresser and was duly attended by one from the Blow agency, the young lady although very pleasant and polite was a t least poorly trained after less than an hour my wife had to get assistance from a friends wife to re do her hair. a total waste of money in my opinion if you wish to offer hairdressing facilities use a different company. a big thank you to your staff for making our visit very enjoyable  Regards    Mr M R Toy",4,2015,11,09
128,Alice is a delight !,"From the start of our booking to the the moment we checked out, Alice was kind, thoughtful and generous to us; upgrading our room due to it being special weekend, and providing champagne for us. A lovely hotel, where the staff really make it special. Thank you Alice.",5,2015,11,09
128,Excellent Hotel but.......,"And to be honest, I can't quite put my finger on what the ""but"" is, everything was superb and exactly what you would expect from a hotel of this class and in this location. So why don't I feel all warm and fuzzy. The only real niggles I had were that the layout is like a rabbit warren, and that there is no taxi rank directly outside the lobby. So what, it's the City of London what do I expect. I think it was just a bit... ""boring""

You didn't ""Wow"" me chaps, but that's not to say your not doing a great job, I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone for a business trip or Romantic weekend with your own or somebody elses wife.

128,weekend in november,"Check-in was slow but very polite. Bedrooms are fine, though the hotel is quite higgledy piggledy so difficult to find your way around. Unfortunately the bar and restaurant were WAY too busy and too noisy in the evenings, definitely not a relaxing environment.",3,2015,11,09
128,Great hotel with Best Staff in London ,This is our 2nd visit to The Montcalm and once again everything about it was 5 star.Alice and Simona ....what can I say ? World Class customer service as always.Upgraded to club room with club lounge access which in itself makes the stay even more memorable.Complimentary bottle of wine and a card left in room to celebrate my partners birthday.Jugged Hare as always very busy and a good stop off place before heading out for dinner. Overall all staff 5 star and none more so than aforementioned Alice and Simona.Looking forward to returning soon.,5,2015,11,08
128,Excellent all round,"What can I say? From the moment we arrived at remarkably busy check-in, we had friendly, helpful and warm staff bent on making sure what I'd planned as a surprise anniversary treat was special. Our room was elegant, if compact – perhaps there are larger club rooms, not unreasonably, used for those staying more than one night. If we'd been here for a week, it would have been a challenge to get all our clothes hung. We don't travel light… But for a night, it was perfect. So many good touches. A quality coffee machine instead of those ghastly sachets of instant, a range of teas, wonderfully comfortable bed, high-tech bathroom, ironing board and iron (in case you pack badly or are as obsessive about your creases as I am). And the club lounge was an oasis, staffed by a young woman who made excellent G&Ts and took good care of us. Breakfast was great, although we were well-advised not to go before 9, as it was packed with people clearly setting themselves up for a working day. Once 9 had passed, it slowly cleared and our day started in excellent form. Thank you to all the staff for making our occasion so memorable.",5,2015,11,08
128,A lovely place to visit,I stayed here during a conference and found it to be a really nice place to stay. The place was very elegant and with modern features. It was clean and very well maintained but I did find the lack of drink options in the room a bit disappointing but I asked the staff who were really friendly as well as happy to help.,5,2015,11,07
128,A great place to stay in the City.,"I've chosen this particular property since I had a few meetings to hold around the City during my stay.

The hotel is extremely well run with genuine care from everyone to provide you with a good service. It's simply great value for money. 

I wasn't too happy with my ground floor room for two reasons, the first is that my window was on the street level which simply made me feel very uncomfortable and the second is that it was on the same level with the Jugged Hare pub, there was an inexplicable noise whenever I'd get out of my room. Otherwise, the hotel was one of the best I've ever stayed in.",4,2015,11,07
128,Great hotel in the heart of London,Great and fancy hotel located in a very central location close to the financial center of London as well as to all London's sights and shopping districts. The service was impeccable. You ask for something and you immediately get it! Highly recomended if you are looking for a superior and central hotel in London!,5,2015,11,07
128,Perfect place for a long weekend,"The location of the hotel is excellent, and you can get to the closest tube station after a 7-8 minute walk. The building is a refurbished old brewery and they tried to keep as much of the original structure as possible. Inside, the system of corridors and stairs can remind you of a maze but overall the interior of the hotel is nice and tasteful. The rooms look modern and nicely designed but some can be a bit noisy due to the air ventilation system outlets which sometimes are very close to the windows which aren’t soundproofed. If you’re a light sleeper that can be a problem. In that case you definitely should ask for a quiet room; we did that and the staff were really helpful in finding us one. In general, the staff were really kind, helpful and professional throughout our stay. The hotel offers an afternoon snack option which you can add to your booking; it’s really nice so it’s worth to try. Every room comes with a really extensive list of information about the hotel, extra services, dining options, etc.. which can be really useful.
Possibly the only thing that didn’t go perfectly smoothly was breakfast. The hotel has at least two breakfast areas – one inside the hotel and the other one in the (connected) corner pub, The Jugged Hare. We were directed to the latter therefore can’t talk about the other breakfast location but The Jugged Hare was simply overloaded by people at breakfast time. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated and it seemed they are pretty strict about when breakfast ends so it’s worth going there about 25-30 minutes earlier than finishing time. Despite this, breakfast was still nice because the food – both the English and the continental items – tasted good and the staff were helpful and dealt with the situation caused by the huge amount of people as best they could. Lastly, we have to warn you, if you are an animal rights advocate or anti-hunting person, ask your breakfast to be served in the other location instead – or if you are in The Jugged Hare don’t look up – because the wall is covered with hunting trophies and taxidermied animals.

Staff wonderful when we arrived the room wasn't ready as expected so we left our bag and went to our show they looke after the bag no trouble. We returned and the room was ready the concierge showed us to the room he was great nothing was too much trouble. Room was great and decorated plus a birthday card and cupcakes lovely gesture.
The concierge were great I did not get his name but he was great he remembered us and anything we wanted he just sorted.

128,Perfect Weekend,"Searched for appropriate accommodation in London for our Anniversary ""celebrations"". Perfect Hotel found ! 
Lovely 'boutique"" hotel, attentive and personal service.
Location surprisingly great, in between two Tube stations (Barbican 4 minute walk), Smithfield Market in walking distance.
Were upgraded to spacious club room, very quite and including all the expected amenities and even recived ""anniversary"" fruit and bottle of Champagne.

To summarize, highly recommended. 
A Gem in the London Hotel jungle. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,11,05
128,Outstanding 'extra mile' guest service.,"What an absolute pleaure it was working alongside the Montcalm! I was arranging my friends stay as it was her hotel of choice for her wedding night. Nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff at this hotel,especially ''Megha"" who more than deserves a special mention as she went the 'extra mile' to ensure that my friends were welcomed and treated impeccably. I was thrilled to hear how the room, warm welcome, special touches were all greatly appreciated by the newly wed couple. Any request we had Megha arranged and communicated with warmth, timeliness and genuine care for the guests. Cant recommend highly enough.",5,2015,11,05

128,Montrage,"Don't really know where to start.  My wife arrived slightly before me and was told she could not access our room without paying for it in advance.  She was told this was due to the hotel having failed to correctly pre-authorise our stay.  She was dealt with by a trainee who was running the desk alone, and didn't really know what to do.

we paid £518 for the room.  we needed to stay close to this location and were informed this cost - very, very out of step with the quality - was due to the fact 'rates vary with how busy we are'.  How very easyjet.

the hotel decor, having stayed in many in London, was poor quality, and I would say it reminded me of the black laquer malmaision look from the 90s.  outdated, and the room was equally disappointing especially for the price tag, with for example a shower that was a handheld bath attachment, and in the bath, a king size bed that was two single mattresses and a general feel that was quite tacky.  I would imagine its often used for office xmas parties as a convenient city spot and it has that vibe.

on checking out, it took three staff to refund our card and put the charge onto mine, with the common theme being, again, they were all trainees.  they kept panicking and asking 'where's the manager?'.  dealing with a guest apparently.  id imagine that happens a lot.

use this hotel when you need to stay local, the rates are under 200 and you are just looking to sleep off the mulled wine.",1,2015,11,04
128,Overrated,"Club room distinctly average; asked for high floor, got put on ground floor right by the main road, although the noise wasn't too bad. More annoying was the exceedingly noisy fan that kept cutting in throughout the night and waking me up. In the morning I finally found the heater controls which were by the door, and the thermostat dial I'd used in the night to try and shut the darned thing up seemed to be ineffective. 

Breakfast next door at the Jugged Hare also an extremely average affair.

There are far better hotels in London for similar money. I expect the people who have given five star reviews are yet to stay at those locations, see my other reviews if you're curious.",3,2015,11,03
128,Amazing hotel with great staff,"Our stay was absolutely lovely. The rooms are furnished to a high spec and the staff are very pleasent. It was a special occasion for us and Dorine was very kind and upgraded us for the occasion.

Would definitely stay here again, no hesitation!",5,2015,11,02
128,Very pleasant,"Hotel greating was good staff friendly and very warming  we booked via hotel.com when we got to the hotel was advised over booked but in  Very friendly manner they offered us double rooms and asked very plightley if we would swap for four singles which we didn't mind in the end we ended with doubles instead,  Rooms were nice and clean.  

Will defentley stay here again",5,2015,11,02
128,Always an excellent stay.,"We have stayed at this hotel twice for our wedding anniversary. Each time we have been upgraded, rooms are excellent hotel and staff are all amazing. Would highly recommend, close to an underground to hop into central London in under 30 minutes, close to a car park which was £9.00 at the weekend. Room was clean, and had everything we needed for a weekend break

128,Lovely Hotel,"Very nice Hotel, situated in the heart of London. I stayed 2 nights with my little daughter (20 months) during my husband's business trip. Staff is excellent: a big thank you to Alex and Laura for making us feeling so welcome, Victoria for being so nice with my little one in the Club lounge and the doorman (I forgot his name) for being so smiley. We stayed in a Club Room, decent size and fully equipped. Breakfast was just perfect.",5,2015,11,02
128,"Superb location, fantastic hotel","My wife and I stayed here so that we could both celebrate our anniversary and also attend the Australia vs Argentina rugby world cup semi-final. The location is superb and the staff were fabulous. As it was our anniversary, we were given free breakfast for both days which was great (especially as this is normally £22 each).

The location is great and only about a 3 minute walk from Moorgate tube stop. The local bar (the Jugged Hare) seemed nice but was very busy both nights. It's quick and easy to get there via taxi from the centre of town with a taxi from Covent Garden costing £13.

I will definitely stay there again when I go back to London.",5,2015,11,02
128,My experience with a 5 star hotel!,"Please be my guest for the following story. I booked the Montcalm at brewery from October 28 till November 1 (3 nights). A 5 star hotel in London. Probably not cheap, what do you think?
I do arrive at 8:00 am on the 28th. We do all check in paperwork then. I ask for a room with 2 single beds as my son (age 20) is coming on the 29th to join me and we prefer separate beds. I go into London and come back at 1:00 pm to get my room.The doorman (yes, as a good 5 star hotel requires) brings me to the room. But mistake: the room has one big bed. I stay polite after the doorman calls reception. They advise me to stay in the room, not touching anything and they will organize a twin bed room immediately. After 40 minutes, no reply. I pick up the phone and call reception. Yes they ARE GONNA deal with my problem but the lady at the reception tells me that she handles everything on her desk one after another (what about priorities in a 5 star hotel?) and my room problem was probably at the bottom of her list. I ask for the duty manager who tells me that she is just informed, but will have a room ready in 15 minutes. After 25 minutes I pick up the phone and get the duty manager at the line, who tells me we spoke 10 minutes ago. No, we spoke 25 minutes ago. Oh! 20 minutes later I was brought to a room with 2 single beds. All in all almost 1:30 hour later! In a 5 star hotel, you know.
I have appointments and wanted to take a shower: nice soaps from Hermes ( as in a 5 star hotel) but: NO SHAMPO.  And ..At the tab from the shower is one piece not fixed anymore (remember 5 stars!). After a night sleep, I want to switch on the make up room sign: it does not work! OK, I inform reception to inform in house cleaning (lucky enough room was clean in the evening). At the same that morning, I give my second key at the reception for my son arriving that late afternoon. Nice piece of paper the receptionist adds to make sure the key is there when my son arrives. That evening when he arrives, they can NOT find the KEY anymore. They make a new one! That evening my son and I do return at the hotel at 12:30 am. And my KEY does NOT work anymore due to the new key made. The next morning we go for breakfast at 10:00 (remember 5 star hotel): we have to wait 15 minutes to get a table. And the pepper distributer is EMPTY. No problem they take one from another table, which is still missing the day AFTER. At the breakfast the servants are so stressed that they forget to be friendly.
This is a hotel which shows a lot of window dressing but is NOT at all at the standard level of a 5 star hotel. Of course: always your choice!
",1,2015,11,01
128,Lovely hotel with exemplary staff,"From the moment you step through the door and Georgi, the doorman, tips his hat and opens the door for you, you know that you are in a five-star hotel.

I found all the staff to be exemplary - very helpful and polite. 

I stayed here overnight as I was working in London on business. Everything about the hotel is excellent. The bedroom was comfortable and very nicely appointed. All the amenities of a five-star hotel were there. Television, complimentary tea and coffee, bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, fruit in the room, everything was first class.  Free WiFi which these days I feel is a mandatory requirement from a hotel.  Sadly though the underfloor heating in the bathroom was not working but this did not adversely affect my stay.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable though the pillows I feel could be better.  I use a memory form pillow at home and there was a big difference in comfort.

The breakfast was nice. It was served in the Jugged Hare pub which is part of the hotel, though slightly down the road, but accessible via the hotel. The quality and choice of the food was first class and the service was excellent. Though I would say that a 5* hotel should be serving quality bacon, not cheap streaky bacon which I avoided.  Additionally some more interesting bread (granary, seeded, etc.) would be appreciated.

The location is extremely convenient to the city and it is right beside the Barbican Centre – ideal for anyone attending a function there. It seems to be a very safe area. The hotel is only a short walk from two nearby adjacent tube stations - Barbican and Moorgate.

All in all, this was very pleasant stay. I can highly recommend this hotel and I hope to be back again soon.",5,2015,11,01
128,absolutely superb,"My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary and my wife's birthday. The customer service here is the best I have ever known in a hotel. Alice, on reception cannot do enough to help, I wish she worked for me! Our room was beautiful, Hermes toiletries, balloons and rose petals on the bed and a free bottle of prosecco.  The hotel is immaculate, every single member of staff cannot do enough for you, hot towels on arrival, doors open and smiles galore. The breakfast in the jagged hare, wow!  Superb quality food and a range like I have never seen.. If you stay in London,  book here... and say hi to Alice from Mr and Mrs tofte!",5,2015,10,31
128,Amazing.......again!,Once again we have had a fantastic stay at the Montcalm. Our stay on this occasion was to celebrate my husbands birthday and the hotel staff did not let us down. We were upgraded to the 'Wow' suite and we definitely felt special. The room was amazing as were the added extras provided by the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to book again.,5,2015,10,30
128,Nice convenient friendly hotel,stayed here several times with family and always have a nice stay. Friendly staff and nice little extras provided. Would recommend . Barbican centre close and several restaurants and bars within walking distance from hotel.,5,2015,10,30
128,40th Birthday Treat,"I booked this hotel as a treat for my husbands 40th birthday through Hotels.com, I wanted something close to London as I had a reservation booked in Tottenham Court Road for Dinner in the evening, so was not to far. I looked at the pictures and read some of the reviews and as the price was very good I decided to book.

As an after thought the day before we travelled I contacted the hotel direct and spoke to a lovely girl ( I think her name might have been Alice) and asked if they had any guest packages for birthdays. She informed me they could arrange for champagne and chocolates in the room for our arrival for the cost of £50. As it was my husbands 40th birthday I agreed as a one of treat, and ensured we would arrive by 4:30pm.

When we arrived the next day about ten minutes later, we checked into a beautiful lobby area, and a young man called Reuben (I think) checked us in and just asked me to wait a moment. A young lady came over and introduced herself and stated she had spoken to me (Alice) and she had the room all prepared as arranged and hoped we enjoyed our stay at the Montcalm.

Reuben showed us to our room, where we would come down for breakfast etc., he was very friendly and very helpful. The room was lovely especially the see though glass the bathroom lol and the speakers in there, definitely took some getting used to. Bu the rainfall shower was fantastic! Champagne was drunk far to quick! and chocolates were brilliant. oh and they sent him a birthday card from the hotel!

When we arrived back from dinner that night we opened the door to two lovely swans and rose petals on the floor and bed! they had been in and given a complimentary turn down service, thank you! we were blown away for the service and the small details.
The breakfast was great and although I had a slight head the next day the waiters pouring my coffee was fantastic!

Thank you to all the staff who made ur stay a birthday one to remember we will certainly be back!

Martine and David Wagner",5,2015,10,29
128,Really?????,"This is the most disappointing hotel stay in a very, very long time.

I had a 1-night stay for a business trip, and picked this hotel for its proximity to the business venue and what seemed like a good overall tripadvisor rating.

Upon arrival, I was told that the 'flexi rate' booked through our corporate travel agent was a Montcalm term for 'we take your money and send you around town at our whim'. So, the receptionist informed me that I had been transferred to another hotel, 5 minutes' cab ride away. Not the best way to welcome your business travellers, even less so when it's female single travellers.

To top it, the receptionist was asking for me to pay for the room up-front before going to the new venue. I refused - not paying for something I haven't even set eyes on yet. And certainly not a service I'm used to getting at top hotels.
Thoroughly annoyed by now, I asked to speak to the manager. Once he arrived, I hardly had to explain the situation before he went back and found me a room anyway. It didn't take him 2 minutes...

My room was absolutely fine - rather compact, but with all amenities and everything you need for a short business stay, including free wifi. However, a small but important design flaw would be my next major issue with this hotel: There was a gap between the door and the carpet, probably about an inch tall. Not huge, but enough to make sure the light - and noise! - from the corridor disturbed my night's sleep. When a guest left his/her room down the corridor at 5 in the morning, I couldn't get back to sleep. So much for starting the day relaxed and refreshed.

My booking included a 'buffet breakfast' which turned out to be another Montcalm term for 'we do not really value your business'. Buffet breakfast is served in what they call the 'Club Lounge' which is just that - a lounge with Chesterfield chairs and small tables. Once I eventually found it on the first floor through a labyrinth of corridors and stairs (leave your luggage in the reception), there were no tables available. And when a few people got up, there was no staff around to clear their table. I gave up on the breakfast - and the Montcalm - there and then.

Upon check-out, I was asked if I'd enjoyed my stay. I shared the above, and was given a half-hearted apology and asked if their customer service department could follow up on it. A week later, I haven't heard from them and thus doubt they even care.

It was my first - and certainly last - stay at a Montcalm hotel. I've had better service and sleep at average 3 star hotels. The price tag of almost 300 GBP for this experience borders on theft.",1,2015,10,29
128,New hotel in old building is a challenge.,"I am a bit surprised at the overwhelming reviews this hotel has. To build a modern hotel into an old building is by any standard quite a challenge and Montcalm has has done a good job for sure but there are shortcomings. We were a group of ten. Some had problems to find the way around the hotel and to their rooms. ( up and down, left and right) . The rooms are small and very dark with very small windows. The lighting system is complicated and in any case not enough. The bathroom is large but dark and not practical. No space to put your own stuff such as toothbrush and shaving gear for example. Surprisingly poor in my opinion. The shower is in the bathtub which is not ideal specially for bit older people. 
The staff are very polite and helpful. The breakfast is Ok. Wifi is fast and included in the price.  The location is Ok if you have business in the City area which we had. But it is not a place for tourists. The immediate surrounding area is simply not very nice.",3,2015,10,29
128,Fantastic place to stay close to the Barbican,"Had a wonderful stay. It was the perfect location for us as we were in London seeing a play at the Barbican. The staff, room and (most of all) breakfast more than made up for the flop of a play!! If we're in the market for a serious treat again, this will be where we book.",5,2015,10,28
128,Absolutely Brilliant ,"This place is my favourite hotel in London, service excellence, opulence, character, if I could stay here every week I would.  Nothing is a problem, questions are answered quickly, they know what you need/want every time. Five star rating from me.",5,2015,10,27
128,Sisters birthday ,We stayed here for my sister's birthday on August 2015  Can't complain at all. Helpful staff great location. The room could have better view and location as it was on ground floor but it wasn't so important. Overall great experience.,5,2015,10,27
128,Lovely hotel - They went the extra mile,"I was staying for a special occasion and they provided some lovely decoration, wine and cakes for us. The check-in process took a little longer due to us not having the reservation card at hand but this was resolved. The room was great and very comfortable and I'd most definitely stay again.",4,2015,10,27
128,Truly excellent,"What a hotel

We arrived at the hotel and was greated by the receptionist. The manager then came over to also greet us. She then took us to our room and gave us a tour of the building with a lot of information about the history of what is an incredible building. The whole building is an old brewery and is very impressive. We then arrived at the room and I had mentioned it was my other halfs birthday and how much she likes dark chocolate. we had copious amounts of dark chocolate left for us in the room along with a bottle of wine and numerous other treats. they had also filled the room with balloons and covered the bed in rose petals. The room was very impressive and quite large. the bathroom was also impressive with a window through to the bedroom, which was a little odd and not an aspect I am going to review. The location of the hotel is a bit out of the way for most of London but right on an underground route so not much of an issue",5,2015,10,26
128,Great hotel for all occasions,"I stayed for 3 nights, partly for business, partly for pleasure with wife and kid. Hotel is very beautiful and new, staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Great location in a historical building, and with the subway you immediately get to the tourist attractions. Only downside that it was complicated to get the two night booking (by company) extended for one night and link these 2 together. But that's a detail, all went well in the end. Great hotel for every occasion. 

Frank Cools",5,2015,10,25
128,Lovely hotel ,My husband and I chose to stay here for our anniversary. We booked a double deluxe room which was a good size with a comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom. The strength of this hotel is its staff - they are all very friendly and helpful. We particularly appreciated the loan of the umbrella! Breakfast was in 'The Jugged Hare' just a short way down the road but also accessible from inside the hotel. ,5,2015,10,25
128,Amazing Hotel,Absolutely amazing hotel. Was easy to reach via the tube. Staff were all very kind and helpful. Club double room was great and so was the access to the club lounge. My GF was very impressed with this bit of her birthday present. Breakfast was really good with a great choice and attentive staff. Really good memories.,5,2015,10,24
128,The Best Hotel In London and The World!! ,"We stayed here as a surprise for my girlfriends birthday and as soon as we stepped into the lobby we knew we were going to be in for a treat. 

The hotel staff are so polite, helpful and friendly. No request is too much. 
They held our bags whilst we weren't out as the room was not quite ready as we arrived before 2pm check in. 
When we arrived later on I. The evening the bags were presented in the room and as I had told them it's was my girlfriends birthday they delivered. 

The hotel gave us an upgrade to one of their beautiful club rooms and had provided champagne, cupcakes, balloons, fruit, water and covered the bed with rose petals. The room was amazing, massive and a really comfy bed. 

In the morning the hotel even provided complimentary breakfast which is usually £24.95 each. This was served in the adjacent Jugged Hare Pub and was again amazing. 

I want to personally thank all staff at the Montcalm Brewery London City. Absolutely amazing!!!",5,2015,10,21
128,Nice hotel with exellent stuff,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Hotel. The highlight of all experience was Concierge service, specially Vlad Jafanovs - What a person---intelligent, patient and always happy to help. Huge thank u

Other plus is location...Tubes are 3 min away, very convenient.
I would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,10,20
128,Such a nice place to stay!,"This hotel is located in walking distance from Moorgate. It's staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and the service provided is nothing but top notch. It's a bit expensive as you'd expect from this area, but a very good choice nonetheless!",5,2015,10,20
128,Nice hotel with excellent staff,"Rooms are in a very good reception, very nice and helpful staff. We had a very pleasant stay at this Hotel. The only thing that could have been better is the connection to the tube stations. However, there is a bus station directly in front of the hotel.
All in all I can really recommend this Hotel!",4,2015,10,20
128,Evening away!,"We went here for an evening away. We were disappointed when we got to our room and the floor was wet and smelt, it also wasn't very clean. However the staff were amazing, they changed our room for us when we went out and also gave us some room freebies and took off the charge of our breakfasts. We were very satisfied with the outcome and they were so apologetic, they did say the room was out of order and there had been a hiccup. The level of service is excellent and I would highly recommend.",5,2015,10,18
128,Birthday ,Although rather further out than we would have liked to be we found this hotel to be a gem. Check in perfect room perfect service more than perfect. An added bonus its own pub. The jugged hare good beer good ambience and good company. 3-30 on a Friday and totally rammed. This hotel on the site of an old brewery was great although keeping up with the modern day still kept the character of yesteryear's brewery. I would recommend and would return. ,4,2015,10,18
128,Great Place to Stay in the City,"Booked here just for one night before attending a morning meeting at Moorgate. The plus points are:
Great location (you can easily walk to the City rather than battling with the crowds on the Tube)
Very friendly staff. Lots of smiles :)
The building itself is full of character being (as the name suggests) an old brewery
I had a Club room. The bed was massive and really comfy so I had a great night's sleep.
I know rates go up and down. I paid c£160 in breakfast. For London I thought that was really good value.

The negative:
Even on a Sunday night in the City, there was still a bit of traffic noise. It didn't stop me sleeping (due to the comfy bed), but I was aware of it.

I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,10,18
128,Highly Recommend the 'Montcalm at the Brewery' Hotel- Excellent Service & Great Location,I stayed at the Montcalm Hotel earlier this month on a colleague's recommendation. I'm delighted I did and this hotel has become my default hotel of choice when staying in London. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortably decorated. The staff are excellent- extremely attentive and very professional. Room service was delivered promptly and the food was of a very high standard. I can't praise this hotel highly enough and I'm looking forward to returning next week.,5,2015,10,17
128,"Nice, quirky but small rooms","I stayed at The Montcalm for one night whilst travelling on business. The Reception is small but interestingly styled. The Concierge led the way to the room as they can be difficult to find, accessed via a courtyard rather than from Reception.

My room was very small, and at first I assumed that the room didn't have a window, and the curtains were for decoration only. However, sure enough there was a tiny narrow window behind the curtains. I think the curtains were to stop you looking out!

Whilst the room was small (and almost windowless), the fixtures and fittings were good quality, the decor was pleasant, and the bed was comfortable. That's perfect whilst staying on business, but I'd perhaps wish there was a window if staying for pleasure.

Whilst it didn't affect me at all, when I checked out there was a lady in Reception complaining about the noise from the courtyard and from banging doors.",4,2015,10,17
128,"Good Location, Lovely Hotel",Only stayed for one night but a great hotel.  Just off Finsbury Square so good for the City.  Easy access to the tube.  Hotel staff friendly and efficient.  Hotel is based in an old brewery so has imaginative layout.  If you arrive back after 10pm you either need to ask the staff for assistance to your room or have a good sense of direction.,5,2015,10,16
128,Lovely hotel but small rooms,"I stay here quite a lot on business and overall it's a lovely hotel but it depends on what room you stay in as I've found some on the small side.

Rooms in the building over the road are bigger but you can't check out there so have to come back over the road to the main reception 

I'm also not keen on having to pay extra for room service 

Wifi is free and works well

I can never work out how to switch all the lights out!!!! 

Overall it's nice and the staff are very helpful but it's expensive",4,2015,10,15
128,Quirky and fun but did not live up to the expectations,"Having read the other reviews here I feel we probably missed out a bit. While the reception area has a very interesting design and the staff was very helpful, our room was located below ground floor with a view from the window towards a huge fan. The bed was very soft to be honest. Other than that, it is a great quality hotel and as long as you don't get a room below ground floor, you should be fine!",3,2015,10,15
128,Average but not a luxury experience!,"I stayed at Montcalm at the Brewery for 5 nights. Overall I walk away from this place thinking why is it classified as 5 star luxury boutique? Hence the review to align expectations for future travelers like myself.

Positives
1. Staff is friendly and polite.
2. Location is great

Not so Positives
I arrived at the hotel few hours early on the day of my check in. After 14 hour flight I made a polite request if I could be accommodated earlier. Despite having reservation for 5 nights I was sadly only given a room @ 1:30pm. Again this is not there fault but usually my former experience has dictated a better outcome.

Negatives
1. Despite staying with them for 5 nights we were only given 2 bottles of complementary water. No water offered for the next 4 days or during turn down service. Imagine reaching your room at 10pm at night and you can't even find water?

2. Very inconsistent room service. Again replacing of toiletries such as bath gel and shower cap is discretionary and you can't assume they will automatically do it. Twice I was caught short once I had no shower gel other time no shower cap. Imagine standing naked in cold bathroom and discovering this? Not a very forgiving or pleasant experience.

3. On the final day of check out which I thought would be quick since they had charged me during checkin full price of stay. However no such luck as the house keeping had incorrectly added a bottle of Prosecco to my room. I had informed them during my check in that I will be leaving early morning to catch a flight. If they had any outstanding amounts I would have appreciated a knock on my door the night before. 

Again had I known the hotel does not provide water or bath gel I would have made my own arrangements but than to call itself luxury boutique is misleading. 

Sadly, It was not a value for money experience for me. I will stick to business hotels for more consistent service. ",3,2015,10,15
128,Fabulous,"Lovely hotel with excellent staff.  We ate in the hotel's restaurant The Jugged Hare which as next door but accessible from within the hotel.  Very convenient for the Barbican Centre.

We stayed in a Club Room which was excellent.  Wonderful comfortable bed and extremely clean room.  Mini-bar and tea/coffee making facilities.",5,2015,10,14
128,"Great location, very small room!","The Montcalm has both its good and weak points. First the good - The location is great, right in the center of the city, with everything closeby. I also enjoyed their steam room when I was there. Very private - I was the only one there using it! The room itself is tiny, but well equipped with everything I need. All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Montcalm!",4,2015,10,13
128,City hotel in historic surroundings,"We had a weekend break at what is probably, judging by the location and set up of our room, a busy week-time business hotel, next to the Barbican Centre.  The hotel is situated in the original 18th century Georgian Whitbread brewery.  It is like a rabbit warren inside, but there is good internal signage and we were shown to our room, so nota proble getting about.  I was just glad someone else was carrying my case.  We had a club room which as part of its contemporary furnishing featured a very high, but luxurious bed; comfortable seat as well as a desk, rainfall shower over a bath and Hermes toiletries.  We had complimentary fruit and water on arrival.   It was easy to get the temperature right in the room, and also underfloor heating for bathroom.  We needed room service one night and staff were very accommodating when we wanted something lighter than on the menu.  In fact all staff we encountered were very professional, respectful and helpful.   The hotel has its own pub, the Jugged Hare, and dining rooms attached (the latter closed for a wedding) or there are a few other offerings around.   Being close to Liverpool St, Moorgate and Barbican tubes/stations as well as busiest is easy to get about town.  No parking at the hotel, but we parked cheaply at the Barbican Centre.   We did not use the spa facilities, but in any event I found the hotel very comfortable and relaxing, and would be happy to come here again.",4,2015,10,13
128,"Generally great, but some oddities","I stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery while I attended a conference. I was pleased upon check-in to find out that I had been upgraded, and that my room rate included breakfast (at the charming pub 'Rugged Hare' next door - which, mind you, was absolutely a hot-spot for after-work drinks). The hotel is lovely, very well appointed and impeccably clean, and staff are courteous and polite. I was a bit surprised that the desk chair in my room was in disrepair, but wasn't too fussed. However, this definitely ranks among the most poorly designed bathrooms I've ever seen (maybe only slightly above the hotel with a toilet & a shower, and only one door between them). The bathroom was ridiculously large, and yet had zero counter space for toiletries; there was just enough room on the sink for a cup to hold a toothbrush, and dish on the towel rack for the provided toiletries. The sink was so small it was impossible not to wash the floor every time I used it, & it was extremely low - I'm 5'4"" and it hit me mid-way between hip & knee. Despite the incredibly roomy bathroom, the toilet and sink were crowded beside each other, and the makeup mirror (light broken) was mounted so that you had to sit on the toilet to use it. Definitely detracted from how nice the rest of the room was. Pictures attached of the weird bathroom.

The fitness centre was very small - 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 bike & some dumbbells, and very hot. But it was empty, so fine for it's purpose. But be aware you may need to walk outside to get there.",4,2015,10,13
128,Montcalm Excellent place to stay,"Great city location, rooms were well equipped and luxurious.  The staff are second to none, they were so helpful and courteous.   Easy walking distance to Liverpool St, Moorgate and Barbican.  Situated right next to the Barbican so great for Theatre.  Quiet street so not noisy over night.",5,2015,10,13
128,Glass walls are great fun for people who are childish. Just saying.,"I decided to surprise my wife and booked us into this fantastic Hotel for her Birthday. The Professional photographer has presented this premises with some beautiful images and I can tell you the images don't lie. It is a stunning Hotel.
As you walk towards the door you are greeted by a suited and top hat doorman. 
The welcome was warm and we were dealt with very quickly at the reception, with a warm face towel, which was nice after our journey.
We were taken to our room and on route we were given a history of the building tour. The staff clearly have to know their stuff and it made a nice change from walking through corridors with no clue as to where you're going.
The room was stunning' although the bed was smaller than I had anticipated, however it was an extremely comfortable bed. 
The wall between bathroom and bedroom was glass, so a lot of fun was had by pressing myself against the glass, like a fly on a windscreen. whilst having a shower. unfortunately you can lower a electric blind to hide your modesty if you of the shy type. My wife was constantly amused to see the blind being raised whilst i sat on the loo pulling poo face... Not! Like I said, much fun to be had here. If you're planning on booking a hotel book this one just for the glass toilet wall.
Like most hotel mini bars they are pricey. This wasn't to bad and was reasonably stocked, although no encouragement was required.
Late check out to which was great after a heavy night out. 
This hotel truly is great and located in between two underground stations, of equal distance. The Barbican or Moorgate.

Totally enjoyed my stay here, hope you do to. Hopefully they have cleaned the glass wall by now.....",5,2015,10,12
128,Very nice & quiet hotel,"We really enjoyed our 2 nights stay in this lovely hotel which was once a brewery (the crescent building dates back to 1759). We had a nicely decorated room although pretty small. Clean, nice bathroom, comfortable bed with good quality linen, very quiet at night because the room was located in the inner courtyard. The staff especially the concierge was very friendly and helpful. Why did we not give 5 green dots? It's just too expensive for what you get (but unfortunately London is among the most expensive cities in the world especially in regard of hotel prices). Overall it did not feel like a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star one.",4,2015,10,12
128,Beautiful,"Spent the night here as our work was attending an awards ceremony. My room was perfect, I was shown to my room and shown around my room. There was everything! If you have the money you can raid the fully stocked mini-bar, sweets, crisps and anything you could possibly want. 

It was immaculate and I felt thoroughly spoilt, very out of place wandering through reception in my trainers!

Well recommended as a treat, cant wait to take my husband here.",5,2015,10,12
128,"Quality, comfortable, chic hotel in historic brewery","i love unique hotels like this one.  It's very well designed, with architectural details remaining from the old brewery remaining wherever possible adding a hip, chic ambience.  The staff are professional and lovely.

Our  king room was superb, comfortable, and air conditioned.  No views, but convenience and quality were why we chose this particular hotel.  We had a lovely queen room on the 4th floor the first night, with the old brewery roof as our ceiling, so cool.  However, a surprising drawback for a hotel of this ilk was the queen bed.... With all that luxury, the mattress was one of those with no integrity on the sides, so if you're sleeping with a 6' 4"" like my husband, you'll be rolling off like I was all night!  

Due to it's historic details and conversion, it's a bit of a rabbit warren, so if you're easily confused, bear this in mind.  (My old Mum would be lost for days!). However, if you do get lost, you're likely to eventually find the 'Club Lounge' where you can always enjoy refreshments, and free drinks and light bites of an evening.  The decor in the Club Lounge is very tired, (I think it dates back to brewery days).  I consider it a ploy to discourage lingering and feasting.  I certainly worked on us. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,10,12
128,Brilliantly located for the Barbican,"Our first stay at a Montcalm and we were very impressed. We chose the hotel because of its location: two minutes' walk from the Barbican. The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating from booking and throughout our stay, providing a child's bed in our room, upgrading us so we had more space, advising us on travel and allowing us a late check-out time.  An excellent breakfast is included, as are drinks and snacks in a club lounge if you stay in a club room, which made the room rate good value for central London.  Our room was clean and well-appointed.  We'd recommend it highly.",5,2015,10,11
128,Lovely hotel,"Spent one night here with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. Booked the Club double room but got upgraded when checking in to a Montcalm Club room which was nice and unexpected. Despite there being a bit of confusion about where our bags were that we had dropped off in the morning (they had been taken up to our room), the check in (and equally the check out) process was smooth.  The staff at reception and concierge were friendly and welcoming.  Our room was fantastic. With a large LCD TV, an espresso machine, a good section of teas, fresh fruit, cup cakes, and water bottles.  All of which were complimentary. The mini bar was also well stocked. Our comfy queen sized bed with lots of soft pillows had towels shaped into two doves forming a heart on it and red petals scattered around which was a nice touch. The bathroom was also similarly well fitted out with a well sized bath with a rainfall shower head. There is also a control so you can listen to the TV or radio while relaxing in the bath. Our room was on the third floor so we could not hear any noise from the streets outside or from the function rooms on ten ground floor. We both had a really good nights sleep. 

Breakfast is served in the Jugged Hard pub which is connected to the hotel. Unfortunately, and the reason why this hotel loses a star from me, it seems this is not really big enough for the size of the hotel as when we arrived there was a 10 minute wait to be seated. Additionally breakfast was also a buffet which I would not expect to find for a hotel of this quality. I would much prefer a waited service where you could order a hot breakfast that was prepared to the way you wanted.  Our breakfast came with our room fee but had it not I would instead go to the Côte restaurant nearby, which I have found to do a really good breakfast. 

I would still recommend this hotel just because our room was fantastic but would advise against the breakfast.",4,2015,10,11
128,5 Stars all the way,"Excellent Hotel, Exceptional Staff through out. Club Lounge nice touch. The weather was miserable on our stay but the Hotel and particularly the staff brightened up our stay, A proper 5 Star experience.",5,2015,10,11
128,"Lovely hotel, if you get the right room!","On arrival, the hotel is stunning, beautifully maintained with exceptionally friendly & helpful staff. Checking in was very speedy and then we were escorted up to our room by concierge who insisted on taking our overnight bags - he was very informative of the hotel's history & where everything was should be need anything. Once in the room, it was a fairly small room but very nicely decorated and clean. Unfortunately we had an issue with the bathroom blind as it wouldn't shut so called reception who said it couldn't be fixed yet but would move us to a different room immediately & were extremely apologetic for any inconvenience caused. The new room was still a club double but almost twice the size with an equally huge bathroom however we realised much later that it was directly over the pub. This wasn't an issue through the afternoon but when we returned from dinner the noise was extremely loud through the floorboards & went on until just after 12. Also having been in a room at the cross road, there was traffic noise all through the night which obviously can't be helped but isn't ideal if you're a light sleeper. We were also woken up fairly early by the noise of the pub setting up for breakfast. We ate breakfast at The Jugged Hare which was really nice and actually one of the better breakfasts we've eaten in London hotels. It was also good to see that there was an internal walkway from the hotel to pub so that you didn't have to go outside. All-in-all, the service was great & we probably would return but would just make sure we request a room far from the pub & also the road.",4,2015,10,07
128,not so great,"We checked in mid-day after arriving via the Chunnel Train and were given a room with a handicapped bathroom that had a sink that was about three inches wide and no room for toiletries.  The person checking us in did NOT tell us it was a room for handicapped visitors.   We tried to make do in this room by moving a small table into the bathroom for toiletries.  It was very inconvenient.   The bathroom was huge and not practical for an able bodied guest, why didn't someone give us an option or heads-up?   

There was only instant coffee in the room (terrible) and the light switches to turn on the coffee area where on the other side the bed, far from the coffee area. 

When we complained to the front desk about the being put in this room and finding the inconveniences unpleasant, they offered us a complimentary breakfast the next morning, which we accepted.  It NEVER was delivered to us.  

The first morning I woke up, the personnel at the front desk, I suppose from never seeing me before, gazed at me in an unfriendly way, as though I was a trespasser. 

Right after we checked in, a person knocked on our door to replenish the minibar, a task I would think would happen before entered the room.

I know this is considered a high end hotel, but I did not have that experience at all.   They sent an email after I checked out, offering me better services when I return, but that requires that I decide to stay there again and I am not sure I will.",3,2015,10,07
128,Very nice.,"Having arrived at the Montcalm for an award ceremony being held there I was made to feel welcome from the start.

The smart door staff guide you to reception where we were dealt with immediately. It was refreshing to go into a welcoming reception area and not have to queue to get checked in. The reception staff were very polite and very attentive. 

I was taken to my gorgeous room where the gentleman explained all the features of the room. 
The room is spacious and very comfortable. There is everything in your room you could possibly need from bathrobes to shoe horns.

The function itself was spectacular and staff were excellent all the way through my stay.
This hotel has to be one of the best I have stayed in in London. The staff can literally not do enough for you.

Thank you for a lovely stay. I will stay again.

Regards

John browne",4,2015,10,06
128,Memorable for all thr RIGHT reasons,"at first glance the hotel doesn't seem like much, just a few pubs lining the streets. That is until you look a little closer and notice the unmistakable charm of the brewery conversion. in keeping with the history of the place itself but matching the high quality one would expect from a 5* hotel. right from the beginning i was met with smiles and warmth from everyone and more than looked after by all staff. I booked a room for my girlfriends birthday and the entire hotels staff were nothing but accommodating. I would happily stay there again and will be recommending the hotel to everyone i know. if i could give more than 5 stars i would. amazing service all round! thank you!",5,2015,10,06
128,Excellent overnight stay,"We stayed here overnight during a visit to London. Our room was in a building across the road from the main hotel - quirky but perfectly comfortable, quiet and well equipped.  Reception was warm and the staff very obliging and polite.  Our only problem was finding the place, as we booked for ""London City Suites"" whereas the hotel is signed ""The Montcalm"".  But we figured it out eventually.",5,2015,10,06
128,Perfect Position to see all of London,"Club room. We stayed on a Saturday, all the public parts of the hotel very glamorous, we were watching a show in the afternoon so wanted to be able to get to the west end easily, but I always prefer staying in the City/ East end and this hotel is in a perfect position for both. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms a decent size and facilities fantastic also, the pub on the corner is effectively the hotel bar and the area for pbreakfast in the morning. Breakfast had so much choice and its a fantastic setting .",5,2015,10,05
128,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"We have just returned from a stay ay the Montcalm and the Brewery and it was amazing from start to finish, we were checked in by fantastic staff who wished my wife happy birthday and surprised us later on in the day with a card and cupcakes left in the room for us.... a very thoughtful and nice surprise. All the staff were so friendly and polite.

The hotel is beautiful and rooms definitely had the wow factor being both modern and stylish with a great bathroom. We had breakfast the next day arranged by the hotel at the gastro pub next door... the Jugged Hare. Food was lovely with a great selection. We did not have a single complaint and can't wait to stay here again.",5,2015,10,05
128,"Gorgeous hotel, great staff, great location","An amazing secret hotel, the staff were fantastic from the very beginning, the location of course is central and handy, just a few minutes walk to the tube, we loved the decor, the room, the breakfast at the pub nearby, everything was wonderful, thank you!",5,2015,10,05
128,Not always calm ...,"This is a lovely hotel tucked away behind the Barbican in The City. It has an impressive facade and the staff were very efficient at booking us in and taking us to our room. It was quite a small room but the bathroom was lovely and as we were staying over for a theatre visit, the actual size of the room wasn't too important. What did bother me was that when we returned from the theatre later that night, there was the noise of music coming from downstairs which was quite loud, plus very noisy neighbours coming and going until about 2am which made for a very restless nights sleep. The next morning, we had a lovely breakfast in their restaurant at The Jugged Hare, but as my partner commented, as you have to go to the corner of the road to get there, it wouldn't be ideal if it were raining.
Overall, this is a lovely hotel - it just needs sound-proofing!

128,A really great week end,"We stayed in The Montcalm while we were celebrating our Ruby wedding anniversary with a weekend in London.
We could not have been given a better welcome by the staff of the Montcalm. All staff seemed to know this was a special weekend for us and we met with a very warm welcome and received sincere wishes for a good weekend by all the staff.
Even our room was specially decorated for the occasion.
And what a great hotel! Luxurious and convenient. We did not have a single complaint and will definitely look to stay here again",5,2015,10,04
128,If you get the right room this is one very nice and stylish hotel!,"We stayed at this hotel for a wedding also hosted at the hotel. First impressions were great, welcoming staff, impressive reception and very quick and easy check in- definitely had the wow factor!
Very happy and pleased with our room, clean, modern, stylish, luxurious with lots of nice details like dressing table LED lamp, good lighting and lots of mirrors (great for getting ready for a wedding) nice high bouncy soft bed we slept very well......however.....!
My Mum & Stepdad and sister and boyfriend had two rooms opposite to us, which they had paid more for as they were supposedly 'club rooms' and they were staying for 2 nights. 
They were not very nice at all!
Dark, dingy, not as modern and a bit tired looking! They didn't have any mirrors (not great for getting ready for a wedding) and their bathroom was no where near as nice as ours. Theirs did not have the wow factor at all.
Great hotel but it does depend on what room you get as there was quite a difference. My review would not be so complimentary if I'd had one of their rooms!
All in all we personally had a great stay and would come again....but would ask for the same room again to be safe! ",4,2015,10,04
128,Fantastic Hotel,"I've stayed here on business twice now and each time it has been a pleasure. Friendly staff, extremely attentive to detail and the rooms are fantastic! 

The location is good with Moorgate and Barbican tubes only a 5/10 minute walk away and London Liverpool Street just a bit further... plus The Barbican itself is just next door.",5,2015,10,04
128,Incompetent reservation staff and management,"I should preface this by saying that this review does not reflect on the staff of the Montcalm at the Brewery, because I never got a chance to stay there. Please see other reviews to evaluate the accomodations and service at the hotel. 

I booked a 2 night stay at the Montcalm via the hotel's website. I found a rate of 253 GBP/night for a Montcalm Club room and booked it about 2 weeks before my visit. Immediately after I completed the reservation process, I received an email with the words ""pre-arrival"" in the subject line. The message starts off saying thank you for choosing to stay with us, and then it proceeds to describe information about the destination. 

The morning of my stay, while looking for directions to the hotel, I realized that I never got a confirmation number, so I called up the hotel to make sure that everything was ok. Of course, things weren't ok. The hotel had no record of my reservation, and the reservations agent had to call me back after figuring out the situation. He wrote back saying that the Montcalm at the Brewery London City Hotel is fully booked, and offered  10% off a Club double room rate at the Marble Arch location for £336.00 for 2 nights’ accommodation. 

Needless to say, I was unhappy that my hotel reservation was lost, and the Marble Arch location was not convenient given my business in London. Nonetheless, I called back to confirm that reservation only to be connected with a new reservations agent. This agent had no record of my previous interactions and took it upon herself to re-do all the steps taken by the previous agent. She then contacted me to confirm that I never had a reservation, possibly due to a ""website glitch"" (though there was never an actual apology). I explained that I was already informed of this fact and that I wanted a solution. She had to call me back about this, and hours later I got the same offer as the previous email--except that this deal was for 336GBP PER NIGHT, not for two days! She made it sound like it was a major concession for the hotel to give me this rate, which was 10% off the rack rate for the room. No other attempt was made to rectify the situation, so I instead got an Executive suite at the Hilton Angel Islington for half the price. 

I have done a lot of travel over the past 15 years, and I've never encountered such a poorly trained and mismanaged reservation staff. I can assume that mistakes happen and that such ""glitches"" happen at every large hotel. What is appalling, however, is that this mistake was compounded by such a pathetic effort to make it right. Fortunately, I know London well enough that I was able to figure out an alternative plan, but I can only imagine what would happen to an exhausted tourist arriving off of a long intercontinental flight.",1,2015,10,04
128,"Wonderful location, amazing service, perfect stay","So many hotels claim to be 5 star and don't quite deliver.  No fear of that at the London City Montcalm where the service is fantastic and the details are thought through.  The hotel very kindly upgraded us to a club room so we got a complimentary continental breakfast in the club lounge.  We were there for my partner's 40th and when they asked at check in if we were celebrating anything and told them, they decorated the bed while we were out and left macarons as gifts.  The room feels luxurious with Hermes toiletries, a large bed, lovely coffee cups, expensive bathrooms fittings etc.  soundproofing was excellent - I didn't hear anything from inside the hotel and we were right next to another room, so you can normally hear doors opening and closing etc.

I can normally find some detail that's been overlooked in even a 5 star hotel, but cannot think of a thing.  Despite being a continental buffet for breakfast, a waitress still took drinks orders and brought them to our table, and the food quality at the buffet was excellent.  Services was friendly and discreet.  Overall, an excellent experience and highly recommended.",5,2015,10,04
128,A Cozy Hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights. Staff is nice and helpful.  It is stylish, bed is high and comfortable. Bathroom is small but provides all the functions. Everything's nice except the bath towels are too old, they left some white fiber on my body every time I use them to wipe myself, of course you can use hairdryer to blow them away from your body. I will choose it again next time for business trip to city of london.",4,2015,10,02
128,Superior Service,"Stayed for a night and really enjoyed a great nights sleep in a very well appointed room.  The staff were very helpful and a special note of thanks is due to Duty Manager Alice for assistance above and beyond expectation.

128,"Staff attententive, helpful and very professional.","Hotel and rooms are chic, well appointment, modern, clean with all the things you expect from a top hotel in London but without the extortionate price tag.

Perfect for business or pleasure. Highly recommended.",4,2015,10,02
128,Stunning hotel - perfect for a special occassion,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel on our wedding night in early August 2015. We booked a regular room as we thought by the time we get to the hotel we'd be shattered anyways and will just pass out until we leave again. When we arrived at the hotel after the ceremony (before the evening reception) they saw the beautiful bride in her wedding dress they imidiatelly upgraded us to a juinor suite across the road. It was the most incredible suite with a big bedroom and a large living room with kitchen and a spacious and bathroom. This was ideal as we had a few people in the room to make the bride look even better (which I didn't think was possible!). So we had plenty of space, everyone could relax and the actual wedding night after the reception was just pure bliss! We didn't want to leave - but had a honeymoon to go on to :)

Staff: absolute top - from the receptionist to the lovely guy that helped us with our luggage (mostly the brides!)
Cleaniness: stop on! 
Rooms: At least the suite... absolutely increadible
Food/Restaurant: I can't comment on the restaurant - but we ordered a large breakfast to the room which arrived fast. Everything was there - and it was delicious. 
Location: Ideal in my view - it's sort of in the middle of many things so you can real all very easily (close to Angel, Shoreditch, the City, Holborn, Farringdon, South Bank, West End)

Would I recommend this to anyone? Without a doubt! Especially for a special occassion like we had. 

Thanks again to the very friendly and attentive staff!",5,2015,10,01
128,Elegant.....but at a cost ,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights as our friends were getting married there. 

The reception staff (both arriving and leaving) were exceptional. The gentleman who checked us in dealt with a query I had about my booking payment swiftly and promptly. Unfortunately I didn't get his name but he deserved a special mention. 

All staff we came across were professional and all were smiling.  What a difference that made. 

The room was disappointingly  small for what we had paid, however was very plush. 

We were given an upgrade for continental breakfast and that was greatly appreciated. The Club Lounge is an oasis of calm and food delicious.  

The hotel is located near to several tube stations and easily accessible. 

Would we stay here again? Most definitely yes. 

Would we recommend this hotel? Most certainly.  ",5,2015,09,29
128,Very plush,"Great stay in a super stylish room. All the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was great. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom set up was ""different"" and fun. Book Room 228 and all will be revealed.
One small point. The staff were unaware that the hotel TV had Sky Sport which meant we almost went out to find a bar showing the match which would have cost them revenue.",5,2015,09,28
128,Home from Home,"I continue to be impressed by the quality of staff at all levels and the high standard at which hotel rooms and all facilities are maintained, particularly the warm welcome provided by both the staff outside the hotel and front of house reception
This hotel is the only one I have frequented over many years and will continue to stay at for the foreseeable future
A haven in a busy world",5,2015,09,28
128,loved it...amazing staff..great customer service all round!,"we went to stay for my fiances 30th birthday. I explained the day before it was a special occasion and they said they would do something to make it special. When we arrived they upgraded us to a club room and gave us free breakfast as a birthday present. when we arrived in the room i was a tiny bit dissapointed there was no acknowledgement of his birthday like some rose petals or a cupcake but was so impressed by the rom with its glass wall to the bathroom and the exceptional espresso machine i was over it in 30 seconds, but then as though they read my mind i got a phone call to apologise and say they had our original room ready with some birthday suprises but because we had been upgraded nobody had time to move the things over, and within 5 minutes they brought us a tray with some very nice chianti wine 2 cupcakes and lots of lovely macaroons. Such a lovely touch. ps. the bath is enormous i was sinking as i'm fairly short i just loved it as did my partner. My only advice is it is located in the city of london so basically all shops are closed on the weekend. but within 10 minutes walk you have the whole of london on your doorstep. cant fault them loved it and will be returning for sure!",5,2015,09,28
128,Good location,"Good room once I found it through the maze. Just couldn't turn off all the lights to sleep, so had to pull the card out of the slot. Very comfortable bed, quirky feature in the room with a glass panel along the side of the bath so unless you had the blind down your partner had a perfect view of you using the bathroom! Great breakfast.

128,"Fabulous, everything about this place is just fabulous.","My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights a few years ago for my birthday weekend (the dates didn't go back far enough so I put April last year) it was also the weekend of the royal wedding. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are amazing, we upgraded to a suite that was lovely. There was 2 bathrooms in our suite. The bed had pretty little fairy light above it, was very pretty. The location is perfect. Very friendly staff. We only live 30 mins away on the fast train so visit London often. Wiould def recommend this hotel. I will book again to stay here.",5,2015,09,27
128,Happy wedding guest,"What a gorgeous hotel. Sadly only stayed for one day for a wedding and the staff were fabulous. Really kind and attentive, and unfailingly professional. The food was to die for. We used the nearby Barbican car park which is a bargain. Will endeavour to return for a weekend break asap.",5,2015,09,27
128,GPS Required,"Expansive but good.  Restaurant crazy prices.  And if you Andre a couple and one wants english breakfast and the other continental they are different restaurants.

Breakfast service was truly terrible. Had to wait ages to be seated .... It's too small for the size of hotel.

Oh, and it's and old brewery converted to a hotel. Take a GPS with you, it's a maze to try to find your room 

Staff were lovely, and hotel nice and clean ",4,2015,09,27
128,Wedding stay ,"We stayed here for two nights on a weekend where we also got married here. We didn't get off to the best start with our reservation having been cancelled in error by Montcalm Group Bookings. Fortunately, the duty manager sorted it out and was very apologetic, even ensuring we checked out smoothly two days later.  Throughout our stay the hotel staff were exceptionally warm, friendly and professional. 

The hotel itself is well located and opulent. We had a Wow Suite which was lovely, comfortable and roomy with a four poster and glass walled bath. 

Our suite faced the road by the entrance and lacked sound-proofing to the Windows but a super comfy bed made up for this (and with the a/c on we could actually hear very little). 

We visited the wellness area (which took some finding!) but there was no real changing room and only one towel available at the steam/sauna, neither of which heated up very well, but it was a nice thought. 

We did walk into the Club Lounge twice but it was packed on both occasions. Fortunately the inclusive breakfast at the Jugged Hare was much quieter and the food was very good - service was amazing the first day but terrible the second although we put that down to an individual's poor attitude. 

Overall, we had a wonderful wedding and stay. ",5,2015,09,27
128,Stunning hotel... wish we could have stayed longer.,Booked to stay for my partner's 40th. The hotel itself is gorgeous. The room was lovely. The bed was so comfy..  my partner who always has difficulty sleeping in hotels slept like a log. The staff and customer service was outstanding.. That's what really made our stay special. Very helpful and courteous. People may say you should expect that in a hotel of this rating but it is rare to find these days. Thank you for a great stay.,5,2015,09,27
128,"Lovely, relaxing hotel with nice, quiet rooms",We stayed for 1 night and found The Montcalm to be extremely relaxing and very comfortable. Our room was very quiet and the staff were extremely helpful and very accommodating. We didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. We would definitely stay again,5,2015,09,24
128,Luxurious stay,"On arrival at the hotel you are greeted and your bags taken from you. All staff are extremely helpfull and friendly. We were even given complimentary check out for 2pm instead of 12.

We stayed in a double room - The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and they had a water fall shower in the bathroom. In addition the bathroom products were elemis. 

Continental breakfast was delicious and went on till 11am - great if you like a lie in. 

When leaving the hotel we were given free bag check and they offered to get us a taxi. 

Felt the hotel exceeded expectations, and would definitely be visiting again should we return to London. ",5,2015,09,24
128,Great value for money - Luxury!,"The gist: 
Great location
Great price
Excellent customer service
Good facilities 
Strong attempt at 'the details' but not nailing this let them down
I would absolutely recommend 

I stayed here last weekend following my Open Uni graduation at the Barbican. This hotel is a stones throw from the building and £15 in a cab from St Pancras - Ideal! 

My boyfriend and I had one room and my parents were in another. We arrived at 11am to drop off our bags and we were able to check into our rooms early. My Dad explained it was my graduation and they arrived with a card for me (although it was addressed to a Mr Payne so if you read this Mr Payne - congrats, we were probably at the same ceremony)! We also later received a card and cupcakes which were addressed to my Dad congratulating him on his daughters graduation - same card in both rooms. 

We chose our selections for room scent and pillow type but were put in each others rooms so that was lost on us.

Mini bar was well stocked and priced about the same as the local pubs. The bar/restaurant on the corner, the Jarred Hare is part of the hotel - no Bacardi! but other white rum available. 

The hotel is like a maze! There are 3 wings and we got lost a number of times - it added to the charm though. 

All staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and polite (and happy to give directions to lost guests which must be really tiring for them)! 

We did go into the lounge (between 5-7 complementary drinks and snacks) - great selection of everything except beer (only peroni) so we didn't stay.

Breakfast was nice - we had full English and it was as you would expect. 

My parents had some trouble as the screen in their bathroom was not working - they reported this when we checked in and on our return in the evening this was not fixed. They were however then moved to a suite. The hotel admitted that a few of the rooms have broken screens. Due to the fact they were moved, their complementary fruit etc was not moved with them but they did not raise this. I have a feeling the hotel did come up in the afternoon to repair the screen but came to my room instead of theirs.

Overall I would stay here again and I would recommend to others, however the devil is in the detail! Adding personalised touches would be impressive if done correctly.",5,2015,09,23
128,Even better than I remembered ,"Had a perfect nights stay in this tucked away luxury boutique hotel just around the corner from Barbican & Moorgate stations. 
Staff are all friendly & helpful they don't just giving you your key card at the front desk they carry your bag up into your room. 

Rooms could not impress more lovely classic clean deco, espresso coffee machine, complementary water & fruit plus a fully stocked mini-bar (at a charge). Free wifi & iPod station. 
Bathrooms are compact in size but do include a large bath & rainforest shower which was just great. All toiletries are included, robes are hidden in a bag within the wardrobe. 
The queen size beds are so comfortable also has the best pillows. 
We chose to have our breakfast (full English) sent to our room it came on time requested. Everything was still hot and the coffee was lovely. 
This was our second visit to this hotel can't wait to stay again. ",5,2015,09,23
128,Surprise treat,"I had no idea where we were staying and when we arrived I was very impressed. The rain had pouring we were soaked the staff were welcoming and helpful. The Montcalm offers lovely little touches that you appreciate. We were upgraded to a Club room which was super giving us the benefits of the Club lounge. The bedroom was superb and the bed incredibly comfortable. We were made to feel ""at home"" by the staff who delivered a professional level of service but with approachability and humour. A perfect break than you.",5,2015,09,23
128,Excellent hotel,This was the perfect hotel for a weekend away in London. Stylish boutique hotel with very pleasant staff. I can highly recommend it. The breakfast was good with items cooked to order. Service very good and pub is attached to the hotel if you want a drink. Although very busy as rugby World Cup was on. ,4,2015,09,22
128,Luxury and service at its finest,"A perfect one night stay at this luxury hotel with character, charm and exceptional service.  Every staff member we encountered was charming and professional and provided a quick and pleasant check in and check out service.  The complimentary upgraded room and delicious cupcakes for our anniversary was a lovely touch.  As was the romantic turn down service provided on our return from Dinner.  Our room was spotless and had all the modern facilities one would expect.  Free wifi was fast and fully available during our stay.  The bathroom was stunning - well laid out, a fabulous rain shower and quality toiletries.  Lots of lovely white towels and great lighting and mirrors.  Our bed was comfortable and we slept well without noise or interruption from other guests or staff.  This hotel is situated a little away from the main shopping areas but is perfect for Liverpool Street Station, the Barbican, St Paul's and a 10 minute walk from the One New Change building with some lovely shops, eateries and bars.  I loved this hotel, its interior style, ambience, staff and facilities and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,09,22
128,A warm welcome,"I was immediately struck by the friendly staff at The Montcalm as we checked in. The hotel is developed within the confines of an old brewery (Whitbread I believe) so is not typical of so many hotels with their vast reception areas. Instead the atmosphere is one of a club, or a lobby of a traditional (and rather well furnished) company headquarters.

Quickly checked in, we were informed we'd been upgraded, never something to moan about, and shown by a very helpful bell-hop to the room. Well appointed, with smart and high quality furnishings, low level lighting and pleanty of space, the room was quiet and excellent, sporting a large TV and an iPod dock and, importantly for my wife, a really decent hairdryer which actually plugged in somewhere near a mirror - you'd be surprised how often this is not the case in hotels!

My only criticism is that the room, as large as it was, had only a queen size bed. As a 6'6"" man with a wife who complements my scale beautifully, we are used these days to a King at least, and enjoy a Super King at home, as do so many people these days. There is no reason for this hotel to have skimped on the bed size as far as I can see, and they do have rooms with bigger beds, so if this is your priority, it pays to ask.

The well appointed bathroom lacked only in that it could do with a few more places to spread one's accessories, I found I had nowhere to rest my washbag as I unpacked. There was, however, plenty of hooks and low-level shelves with towels, flannels and so on, just nowhere to put things down. The shower was a large ""rain shower"" above the bath, with a welcome glass screen (I loathe curtains), and worked well.

Breakfast was served in a ""pub"" premises just along the road a few yards, and again the standard was high. I had the most delicious Eggs Benedict and the waiter who came to take our order clearly had a strong passion for the coffee he was about make for me, offering every option known to Baristas the world over. And it was good coffee.

All in all, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, it was great value and I have never met more friendlky and communicative, helpful staff.",5,2015,09,22
128,Amazing stay...,"Couldn't ask for anywhere better. Wonderful birthday surprise & the service was incredible. The staff went above & beyond & couldn't be more accommodating. Front office manager was so sweet, genuinely took an interest in making our stay memorable. Room was amazing and the whole hotel is just stunning!!",5,2015,09,21
128,Attentive 5 star luxury,Classy place but with a warm welcome and friendly helpful staff.  Good location to the east of London and easy access to the city center.  The breakfast was my highlight because the service was excellent though they were busy.  The food both quality and quantity was great for London. Nice rooms and we didn't get any noise from the road.  The bar downstairs had a great atmosphere.,5,2015,09,21
128,Montcalm at the Brewary,"I took our daughter to the Montcalm for her birthday. We had a lovely stay, friendly and helpful staff. Got a Complementary upgrade which was a lovely surprise. Laura was very attentive and made our stay a great pleasure. I would stay here again.

Dawn Potter",4,2015,09,21
128,Excellent service!!!,"Nice hotel, high quality with a character. 
Service was really-really good! Even when I contacted them later a few days after I have left for something I needed, the service from a distance continued being excellent!
Room could be just a bit more spacious, but otherwise very good. Concierge did an excellent job when we asked for some help.",4,2015,09,21
128,Unparralleled experience,"My wife and I had the most incredible weekend break at The Montcalm, we were greeted by the friendliest reception & front of house team I've ever met, nothing was too much trouble for them. As it was my wife's birthday we were upgraded to a Montcalm club room and given a free breakfast too which was a nice surprise.
The room itself was immaculate with the usual tea/coffee facilities but there was also an espresso machine, free wi-fi, i-pod docking station and so much more. 
At some point during our stay the team provided us with a bottle of wine and some cake for my wife which was lovely.
The next time we have a short break in London, we will definitely be coming back.",5,2015,09,21
128,Wonderful relaxing experience,"From the minute the taxi pulled up outside, to my departure the next morning, I was treated with the utmost courtesy. The staff couldn't have been more helpful.
I didn't use the restaurant but the food delivered by room service was excellent and very good value for money.",5,2015,09,21
128,Mixed Review!,"The hotel is situated between Moorgate Underground and Barbican.  Moorgate being the closest.  We took an Uber car from Paddington Station and this cost £14.31.  We were in London for a special birthday weekend and had booked several restaurants in the City and a show.  We found the hotel to be slightly too far away however we used Uber cars everywhere and this cost between £10 to £14 each trip.

On arrival at the hotel, all the staff were very friendly and this continued throughout our entire visit.  We arrived around 12 noon so a little too early for check-in however our room was being cleaned etc and was to be ready within the hour so we went to the pub on the corner (which is actually part of the hotel and where breakfast is served), the Jugged Hare. The hotel is a bit of a maze and we found access to our room easier through the pub than going through reception!  The room is very nicely decorated and had everything we needed, although a little on the small side.  The bathroom was again well decorated and equipped although the overhead ""rainforest"" shower is no use to man nor beast with just a trickle of water coming out and unfortunately the shower head on the adjustable rail kept slipping down so for me to wash my hair with two hands, I had to kneel inside the bath!
We visited the hotel the night before the Rugby World Cup started and the hotel had a function on that night.  Our room (251) overlooked the cobbled courtyard so we could hear and see everyone arriving.  No issues as another exit was used for the majority of the people attending the function so we didn't hear very much when the function finished.  Unfortunately what we did find, all 3 nights we were there, was that frequently staff pushed wheeled trolleys around the courtyard.  This wasn't too troubling throughout the day however when they were still doing it at 12.40AM, it became infuriating.  Saturday night was the worst.... we had to phone reception and made a further complaint the next morning on check-out.  Again, praise where praise is due, the staff handled everything well and the manager spoke with us.  She deducted drinks we had had the night before from our bill and reduced the overall bill by £40.00.  She also offered us an up-grade on our next visit.  I don't think we shall take her up on this offer however as we found the location of the hotel didn't suit our needs.  
Finally, just a quick mention regarding the breakfast - as I said, this is taken in the Jugged Hare which isn't a big place for the amount of people that could be staying at the hotel if it was full.  We came down on Saturday morning to be told that all the tables were taken however we could eat in the bar or take tea/coffee in the bar until such times as a table was available.  For us, the wait was only 5 minutes however a larger party had been waiting quite some time and one guest in particular started shouting at the young girl who was doing her very best to accommodate everyone.  This resulted in the poor girl in tears.  Not her fault at all however a review of the area for eating or perhaps an extension to breakfast times might alleviate this problem.  The continental breakfast had a great selection however the cooked breakfast choices were very poor.  After the first morning,  we decided against the cooked breakfast buffet and requested omelettes from the chef which were delicious!

A good, friendly hotel which had a little hiccup dealt with efficiently.",3,2015,09,21
128,Customer service at its best.,"This is a great hotel.
Created out of an old brewery, this is a hotel that blends modernity and history with real charm. From the bowler hatted and perpetually smiling Vlad on the door, through the reception staff and concierge, the staff in the club lounge and the housekeepers, everyone is cheerful, personable and seemingly eager to please. The re-imagining of the brewery in to a hotel has created a series of rather labyrinthine corridors and staircases that, at times, makes one feel you are staying in an M.C.Escher drawing, but that only adds to the ambiance. Once we found our room, it was very comfortable, with one of the best beds you could hope for in a hotel. Breakfast, in the Jugged Hare was excellent and rendered the need for lunch rather superfluous.
Good job, team. We will be back.",5,2015,09,21
128,Magnific',"I wanted a luxurious stay, at a reasonable price within the heart of London. I wanted to take my girlfriend away for the week as a birthday treat. I feel this is exactly what I had. I read many reviews before my stay here, and not only was I anticipating great things here, my anticipation was surpassed. From the concierges, to the front office staff. It feels as though every member of staff cares about what they do and for the experience of it's guests. Donatella was a standout. She was such a pleasure to speak with, and she even guided us from the front desk to our room, conversing the whole way. The rooms are impeccable. I can't think of anything I would change during my stay here. Thank you Montcalm, I will be back again.",5,2015,09,21
128,Excellent customer service and a wonderful stay!,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we instantly recognised the exceptional customer service, from the doorman to receptionists, everyone was extremely helpful and friendly and it really gave me a positive first impression of the hotel. We received a complimentary upgrade, which was a nice surprise, and as it was my partner's birthday our room was decorated with balloons, rose petals and we had some little cupcakes too - which was also a very nice surprise!

The room itself was very nice, plenty of space and a lovely bathroom. Only thing for us was a lack of windows, as there was only 1 window in the kitchen area, which meant the room was quite dark. Our air conditioning also stopped working, so the room would get quite hot, but this didn't matter too much as we didn't spend too much time in the room. Everything was very clean which also added to our stay.

Overall, great location, very close to tube stations and lots of bars and restaurants! Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone. Special thanks to the employees on reception who provided excellent service and really enhanced our overall stay.",5,2015,09,21
128,Wonderful service,We were having a terrible time in London until we came across ...The Mont Calm - and Megha Singh - The Front Office Manager.  The service and kindness  from this lovely lady and her colleagues  made our trip a lovely one and when we thought London was not as it used to be she bought back the loveliness it once was.  This level of service is NOT found in London - well done.  Thank you!  Monique,5,2015,09,20
128,The Best Service Possible,"The Montcalm group of hotels in London are magnificent. It is all good  but there is one little diamond standout that needs mentioning - the Montcalm Brewery is a very suave spot, great looking location with history and a team who's service commitment is an industry benchmark. You do need to stay here.
I must mention the star of the show - Megha Singh, the Front Office Manager who can do the impossible right away (and her miracles take just a little longer).  Her level of service is certainly commendable and professional.  It is what makes a holiday an enjoyable experience and will recommend to future travellers a great place to stay.
You will enjoy this truly 5 star establishment.",5,2015,09,20
128,Excellent in every way!,"Just stayed the one night on a discounted offer yet despite this we were treated superbly! From the moment of check in to check out the staff could have not been friendlier or more helpful. Rose petals and towel swans on the bed, complimentary fruit and cakes in the room, a lovely touch.",5,2015,09,20
128,lovely personal touches,"We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary.  It was a lovely hotel with very friendly staff.  I mentioned when we booked that it was our first wedding anniversary and when we checked in we were upgraded to include breakfast in the club lounge for free.  Also when we arrived back from our day out, our bed had been decorated with rose petals and swans made from towels.  The staff had also left a card wishing us a happy anniversary and 2 cupcakes.  This was a really lovely touch and it made our stay more special.  We would definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2015,09,20
128,Fantastic stay at this special hotel,"We stayed at The Montcalm to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was absolutely fantastic.  The hotel itself is super, beautifully understated and a great location.  The staff went above & beyond to ensure we enjoyed ourselves.  As we were celebrating our anniversary we were upgraded with a lovely bottle of wine & chocolates waiting for us in the room. My husband had conversed with guest services prior to our arrival to organise a bouquet of flowers which were stunning and a member of staff knocked on our door to check we were happy.  Our room was lovely and spacious & very comfortable.  We had dinner in their restaurant (The Jugged Hare) and the food was superb - I would highly recommend eating there.  Breakfast was also delicious with an enormous choice.  
Thank you everyone at Montcalm for a great weekend.",5,2015,09,20
128,"Lovely hotel, welcoming staff","We stayed for two nights, we had a standard room. Very comfortable room, lovely bathroom - amazing waterfall shower. Bed was great, really comfortable to rest our legs after a lot of walking. Very quiet at night, barely any outside noise. In our 30's the location didn't bother us as we walked a lot back and forth into the main attractions. I would definitely stay again. ",4,2015,09,20
128,Wonderful Montcalm ,"We have just returned from our third visit this year to the Montcalm. The welcome is always warm and the staff are all wonderful without exception. On this visit we had a technical issue with our room and an alternative room was quickly found.

We always have a Montcalm Club Room as it is lovely to go to the Club Lounge for drinks and canapés before dinner, again the staff are always friendly and helpful.

Don't be put off by the location as Moorgate Tube is not far making central London accessible. Definitely recommend this wonderful hotel that puts it's customers first.

",5,2015,09,20
128,Perfect stay,"Absolutely cracking stay at the brewery. The staff make the stay an utter pleasure. The hotel its self is a lovely blend of old and new.
Breakfast in the Jugged hare was again fantastic with some of the best sausages I've ever had (and I've had some sausage over the years let me tell you)
Location its self is a touch out of the way but with Moorgate tube 5 minutes stroll and Boris bikes right outside we found it perfect for us.
Can't wait to stay again",5,2015,09,20
128,Top stay exceeding expectations,"Stayed at this hotel, & it exceeded all our expectations, the staff & service were impeccable, it was my wife's birthday, on arrival we complimented to upgrade the room, it was good size, with all things you'd expect in a 5star.
It's a really unusual building for a hotel, but this is in no way negative.

I would definitely stay here again & cannot thank the staff enough for making our stay a memorable one",4,2015,09,19
128,"Fancy hotel, great staff","The hotel is beautiful, classic and fancy. The staff is amazing.
It is located 1 min. from the Barbican center and about 7 minutes walking from Barbican underground station. You can also walk about 12 minutes to St. Paul's cathedral.
The room was quite big, clean, very quiet and modern. 
Chocolates on the pillow and free water and apples are a nice touch. the only 2 things I would mention are the weird high step (stairs) that was between the room and the bathroom, and the fact that the table and chair were located so close to the door, it's impossible to open it without bumping it into the chair.
Cote is a good breakfast option 1 min. from the hotel.
There's also a Waitrose supermarket also 1 minute from the hotel.",5,2015,09,19
128,"Attentive staff, gorgeous room, perfect for Barbican",We stayed here when going to the theatre at the Barbican. It was extremely close and ideal for the visit. We got it for a very good price and our room was enormous for London. I highly recommend it. Tip ask for a quiet room as there was a very noisy restaurant below. Despite this we slept well and very much enjoyed the hotel.,5,2015,09,19
128,"Lovely, quirky and great value.","We took our girls down to London for a treat and wanted somewhere that wouldn't cost the earth and found the Montcalm. The place is a treat, wonderfully decorated.  A wonderful warm welcome started our stay and we  found the rooms comfortable and well presented and had everything we could wish for.
We only had the continental breakfast here, which I have to say was disappointing, very poor really,  not helped by the fact that even though we arrived 20 minutes before breakfast was due to finish, the two waitresses were obviously, positively displeased to see us arrive, and begrudgingly set places for us.
We would probably return as the hotel is lovely and such good value for London.",4,2015,09,19
128,Amazing!!!,"I don't usually leave comments on here as I'm really picky (apparently according to my partner) and I can find a fault anywhere but wanted to leave a review about this hotel as it was absolutely amazing. 
From getting there to leaving it was a wonderful stay! Beautiful hotel, very lovely rooms and exceptionally nice staff. 
We visited The Montcalm for my sons 18th birthday and they made it a very special one we were even upgraded to a Barbican Duplex Suite which was beautiful 
When we left my son realised he had left his Oakley sun glasses in the room but it was no problem as we just rung up and they went and found them and are going to post them back to us much to the relief of my son!! (An me!) 
Just Perfect! ",5,2015,09,19
128,Birthday treat for husband,"Booked this fine hotel for my husband for his birthday what a great place to stay, staff are great could not do enough for you definitely will go back ,would recommend to friends thank you to everyone there at the Montcalm at the brewery.

128,We keep coming back,"Friendly staff, great pub, great location and a beautiful building. A home from home in the heart of the city. A classy place that's not pretentious. You can tell it's a good place to be from the genuine smiles and banter between the staff :-) We never look at staying anywhere else.",5,2015,09,19
128,Service with a Smile,"My husband and I finished a 6 week European tour with a 5 night stay at the Montcalm.
It was the best hotel we stayed in. The service provided by Megha and her team from the time of check to leaving was superb. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff went out of their way to greet and offer help and a smile at all times.  The rooms were very comfy and luxurious and the servicing done each day kept them  in  tip top condition. The Club Class was exceptional with a delicious light breakfast and drinks and canapés each evening included in the price. A delightful finish to our trip left us feeling spoiled.",5,2015,09,19
128,Fantastic,My husband and I stayed here 2 nights for our wedding anniversary. What a reception we  had. While waiting to check in we were offered hot towels and a glass of water. check inn was professional and friendly. We were upgraded to a club room. The staff here are a credit and other hotels could learn a thing about good customer service. We received some cupcakes .when we returned from our evening out  we found towels made into swans and rose petals and a handwritten card were on our bed. So thoughtful. We were able to leave our luggage to make the most of our day. Thanks to Laura and her team. We will be back. Thank you,5,2015,09,16
128,Why stay anywhere else!,"The Montcalm at Brewery London City! Is a beautiful boutique gem! The service is outstanding. The efficient, friendly staff accommodated our every need. Our room was spotless and was so comfortable, with a fully stocked mini bar that satisfied our every need. Hotel is in a fabulous location giving us the option to either catch the tube or walk to the tourist attractions – when I return to London I will definitely be returning to the Montcalm for the duration of my next trip.

 a huge thanks to all the staff for making our stay so fabulous.

128,Absolutely Amazing ,There are not enough superlatives to describe how amazing this hotel is! Me and my partner celebrated my 30th birthday here and when my partner emailed them they helped to make our celebrations even better! We had an extremely warm welcome and the staff were second to none! I would highly recommend the montcalm club room as this is excellent value for money and well worth the extra expense as you get access to the lounge with complimentary snacks and alcohol. The breakfast in the Jugged Hare is also worth the extra expense! Lots of selection and high quality! Overall an excellent hotel and we will be returning in the future.,5,2015,09,15
128,An oasis,"Stayed one night in a club room.
Warm welcome on arrival and the staff were extremely helpful. We enjoyed a relaxing drink and snack in the stylish club lounge.
Room was not large but very comfortable and incredibly quiet for a busy area of London. Very comfortable bed.
As other reviewers have commented, the lighting system is haphazard. Also the air on was rather noisy at night, but was the only problem we experienced. These minor issues did not detract from a very enjoyable stay.
Will definitely be returning.",5,2015,09,15
128,A business hotel with English style,"I travelled to London in June on business trip and stayed there 3 nights. It acted as a 5-star English business hotel with nice service. But the room is small. My room's armchair was not well kept and I had to ask for a replacement. I also needed to go up and down staircase after leaving the lift  before reaching my room (I think the hotel was modified from the old buildings of around 300 years). It is in a good location. By a few minutes walking to Moorgate station, you may go to everywhere.",4,2015,09,14
128,fabulous !,"We are two couples who have just returned from this fantastic hotel after spending a fabulous weekend in London.  The hotel staff cannot do enough for you.  The check in and check out was quick and seamless, the concierge were fabulous and so helpful (thanks to Vlad who also managed to get us into Bread Street Kitchen for our evening meal on a Saturday without prior reservation - you are truly a miracle worker!).  
We had booked standard rooms but were upgraded to Club Rooms which were fabulous.  
The concierge looked after our bags whilst we enjoyed our final day and arranged for us to have tea whilst we waited for our taxi departure - it was just everything that you expect from a hotel of this calibre.
It is situated more or less between barbican and Moorgate stations - we found Barbican the easiest to get to although it depends where you are wanting to get to. It was a 10 minute walk to St Paul's and there are some lovely little bars, restaurants close by.
There really is nothing that we can say was nothing short of excellent, you will not be disappointed if you stay here.",5,2015,09,14
128,Really good hotel near Moorgate and the Barbican,"We really loved this hotel. A old brewery converted into a hotel, it manages to maintain some character whilst providing a high quality stay. Great staff all over the hotel - from the reception (thank you Ruben for upgrading us), to the concierge and doormen. The room was big for a London hotel, well equipped (hair dryer, kettle, nexpresso machine, docking station for your music device. It even has a quirky bathroom, with a clear view from the bedroom through to the bathroom (via glass) if you want it (there's also a blind). There's 2 restaurants attached - one was closed for a wedding when we were there, the other (the Jugged Hair) was where we had we had breakfast (which was also very good - if a little expensive at £24 per head). We'll definitely be back.",5,2015,09,13
128,Nice hotel...with a few niggles,"We stayed for our wedding anniversary for 2 nights over the weekend and got a fairly competitive deal.  On arrival we were checked in very quickly and shown to our room.  The hotel is like a maze, so this was pretty much essential for the first time.  Room initially was a bit underwhelming, small, overlooking a courtyard and pretty dark and dingy.  Bathroom although clean, was very much the same.  Bed was comfortable, although my husband moaned it was too soft!  Room was equipped with all the usual bits you would expect to find, the complimentary water and fruit was a nice touch. The hotel also does a nightly turn down service, with chocolates left on your pillow. 
The hotel was quiet on the Friday night, but the Saturday was a bit of a different story. We got back late Saturday night and there was a wedding reception in full swing.  The slamming and banging of doors in the courtyard area was fairly annoying, especially when the windows are single glazed.  Other than that, the hotel was lovely, the staff were very friendly and the location is ideal if you want to be in London, but not slap bang in th middle of everything.",4,2015,09,13
128,Good hotel!,"Enjoyed our stay very much. Only issues were with the first room we were given, it was noisy from ventilation and had tiny windows so no natural light, but we asked to change and it was no problem for them. New room was much better with tall windows and high ceilings. The rooms had very comfy beds and a nice bathroom. There was no fan in the bathroom so it got very steamy. The lobby was very fancy and the staff and concierge were fantastic. The location is good, 2min walk from Moorgate and 5min walk from Liverpool St. It is overall very good, but because of the first room being below standard I have rated the hotel 4*",4,2015,09,12
128,Very impressive,"I don't tend to take time out to write reviews but I think that I must this time! I have stayed at numerous and various hotel in the past but this one really impressed me to take time to feedback. From the pleasant staff to the the impressive hotel itself. Staff took extra time out to wish my partner a Happy Birthday and to ensure that we had everything that was needed. Rooms are well prepared and have a air of quality about them.

Would return in a heart-beat!",5,2015,09,12
128,"great location, great rooms, great staff, great breakfast","I travel for business regularly to this hotel and I'm very pleased with it. The staff is very attentive, the wifi is satisfactory, the rooms are a good size and the breakfast is fantastic. I can only recommend it.",5,2015,09,11
128,2 night stay at the Montcalm,"Great room ; amazing hospitality from the hotel team and a real personal touch. I will be back. thank you ! 
Reception team were very welcoming and room service timely and excellent. Its a great ""one stop shop"" with restaurant and on the door step to the City",5,2015,09,10
128,Amazing,I took my girlfriend for the weekend in the duplex studio and it was an amazing room and great service. Great location for venturing into the city centre and the receptionist was very helpful in booking us a table at a restaurant nearby,5,2015,09,10
128,attentive staff,"Hotel easy to find and just a short walk from the tube station.  Stayed here to attend a function at the Brewery next door so very convenient.
Staff very attentive but for me its a little uncomfortable as when staying on business it is not ok to tip.... they insist on taking you to the room.
The room itself was ok, quite compact but well fitted out and lovely and clean.  The bed is quite high so be aware if you have mobility issues as it may be worth seeking an accessible room.  The lights were an absolute nightmare - what's needed is one master switch but instead there are lots of different combinations which took me and my colleague who was in another room, ages to get everything turned off!
Free coffee and tea, in my room there was such a small space to work it was difficult to manage.  Lots of snacks but be aware that they are chargeable, its just the tea and coffee that's free!
Would definitely try this for pleasure if in London.",4,2015,09,10
128,Pleasure to have stayed in this hotel,"I visited London on Thursday 3rd September to attend James Morrison concert and stayed here with my friends over night. The accommodation was amazing we had a suite with 2 bedrooms and it was total luxury, could not fault this place at all and would most definitely visit again if I had the chance.
Fab accommodation, quite near Liverpool Station, pleasant friendly staff 😊",5,2015,09,08
128,Great Hotel. Good location,"Spent three nights here on a sightseeing weekend and theatre visit. Staff on reception very welcoming and very helpful. Our room, although quite compact, was extremely comfortable and had everything you needed. Some outside noise in the night, and feel that the cost of breakfast was too high. Overall, an excellent hotel well located and one we will use on our next trip to London",5,2015,09,08
128,Best Guest Experience in London,"Really fabulous hotel, with a wonderful charming group of staff. Very welcoming. In fact nothing is too much trouble.  The Montcalm @ The Brewery, is now my London choice hotel.  A special mention to Megha, Front of House Manager for making me less grumpy.",5,2015,09,08
128,Perfection. You won't regret it,My stay at the hotel was PERFECT. Stayed here for my birthday weekend just gone and was greeted with a complimentary upgrade and a bottle of wine sent up to my room. The staff were so helpful and professional. I have zero complaints. They went beyond call of duty to help and I will be coming back. My favourite hotel in London.  Big thank you to Mega and Reuben. Thank you again. ,5,2015,09,08
128,City break ,"Stayed 1 night and this has to be one the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff (particularly) housekeeping were so friendly, attentive, and went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. The bedroom was absolutely spotless, the beds were so comfortable and the linen and towels were like brand new. The attention to detail like coffee makers and little touches were so thoughtful. I will definitely be back. 10 out of 10 for excellent and attentive staff. ",5,2015,09,07
128,Memorable but not in a good way.,"I stayed there for 2 nights in August, part of a larger group at the hotel, in London, for a wedding. The first problem I encountered was when I became separated from some of the others who were visiting the bride-to-be in her room. I enquired at reception as to her room number. Firstly I was asked for ID. This was fair enough but I was told I wasn't registered at the hotel. True, the booking was in my partner's name. No, sorry, they can't find that name either. How easy would it have been for reception to call the room and ask if I was permitted to go up? 
The second issue was the following day. I received a phone call from reception asking at what time we would be vacating the room. I told them we were booked for 2 nights. They informed me they were full that day and could they assist in finding us alternative accommodation. Luckily my partner had saved the original emails requesting 2 nights, with confirmation and forwarded them to the duty manager, Nothing more was heard, not even an apology. Staff can ingratiate themselves 'till the cows come home but if they can't resolve issues professionally then it's all a waste of time. 
I expect better than this for the money 2 nights cost me.",3,2015,09,07
128,Truly exceptional service and a stunning hotel,"My partner treated me to a two night stay at the Montcalm as a surprise for my 30th birthday. 
The hotel itself is absolutely fabulous and the dining options available are perfect after a day of exploring The City.
The staff at the Montcalm are really the hotels jewel in the crown. Magha and her team went above and beyond to make my birthday unique by arranging breakfast in bed, upgrading our room and leaving wine, cupcakes and fresh fruit in the room on arrival. A special mention about Claudio from the concierge team who was always on hand to assist with our stay and offer to arrange taxi's and restaurant reservations.
Myself and my partner will most definitely be staying again very soon and can not recommend the establishment enough to anyone travelling to London.
Thank you Montcalm and your team, truly amazing stay :)
",5,2015,09,07
128,A wonderful hotel,"A brewery turned into a hotel. The hotel staff is amazingly helpful. Since this is a brewery turned into a hotel, reaching your room can be a bit difficult. However they do provide you a hotel map at check in and explain. The doorman greets you with a wonderful smile and escorts you to checkin. Checkin process is smooth. A person will escort you to your room while explaining the features and a bit of history of the hotel. Don't forget to ask about the light switches. I know atleast 3 people who struggled to switch off the overhead lights. I ended up calling the reception for this. Someone came to explain again. But it was slightly inconvenient in the middle of the night. I stayed in a Club room for 3 nights. Club room is good if you wanna enjoy the complimentary evening drinks (self service) and snacks in club lounge. However it is a Gentleman's club serving mostly cold cuts and sandwiches in breakfast and snacks. If you are looking for a bit elaborate setting go for the Jugged hare restaurant breakfast buffet. It has a decent spread. The beds in rooms are amazingly comfortable. I will visit again...",5,2015,09,07
128,First class experience!,"First visit to the Montcalm, upgraded to a Club room which was fabulous and obviously a great start!. Every member of staff I spoke to was professional, well mannered, very friendly, top marks to the HR dept that hired them all!. Glass wall in-between bedroom and bathroom a little bizarre but I was a solo traveller so didn't worry me too much :-). Free wifi was great. Love the Hermes bathroom products, a great touch!. I've lost count how many hotels I've stayed at in London over the years and I would not hesitate to go back to the Montcalm!",5,2015,09,07
128,All is Montcalm in the city,"Given that I work in the City everyday it was a bit of a busmans holiday, but my wife and I stayed for Saturday night on a weekend shopping and eating trip.

Hotel is lovely and well positioned, service is exceptional and rooms well equipped, we had a small problem with our room upon arrival which was quickly solved.

If I had one negative it would be that its hard to navigate around the hotel complex, certainly getting back to reception can involve a trail of breadcrumbs.",4,2015,09,07
128,5 year anniversary celebration ,"My partner and I decided that we wanted to make this something special and this booking was done on the spear of the moment. On reading about the hotel on their website we noticed they catered for special occasions and rang them. This was the start of our wonderful experience  and stay at the Montcalm. Firstly thank you Laura for looking after us, you made us feel very special! Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for your staff. We were really looked after and catered for in anything we requested. As this was a significant event the hotel upgraded us to a club room status, this is how a hotel should be run. All your staff were wonderful and we were made to feel special at all times. The room was perfect and I loved all the little extras. Although we were in the heart of London not far from the Barbican the hotel was very quiet  and  peaceful. Loved the breakfast in the Jugged Hare! The breakfast was very tasty  and the choice of food great! I would like thank the Montcalm and your wonderful staff for making our visit very special. It goes without saying that we will return when we visit London again! The Montcalm is very well placed and close to many of London's attractions. Looking forward to staying at this hotel on our next visit to London. Special mentions to Claude and Donatella who were very helpful and informative. This was a wonderful experience  and stay.",5,2015,09,07
128,The Best Place in London.,"It was my 30th birthday this past weekend, and it was a surprise to me at where my significant other and I were staying. I walked in to the lobby and was immediately stunned. The service, the room, the breakfast at the Jugged Hair just a few steps away, it was amazing! And when we were checking out, most of the staff and the front desk manager was cheerful, wished me a happy birthday, and the front desk manager gave us her card for when we come back next, and even gave us some bottles of water for the trip back home. We will definitely come back and stay here when we come back to London.",5,2015,09,07
128,Great Weekend Value,"A super weekend break. The staff  were excellent and were very attentive, This was apparent even in reception forseeing the potential physical challenge of my gammy leg and allocating us an easily accessible room, in what otherwise appeared to be a veritable warren.

Only criticism was that the breakfast was far too expensive even for a hotel of this standard.",5,2015,09,06
128,Best bed I've ever slept in...,"My husband and I stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery for just a short one-night break. I left wishing we'd extended it to the full weekend, because it was a fab hotel!

The room was a really good size for London. Everything in the room was discerning in taste, from good quality toiletries (toilet paper also (!), always a good test!) right the way to the linen and the bed itself. It was beautifully soft yet firm at the same time, definitely the best bed I've slept in! 

The layout of the hotel is a little higgledy-piggledy due to the heritage of the building. Funnily, when we arrived home on the Friday evening after our social event we found the room straight away. Finding reception in the morning was much more difficult...",5,2015,09,06
128,Pricey but exquisite,"You'll feel it in the pocket, but you get everything you pay for. The staff wait on you hand and foot, and the room was gorgeous. The breakfast at the Jugged Hare is well worth the extra money and the waitstaff there is fabulous. Would highly recommend to anyone that doesn't mind spending a buck.",5,2015,09,06
128,Superb Hotel...personal attention and detail is unbelievably good,"I took my partner to London as a surprise for her birthday. 
On booking with the hotel I informed them it was a surprise and that we were celebrating her birthday. 
The staff were the best staff I have ever experienced in a London hotel. 
At  check in the concierge took our bags showed us to the desk and waited patiently whilst we checked in. 
I gave my name to the receptionist who then made a phone call. Suddenly a lady appeared who I believe was the hotel manager and was going to sing happy birthday to my partner! Never had service like that before! 
We checked in were taken to our room by the concierge who was telling us all about the building the architecture and its history. 
The room was fantastic with ballons all over the bed.
There was a knock at the door and then a bottle of wine and two cupcakes appeared with a card saying happy birthday from all the staff. 
The room was very nice, very comfortable and despite facing the main road was very little outside noise. 
The nearest tube station is Barbican which is two stops or 4 minutes from Kings cross. 
Overall we had an amazing weekend away and I can't thank the staff enough. 
Will always stay here in future. ",5,2015,09,05
128,Pleasure ,"Staff on top of their game!!! Couldn't do enough for us , unfortunately for us we only had the pleasure of staying one night but very memorable and will defiantly stay again , rooms immaculate !! Clean tidy ! Customer service 100% !!! Bed comfy slept like a baby ",5,2015,09,04
128,"Brilliant stay, perfect room, exceptional staff - highly recommended.",We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hospitality was exceptional - would certainly recommend. Our room was a very spacious suite with all the amenities we could desire and breakfast was plentiful and beyond our expectations.,5,2015,09,04
128,Romantic weekend away,"Great service in a building with character. We stayed here on a Saturday night. It was booked as surprise for my girlfriend, and the hotel didn't disappoint. All the staff were helpful and courteous, but not overbearing. There may be better 5 star hotels in London but this was great value for money in a good location.  It's about 5 minutes walk from Moorgate station, so dead easy from Euston Station (a couple of stops on the northern line). Nice welcome on arrival and check in was easy. I'd let the hotel know that it was surprise and they very kindly upgraded us to a Club room. We arrived early so the room wasn't ready (it was only around 11.30am), so we left our bags with the concierge and went out in London. Easy to get to all the sights as the tube is on your doorstep. On our return the receptionist recognised us, and asked another member of staff to show us to our room. Again he was extremely polite and told us a bit about the building on our way to the room. Our room was close to the lifts but still quiet. We went out for the night and when we came back they had put rose petals on the bed and it was decorated with some towel swans. A nice touch for a romantic weekend away. Overall a great stay, that was a pleasant change from the uniformity of some hotel chains",5,2015,09,03
128,Wow - real luxury a stones throw from City of London,"Stayed here for 1 night whilst on business last week.
Wow – this is a luxurious hotel in a great location (5 mins walk to the city – a very short commute for me in the morning).

The staff are exceptionally helpful and accommodating – nothing is too much trouble.

The room was spotless, spacious and nicely appointed - I stay in London regularly on business but I have to say that the bed in the Montcalm was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. 

If you like game, you have to try their pub (on the corner) – the Jugged Hare. A traditional London pub with an excellent game based menu and fantastic wine list. 

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for business or leisure and will definitely be back – hopefully in the very near future.",5,2015,09,03
128,BRILLIANT HOTEL,"Had a wonderful stay for my birthday and 30th wedding anniversary, we were upgraded and the room was great, very spacious and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need.   All the staff were friendly and professional and the treats we had delivered to the room made it all the more special, so many thanks to Laura.   The building has lots of character and the decor is beautiful.  We had breakfast in the Jugged Hare, lots of choice, could not fault a thing, wonderful hotel and we will be returning when we visit London",5,2015,09,02
128,"Overall a nice hotel, quirky in layout, very welcoming","We stayed in May 2015, and commented on some faults in room (36) and poor service at the Jugged Hare, this resulted in being contacted by the hotel manager and offered a complimentary stay and meal.  This review is therefore in two halves

May 2015

Like others, I echo the comments of many reviewers as to the welcome and friendliness of all the staff and would add that the staff are very proud of their hotel and therefore are sensitive and reactive to any comments. 

First impressions, The bowler hatted and impeccably dressed door man, greeted you with a wide smile, immediately offers and relieves you of your luggage handed over to concierge desk, so that check in does not involve you avoiding your cases.

Megha the front desk manager, appeared to welcome us and immediately wished my wife a Happy Birthday.  Megha is full of life and her happiness in welcoming guests enjoying a visit for a special occasion is genuine and self-evident.  She showed us via the club lounge and guided us, up and down stairs to our Montcalm Club room

The room, had birthday balloons, and carefully arranged petals on the bed and a card, wishing my wife and I a pleasant stay.  Later cupcakes and a small bottle of red wine had been left.  Fresh fruit and two water bottles were left on the first day.

We were impressed by the attention to detail and care taken.  

The Montcalm suffers from the internal building layout, which no doubt suited the brewery, but makes the hotel difficult for anyone with a bad knee or unfit.  There is a lift, but it get easily to reception, you are better to go out onto the street.

Room 36, a Montcalm club room, is a good size and well appointed; two chairs a large king-size bed, but lacking a proper chest of drawers.  In all a well cleaned and pleasant room, but in need of better blackout curtains and a duvet that fits the bed.  As is has single glazed windows (listed building), and is on the 1st floor above the Jugged Hare the traffic noise may be troublesome for light sleepers

August 2015

Room 134, is a Montcalm Club room, with a feature glass panelled wall, (with an electric blind)  It is featured on the web site. It is a good size and well appointed; two chairs a large king-size Z bed (twin pretending to be a double), but lacking a proper chest of drawers.  Clean and pleasingly stylist room

Both Visits.

Breakfast was served in the Jugged Hare.  The range of buffet is not bad, but the table layout and service is not 5 star. Service standard was fine, but not 5 star.

The lounge is small and gloomy at night, and is managed by staff who are welcoming and hospitable, however a true executive lounge is normal a place of seclusion and space, the layout of the hotel precludes this.  I loved the huge chandelier and loathed the huge entire wall painting.  Overall the room feels sparse.  A mirror above the fireplace is required. 

The hotel is very stylish and spotlessly clean.  Located near the City, the London Museum is only 5 minutes away and it is on top of the Barbican which has good parking (at a weekend of £8 a day), and is away from the madding crowds, easy to get into centre of London, via the tube (10 minutes away) or a nice stroll of an hour to keep you fit. 

I cannot tell you about a bar, of the other restaurant, never found them.  The public toilets are spotless and they really do check and clean them when they say. 

Overall a nice hotel, quirky in layout, very welcoming.",4,2015,09,02
128,Very nice butique hotel,"This is my favourite hotel in London. The rooms are very cosy, clean and quite stylish. The staff is polite and very helpful. The restaurant where breakfast is served is accross the street -  few steps awaw from the hotel. You need to book well in advance as the hotel is almost always full.",5,2015,09,02
128,The Cupboard Under The Stairs,"All I wanted on this business trip was a comfortable bed for the night. I am 188 cm tall (6ft 3in) or so - so tall but not very tall. A bed so crammed in that my feet were touching the wall is not acceptable. This is not an inexpensive hotel - my card was swiped for £240

I complained and they gave me a new room which was fine but I should not have had to.",1,2015,09,02
128,Excellent Service,The room I stayed in was quite small and looked into a business office next door but was very clean and quiet.  The service provided by staff was spectacular and the location was within walking distance to the office daily.,4,2015,09,01
128,Anniversary trip,"We booked this hotel for a one trip to London for our anniversary. Having seen the reviews and the pictures on lots of booking sites, we decided to book a club double due to the added benefits of the club lounge use through their site was the cheapest way as well. 

On the day of arrival we got to London early so went to the hotel to drop our bags off before heading out for the day, we were greeted by the concierge and they were amazing helpful, and even though it was hours before our booking in time had a room available to check into. 

The rooms are fabulously presented and our bathroom was huge, we had a corner room over the Jugged hare pub/restaurant. the bar was fully stocked and everything you would ever need was in the room.

The bed was a joy to sleep in and as the area is very quiet at the weekend we slept so well, it helps that on booking through their site we could book the type of pillow and room fragrance.

The club lounge we used before going out for the evening, to relax read a paper, have a few glasses of wine etc. lovely service yet again there and the canopies were delicious. 

We booked a meal in the Jugged Hare on the Saturday night and it surpassed all expectations on the food, quality produce and fantastic service, and would recommend having a meal in there rather than traipsing across the Centre of London for a meal, again with staying there in the hotel a wine tasting was free for all patrons in the restaurant. 

Breakfast was also served in the Jugged hare and the produce and variety was again fantastic, a buffet type of breakfast but lots of choice from continental to full cooked and bespoke variations. 

In all a fantastic stay, would recommend highly to anyone wanting a hotel close to everything , tube is 5 mins away and with the most wonderful attentive staff. without doubt the best hotel stayed in for along time.",5,2015,09,01
128,Quieter side of London,We chose this hotel as it was close to Liverpool Street station and St Paul's. Quite a quiet location for London. Confusing check in but clean and comfortable room on the other side of the road. We had an excellent meal at the adjoining Jugged Hare restaurant/pub and I would highly recommend the signature dish the Jugged Hare.,4,2015,09,01
128,Disappointing stay. Don't believe the 'upgrade!' to an apartment in the building opposite!,"'Upgraded' (!) to one of the apartments on the opposite side of the road to the hotel and felt duped when assured we had at least been allocated the 'Club Double Room' we had originally booked. The room was small with an unwanted kitchenette (!), hardly conducive to a romantic one night stay! There was no complimentary water or fruit on our arrival, the TV was not working and the promised response to the inoperative TV never materialised! No promised complimentary newspaper appeared the next morning and the advertised Hermes toiletries were not provided in the bathroom! Breakfast was spoilt first by the waiters hurrying customers in their breakfast choices as there were apparently insufficient menus available and secondly by one of the waiters putting his hand right across my husband's plate to help himself to one of the jam pots to add to another table without even an explanation or an 'excuse me!', totally astounding rudeness!

The one (?) positive thing about our stay was the reception manager sensitively listening and responding to our account of the disappointment experienced during our stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery.",2,2015,09,01
128,Flawless experience with excellent staff,"We booked in here for one night at the last minute before going to stay with friends. We had upgraded to a club room when booking which was the best decision we made. We were greeted by the hotel doorman who helped us with our bags and then in the stunning reception we were offered hot towels to wipe off the grime of the tube. Staff at reception offered us a wheelchair accessible room as it was bigger and offered more space. They didn't push it on us and left it as our choice, the main benefit being the extra space. There was not much difference from the other rooms so we welcomed the extra space. The club lounge is the great reason to upgrade to the club room. We enjoyed a beer and a few nibbles before going to meet friends. There was plenty of choice on offer and it was nice and peaceful where we could relax and read the paper and chat. Again we used the club lounge the next morning for continental breakfast which although simple was tasty and fresh. Smoked salmon, cheeses, breads, jams, cereal etc. were on offer. Any request we had during our stay was met with a smile. They have obviously trained their staff well to focus on guests needs. I have stayed in London many times for both work and pleasure and this was by far our favourite hotel. I would even go as far to say one of my favourite hotel experiences and we have stayed in many around the world. I won't be looking elsewhere for our return visit in the near future.",5,2015,09,01
128,"Great hotel, great value and 5 star all around",I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world from dubai to las vegas and I always find 5 star hotels in the UK lacking. Not only is the Montcalm the best hotel I have stayed in in the UK it is also exceptional value for money. when you get a montcalm club room you have free access to the club lounge which gives you free access to drinks and snacks. The staff are friendly and attentive.,5,2015,09,01
128,night away,arrived on Monday 31st August and from doorman to check in staff I can not fault it. we upgraded to Montcalm club room which was definitely worth it. The rooms are very spacious with complimentary soft drinks and designer toiletries. You also get access to the club room lounge which provides complimentary snacks soft drinks and alcohol( 2 hours a day). Victoria in the club room lounge is lovely. We have stayed in many 5* hotels around the world and this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in in the UK. First class from start to finish. Well done Montcalm at the Brewery. We will definitely be back,5,2015,09,01
128,Birthday surprise,"My partner took me here for my birthday we stayed 2 nights..

128,Most amazing service ,Stayed here for a birthday celebration. Was greeted by megha who was an absolute delight. She made the stay incredible we was welcomed with a birthday cake and decorations in our room. I would highly recommend the Montcalm as the customer service is beyond expectations. We were upgraded to a spectacular suite and look forward to staying there again :-) ,5,2015,08,30
128,A first class place to stay.,"A really first class place to stay next to the Barbican Centre. Very nice rooms, lots of nice touches and very comfortable beds. The breakfast is really excellent, one of the best I've ever had. A great selection of hot & cold food which is really delicious. All of the staff were very friendly, attentive and couldn't have been more helpful. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,30
128,"Amazing hotel, lovely staff! ","Thank you so much for our lovely stay. The Barbican suite was outstanding , much to my surprise my boyfriend now fiancé proposed to me last night and the hotel staff had secretly upgraded our room with a complementary bottle of wine rose petals on the bed and swans made out of towels . Would 100% come back next time we visit London. Would highly recommend this hotel to anybody!
Thank you so much 
Mel and marco ",5,2015,08,30
128,Very nice,"Lovely hotel. The rooms are large and comfortable and the staff is very accommodating. Perfect location within walking distance to 2 tube stops. 
The neighborhood is quiet and very safe. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,08,29
128,Best value ,"I would be very surprised if you find a hotel in London with better value than this hotel.

For £100 a night (excluding breakfast) you a well maintained room with good facilities.

It also has a cracking pub attached to it.

The one thing the management needs to do is keep up the maintenance as a small things in the room were loose (for example the loo flush) but nothing major.

The staff are friendly and check in was efficient.

No41 it isn't but you get what you pay for and this is phenomenal value.",4,2015,08,29
128,Fantastic hotel and amazing staff,"Booked this hotel for a weekend away for my partners birthday. I found the hotel staff polite and so helpful...they made you feel as if they could not do enough for you. The room was fantastic, the decor was modern and the bed was extremely comfortable. The breakfast was either full English or continental- we chose the full English and the scrambled eggs were the best I have ever had!! The hotel was aware it was my partners birthday and they had someone there to greet us, when we arrived, to wish him happy birthday and also there was a card in the room, from the hotel, and cupcakes compliments of the hotel! Fantastic stay and would not only recommend this hotel but would love to stay again.",5,2015,08,28
128,Wonderful hotel in fantastic location.,"From the moment I arrived I was made and felt extremely welcome.
The management and staff were very attentive, and every detail to make my stay a wonderful one was taken care of. 
Rooms are furnished to a high standard and spotlessly clean.
The location is fantastic, under five mins to tube and so much to see if on foot!
There are plenty of options for eating. The club lounge is a lovely venue for both breakfast and early dinner snacks. 
The hotels own pub, The Jugged Hare, is a ""must"" to try. 
Either the bar snacks or the restaurant menu have great choices and having experienced both can say, you will not be disappointed with the quality or service.
As a frequent visitor to London for both business and leisure, I have stayed in some marvelous hotels. 
However the welcome, attention to detail, rooms and location make this particularly hotel my favorite by far.
I have no hesitation in recommending The Montcalm At the Brewery to anyone.",5,2015,08,28
128,Elegant with great staff,Incredible hotel with well trained and polite staff. When I was leaving and the reception could not locate my breakfast bill they said it would be complimentary - a small gesture which makes all the difference. The only problem I had was with the complicated structure of the hotel and small gym. ,5,2015,08,28
128,Great find from TripAdvisor!,"5 minute walk from Moorgate tube station, greeted with small towels to help us dry off after a typical summer shower! We were lucky to be upgraded too which was much appreciated! Thank you!
Shown to our room on the second floor, perfectly spacious for the three of us for the weekend with lovely room amenities.
Used the club lounge before heading out for dinner and the variety of nibbles and drinks on offer was fantastic.
Breakfast in the Jugged Hare, just next door,was equally enjoyable, the sausages and yoghurt granola were our favourites!
Must mention Vlad, so friendly and always with a warm welcome at the door!
Overall really impressed with our stay and will definitely return on our next visit 'down south'",4,2015,08,27
128,First time user,"Great place to stay, excellent location for a decent price.  I will definitely use again.
Boutique hotel so it's a little bit different to the chains.  Bowler hatted concierge, bags carried to room - I didn't know if I should tip him - I didn't!!",5,2015,08,27
128,Expectations exceeded way beyond ! outstanding !!,"I have never stayed in a hotel where the first class experience starts the moment you arrive and doesn't finish. While checking in Chiara asked if it was a special occasion, I said no but my partner and I hadn't seen each other for a few weeks. 
That night when we returned to our room we found the bed beautifully dressed with rose petals and sculptures, very very romantic.
Thank you Montcalm. I cannot wait to visit again.",5,2015,08,27
128,"Amazing experience, a perfect one night stay!","I booked one night here to celebrate my partners birthday while we were in London for the weekend. The staff and hotel were fantastic, they upgraded our room and left balloons and rose petals on the bed. Very impressed! Staff were able to give recommendations for evening restaurants for dinner out. We had access to the club lounge which was fantastic, beautifully decorated with good supply of snacks and drinks, nice area to relax. 

The room was large and spacious, it had the most comfortable bed and pillows I have even slept on! I did not want to leave. It had a see through panel to the bathroom, but it does have an electronic blind you can use if you want to block out the bathroom.  Our room was above The Jugged Hare on a Friday evening and on the road, but we couldn't hear any noise when sleeping. No issues here! 

Breakfast was in The Jugged Hare - which a lift right next to our room gave us access straight down into the restaurant. Perfect! So much choice for the breakfast, everything you can think of - it had the most tastiest Cumberland sausages! 

Experience was everything i wanted and more, would definitely recommend a stay here!",5,2015,08,26
128,"Excellent, just gets better and better.","Another fantastic stay at the Montcalm, Wow suite 227. Thank you!

As usual the welcome by everyone was excellent, the door staff are always friendly pleasant and polite and I met Matt who was training on reception and he carried out my check in professionally and courteously  with ease.
I then met some old friends who I must mention especially Megha who is a credit to the Hotel as is Simona and Bascar was very helpful in the club lounge (apologise for spelling)

I cannot praise the Hotel enough and Steven Sands the general Manager is certainly on top of his game as his staff reflect the professionalism he has injected into the Montcalm Brewery. Top Marks to everyone ,  and we look forward to seeing you all  soon.

Regards 

Tom.",5,2015,08,26
128,An Amazing Week,"The Montcalm at the Brewery London City is one of my favorite hotels that I ever stayed in. An amazing experience!!!! Beautiful, clean, with an amazing staff. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. Really an A+ experience. I will definitely be coming back!!!!",5,2015,08,25
128,Great hotel,"I booked this hotel for 2 nights as a gift for mums birthday. 

Easy to find, I had decided to drive. Its is a 2 minute walk from the Barbican car park, which on a weekend, only charges £8.00 a day. We walked straight passed the hotel, not realising how close it was. I called the hotel and the concierge came in to the main street to meet us, as although is a large hotel, is just tucked back off the main street. 

Because I had mentioned it was mums birthday, the hotel had upgraded the room and when we got in to the room, they had placed petals and balloons on to the bed, along with cupcakes for her. Very nice touch. Room was spacey,which is something even in a 5 star, smack bang in the center you will never get unless you are paying over £300 a night. 

The Barbican tube station is a 5 minute walk, which is then around 6 -7 tube stops right in to the center. This is literally a 20 minute journey in total. 

Having stayed in central London a couple of times on short stays, I can honestly say, for value for money and customer service, this is fantastic hotel. 

Staff were brilliant...",5,2015,08,25
128,Grrrrrrrrrreat,"Stayed in the WOW suite on our wedding night after getting married downstairs and having our reception next door...excellent hotel, amazing staff (Laura in particular was so friendly and helpful), lush brekkie next door and all of our guests who stayed would echo our thoughts.  Would recommend it to anyone, getting married or otherwise.",5,2015,08,25
128,"Good five star hotel, but doesn't quite earn a five star review from me","The Montcalm at the Brewery provided me a night's accommodation on a Friday, for a black tie evening event nearby. The location is excellent, close to a number of tube stations, and the setting, in the old brewery is lovely.
I was warmly welcomed at the door and then entered the reception area. This was a nice area, with an unusual waterfall feature, which I became a little overfamiliar with, as there was a bit of a wait on check in. Not a problem, but it seemed a bit strange that three staff members were having a chat at the concierge guest, who, I thought, could have assisted in speeding up the check in desks. I checked in and asked the gentleman if there was a shaving kit available, as I had realised on route that I had forgot my wash bag (and had only managed to find a few limited essentials from a train station shop). He said he was pretty certain there was one in the room... there wasn't. Now this isn't a problem and, indeed, a shaving kit was duly brought up to my room, but when a hotel is set out as a five star, with rave reviews, your expectations rise significantly, too.
As for the room, I'd say compact, but well formed given the space. The hotel is a bit of a rabbits warren, so getting to the room was a bit of trek, but a small price to pay for the lovely building. Not view from my standard room. Fresh fruit and complementary water are always welcome and there is something special about the turndown service you receive in a 5*. Always a nice touch.
Their pub next door is great and really welled staffed, unlike the aforementioned reception, so not much of a wait to get a beer, even though it was heaving on a warm summer's evening.
Bed was very comfortable; so got a great night's sleep. I left too early for breakfast, so can't comment on  food. But check out, before 7am on a Saturday, was, again, a little on the slow side.
All in all, I felt that the rate was quite reasonable, given the location, so would definitely stay again. I would recommend upgrading from a standard room, so you get a bit more space and a little more luxury. And, hopefully, my waits at check in/out were just blips, in other wise pretty smooth operation; perhaps they only stood out as everything else was fine. The challenge of running a five star hotel; the five star expectations.",4,2015,08,24
128,Birthday surprise,"My husband surprised me with a nights stay at montcalm. It was one of the nicest places we've ever stayed, the team were very attentive and ensured our stay was pleasant. Will definitely stay there again maybe for our wedding anniversary next year.  Thank you all for a lovely experience.",5,2015,08,24
128,Lovely Stay,"Great hotel, got an upgrade on arrival to a club room, staff were very friendly will definately go back, we also got access to complimentary wine, sandwiches, and newspapers which was a suprise but very welcome, Hotel very close to Moorgate tube the Barbacan and the City business district, Hotel Pub was also very lively with lots of office workers coming in after 5pm",5,2015,08,24
128,Great hotel in a convenient location for the City of London,I loved everything about my stay here - the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. I got an excellent deal by booking last minute as well! The room was very quiet and very well-appointed with a lovely bathroom. Highly recommended.,5,2015,08,24
128,Great Stay,"Just stayed for one night, for business. 
I had asked for a quite room, unfortunately the room assigned was facing a courtyard which was very noisy. I called back the receptionist (Marcello) who was very apologetic and sent someone to fetch my luggage and bring me to another room (Montcalm Club room). The room was big, nice bed, all good and functional amenities, great shower with amazing Hermes product. I slept like a baby!!! 
The only downside was the food smell penetrating the room. 
Marcello from the reception was thoughtful and rang me to see if the room was more suitable for my needs. Nice gesture and very professional. 
Wonderful and cool hotel, will come back!!",4,2015,08,24
128,NICE RETRIT,"Near Barbican  Metro Station, the hotel is a renovation of an old brewery.
The Space is a bit confuse, and when you check in the staff is very nice , and always avaliable to help you at any time.
I had a problem with my room on the 4th floor, was realy to small and the were many noises of the air condiction. But the staff were very helpfull and changed me to another quieter and bigger room! The hotel has also a nice pub and restaurant.",4,2015,08,24
128,Wonderful Hotel,"Arrived at this lovely hotel on Saturday with my husband and our daughter. It was quite busy at reception but check in went smoothly, we had arrived a little early and our room wasn't ready so we were taken through to the lounge and brought afternoon tea whilst we waited. We were greeted by the lovely Laura who knew that it was our daughter's 13th birthday and brought her over a plate with macaroons and candles on saying Happy Birthday - our daughter was thrilled. Staff apologised for our wait which was no problem then we were taken up to our room. There are some long corridors but everywhere is well signed and it is an old brewery after all. Our room was beautiful and well set out we were brought complimentary fruit and mineral water. The Jugged hare is a pub next door/adjoining, this was very busy in the evening as you would expect but very nice, this is where you go for meals/breakfast and a lovely breakfast it was too, lots of choices and all freshly cooked. On check out Laura was there again to say goodbye she really made our daughter feel very special, it has to be said that all staff were very attentive and really can't do enough for you, it really does make a difference to the whole stay. Unfortunately we only stayed for 1 night but we shall definitely be retuning very soon for another stay and to sample the dinner menu in the Jugged Hare. ",5,2015,08,24
128,Fantastic night away,"Hotel staff were helpful and made u feel welcome they provided us with so much information about the hotel and all the available extras within our room 
We had a lovely stay in this hotel truely luxurious best hotel we have stayed well worth the money it cost me ",5,2015,08,23
128,Well done,"Great hotel, great service and great rooms. First experience at the front desk is not that good but as soon as you enter your room you start to enjoy the cosiness of the hotel.
The staff was very nice and even re-open the bar for a last drink... Far far after the closing.... Really nice... Will surely come back",5,2015,08,23
128,An Oasis in the City,"Our Children have a new favourite Hotel; the Montcalm.  We were escorted to our rooms and our girls felt very grown up as the features of their room were pointed out.

The rooms are beautifully appointed with everything you would expect in a hotel of this standard,  however, It isn't about the facilities or the historical building,  it's the staff.   Every person you meet is attentive and helpful.  We were made to feel special.   

We only stayed one night but the Montcalm proved to be a good base for a couple of days sightseeing in London,  especially after the lovely breakfast in the Jugged Hare.  Thank you.",5,2015,08,23
128,A wonderful heritage hotel ,"This is the old Whitbread Brewery , and the hotel had embraced the heritage of this destination . We had a tour with the GM who proudly showed us many aspects of the uniqueness of the hotel . Nearly every room is a little different and you can imagine the old brewery directors sipping afternoon tea in the club lounge . Lunch was excellent. Worth a visit whether you stay at the hotel or not . ",5,2015,08,20
128,Excellent Choice around Moorgate area,I have been on a business trip to Moorgate and office booked me at The Montcalm. Great location and a special building (Ex-Brewery) gives the Montcalm a special touch. Service was very attentive and polite. Room was cosy and all I needed.,5,2015,08,19
128,Good for one night stay,Stayed for one night in room 247 - welcomed by staff and shown to our room. It is a bit of a maze so you need to have your wits about you when trying to find your room or the way out in the morning! Room was comfortable and functional. Bathroom small but again functional. Sink dominates a little meaning there is nowhere to put your lotions/potions/toothpaste! A minor issue though that didn't detract from a comfortable stay.,4,2015,08,18
128,Anniversary Delight,"What a lovely hotel. The welcome was fantastic and lovely treats left in room and upgrade as our anniversary. The room was spacious and the bathroom huge! The room was great with a wonderful bed..v comfortable! 

We popped out for a walk via the secret jugged pub and sneaked back in for a wonderful night sleep. 

Will definitely return again and experience wonderfully helpful staff and top facilities. ",5,2015,08,18
128,yes again Mega and her team deliver a perfect service,"Mega, Simona and Alice front the house at the Montcalm City, all three of them ensure your stay is perfect.

Rooms are great, restaurants are a decent price and service good.

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,18
128,The best customer service i have ever received from a hotel,"From Check in to Check out the staff went above and beyond to make this occasion special for us. Complimentary room upgrade, Kind birthday wishes and always a friendly smile. The decor in this hotel is absolutely stunning from the beautiful chandeliers in the foyer to the layouts of the rooms. Hermes toiletries in the bathroom were a lovely touch.

I would like to thank Leilia and Laura (guest experience) for there help and for making sure my birthday was as special as it could be.",5,2015,08,18
128,Fantastic hotel!,"I booked this hotel without any prior knowledge and it contributed to an absolutely brilliant weekend.
The staff couldn't have been anymore helpful or welcoming from start to finish The room was lovely. We didn't want for anything from lush Hermes toiletries to our own personal room fragrance. The bed was unbelievably comfortable and you can even pick the type of pillow you prefer from a pillow menu. 
Overall it was a real find and we will be visiting again.
",5,2015,08,17
128,Quality and Excellence ,"My husband and I recently visited The Montcalm at The Brewery. The visit was for leisure and it was certainly an excellent choice. Upon arrival Megha Singh Front Office Manager immediately upgraded our room as we were visiting for an anniversary. She offered us complimentary breakfast and access to the Club Lounge. The room was of a very good standard and the hotel facilities excellent. We visited the hotel restaurant twice(The Jugged Hare,) and found the food to be of a very high quality. The Head Concierge gave us excellent recommendations for evening cocktails at a nearby venue Sushi Samba which was fabulous. I wish to offer sincere commendations to all at Montcalm, we will visit again next time we are in London. ",5,2015,08,17
128,Incredible Hotel with unbelievable service.,"Stayed at the Montcalm as part of a birthday surprise and I can safely say that this hotel is by far the best I have ever stayed at. From the Complimentary room upgrade to the decorated room, personal service from the event managers and the room was spacious and perfect for what we needed. Great location as well (5 minute walk from Barbican station). Would definitely come back and recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a top notch visit into the City!",5,2015,08,16
128,Couldn't fault it,"Stayed last night and from the moment we arrived to checkout this morning we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful staff imaginable. We were attending a wedding and as well as having a wonderful day, our stay at the Montcalm made the weekend perfect. The room was great and the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We would absolutely definitely stay here again and can't praise them enough. Brilliant. ",5,2015,08,16
128,Extremely comfortable and friendly,"This hotel is in an excellent central location for business trips.  I had a 2 night stay in a large, comfortable room over the road from the main hotel in an ancillary building, and was consistently impressed with the attentiveness of the staff.  

The room was very well equipped with everything I needed, and remained a pleasant temperature throughout my stay.  I would definitely return.",5,2015,08,16
128,An excellent stay,"We booked one night here on 15/08/2015 for my birthday as we were going to see a matinee performance Hamlet at the Barbican Theatre.  The welcome we got was perfect as we were given club lounge access and free breakfast as a birthday gift.  The staff we met were without exception superb in terms of their helpfulness, friendliness and courteousness.  My wife is unsteady in walking so the bell boy (without our asking) took us by a route which involved no stairs. Our accommodation was a basic room (and not expensive for London) but was decorated and equipped to a very high standard. The club lounge facilities were just what we needed before our very short walk to the Barbican.  We ate in the hotels Jugged Hare restaurant which whilst a little pricey (again not for London) was good if a little noisy but the staff again being particularly pleasant.",5,2015,08,16
128,Customer service par excellence!,"The moment I stepped through the door to reception, I was greeted warmly and offered a refreshing hand towel. Check in process was smooth and so professional.I was shown to my room, and everything was explained clearly. The feather topped bed with  crisp bed linen was delightfully comfortable, whilst the bathroom was luxurious with bath, rain shower and hand held shower. Luxury toiletries by Hermes added a nice touch. Coffee machine with plentiful supplies as well as a kettle and good selection of tea bags were very welcome too.
It's worth upgrading to a Club package, which gives all day use of the Club lounge, where you can take advantage of complimentary wines, spirits, soft drinks and canapés , and continental breakfast in the morning.
The hotel is approx five minutes from Moorgate station, so is on the City side of town, but the West End is easily accessed by bus or underground. I will certainly be back!",5,2015,08,14
128,Amazing Hotel!,"Stayed at the Montcalm whilst in London with work, from the moment I walked into reception until I left I received great service which matched the amzing hotel facailities. The front desk were so helpful and even directed me to my room on arrival, I was provided with plenty of information on hotel restruanats and other facalities available to me. The gastro pub is a must to visist, food is top notch with so much choice and varirty. Will 100% be coming back",5,2015,08,13
128,"Great hotel, poor pub","Stayed at The Montcalm on business and was impressed with the quality of the check-in and the room. However, had one of the worst dining experiences of my life at their pub next door - The Jugged Hare. Arrived alone and was seated at the bar area of the restaurant part, where I was splashed with oil or water every few mins. Asked to be moved to one of the vacant tables. Waitress would have let me carry my own bread plate, menus etc over had colleague (manager?) not stepped in to assist. Water order was asked for then ignored for a bit. Food and wine order taken together - food came a wee while before the wine. Took ages to get attention to pay the bill. Told the waitress I wouldn't be paying the service charge they'd added - she went off without a word to speak to the manager and came back with a face like thunder! Unfriendly, haughty, rushed and uncaring - everything that gives London a bad name. A shame cos the food was very nice!",4,2015,08,13
128,WOW !!! is all i can say ....,"WOW ... What can I say my partner took me here for my 30th Birthday on 2nd August , from the moment we stepped foot in the hotels door till the moment we left we were treated like royalty ,,, we got upgraded to the ""WOW suite "" which really was wow there is no other word to describe it , I want to say a massive thankyou to Leila (guest service's)  , Victoria (club lounge ) and marchello who ensured a speedy check in ...

128,40th Wedding anniversary,"It was our 40th wedding anniversary last weekend they made us feel very special from the start welcoming us with lots of smiles as it was a hot day they provided us with cold drinks and hot towels for our faces which was much needed.
Our rooms where ready straight away.  We arrived at our room it was amazing wow suite and it was certainly wow.

128,Just Perfect,"I have booked the stay through hotels.com at promotional rate. 
The one night stay was meant to be a birthday treat for my boyfriend. I have also reserved a table for evening  at  nearby Chiswell Street Dining Rooms. 
We had pre-dinner drinks in the pub owned by the hotel.  

The hotel:

The welcome at the hotel - top marks! Attention to detail is amazing. From door matt saying good morning in the morning to helpful staff members at every corner.

Guest liaison lady - Laura is the face of the hotel and credit to the The Montcalm. She has made sure our stay was perfect, every detail was take care of. Her politeness and genuine kindness has been very much appreciated.

Reception Lady has kindly upgraded our room for this special occasion and we were also given complimentary bottle of red wine by Laura.
I was really touched by all the attention and excellent service. I will definitely come back again. 

The room had huge bed, comfy pillows!, small coffee machine, wells stocked mini bar, toiletries by Hermes, fluffy towels and bathrobes. Everything was taken care of. Cant fault anything.

Thank you again for great stay!",5,2015,08,13
128,Stylish stopover in central london,From the moment we arrived we were treated as valued customers.  The accommodation was excellent and the location was close enough to walk to Liverpool St and two tube stations.  The buffet breakfast at the Jugged hare was just lovely and the club lounge service with drinks and light sandwiches was lovely.  The Macaroons were the best ever!  Only problem was air conditioning kept tripping out - twice we had the maintenance staff in our room and decided against calling when it again tripped out in the middle of the night.  This was a disappointment in the heat of summer given the otherwise high standard of accommodation.,5,2015,08,13
128,Let down,"We were three couples and two of them were booked in for one night the other couple had booked for two. Unfortunately we had a few problems that disappointed us. Firstly wrong luggage delivered to wrong room, then wrong key given to wrong couple causing confusion. Our room woke to find toilet wouldn't flush, the other couple woke to find the privacy screen between bedroom and bathroom was not working no one wants to see their partner using the toilet !! This was on the morning we were due to attend graduation ceremony at 8.45am and all rushing to get ready. Finally on checkout the confusion about the rooms got worse, we had put everyone's luggage in the couples room who were staying for two nights which we would pick up after the graduation ceremony. On checkout we were told the room we had left all the luggage in was only down for a one night stay and it was the other room that we had just emptied that was down for two nights. It was suggested to us that we remove all the luggage and put it back in the other room, at this point we were all dressed up and minutes away from start of graduation. No way was that happening,we suggested simply changing the room number on the reservation but seemed reluctant, we left and said  would return after the ceremony. On my return the same suggestions was made with help to remove the luggage. On explaining that the occupants of this room still had all their belongings out as they thought they had this room for another night it was suggested that staff pack this away for them too. I said you must be joking you want to touch all their private belongings and there not even here right now to get permission!! I was insistent now that a simple room number change would solve this issue after a few minutes faffing about it was sorted.The manager has apologised profusely for our problems. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very welcoming sadly our experience was not what i believe is there usual excellent standards.",3,2015,08,12
128,Wow indeed!,I stayed here for my birthday lovely hotel and lovely staff. The wow suite was one of the best I've stayed in with designer toiletries and underfloor heating in the bathroom. Amazing stay here would love to come back.,5,2015,08,12
128,Watch out for the towel police!,"We booked 2 nights there for a weekend in London. The room wasn't ready when we arrived so we were offered a nicer room for the same price. We were delighted but unfortunately our new room was organised for 1 person: 1 bath towel, 1 glass, 1 dressing gown, etc...  We asked for more towels but didn't get them until the 2nd day. Our first night was a Saturday and there was a wedding party happening in the yard. They kept us awake till way past midnight with loud music. After a short night sleep, we spent a day visiting London and when we got back, with sore feet, the lift was out of service and our room being on the 4th floor, we weren't very pleased. When we got to our room, our key card wasn't working so we had to go all the way back to reception then up again. The same thing happened again late that night when we went out for a meal. And somehow, our 2nd set of towels had disappeared from our room when we were out. The staff was very friendly and some of the facilities in the room were great (fancy coffee machine, big comfy bed) but we were disappointed by some aspects of our stay (towels, no iron, lift out of service).",3,2015,08,10
128,Excellent stay,"Very good service - attentive staff
Upgrade given and amenities in room for anniversary.
Lovely reception area

128,Why it was great to be here.,"Until now my London Hotel experience was based on my companies budget. Up to 150 GBP you will not find more than a bathroom with a bed squeezed next to it. But a promotion deal allowed me to choose this Hotel. And a good choice it was. Standard rooms are well designed, small, but enough comfort. Clean, and excellent well trained professional staff. My main disappointment was the fact that their Sauna was in repair for a week..being my week where I really longed for it. The breakfast a delight, expensive, but fresh and rich in choice, not to forget the omelets from the gentlemen behind the kitchen bar..always a friendly smile, a pleasant experience..all staff for that matter were good, polite and special requests were honored by Fernandez. I would return for sure as business traveller.

128,Beautiful hotel but can be noisy,"I stayed here on business, the location was ideal and the hotel and room of a very good standard. It was a bit quirky having breakfast in the pub next door - and the quality of the breakfast was great. The BIG problem I had was the noise in the room - I was on the first floor south wing and there was a tremendous racket coming from so sort of generate plant outside the window. Hardly slept at all.",3,2015,08,07
128,Hotel with good location but slow check in,"We travel a fair amount and stayed at The Montcalm for one night for a conference. It's a good hotel although in my honest opinion I think it is more 4 star than 5. First of all our room was not ready when we checked in, so we went for a walk to a local park as I had my son with me, we came back 2hrs later and still had to wait in the reception for more than half an hour. Once we got to our room it was clean and spacious although the divider for the glass panel for the bathroom needed to be replaced as it was bit grotty but this is only a minor thing. The fresh fruit in the room was a nice touch and the wifi fast and easy to use. We popped to the club lounge for some pre-evening nibbles and drinks which are complimentary. The breakfast was very good, lots of choice and attentive staff and it taken place in the pub downstairs joined onto the hotel. Check-out was fine but we put some luggage into storage and when we came back to pick it up it took forever, the staff member meaning to get our luggage suddenly went off somewhere else and we eventually had to ask again for it, taking more than 25mins just to get our suitcases. The reception is beautiful, although there was a rather large sign next to the water feature about being careful as it may be slippery which detracted a bit from this. The staff were in general friendly and helpful and accommodating to the fact there was two adults and two young children but service on this occasion was slow. I think perhaps next time we would love for somewhere else in the area although not a bad choice.",4,2015,08,06
128,Modern yet Classic,"Beautiful decor, very friendly and helpful staff. 
Cleaned to perfection Bathrooms and all
Very modern and up to date, spacious lovely grounds and furnishing. 
I did not try any of the facilities unfortunately this time round I hope too.
I would most definitely stay here again.",4,2015,08,06
128,A real treat,"Had club room for one night with breakfast included, fruit and water. Very comfortable room no problem sleeping, generous club lounge, friendly staff, great selection at breakfast in the jugged hare. Location good near Barbican, London museum, St Pauls. A real treat for a weekend in London and would definitely book again.",5,2015,08,05
128,Fantastic hotel in London which makes a special effort,"This is a really fantastic hotel in a great location. I had booked a room through Booking.com for my husband’s 40th birthday and had contacted the hotel via Booking to ask if they offered any extras for special occasions. When I got no response, I assumed that they probably hadn’t read the message. When we arrived at the hotel, we were delighted to find that the receptionist not only knew that we were there for a special occasion, but the Guest Experience manager, Laura, came straight over to wish my husband a very happy birthday and to offer us a complimentary upgrade and breakfast during our stay. This was an unexpected and therefore extra special welcome. She was also extremely attentive during our stay, offering us advice on where to eat, galleries and anything else we wished to know about the area. First impressions – they are important. This hotel has invested well. 

Our room was a Club Double room, and was absolutely lovely, especially with the birthday balloons and rose petals on the bed! It is slightly larger than normal rooms, but all are kitted out with fab bathrooms and modern décor. Despite looking onto a busy road, it was extremely quiet and peaceful. The next treat was a knock on the door just after we had arrived and a complimentary bottle of wine and birthday card was delivered. I am so very impressed with this hotel’s dedication to the customer experience and we will definitely be staying here on our next visit to London. The location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing and the staff are truly fantastic.",5,2015,08,05
128,Best customer service,"Fits the 5-star category!  Beautiful, clean hotel with great amenities.  Every member of staff that I interacted with was friendly, accommodating, and smiling.  Great pub attached.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,05
128,Simply the best!,"I stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery whilst my husband had a triple bypass at St Barts Hospital. I couldn't recommend it more. It is an ideal location for the hospital,approximately a ten minute walk. The staff were so caring,especially Leila. I was upgraded free of charge to a bedroom that was chic and very comfortable. My thanks to all the staff. Can't wait to stay again!",5,2015,08,05
128,Finally a hotel in London that values the customer.,"This Hotel is excellent It looks great and the staff are very attentive. The setting is amazing (remember the route to your room, as you will get lost along the winding corridors : ) Upon checking in the doorman took the time to show me to my room and explain in detail the history of the hotel",5,2015,08,05
128,I could not have wished for a more beautiful stay,"I recently stayed at the Montcalm and I must say, this is possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed at in the UK. The hotel staff go out of their way to make you feel like you are their number one priority and that nothing is too much to ask for. This is my second stay at the hotel and each of the staff knew me by name and thanked me for my return, which not only was very sweet but added a great personal touch.

We had a beautiful room with a stunning four poster bed, so comfortable that I really did not want to check out and wished that I had taken advantage of the offer of breakfast delivered to the room so that I could have stayed in bed longer! It was a luxurious and beautiful stay and made my anniversary with my partner worth while.

My only fault would be with the restaurant next door for breakfast, it seemed a tad understaffed and no one actually explained to us how the breakfast worked so we just assumed that even though we had been given a menu with prices on, we could just help ourselves to the buffet available. We knew 'full English or continental breakfast' was included in our stay but whether we had to order this from the menu or help ourselves could of been explained better, but obviously this isn't the biggest of deals, more of a constructive criticism! 

Would 110% recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic stay in London and would definitely go back!",5,2015,08,05
128,The extra mile,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery and yet again the experience was a delight. The staff were professional, attentive and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and the whole team worked hard to ensure that we relaxed. Food was brilliant and the rooms are lovely.",5,2015,08,04
128,Modern chic in the city,"This is a great hotel for the weekend as it's not too busy due to it's location in the heart of the city, although very close to the Barbican when events are on and walking distance to St Paul's and the surrounding shopping.  Staff are very accommodating and the hotel has great nods to the brewery it once was.  You do need your wits about you when finding your room as it's not traditionally laid out due to it's previous life but it's all part of the boutique charm.  We had a club double room which was spacious and on two levels with the bedroom upstairs and lounge area and bathroom downstairs, the decor was modern but the sofa needed replacing as it was very uncomfortable but the rest of the room was finely decorated and came with complimentary fruit, tea and fresh coffee with biscuits and mini bar.  The bathroom was also spacious and had lovely extras such as cotton buds/pads and you get left the sweetest mini tins of mints with turndown service.  Might I just add that the door man wearing his bowler hat is a fabulous touch. There is no old school bar in the hotel as the Jugged Hare, a traditional well decorated and stocked up market pub is attached, it also serves bar snacks and has a restaurant that serves delicious english fare.  Although I am British I would have thought this hotel would definitely appeal to the foreign market as it's all just so typically British, done in a stylish manner.",4,2015,08,04
128,Fantastic Customer Service at a Reasonable Price,"My wife and I stayed at The Montcalm for her 30th birthday in August 2015. On our arrival we were greeted by Leila, the Customer Experience Manager, who seemed genuinely interested in ensuring we had a good time. We were shown to our room, where the staff had kindly left a birthday card, balloons, cupcakes and rose petals on the bed, which my wife said made her ""feel like a celebrity"". The room itself was of a comparable size to other hotels in London, although the bathroom was perhaps a little small. The bed, on the other hand, was incredibly comfy and ensured a good night's sleep. Our package also included breakfast the next morning at The Jugged Hare, which was fantastic. I don't usually pay for breakfast at a hotel, but this one is well worth upgrading for. On checkout, Leila requested to speak to us again to check that everything had been to our satisfaction. All of the staff were very friendly, but Leila was a real credit to the hotel. The only drawback to The Montcalm is it's slightly away from the main tourist areas, but the efficient Underground service makes that point almost irrelevant and some people will appreciate the peace and quiet. Either way, the customer service was so good that everything else pales into insignificance - We'll definitely be staying here again!",5,2015,08,03
128,A wonderful experience! Exceeded expectations!,"The Montcalm was an excellent choice for such a special occasion.
The hotel lives up to its reputation and online presentation.
My fiancée and I were upgraded on arrival. Staff were very helpful and professional. 
I would absolutely recommend this hotel.
Thank you!",5,2015,08,03
128,"great hotel, very nice staff","I stayed for one night at the montacalm on a business trip and I actually would have liked to stay longer. the room I had was just great, an amazing mixture between modern and old (but renovated old ;), that's what makes the hotel really charming. the staff is extremely helpful and nice. I stayed in the maine building which is an old brewery - very likely you get lost in the buildung but a great experience ;)",5,2015,08,03
128,Charming London hotel,"Charming hotel in the business district of London, close to the Mooregate tube entrance and also close to the Tower of London.

Hotel layout is odd - but given its an old former brewery that's ok - if you take indoor walkways to different wings you will likely get lost. But if you take the courtyard it's easy and quick. Rooms are well appointed with great amenities like tea and in-room coffee, mini-bar, towel warmer and Hermes toiletries. Bed, while comfy with good pillows, could have had higher quality of sheets - they were a little rough. 

Restaurants are great. The pub serves breakfast (or they will bring it to your room) which is delicious and gets really busy after work with people stopping for a drink. The other restaurant (only open on weekdays) has a bit more of a quieter vibe if you don't want the busy pub noise.

Nice turn-down service in the evenings. Stayed for one week for business.",4,2015,08,03
128,Amazing hotel,"Charming listed building with all the modern amenities you would expect from a 5* central city hotel. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a Duplex Suite which made our two night stay even more special and we were given a bottle of wine and cupcakes in the room which was a nice touch. Very comfortable bed and bedding, good black out curtains and no street noise- very important to parents of a one year old! My only criticism with the room would be the lack of lighting which I find a problem at most hotels. The staff were really helpful and friendly and seemed to genuinely want to make our weekend special for us. I'm sad our weekend is over, we will definitely be returning!",5,2015,08,03
128,Wonderful stay at a fantastic hotel,"We booked the hotel for an overnight visit to London for our anniversary.  On hearing that it was our anniversary, we received a room upgrade and complimentary continental breakfast in the Club Lounge. The whole experience was wonderful from start to finish, the room was clean, comfortable and had everything you would need as well as little extras that set it apart from a lot of other hotels.  The staff in particular were fantastic, all going out of their way to make sure our stay was enjoyable.  Cannot recommend The Montcalm at the Brewery highly enough!",5,2015,08,03
128,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, perfect place","what a lovely hotel, the staff went beyond the boundary to make our stay perfect, i asked the hotel for some assistance to propose to my partner, and they decorated the room beautifully and were incredibly helpful throughout. Will go again for sure and will tell everyone i know just how lovely this place and its staff are. Thanks team montcalm for everything",5,2015,08,03
128,Very Nice Quality Hotel !,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently and was very impressed by the quality of the rooms and the interiors. The service from all the staff was above average and the breakfast at the nearby ""The Jugged Hare"" was great. All in all a very nice stay and will for sure return when back in London again.",4,2015,08,03
128,"Lovely hotel, really friendly staff","Staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. 
As the trip was for my boyfriends birthday there was balloons and petals laid on the bed and left cupcakes in the room which was a lovely touch.
The breakfast is worth adding on again great service there. 
Great value for money will definitely go back! ",5,2015,08,02
128,Amazing hotel and amazing staff,"Wow. Just back from a weekend in London and stayed one night here. Asked what was the purpose of our trip ,my husband told them it was our 10 th anniversary. We had already been given an upgrade which was lovely. On getting back late that evening I had a little gift and a card from them wishing us a happy 10 th wedding anniversary!! It's the little things. The room service food was amazing and the staff just couldn't be more helpful! Bed super comfy, nice toiletries and everything you would need. Wish I could stay there every weekend!! ",5,2015,08,02
128,"Lovely, intimate hotel","The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.  The rooms are small, but very adequate.  More drawer space might be useful.  The position is central and a very short walk from Barbican underground.  It's a rabbit warren, which adds to the charm.  Loved the food in the restaurant.",4,2015,08,02
128,Nice hotel in a drab area of London,"Service, cleanliness and style all top notch for the hotel. Our room on the south wing had a less than flattering view of a wall and some services (pipes etc) so we felt like we stayed in a cave really.
Great bed and a great nights sleep though. We got a good rate so guess you can complain too much about the hotel. 
However, the location near the Barbican is not the best and there is little to do in this area at night and it's very very quiet at the weekends. 
Personally I would chose a different location in London next time. ",4,2015,08,02
128,"Good value, good service","Charming and nicely renovated old building. Friendly and attentive staff at the front desk. Booked the hotel directly with the reservations department, a special rate which proved to be good value for money. Our special request was accomodated with a smile you could easily ""hear"" over the phone. Spacious and well equipped rooms; steam iron & board, hairdryer, minibar, safe, umbrella, bathrobes & slippers and lots of nice amenities from Hermes in the bathroom. Clean and crisp bed linen, comfortable bed. The only remarks on the room were the rather drafty single windows and a soap shelve in the bathroom that was a bit loose. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Barbican underground station (Circle Line). There is a french Bistro called Cote across the street which is rather nice.",5,2015,07,31
128,Great hotel - good location and very comfy beds.,"I had a double room and although the room was a little complex to find, the helpful hotel staff led me directly to it. The room itself was modern, clean and laid out well. 

It is a perfect location to London Liverpool Street, and great if you're visiting an event at the Brewery as the hotel is situated on the same site (we were holding an event the Brewery at the time)

The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was an adequate size. My only criticism is that there were so many light switches on that it took me a while to figure out which ones were for which light!

Overall the hotel staff were helpful and friendly and I would recommend the hotel to anyone. 

Sanjeev was a very helpful staff member, assisting me in moving hotel to the M hotel - a sister hotel of the Montcalm - as I added an extra night to my stay but unfortunately the MontCalm was full so they arranged the room to be sorted at the M and also free transporation to that hotel.

Also pretty fast broadband.

I was very happy with my stay.",5,2015,07,31
128,"Small, compact, some room for improvement, but good nights sleep.","I use this hotel as one of the 5 or 6 regular places I use, working in London. My last stay and my second was early July 2015 for a single night. The hotel is convenient for the city, roughly a 5-10 minute stroll to Liverpool Street. I like the hotel as it offers a good nights sleep, having both comfy beds and pillows. This is a small thing but important as a business user who needs a good nights sleep.

It does have some foibles, such as the cheaper room of the two having a full Nespresso machine whilst the more expensive option had instant coffee packets, which I found a little odd. I also felt one of the rooms had a couple of tatty edges to some of the furniture, but a small point.

The one issue I did have is on 3 separate occasions I was talking to staff members who could not understand my clear English accent. I had Marmalade delivered as Marmite, twice in fact after a very clear pronunciation and then when asking for my coffee to be replenished in room had a single small cup of coffee delivered. Neither spoilt my stay, but as an Englishman in and English hotel it is a little tiresome. It was mentioned to reception, acknowledged and removed from my bill, so well dealt with but the hotel does not seem to have a preponderance of English learners. If I were in another country the problem would be mine, but when in England speaking English it is a little annoying.

However the hotel has a nice feel, is comfy, clean and quiet and offers a nice bar and dining options and I shall stay there again.",4,2015,07,29
128,Wow!!! ,"We stayed at the hotel last weekend for our 10th wedding anniversary... Amazing hotel!! Laura emailed us prior to our stay and asked if we were celebrating - she made it special for us with cup cakes and champagne on arrival. Such a nice touch. 
The room (wow suite) was amazing, huge room with a beautiful four poster bed and fab modern bathroom. 
We didnt eat in the restaurant but went for cocktails in the bar which were great. Breakfast was amazing!
We both agreed this is one of the best hotels we have stayed at in the UK and made very special - thanks to Laura.
We wish we had stayed for our second night in London (see my other review - more expensive hotel but lacked the personal touch!) 
Highly recommend staying here for any occasion (couples, family and friends) thank you!! X",5,2015,07,29
128,Lovely unique hotel and staff,"Checked in for a night of rest after a house move. Hotel is in a good location just north of Marble Arch with some excellent eateries nearby (Grazing Goat was fantastic).  Good for shopping and getting to West End.

Hotel is set unobtrusively in nice crescent and after stepping into the impressive lobby, we were greeted by the friendly staff.  Check-in was very efficient and the receptionist showed us to our deluxe room which was a corner room on floor 2.  The corridor was dark, curved and mirrored and was very atmospheric.  The room was not big but well proportioned and well furnished with a basket of (free) fruit.  Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a decent size (good waterfall shower).
Breakfast was good with very attentive staff and good coffee with nothing too much trouble.
Didn't try the restaurant or bar.

All in all a great looking and quality hotel with good service.",5,2015,07,29
128,"Excellent hotel, We will be back ","We booked the Montcalm for an overnight stay in London to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is conveniently served be either Moorgate or Barbican tube stations, the walk from the Barbican is not the best as it is via a long concrete tunnel which is part of the Barbican complex ,the approach from Moorgate as far nicer. From the moment we entered the hotel the service and facilities were second to none. We stayed in a club room, which whilst not the biggest  was extremely comfortable. Our room rate included access to the lounge where there were complementary drinks and sandwiches/snAcks between 5:30 and 7:30pm, also included was breakfast. We took our breakfast in the jugged hare, the gastopub attached to the hotel, which was superb. We will definitely stay at the Montcalm again, it is an outstanding hotel. Thank you to all the staff.",5,2015,07,28
128,excellent ,"My fiance and myself stayed here at the start of June and absolutely loved it! We were down in London for a 4 day stay and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, the room was spotless, the hotel itself is beautiful and its just a short walk from the nearest tube so its in a perfect location :-)",5,2015,07,28
128,Boutique Hotel,"High standard of quality throughout the hotel and bedrooms.  Staff extremely friendly and very helpful.  No more than £10 taxi from most areas, with the usual stream of london cabs passing by each minute.  The bar is bustling with people, lively and friendly.  Great service throughout.  The steam room and Sauna needs upgrading, but very clean, with towels and gowns available.",4,2015,07,28
128,Staying and Service at The Montcalm,"I have only had the pleasure to stay at the Montcalm a handful of times. It is like staying in a 7* property in the UAE without the 7* price tag. The service and staff are second to none and can never do enough for you, ensuring your experience is the best customer experience.  Megha Seghn always makes me feel welcome and has an impeccable mannered, happy team. All credit to her and her team. I look forward to my next stay, soon. 

A customer that has experienced, great customer service. And would recommend the Montcalm.",5,2015,07,27
128,1at class,Excellent hotel the best I have stayed in while in London can not fault anything the staff were spot on the room very clean the breakfast was amazing c u again soon I'm sure of that the bathroom was fantastic and clean the bed was so comfy the pub built onto the hotel was great we were made to feel welcome from start to finish.,5,2015,07,27
128,"Great location, choose room carefully.","The hotel is in a great location being only a 5 minute walk from the Barbican tube station. The reception is lovely and the reception staff friendly and helpful. I was shown to my room which was small, but perfectly adequate for what I needed. I was facing the road and had I not taken ear plugs it might have been a bit loud. Although there was decent double glazing. The room is modern and well decorated, if a little gloomy. The bed was comfortable too. I felt what let this particular room down was the loud humming noise from some kind of air conditioning. It seemed to come from every wall and floor in the room, to the point where you could feel the vibration. I asked the hotel about this, but they couldn't throw any light on what was causing it. Also, my air conditioning broke every night. I had to bring it to the attention of the reception staff every morning for them to fix. Once fixed it was OK until the following morning. The breakfast was lovely but be aware that it was down the road in a nearby pub. Overall I would consider staying here again, but in a different room. ",3,2015,07,26
128,Outstanding hotel,"Even before we walked in we were warmly greeted, this was appreciated as we were soaked by a walk in the rain, so the offer of dry towels at the door was welcome! The friendly and informative concierge made us feel valued even though we must have looked like drowned rats! Our bags were carried to our room by a very friendly and helpful guide. Our room was beautiful and very luxuriously appointed! Some excellent touches made it very personal and comfortable. We enjoyed an excellent meal in the Jugged Hare that evening before a superb play at the Barbican. Our complementary breakfast was excellent! And the check out by 12 meant a lovely lazy morning! Thank you very much for looking after us!!",5,2015,07,26
128,Wow!,"Stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery last night and have to say from start to finish it was fabulous.

From booking the room, by telephone a few weeks ago, the service was very helpful and informative.

We were celebrating a special occasion so they upgraded us from a club room to a club suite (a Wow Suite). It certainly lived up to it's name. At least twice the size of other hotel rooms in London we've stayed in. The bed and pillows were the comfiest ever! Seriously, if only we could have spent more time in bed! The coffee machine and refreshments were well stocked, with additional bottled water available in the foyer. They also provided us with a half bottle of wine for our celebration - so very thoughtful. There were two plates of fruit and 2 cupcakes also given to us - we felt very special and it really made our visit for us.

The bathroom was a good size with a large bath and shower with rainfall and jets.

As we booked the club room we had access to the club lounge. 5:30-7:30 drinks and canapes were served complimentary. We enjoyed finger sandwiches, chicken goujons, crisps, peanuts, rice crackers, coffee, Pimms, G&T - a wonderful start to our evening. 

The breakfast in the morning was a buffet style full English, including buffet continental. There was also a menu to choose certain items cooked to order, such as eggs benedict, salmon and eggs etc.

The service, food and hotel were all top notch. I would definitely stay here again. 5 mins walk from Moorgate tube, a few pubs and restaurants on the doorstep as well as the Barbican.

Note there is also a Wellness centre including steam room and sauna!

Thank you so much for a really special stay with you.",5,2015,07,26
128,Good Hotel with Decent Location,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights and we were pleased with the hotel and staff. Everyone was so nice and helpful and made our stay very comfortable. The room we stayed in was large for London with modern amenities. Lots of outlets, soft slippers, large bathroom, and a mini fridge. The only pitfall of our room was that it was on the bottom floor which was kind of noisy since it is right on the street. I'm not sure if they have the same type of room on a higher floor. Also, the room had good lighting in one area over the bed and desk but around the mini bar/bathroom area, it was so dim that I could not do my makeup. The staff provided a stand up lamp at my request. 

The hotel was a good distance to the Museum of London and had a few pubs within walking distance. Not much else around this area and away from other attractions since it is in the financial district. Other than that, we were pleased.",4,2015,07,25
128,Birthday Treat,"My husband booked a night away at this hotel for my birthday and we were upgraded to a suite, which was perfect! Our bags were carried to our Room and once settled we received a call from Laura inviting us to the lounge for complimentary champagne and an invitation to meet in the lounge at 5.30 for more complimentary champagne and canapes! Then upon returning to our room at 11pm were faced with swans made out of towels and beautiful red petals scattered on our bed! All the staff were extremely attentive and couldn't do enough for us. A superb hotel which I would definitely recommend.",5,2015,07,24
128,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service",I stayed here for a week for work. The hotel itself is very beautiful and the concierge was extremely helpful and took time to walk me around to the gym and explain the hotel map and room amenities to me. The food was delicious and the service was generally very warm and friendly. Thank you!,5,2015,07,24
128,I recommend this hotel,"I stay here every week for two nights. The hotel itself has a relaxed atmosphere, is very clean and has very friendly staff who do a great job in making you feel welcome. Nothing is a problem and they make your stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms are a good size, well equipped and the beds are very comfortable.
They would get a five if they had an air-conditioned gym!",4,2015,07,24
128,"It's the little things that make a difference, and there's plenty of them at the Montcalm Brewery.","I have been staying at the Montcalm at the Brewery since it opened back in 2011.  I spend at least one night a week in London and have stayed in many many hotels.  I keep coming back to the Montcalm for one reason really - their attention to detail.  

Of course the hotel is extremely luxurious, rooms spacious and well appointed but most 5 star properties can claim this.  I enjoy coming back to the montcalm for the little touches and the extra level of service that I always enjoy.

I feel I need to pay a special thank you to Megha Singh who strived to make my most recent stay a fantastic experience.

I can't recommend the hotel enough.",5,2015,07,24
128,Great hotel with very helpful staff,"I stayed in this hotel last weekend for my wifes birthday. Upon entering you are greeted by someone to take your bags, and take you to reception to check in. Reception asked if we were here for a special occasion, the receptionist wished my wife a happy birthday and tried to look for a complimentary room upgrade. Unfortunately there were no rooms available but she did offer us a free breakfast. We didnt go as I had booked breakfast at the Shard (which I would recommend!) We were taken to our room and shown all the amenities. 

I dont normally write reviews, but thought this was worth a mention as the hotel was fantastic. The staff really make the place and would recommend this place to any friend. 

A few notes, There are two Montcalms in London. Dont do what we did and check park in Marble Arch and check into the one there, this one is near Liverpool Street! Completely my fault, but just a heads up!

Also we were in room 22, which was quite a small room. This didnt bother us as it was very well equipped, and had a good sized bathroom attached.",5,2015,07,22
128,Charming,"Lovely hotel, if a little bit of a trek to your bedroom. But for an old building it's understandable! 

Great, if small rooms. Comfy bed. Lovely bathroom. Amazing breakfast - don't miss it. Great location.",4,2015,07,22
128,London weekend ,"It was a treat for my fiancée birthday weekend with a west End show. Easy to find via the Barbican underground station. Very welcoming staff and great breakfast tip top rooms. Love the laundry bag and shoe bag touch, nice little souvenir. Great bathroom. ",5,2015,07,21
128,"Last time here was good, now better","Montcalm is perfect, close Torworth, exceptional customer service, standard rooms awesome, even better with complementary executive lounge access. Andrea in the lounge is lovely. Eat in the Jugged Hare which is just sublime, lovely hotel. Be back soon...",5,2015,07,21
128,Amazing stay with amazing service,"This hotel is built within an old brewery, which makes a refereeing change from the many hotels which look the same.  The rooms are to a high quality if not a little small, but service is first class, as is the food sampled via room service.",5,2015,07,21
128,We felt totally spoilt!,"FANTASTIC!  Should you have the good fortune to stay at this hotel, you would be well rewarded.  Our visit was a total pleasure from start to finish.  The warmth of our welcome surpassed any previous hotel experience and was the hallmark of all the staff we encountered - there was genuine concern that you as a guest mattered and every care was taken to ensure that we enjoyed our stay.  Nothing was too much trouble. The room we were allocated was luxurious, being well appointed with a a good and efficient bathroom, particularly quiet, exactly as requested.  The welcoming fruit, wine and the magnificent swans with rose petals were thoroughly appreciated - we felt entirely cossetted!  We enjoyed an excellent and leisurely breakfast in the club room, which offered a good range of fruit, cereals, cold meats, cheese etc again with very courteous and friendly service.  
This hotel is in an excellent location for exploring London either on foot or with transport.  The Montcalm at the Brewery offers very high quality accommodation and excellent personal service to their guests.  The reception team under Donnatella Gagliano ensured checking in and out was highly efficient and thoroughly pleasant - thank you.  Our special appreciation to Megha Singh and her formidable team  - you truly enhanced our stay in London.  We are looking forward already to our next visit.",5,2015,07,21
128,Weekend in London,"Price/quality is recomended; beautifull room, one of the best breakfast ever after all our other experiences in other hotels. Friendly, helpfull, skilfull Staff. Never had a question like this at arrival when we were even hours too early"" Would you like to take a refreshment first; shower or bath,what you want, becausethe room is not ready?""",5,2015,07,20
128,"Perfect ""mini-moon"" night away","My husband and I got married last week and as we aren't going away on honeymoon until September we decided to have a night away in London as a ""mini-moon"".
The Montcalm at the Brewery was the perfect choice, from arriving at the door and being met by the concierge we were greeting with friendly smiles and helpful staff. We were shown to our suite (a lovely upgrade we were given!) and offered advice on local places to eat and visit. The ""WOW suite"" contained a super comfy 4 poster bed, a sparkling bathroom with a window to the bedroom (we loved this but there is a blind which can be closed for privacy as required), complementary Nespresso coffee and bathrobes/slippers.
After an evening out we came back our room scattered with rose petals, glasses of champagne and pretty cupcakes, along with a lovely congratulatory card for Leila (guest experience), this really made our stay feel personal and was the lovely touch.
The room is at the front of the hotel and we were originally concerned about noise, however we slept wonderfully and didn't hear any more hustle and bustle than any other London hotel.
We got up the next morning and headed to the Jugged Hare restaurant for breakfast. The staff within the restaurant were very attentive and bought us offerings of hot drinks straight away. The food was hot and well cooked, lots of variety and could be made to order at request. Really good quality food which definitely filled us up for our day ahead.
Every bit of our stay was perfect and luxurious. 
We will definitely be coming back to the hotel in years to come for special occasions.",5,2015,07,20
128,excellent hotel,"Stayed at this hotel overnight while in London. Excellent staff on duty, arrived late but nothing was too much trouble for the receptionist on duty. Room was a little on the small side but décor and furnishings were of the highest standard. Very good standard of cleanliness in a very quiet room overlooking the courtyard. When I asked about getting a meal I was offered room service I declined that and was then informed of The Jug & Hare pub just down the road which was very good.",5,2015,07,20
128,Faultess! The best stay in London I have ever had!,"Simply cannot fault this hotel and staff. I stayed recently as a birthday present and I the five star experience we received was fantastic! I especially have to thank Laura from Guest Experience who is by far the most welcoming, lovely and helpful person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting Nothing was too much trouble for her, I contacted her quite a few times beforehand for information on various things of which she was happy to help and explain which made me feel reassured and made me look forward to the stay much more.
The room was stunning, and every need was tended too, we had access to the club lounge which was beautiful, overall the whole stay was perfect and we are already planning to come back! Best experience in London I have ever had! Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, the location is great, perfect for a weekend away.",5,2015,07,20
128,Our fantastic stay at Montcalm London City,"We booked a Deluxe Double Room as part of our 15th Wedding Anniversary celebrations.  Upon arrival we were greated by the most helpful staff and a breath taking reception.  Megha, the front office manager, personally dealt with our booking and informed us we had been upgraded to a suite as it was our anniversary, as well as a couple of other extras (breakfast, club lounge access) - all to help make it special for us.  It really did do that, the room was amazing and the attentive care we received made us feel really special.  After a short walk we arrived back to find two exquisite cupcakes beautifully wrapped and a card in our room.  After our night out we arrived back to rose petals on the bed and towels shaped as kissing swans. We were really touched, and we have left already looking for a reason to go back....my husband and I cannot thank Megha and the rest of the hotel staff enough for making our stay so special, we really appreciate it, thank you.",5,2015,07,19
128,Cheeky weekend away ,"This was the first time I had tried the Montcalm Hotel, I stumbled across is via laterooms. The booking was to celebrate my wife's special birthday. The welcome at reception was exceptional, we were taken to the Club Lounge where we were both given a glass of champagne, after which we were shown to our rooms by the extremely attentive Laura. The bedroom was contemporary, a good size for a central London hotel, and had a lovely bathroom with Hermes toiletries, it also had bathrobes and slippers. The location of the hotel was superb, it was a situated on a quiet road yet close to all amenities.The Club lounge offered complementary drinks and snacks between 5.30 and 7.30pm. The breakfast was fresh, plentiful and of a good quality. Overall it is a lovely hotel and we can't wait to return. I would suggest however that the room is booked directly with the hotel as it is cheaper than going through laterooms",5,2015,07,19
128,A real pleasure,"From start to finish it was a lovely stay! 
Booking was made very easy & seamless over the phone. I checked prices online, to which the hotel itself came in slightly less!!
On arrival I was instantly impressed with the exterior & interior of the hotel! 
The front of house manager Megha was absolutely amazing, very kind & keen to help improve our stay! It was an anniversary for us & the hotel provided us with little treats for our room. We had already booked breakfast & club lounge access came with our stay, so these were already considered upgrades 
The room itself was very comfortable & spacious enough! Bathroom & waterfall shower was also very nice! 
The location of the hotel is conveniently located & close enough to covent garden & soho! 
We went to the theatre, but opted for a taxi due to laziness really!! 
Overall I would definitely stay here again & certainly recommend it to anyone staying in London!",5,2015,07,19
128,"5 star comfort, 5 star style and 5 star smiles","Just back home from an absolute stupendous one night stay at the Montcalm brewery hotel, and just had to hit the iPad to let you guys know just how good this place is. Was visiting the West end to celebrate an anniversary and the birthday of my partner Elizabeth, and also for a night at Ronnie Scott's. Did my homework re a hotel to check into and finally decided on the Montcalm after reading the great reviews on TripAdvisor. Alerted the hotel that we were celebrating a couple of special things and wanted the time to be really special and man did they come through for us. Walked into the impressive foyer and was immediately approached by the incredible Laura, the guest experience/concierge, she welcomed us with a fantastic bubbly manner and welcoming smile and made us feel at home and relaxed in a matter of seconds. From that moment we knew that we had made the right choice! Laura made the check in painless for us and made sure we knew all we had to know. We were showed up to our room (club) which looked just as it was on the website. Nice size with all mod cons, coffee and tea maker, mini bar, safe, great looking shower and bathroom. Must admit I was a little unnerved about the see through glass to the bathroom but all concerns were put away when we were told that their was a blind that came down on bathroom window so all cool. Just settled in and placed iPod into the in room iPod dock when the doorbell rang and we were served with a couple of glasses of champagne which were sent up by the wonderful Laura to celebrate our special occasion, great touch. As we sipped our champagne listening to a bit of chilled music the doorbell rang again and this time their was a  lovely bottle of Red wine (good quality) and some nice tidbits. (another great touch) . As we were in a club room we had the option off  using the club room for pre dinner complimentary snacks/drinks (canapés, sandwiches etc and tea/coffee and spirits, had a couple of strong G&T's) We chilled for a bit before heading off to Soho (no prob hailing a cab and a quick 10 min journey). Next morning  we headed down to the jugged hare for a great English breakfast ,all the other add on's you expect from a place like this ( chef different class). Didn't make use of the wellness centre but had a quick look and it seemed pretty impressive. When it came for the time to leave we were once again approached by Laura who took at least 15 minutes to make sure that out stay was all we expected it to be (Momtcalm excecutives do yourself a favour and look after her because she is excellent). Have to say that we were really dissapointed to have to leave and wished that we had booked for another night. So as you can see this is a great hotel with superb facilities and incredible staff, if you get a chance to stay there go for it because you will not be dissapointed, A 5 star hotel in a 5 star city!!!!!",5,2015,07,18
128,Brilliant ,"I stayed at the Montcalm Brewery last week whilst on business. It is a great location for the city. The room was big and comfortable and had plenty of space for the extra bed for my son.

The club lounge is slight stuffy but great for drinks before dinner.

The Jugged Hare pub had a great atmosphere and delivered good food and good service.

The staff were fantastic, courteous, professional, friendly and helpful.

I will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,18
128,Great staff and funky place to stay,"From the moment I walked in the door it felt good, and that was confirmed in the reception team greeted me and handled my check in.  The room was delightfully done, with the personal touches that make a hotel stand out from the usual.  Would go back any time.",5,2015,07,18
128,Great personnel,"One stays at many good hotels over a business trip. But what set Montcalm apart in a manic four week Europe trip was the quality of its staff. Everyone is friendly and super helpful. Great work guys, keep it up!",5,2015,07,17
128,Glad to be back. My second stay here was even better than my first.,"I stayed here last on a flying visit in March 2015 (see separate entry under ""Very welcoming, spotless room and quirky building""). I returned because I liked it and I wanted to try it again.

I wasn't disappointed.
The welcome was equally friendly (despite needing a late'ish check-in) 
The room was spotless (again)
The place was a quirky as I remember, although this time I was give a room in ""The Suites"", which is located in a town-house style building separate from the main hotel, just over the road to the hotel's main entrance. 

I really appreciated the comfortable accommodation as I had already had a busy day behind me and an equally busy day ahead of me.

The bed was brilliant. The room was well presented.

And whereas it is located on Chiswell Street, the room was surprisingly quiet. Just as well really.  I was out like a light.   Zzzzzzzz. 

Would I come back again?
Yes, I certainly think so. 

Must just say that the photo was taken for me on a friend;s camera, so I've got Jim (Twitter @TXdotcom) to thank for that. He takes better pictures than most people.",5,2015,07,16
128,Beautiful!  ,"My partner and I stayed here last year a little earlier than August for a couple of nights because the sister hotel we booked had flooded.  We just want to say a bug Thankyou to the helpful staff who were more than willing for me to walk through the beautiful reception with my mud caked wellington boots on! We had been to wireless festival for two days and as I struggled to peel them off and put clean shoes on across the street the staff noticed and insisted I come in as I was. 
Thankyou!  ",5,2015,07,16
128,Great stay,"The hotel was very nice and they even got us in a room early for a shower after our long flight.  The rooms were a bit small and the hotel was not centrally located for sightseeing.  I would stay closer to the center of London if I were to go back.  We had no problems finding our room as other people seem to and the breakfasts were pretty much the same as everywhere els in the UK.
",4,2015,07,16
128,"decent quaint place, great staff","My room, 002, was in an odd place. It is on the first floor, near the gym and across from the main hotel.  There are windows that overlook the street and so you do get a little street news/action but I was fine. The room was just okay. There are numerous light switches, etc. that were confusing and a few issues - battery died in the safe on day 1, had it replaced. there was a floorboard light out of the socket and laying on the carpet but still working, there were two clocks (one with a radio) in my room and neither worked, the robe is comfortable but came with no tie.  The room service is good, the wireless good, and staff are great! I was here for business with Cass BSchool of City U London and it is a very convenient location with plenty to walk to.  The staff are great here and the location is convenient for business, exercise, and close to the barbican station.",4,2015,07,15
128,Suprise Birthday Trip,"My boyfriend booked this as a surprise trip to London for my birthday.

The hotel was lovely and the service impeccable. You really are treated like 5* guests as soon as you arrive.

This hotel clearly goes above and beyond and being a girl I loved the small touches. The Hermes toiletries were a hit and choosing the room scent was a novelty.

The only small negative from me was the robes provided were not soft, actually felt a little like sandpaper, but that really is scraping the barrel.

Really wish we could've stayed longer than 1 night and will definitely be back next time we're in London.",5,2015,07,15
128,Excellent business hotel,"Excellent hotel if you're working in London, but maintenance falls short of expectations. Gym room (if you can call it a ""room"") is about as big as a closet. The three exercise machines a really old and in need for replacement.
Rooms are big (I've stayed in several) but bathrooms may be quite small. General maintenance in the bathroom is poor and not at all as expected given the rates. Large beds with excellent mattresses
The staff is excellent and they will do anything to improve your stay. The location is second to none in the best part of The City.
Despite its quirks, I keep coming back to the Montcalm time and time again on business trips to London.",4,2015,07,14
128,Cool Hotel,This is a great quirky hotel! We stayed in a barbican duplex suite which was well furnished but the bathroom was slightly smaller than we expected. The bed was unbelievably comfortable and being able to choose your pillow is a nice touch. Good value for what you get 😀,4,2015,07,14
128,Fabulous stay,"This hotel was booked as part of a birthday treat.  The level of customer service was fabulous from the moment we approached the entrance to being checked in and being shown to our room.  Thank you to the hotel for kindly organising an upgraded room and for the lovely birthday treat surprises left in our room.
This is a beautiful hotel with an interesting history.  Our room was spotless and every small detail had been thought about. The queen-size bed was very comfy and the room was so quiet that I forgot we where actually in London!  

We also ate at the hotel's Jugged Hare gastro pub/restaurant which I would recommend to anyone who is not a vegetarian, as the food and service were great.  My only gripe was the very bad service from the two bar staff before we were seated for dinner.  They really need to go on a the same customer service training as the rest of the lovely hotel employees and their colleagues in the restaurant - they are letting the team down!",5,2015,07,14
128,Best Hotel in London,"3rd visit and the hotel in my opinion is the best in London I really can't rate it enough.

Great rooms, friendly and attentive staff nothing is any trouble.

Simona is an asset to the hotel and always checks everything was ok and goes the extra mile.

Breakfast was fantastic big shout to Mark the chef.

Cannot wait to stay again....",5,2015,07,13
128,A far cry from our previous Montcalm experience,"We were looking at decent hotels in this part of town for a recent two night stay.  We had previously had a very excellent experience at the Montcalm's flagship hotel at the top of Park Lane (see separate review) and so we booked a Club room at the Brewery London City without hesitation.  However, this hotel was hugely disappointing by comparison.
Firstly, what we hadn't appreciated and what wasn't explained to us was that the Club Double room was actually an apartment on the opposite side of the road, albeit manned by a small reception desk.  Although in keeping with the usual Montcalm brand and spacious enough, this ground floor room suffered from noise issues.  I don't expect a view in a ground floor room in London - not even one which claims to be 5 star - but there really should be sufficient noise insulation.  We literally heard everything, from the traffic noise outside, to everybody's movements in other rooms, talking in the corridors and even staff arguing with each other on reception desk at 7:00 on Sunday morning.  This would be unacceptable in a Premier Inn, let alone a Montcalm.
The other significant disappointment was the dining arrangements for breakfast, which is catered for back over the road at the Jugged Hare pub.  This definitely had a  Premier Inn/Brewers Fayre feel to it, despite it's claims of being a gastro pub and the efforts of the staff.
I appreciate that within a restored brewery building there will be constraints which may require some flexibility but the room allocation, noise and breakfast arrangements all combined to provide a hugely different experience from our previous Montcalm stay in the West End.
For balance, I should note that some of the staff were very nice and the wifi connection and speed was excellent.
We'd definitely stay at what appears to be the flagship Montcalm hotel again but we'd certainly avoid Brewery London City in the future.",2,2015,07,13
128,Fabulous Stay,"There is only one word to describe this hotel and that is fabulous.

We were warmly greeted upon arrival by every member of staff, provided with cold mineral water(nice on such a hot day), check in was a breeze. We were escorted to our room, we had booked a Club Room, and shown around the room. Enroute the Club Lounge was pointed out to us and we were advised of Canapés and Sprits been served at 5.30.

The room itself was very well decorated, a little small but not unusual in London, lovely shower with a glass wall so you can see into the actual bed area!

Free water and fruit are provided in the room as well as a well stocked mini bar.

Overall a lovely stay and can't wait to go back.",5,2015,07,12
128,We wish we could have stayed longer...,"We have just come back from two nights at The Montcalm Brewery and we wish we could have stayed longer. We had room 416, a Club Room. It was lovely. The room had complimentary fruit, water, coffee machine, tea, biscuits, gummy bears and nuts in jars which I loved and we had chocolates left on our pillow which was a lovely touch. Also lovely toiletries in the bathroom and a nail file and cotton buds were very helpful too. Hairdryer is also provided, ample hangers and ironing facilities. If you wish to use the hotel dry cleaning and ironing service this is available at a charge. 

The staff are unbelievably lovely and helpful including in the pub next door, The Jugged Hare which we had breakfast at and also lunch.

The hotel does have a lot of corridors but we found our way around fine and we were able to access the Jugged Hare for breakfast by crossing the courtyard of the hotel, so no need to use the pavement. 

Breakfast was wonderful. The choice and quality are superb. My husband said this is the best breakfast he has ever had!

Plenty of taxi's going passed so no issue with transport. 

We will be going back again and I was in two minds about leaving this review as we don't want everyone else going there! We want it to ourselves!",5,2015,07,12
128,Lovely stay ,"Used this a base for our weekend in London, all staff were very friendly and couldn't help enough from start to finish. Easy to travel into the main tourist attractions but local restaurants just a 5 minute walk away if you prefer. Staff recommended restaurants to visit. Had an amazing weekend and would definitely recommend this hotel ",5,2015,07,12
128,Great hotel & friendly stagg,"Great value for money. Also got a complementary upgrade. Staff were very friendly (particularly Marcello, made a good impression)! Stayed in a lot of 5* hotels in London, but this was the nicest! Very easy to get lost, but staff easily notice and point you in the right direction.",5,2015,07,12
128,Cannot recommend enough!!,"Fantastic hotel, modern, spotless, elegant but still very friendly. The staff are outstanding. Great value stay, only criticism is that breakfast is too expensive. Our first anniversary was well spent here...greeted us by name, left us a card and cute touches in the room. ",5,2015,07,12
128,The devil is in the details,. . . and I do believe this hotel has covered all of them.  I cannot say enough positive about the staff's engagement and concern for their guests' welfare and comfort.  The facilities are excellent--one feels both luxuriously comfortable and safe--but it is the attentiveness of the staff which really makes the place glow.,5,2015,07,11
128,Birthday Visit,"This is one of the best hotels I have ever been too in my life so far. The staff have been extremely friendly, kind and personable. Great location. Beautiful building (that our porter mentioned was 250 years old)!
Love it! Will definitely be back.",5,2015,07,10
128,Treated LIke An Old Friend,The Montcalm at The Brewery  is located conveniently  near the business district. I often stay at this hotel  on my business trips. Two employees you should meet when you arrive are  Vlad who is part of  the Concierge Team and Adeel at the Club Lounge. They will make your stay stress free .Vlad is always ready to  assist with anything you need and  Adeel in the Club lounge will make you feel at home. The Club lounge serves a light breakfast in the morning and is a great place to relax at the end of the day.,4,2015,07,09
128,Gift to parents great stay,This ancient restored brewery turned hotel has old world charm but modern rooms. We did a family stay and gift to our folks visiting london. Knowledgeable staff and great location make for a great stay. Breakfast a bit overpriced for the offer. Yet well presented with efficient staff,4,2015,07,08
128,Indulgent weekend,"Just home after a fabulous long weekend staying at this beautiful hotel. Absolutely perfect for a romantic little break. We stayed in a Montcalm club room which gave lounge access, ideal for a few drinks before dinner. 
The room was a good size with a lovely bathroom, quiet and spotlessly clean. Housekeeping does a fantastic job. In fact all the staff were so friendly and helpful and genuinely keen that you should have a perfect stay...and they succeeded.
We ate in the hotels gastro pub on two evenings, great food and generous portions and lovely vibe. Breakfast on Sunday morning was a little dull on the buffet side and not up to the standard of the other meals. However Monday we decided to have breakfast in bed which was superb.
Location is great, easy to get everywhere by tube which is a short walk away.
Think this is our new favourite London hotel!",5,2015,07,08
128,Wedding Party Guest - one night stay,"Superb hotel, great room with everything you would expect plus more.  Staff were amazing.  English breakfast buffet was superb.  My only regret is that I only stayed one night.  Comes with its own gastropub which is brilliant.  No car park however the Barbican car park is just around the corner and you can pre-book a space.

Yes it's not cheap but this sort of quality comes at a price.  It is worth it!   Would also highly recommend for a wedding venue.",5,2015,07,08
128,Funky hotel,This hotel turned out to be a great pick. Really comfortable with helpful staff who went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and in a good location that was close to the Tube and to buses. The only issue was getting a cab turned out to be a bit more difficult. I had to wait for a while while hotel staff went to flag one down for me.,4,2015,07,08
128,A Concert at the Barbican,"This Hotel is just two minutes walk from the Barbican where we were attending a Concert.  It is a converted brewery and very attractive with plenty of old brewery details.  The doorman and porters were very friendly and knowledgeable.  When we checked in the reception staff were efficient and welcoming.  Our room was upgraded and was extremely comfortable.  We couldn't fault a thing.  Decor, beds, bedding and towels were super as well as the cleanliness.  We wished we were staying longer.",5,2015,07,07
128,"Very lovely, room rather dark though","Lovely hotel, front desk were very attentive and welcoming. Room well appointed but very dark, bathroom too. Room service was hard work and took three phone calls and me having to spell some of my order as the man didn't seem to understand English very well. He was most polite though.... Perhaps in training? Downside, there was an event on at the brewery that was crazy loud and was quite annoying. Would stay again though. ",4,2015,07,07
128,Impeccable service!,Excellent weekend in london and superb service from Megha the office manager. Who welcomed us on arrival of our stay and looked after us throughout. All the staff were extremley helpful. I would recommend to stay here for business and lesuire.,5,2015,07,07
128,When a hotel is as luxurious as the TripAdvisor listing suggests,"It's never easy finding a nice hotel in the London high season without burning a hole in your wallet. The Montcalm at the Brewery *appeared* to strike the balance between good value and a bit of luxury, from the online information.

After many hours of sight seeing in the summer heat, the hotel was the sanctuary I hoped it'd be. Visually, it's gorgeous; exposed brick ceilings, high-shine chesterfield and very sleek guest rooms. Bed was so comfortable, it revealed a litany of aches in my body that I hadn't noticed previously, and I weighed how much longer I could stay in it, versus having to get up and actually see London.

The hotel is in a quiet business district, but is only a few minutes walk from Moorgate station, so it was easy to get into the city and to/from Heathrow via Paddington.

Room is very well appointed, with a multitude of plugs for your electronics (USB, European wall socket), fancy complimentary snacks (god, those smoked almonds...), umbrella, robe and slippers, extra carry bags, a hand held or rain shower option and Hermes toiletries.

Breakfast at the Jugged Hare was something to look forward to, with a wide variety of hot English options (Cumberland pork sausages, very nice scramble or eggs cooked to order), fresh, enormous croissants and pain au chocolat, and healthier choices of Greek yogurt, muesli, raw nuts and fresh fruit.

Also nice was an hour spent in the club lounge with complimentary wine and finger sandwiches, although I did hope for club lounge snacks to be a bit more substantial, kind of like how they do it at the Marriott hotels.

Every member of staff I encountered was cordial and helpful, it was a nice end to the day to come in and be greeted by such nice door and reception staff.

Would stay again.",5,2015,07,07
128,"Friendly staff, comfy modern rooms in old school brewery","In the City,everything at hand from St. Paul's to Brick Lane, very friendly and attentive staff, heritage building, clean room with everything you need - and really quiet at night. Great place to stay for vacation, even if in the midst of the buisiness district.",4,2015,07,07
128,Very good London City location - great for business meetings,"I stayed here last month on a business trip, and found it to be a great hotel for travel.  The staff was very attentive and the room was very spacious and well-appointed.  There really  was no view to speak of from the windows, but it was one of the nicest rooms where I've stayed in London.  The internet was very fast and reliable.  My colleague was a bit perturbed by the hotel charging the entire stay upon check-in, but I didn't mind.  I was always able to get taxis.  The hotel price included a fantastic breakfast. Chef was very good and always greeted everyone cordially in the morning.  I'd definitely stay here again, although it is  more expensive than others.",4,2015,07,05
128,Going to London? Don't stay anywhere else,"From walking in the door to checking out, we were treated majestically. The room was spotless and the beds were comfy, gorgeous building and exceptional staff. Would recommend staying to anyone looking for true five star service. You honestly cannot beat the value for money provided.",5,2015,07,05
128,Wonderful,"An excellent two night stay. Having regularly stayed at the Marble Arch Montcalm which we like, the stay here came as a pleasant surprise as the hotel has successfully carried its brand to a very different building. The Jugged Hare on the corner for breakfast again surprised on the upside. Room was quiet, the window opened for air and with the curved brick ceiling the historical origins are tastefully built in to the decor. Would stay again.",5,2015,07,05
128,Luxury,"We stayed here for a single night in June and were very impressed with the hotel. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the room was decorated/furnished to a high standard and very clean. A good location too, being within short walking distance of the Barbrican underground station.",5,2015,07,05
128,Superb,"I have been lucky enough to stay in many fine hotels around the world and the Montcalm at the Brewery London City ranks right up there. The staff are simply tremendous - Alice in reception provided the perfect welcome and that standard never dipped during our short stay. The ordeal of the Holiday Inn, Sutton (don't ask...."" swiftly became a thing of the past with the Montcalm's beautifully decorated and appointed club room, with air con that actually worked on a very hot day (the Holiday Inn's receptionist failing to spot the irony in her explanation that their a/c wasn't chilling the room because ""it's a very hot day..."". The Club Lounge was excellent, upgrade to the Club Room is highly recommended. Parking is a few minutes walk away in the Barbican's large car park so the whole experience can be warmly recommended.",5,2015,07,04
128,"Excellent hotel with very polite, friendly and professional staff in all positions.","We would definitely stay again we took some family and friends this time and attended a local charity function up the road at the Royal Artillery Grounds. They all commented on what a fantastic hotel it was.The restaurant up the road, in the Jugged Hare public house, was novel but worked well and the breakfast was lovely and the serving staff were attentive and efficient.",5,2015,07,03
128,The only place to stay in London !!,"Currently staying at The Montcalm at the Brewery and as always it is fabulous. 

On a warm day to be greeted with friendly and professional staff - and a glass of water - is wonderful.

This hotel can not do enough for you - Megha and her team are  first class.

The only place we will stay in London.

128,Great stay - outstanding service,"The key feature for me was the great Guest Relation service - went out of their way to be helpful.  I am always keen to go jogging and they provided a customized map, and had a bottle of water waiting for me when I got back.  Even followed up to ask if I had enjoyed the running course!  Very rare to get that level of service.  Breakfasts were delicious and location is very central - overall a great experience.",5,2015,07,01
128,Fun but flawed,"Good location for The City or the  Barbican.  Nice reuse of the old brewery, which makes it architecturally interesting. Updated rooms.  Nice clientele.  But....the oh so fashionable room decor (think clear wall on the bathroom so you can watch your loved one shower; yes, there's a curtain if you want) sometimes misses the mark when it comes to functionality such as needing to charge multiple electronic devices at once. And the concierge staff was uneven; good on some occasions but outright awful on others. Once the curt, superficial instructions led to getting lost. And they literally had never heard of the Guildhall -- the ceremonial and administrative center of the City of London that's a ten-minute walk from the hotel.  Come on Montcalm, you're better than that. Train your concierge to be at least as knowledgeable as a London Cab driver.",3,2015,07,01
128,a great 5 stars hotel in central London,"a great 5 stars hotel, with all facilities and more, well located. Nice staff. Continental breakfast at the launch was generous and tasty. The room was quite small, and so is the bathroom, but who wants to spend time in the room, when you are in London. So much to do in a walking distance. ",5,2015,07,01
128,Long weekend in London,"This was a combination business/pleasure weekend and we had heard good things about this hotel, but were a bit let down by the accommodation. The room was rather small and noisy on the street side. Breakfast was across the street in the Jugged Hare, but on Sunday it was full and the waiting time long. The bar area was awkward for eating with stools and barrels so was not comfortable.
It was also a bit difficult by the check in as I arrived early and was asked to pay in full to obtain the key, but I did not have the business credit card. After some discussion, mine was  taken to secure the room although they obviously had one on file for the reservation. A lot of the staff were also difficult to understand as English was not their first language.",3,2015,06,30
128,The perfect weekend,"This was a special weekend our first away together as a couple and it was everything we could have wished for. Laura contacted me the evening before our arrival and was there at the desk when checking in, her attention to our needs made the stay so much more enjoyable, in fact all of the staff were second to none and extremely helpful courteous and polite. If you are looking for a quiet Hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the west end this has to be the one. A short walk to St Paul the Globe Theatre plus Borough Market and many other lovely sights for us this was the 'Perfect Weekend' and one we will not forget. 
Many thanks 
Paul and Stacey.",5,2015,06,30
128,Yet another wonderful stay,Our 5th or 6th stay here now and I will continue to post good reviews as long as the service remains of such a high quality. Hotel is 'quirky' but main delight is the friendliness and service offered by the hotel staff.  It does seem that everyone is genuinely pleased to see you again.  Please continue!,5,2015,06,30
128,Very good,"I was quite amazed with the standards offered at this hotel - good value for money. Few details worth mentioning: very comfy bed and pillows, well designed room though a bit small, perhaps the best chocolate croissant I have ever eaten and excellent coffee:) at breakfast, comfy slippers, and more importantly, very nice and kind team who are willing to help at all times. On the downside, to reach some rooms, you have to walk up and/or down few stairs - they had to keep some parts as original - it is an old brewery as the new gives away.",5,2015,06,29
128,Great location but dissapointing room,"Just a one night stay as we were seeing a play round the corner at The Barbican. The hotel was ideally located for us, away from the madness of the WestEnd, but striking distance of anywhere in the capital thanks to nearby tube and train.

We were warmly welcomed despite a really busy check-in area caused chiefly by a wedding party. Having booked a club room we were looking forward to staying in the main hotel but instead were ushered across the road to a block of ""city apartments"" managed by the hotel group. This was supposed to be ""an upgrade"" but was actually a poor excuse for the fact that the hotel was full of the wedding party and as a result guests were being re-accommodated across the road. the resultant room (605) was devoid of most daylight and had a kitchenette with a solitary bottle of water and some third rate tea and coffee supplies.. The rest of the room was clean, modern and well designed but I couldn't help feel we had been 'bumped' from our original £200+ room. Unfortunately when I went to enquire why this was the reception area was awash with wedding guests checking in and reluctantly left things and stayed put. The issue was however mentioned next morning at checkout and met with an empathetic apology.
Breakfast next door at the Jugged Hare was average but not great as staff were rushed off feet from the wedding party. Breakfast looked as though it could have been good but the buffet lacked a number of items waiting fro replenishment. The tables in the Jugged hare are REALLY close together so movement without spilling items on your neighbouring table is a challenge. A shame, as it looks as though it could be good if they weren't as overrun.
Sadly, not a property we'd choose again, but if on form, they might be OK.",3,2015,06,29
128,Worth the money,"Excellent hotel. Well placed. Great club lounge. Excellent and very helpful staff, could not do enough for us. A lovely change to some hotels.  Breakfast was good.  The room and bathroom luxurious.  A well placed hotel and easy to access the Underground",5,2015,06,29
128,An excellent stay at this 'hidden gem' of a hotel in the City.,"I stayed overnight at The Montcalm at the Brewery, London City, in June 2015. The hotel is housed in the listed former Whitbread Brewery building, dating from around 1750, but sympathetically updated to include all modern amenities. It is immediately opposite the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and only a few minutes' walk from The Barbican Arts Centre, as well as being near many law firm offices and a short walk from both Barbican and Moorgate tube stations.

My room, on the ground floor, was spotlessly clean and in excellent decorative order as, indeed, was the hotel as a whole. The bed was very comfortable, with plenty of supportive but not too hard pillows. The bathroom included a bath with both hand-held and overhead shower. There is free Wi-Fi in all rooms ('though I did not use this facility myself).

I had booked English breakfast, which is provided in 'The Jugged Hare' pub; itself part of The Montcalm. This was a self-service buffet meal including cereal, eggs, bacon, sausages, pastries, etc. and was very good. All the staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly without being obtrusive. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,28
128,Excellent hotel with first class service,"I had a weekend getaway in London and decided to stay at Montcalm London city. 
The hotel was luxurious and modern and the service was brilliant. First class all the way! 
I had booked a single room so the room was small, can't complain on that. The reception supervisor apologize because they were fully booked and she couldn't upgrade me to a better room but she then gave me complimentary breakfasts at the club lounge. I think this is a nice touch. The breakfast has sufficient variety of food (cheese, various bread, pastries, yoghurt, various fruits, nice choice of coffee, various cold cuts) and they are all fresh and of good quality.  
They also provide complimentary fruit at your room which I also think as a nice welcome gesture.
The inside of the hotel is a bit maze like and maybe a bit confusing at first but you just have to get used to the twist and turns and somehow it feels artsy :-)
I don't really have a real complain for the hotel. I think all the staff are also polite and helpful. They even offer morning and evening turndown service for your room if you want it. 
The surrounding of the hotel is also nice, you have some restaurants and pubs nearby, Tesco express is just 3 minutes walk, Barbican tube station is only 8 minutes leisure walk
I love this hotel, it is a bit pricey but I think it really worth the money that you spend.",5,2015,06,28
128,5 star hotel with 5 star staff,"Booked as a special treat for my 30th birthday, was reduced price on Booking.com, and was cheaper then Premier Inn, Travelodge.  We arrived an hour before check in and room was ready also we were upgraded for free with it being my birthday, and had balloons on bed, coffee machine and cupcakes with a card, was delighted with the room, had superior double, Queen sized bed, all amenities Inc bathrobe and slippers. Bathroom was spacious, clean with option of rain shower or bath pus lovely toiletries. 

Could not fault the hotel with its attention to detail and help fullness of the staff. Will be coming back  for my birthday next year.Thankyou for making it part of a very special weekend.",5,2015,06,28
128,I Will Stay Again,"I stayed at the Montcalm as part of BritMums Live weekend over the 19th & 20th June. The service was fantastic and the staff were efficient, friendly and helpful. The room itself was small but very well appointed - they even have floor heating in the bathroom and a button to press for Do Not Disturb or Please Clean the Room. They leave fresh fruit and water for you and there is the traditional turn-down service with mints on the pillow and a card with the following day's weather forecast. The only slight drawback is that the hotel itself is like a maze due to the fact that it used to be a brewery (not the hotel's fault in the slightest!). Also, I found it a bit confusing to get to breakfast - it wasn't that well sign-posted! The best thing was that it was quiet - there was no road noise as it is well set back. I will certainly stay here again next year.",4,2015,06,27
128,Great Experience,"I stayed here for work and the location was very close to the Tube station so that I could get around the city very easily.  My room came with Breakfast and a Happy Hour complimentary!  The staff in the Club Room were very helpful and pleasant.  I cant say enough about the excellent customer service from all staff at this hotel, from Reception to House Keeping they always had a smile on and would assist in everything!

The Rooms were beautiful and the Bed was AMAZING!!!  When I registered they asked me what type of Pillows I like and if I wanted a fragrance!  I chose Feather and Lavendar and I have never slept better!  

Thank you so much for the great stay and I will definitly come back on my next business trip!",5,2015,06,26
128,Excellent hotel,"I stayed here with my girlfriend back in May and we can’t recommend it enough. From the moment you walked to the front door and your bags were collected, to the moment we left the service was incredible. We had a complimentary upgrade to the Club Room, the room was a great size especially for central London. Everything was clean and well kept. The hotel is a few minute walk form the tube as well, so very convenient.",5,2015,06,25
128,Well worth a stay,"Excellent hotel slightly quirky as it is the Old Brewery, but still lots of quality to enjoy, very good breakfast pleasantly served, traditional London pub adjoining.
Friendly and accommodating staff always happy to help.
Good location.",5,2015,06,23
128,Great one night stay,Took my girlfriend away in March for her birthday. By far exceeded expectation. Booked this hotel due to the excellent reviews it had received and was not disappointed. Our room was upgraded upon arrival and the manager came and spoke to me personally. They had tried to call me beforehand to see if it was for a special occasion and see if they could make any special arrangements but unfortunately missed this call. Received a complimentary bottle of one to top it all off. Breakfast was great and the staff were more than helpful and polite. Will be hopefully returning with my girlfriend in the not so distant future.,5,2015,06,23
128,A PLEASANT STAY,"We were forced to book this accommodation at the last minute when our previous accommodation fell through so we didn't have many options.  Having said that, this hotel is very nicely furnished, smart modern decor and excellent bathrooms.  The beds were very comfortable and good quality bed linen.  The wifi was fast and the staff were very efficient - nice touch in the turn-down service at night. The location is better for business travellers however, it suited us as we were there to visit our son in Shoreditch and so found it comparatively convenient. It's a pricey hotel and I think unless you really want that location, better value can be found elsewhere, however we did enjoy our stay.",4,2015,06,23
128,One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in lately,Definitely the most comfortable bed I've experienced. The Montcalm is tastefully decorated in the old Whitbread Brewery head office and brewery. It's a great stay with good hospitality. Good value for my weekend stay but not sure how expensive in the week. A 5 Star experience.,5,2015,06,22
128,Very convenient for the City.  Attentive staff.,"Very handy location between Barbican and Moorgate stations if you've business in the city or want to be close to Islington.  There was always plenty of staff around and any requests of housekeeping were promptly handled.

The ""Jugged Hare"" for breakfast was actually a nice way to have a very hearty traditional breakfast.",5,2015,06,22
128,Even better than before,"My third stay at this lovely hotel. Staff were delightful, helpful and happy. The room smart and clean. A comfy bed and good wifi. 
On the downside, a little road noise but not terrible, on the plus side, everything else. Would definitely stay here again next time.",5,2015,06,22
128,Absolutely loved this hotel.,"This hotel has a perfect mix of old and new. I can not fault one thing. there is a quirkiness in it with the history of the old brewery. where we had breakfast you felt parts of the past history had been tastefully kept.The food was brilliant. Our room was lovely and comfortable and luxurious. I just loved everything about this hotel from start fto finish, We were made to feel at home from the minute we arrived and i most certainly did not want to leave this unusual hotel. I will definitely go back again.",5,2015,06,22
128,Fabulous,"This hotel really is an oasis of calm and luxury in the middle of London. It's not only a beautiful (& quirky) building, the staff are the most helpful and polite I have ever met in a central London hotel. Beautiful rooms, Elemis toiletries in the bathroom. This will be my first choice of hotel to stay in London from now on.",5,2015,06,22
128,Luxurious hotel,"Enjoyed staying here - lovely hotel, attentive service and nice room.
Only potential downside was street noise during the night from outside the room.  I'm not sure what could be done about that other than maybe more glazing on the windows to offer further sound proofing?  But all in all - great hotel.",5,2015,06,22
128,Last minute delight,"We booked this a few hours before we arrived, having decided to extend celebrations for our son's 21st birthday and stay over in London.  Lovely hotel, lovely room.  Staff very helpful.  A great end to a fabulous evening spent with our lovely sons.",5,2015,06,21
128,An oasis of calm in the City,"The Montcalm is a treasure in the heart of London's Square Mile. Every small detail has been thought of in equipping the rooms, the staff are some of the most helpful in London and The Jugged Hare is now one of my favourite haunts (although not one for Vegetarians!). World class staff - wow!",5,2015,06,21
128,Sat night,"Comfortable room in a nice hotel. Provided feather pillows on request. Good night's sleep.
Jugged Hare pub attached to the hotel provided a great venue for an afternoon drink.
Hotel itself had character although due to design was a bit of a rabbit warren.",4,2015,06,21
128,"Bed, Bubbles and Breakfast","We stayed at the Montcalm in March. As for visiting 5 star establishment goes, our expectations were sadly not meet. However we discussed this with the hotel and decided to return at the end of May.
The hotels communication was excellent on organising our next booking. We arrived early, and were offered refreshments in the club lounge whilst we waited for our suite to be readied. Shortly after, we were taken to one of the Montcalm's 'WoW' Suites. It very much lived up to its title. Beautiful furniture which was headlined by a solid wood 4 poster bed. Our bathroom facilities were of a great standard if a little small for such an impressive room.Our nights sleep was more than comfortable.
In the morning we went down for breakfast in the Jugged Hare, which had an exceptional selection of continental and traditional fare. All of which was fabulously presented and tasted delightful.
I'd like to also take a moment to commend the incredible service that the staff gave us. Well dressed, well mannered and attentive. No request was too difficult.
On checking out, we were asked if our expectations had been met?
I took the opportunity to say that they hadn't just been meet, they had been surpassed.
So, if your looking for a 5 star experience, in the heart of the city look no further than the Montcalm at the brewery.
A final thankyou to Sanjeev and Megha. Look forward to seeing you again soon.",5,2015,06,18
128,Perfect stay in London City,"Surprisingly good quality for money - not your typical shabby London hotel. Rooms are traditionally small, but look great and all the facilities are impeccable. Extremely helpful and friendly staff, enjoyed dealing with them. Will definitely stay there again when need a place in City!",5,2015,06,18
128,"Delightful, fabulous stay!","A world class hotel staff! We have never had better service. Everything was perfect. Everyone did everything possible to make our stay overly pleasant. We loved the Montcalm and would stay at this brand first every time we travel,",5,2015,06,18
128,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here as my daughter had moved in to some uni accommodation nearby.  Fantastic hotel, excellent staff with beautiful rooms.  We booked a club room and had access to the club lounge which was great as you had free drinks & nibbles in the evening.  Had breakfast in the Juggled Hare, which was a full breakfast although the club lounge offered you a small breakfast choice too.  Must admit the breakfast in the Juggled Hare was very busy and the tables very close together but all in all a great selection.  Would recommend this hotel to everyone and will be staying here again.",5,2015,06,17
128,Perfect weekend,"Were greeted by Megha on arrival who couldn't have done more to make us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay.  The rooms and service are exquisite and as we were staying on the occasion of our anniversary, we were given some lovely perks to make the weekend feel extra special.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the Club Lounge affords guests some extra luxury including a nice breakfast and canapes and drinks in the evening.  Overall, this was one of the best places we have ever stayed and although all the staff were friendly, Megha went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect.",5,2015,06,16
128,Perfect short break,"From the minute we walked into the hotel, my girlfriend and I were welcomed and treated with great care an attention.  We were only using the hotel as a base and didn't eat or take advantage of the wellness facilities but all our needs were met with charm and quality service. A unique pub attached to the hotel, which served a lovely breakfast and very high quality ales and wines. The room was excellent; well-furnished and comfortable. Will definitely be back the next time we're in that part of town!",5,2015,06,16
128,5 Star Service in the City of London,"London is an expensive place to stay... but if you're going to stay somewhere expensive, then it should be top notch - The Montcalm at the Brewery delivered on that promise. I've stayed here twice in the last two years, both times whilst working conferences at The Brewery. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, the rooms are clean and (for London) spacious, the showers are good, and the beds are very comfy. If you've got the cash, and service is key, then I can't recommend the Montcalm enough.",5,2015,06,16
128,Montcalm at The Brewery,"We booked on the day of our stay on a website, it was a bank holiday so got a good deal.  Great hotel & building & loved the room- large & very comfy, great bed & cosy sofa & great bathroom with nice toiletries & super clean.  Hotel staff were friendly & professional, helping us find a parking space & staff brought soy milk to the room and extra tea bags when requested, I'd stay here again for sure. Oh and it's got a good pub adjoining it, foods good they even did a vege option for me.",5,2015,06,16
128,lovely weekend,"Stayed in Montcalm club room with daughter for girly weekend and concert at o2. 
lovely room, lovely breakfast, lovely staff. Felt nice safe area at night when returning back in evenings. loved quirkiness of hotel building.
 Easy to get to shopping areas and easy to get to o2.
would love to come back to stay with my husband in future.
had issue with tv on first night but it was sorted with an engineer in 10 minutes!
will definitely recommend to friends wanting hotel in London.",5,2015,06,15
128,"We felt very taken care of, a lovely place to stay","We were attending a wedding at The Brewery and as it was my husbands birthday on the same day I decided to book a room as a treat. From the first conversation with reservations I knew we would be well looked after. On arrival at the hotel we were told we had been upgraded as it was a special occasion for us and given a beautiful room with enormous bed and lots of goodies in the room including delicious cupcakes, wine, fruit and water.   Everything felt very luxurious and special and all the staff were so helpful and polite. Breakfast in the morning was great with everything you could want and eggs cooked to order anyway you wanted them, I had royal with smoked salmon and hollandaise which was divine and a much needed hangover cure. Megha, the front office manager welcomed us to the hotel and took such great care of us, nothing was too much trouble for her, so thank you Megha and your fabulous team, you are doing everything right, I can't wait for the next special occasion.",5,2015,06,15
128,Exceptional hotel with a very personalised touch,"5* hotel! I stayed at the Montcalm London City for my partner's surprise 30th as was not disappointed. The hotel staff were very friendly, upgraded our room, and even left balloons and cupcakes. I could not fault this hotel in the slightest. Plus its a 10min walk to Shoredich and walking distance to a lot of the London landmarks and sights.

The only piece of advice I would give is breakfast (very delicious and a good choice) can get rather busy as not too many tables, therefore allow a little extra time if its the weekend to have breakfast and enjoy the food. 

Thank you to all the staff! Will definitely be going back to this hotel.",5,2015,06,15
128,"Amazing service, room a little disappointing.","Make no mistakes, this is a lovely hotel with service above and beyond. The only reason I didn't give it 5* was the room experience.
We booked a WOW Suite for one night and assumed that it would have a large bed. All these suites however have a four poster Queen sized bed so we were offered a City Apartment suite instead. I don't think they use this room much because it was missing water, shampoo and bath robes. The bedroom also doesn't have any natural light so feels a little like a bunker.
Overall this is a very busy hotel so if you want a quiet, relaxed away from it all experience, then this wont be the venue for you. If however you want great service in a great location in The City, then you will love it.",4,2015,06,15
128,Excellent stay,"My wife and I stayed here in one of the club room and I have to say it was an excellent hotel. Firstly when you enter the hotel you have someone to take your bags off you and greet you, you arrive at reception staff were again very friendly, we were then taken to our room which was very nice, on the way everything was explained about the hotel. I had told the hotel we were celebrating our anniversary and they kindly left a card, cupcakes and a bottle of wine in the room. We made use of the club lounge with was nice to have a drink before we went out for the evening. Upon returning the hotel turndown service was nice with rose petals and a towel swam on the bed. Breakfast was served in the jugged hare which is the pub attached to the hotel, a brilliant pub! The breakfast was brilliant!! Good choice!! Excellent stay and we will return!!",5,2015,06,15
128,Fantastic Stay and will definitely return !,"We went for a weekend to London and found this hotel were extremely helpful with enquiries and booking over the phone.  We arrived and had a great check-in and were extremely pleased with our room which was spacious and lots of 'mod-cons' with a few quirky features of the old brewery.  We were upgraded to a Montecalm Club and had access to the evening sandwiches and canapes which were delicious and we can recommend the Pimms !!!  

We slept well with the plush bedding and pillow menu and found the staff and service fantastic.  This hotel definitely offered the service and quality of a 5* hotel, with Elemis shower gel/shampoo in the rooms and fruit and water on arrival and if you happen to be celebrating a 'special occasion', the staff will go out of their way to make sure they provide something extra in the room.  

The breakfast was well laid out and they used the finest ingredients with a superb cappuccino too.  We could not fault the food, service and staff and next time we are in London we will be sure to return.",5,2015,06,14
128,1st wedding anniversary,"Fantastic hotel. The room was fantastic and very modern, the bed was really comfortable stunning bathroom and extreamly polite and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying again.",5,2015,06,14
128,Nothing is too much trouble.....,"Upgraded to a Club Montcalm room. 
Beautifully decorated, spacious and comfortable. 

Upon arrival to departure staff couldn't do enough. From carrying bags to room and giving a short guided tour, keeping us fed and watered in the club lounge to ensuring a cab was waiting for us when we checked out!!!!

Everything was easy. 

It says 5star and it certainly is. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed being spoiled!!!!!

Easy to access the whole of London with the number 76 outside the hotel and two underground stations within 5 minute walk. 

Would certainly stay again, although may look for an offer..............",5,2015,06,14
128,Amazing Hotel!!,By far the best hotel experience i have ever had.  Staff were immaculate and extremely friendly and went out of their way to help you.  The room was faultless and the breakfast was out of this world.    Already planning my next visit back.,5,2015,06,14
128,Good attention to service and a wonderful maze,"I arrive very early after an overnight flight from South Africa.  While my room was not ready, I was offered a shower and Marcello was very attentive to show me around.  I had a day out in the city and returned to my upgraded room and luggage waiting.
Overall a good week stay - the old building is a real maze.
The area is best suited to business travellers.",4,2015,06,12
128,Faultless hotel,"I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my husband, we wanted to be near Smithfield for a cycling event. I booked through a secret hotels site, not directly, but that made no difference to how we were treated by the staff. Every member of staff we met was amazing and I felt we really given VIP treatment, making my husband's birthday a memorable one! Thank-you Megha and everyone else! This is the best hotel I have stayed in for a long time! The room was luxurious, but cosy. The extras in the room like nespresso machine, fruit, water, wine were a lovely touch. Bed was very firm, that's how I like it. We had the continental breakfast and could return as many times as we wanted to try the different foods available - yoghurt with granola, pastries, fresh fruit, toast, cold meats, cheeses, smoked salmon - yum!

Location was perfect for us as we wanted to be near Smithfield, we also visited Shoreditch and Spitalfields - tube stations aren't far - Barbican, Moorgate, Liverpool Street. Walking distance to popular sites such as St Paul's Cathedral, Museum of London.",5,2015,06,12
128,Fantastic stay!!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Montclam brewery, on arrival the reception desk were extremely helpful and welcoming and informed us they had upgraded us from a  deluxe room to a club room.  On the way to our room, we happened to mention that we were celebrating a anniversary and they offered us a complementary bottle of wine, which was a lovely touch. 

The room itself was amazing, the bed was amazingly comfortable and the glass shower wall and privacy blind were a lovely touch.

I can't recommend the hotel enough.",5,2015,06,12
128,Lovely,"I love staying at the Montcalm. It's a beautiful old building feels antique and modern at the same time. All the staff are super nice and helpful and you have some really sweet perks, like the biscuits they leave for your tea or the mint chocolate for goodnight. It just feels very cozy and welcoming, the location is perfect, especially for a business trip (although it's convenient for a tourist trip as well, very close to the central line and St. Pauls). Last but not least, the complimentary gym and steam bath are quite a bonus!",5,2015,06,12
128,Not as 5* as expected,"The reception area was opulent and the staff were very informative and helpful, perhaps a little too gushy! We only had one small travel case and the porter was a little over-insistent to carry it.
The room was adequate and relatively quiet. Not the most exciting view but we appreciated we were in London so backing onto high rise offices/flats wasn't a surprise! we expected a little more luxury for a 5* hotel as we had booked a deluxe double, but not having seen a double we had nothing to compare it with.
Overall it was a lovely 3 day break, the breakfasts were delicious and the hotel is quirky

Our only criticisms would be;
There seemed to be an excess of staff at breakfast 8-9 people attending to no more than 10 diners. Also, staff were openly conversing, joking with each other, which, although it is good to see staff all get on, seeing and hearing it whilst trying to enjoy breakfast (on all 3 mornings) I felt was a little inappropriate. We overheard one waitress making party arrangements with the other staff, do this in your own time, not when your meant to be attending to guests.
In our room we found the duvet cover had a tear and the bedspread had a stain but when mentioned at reception it was attended to swiftly.
I would ask that Montcalm address their environmental issues - we hung our towels up to dry, not in the bath to be replaced but they were changed every day-not necessary.
The small shower gel toiletry bottles were inadequate. I had a bath the evening of our first day (the water wasn't 'hot' merely warm) so there wasn't enough gel for a shower the following day. I had to ring the concierge to ask for more. They weren't replenished adequately after this either but I lost the will to keep asking.
Having refillable dispensers would be more cost effective and more environmentally friendly and would ensure guests were sufficiently provided with toiletries for the duration of their stay.
Typical as we usually bring our own toiletries but the one trip we don't, thinking a 5* hotel would provide this as a minimum, we end up needing to ask for more! 
To conclude we passed on our comments to reception before we left and received a sincere apology.",4,2015,06,11
128,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed at Montcalm at The Brewery for one night with a friend , while we were in London for a concert at the O2 .
On arrival the staff quickly took our luggage while we checked in . The receptionist Marcello was lovely , he checked us in and upgraded our room at no extra charge , and then took us to our room and informed us about places in the hotel . The room was large with a flat screen TV and a nespresso machine . The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on. As we had been upgraded to a Montcalm Club we were able to use the club lounge were we had afternoon tea all included in our room price.
When we arrived back at the hotel in the evening our bed had been turned down with chocolates on the pillow and a card with the next day's weather in , it's these little touches that make you feel special .
The next morning we had breakfast at the Jugged Hare , which was really good , staff helpful again and got me gluten free bread and cooked me fresh bacon to avoid cross contamination .
On checkout Marcello was again on reception and was so lovely to us , he is a credit to your hotel.
I will be back to stay again soon . Thank you for such a lovely stay and for making us feel welcome .",5,2015,06,11
128,Excellent,"Lovelly hotel. Small and personal. Very nice decor, stylish and modern but not pretentious.

Lots of staff and very good service. Breakfast was excellent.

We chose the hotel as we needed to be in the city, although it really wouldn't matter if you were going out in the West End as one tube ride is much like another - also really nice to escape the noisy crowds at the weekend and walk through the quiet streets.

A good choice!",5,2015,06,10
128,Fantastic Hotel!,"We stayed just 1 night here, but the quality of service and the building itself was exceptional. The staff were so friendly and willing to help.  I was pushing a pram with my 2yr old and lugging a suitcase and the staff were super quick to assist. We were upgraded to a larger room without asking which was perfect.  Room was spacious and spotless. Will stay again!",5,2015,06,10
128,Excellent - ish,"I was staying here for business and 90% loved it. The building is very much old London and the rooms are modern and clean. The only drawback was it was too modern. I was in a suite which was designed to be wheelchair friendly (I am not in wheelchair) so the room was big and bathroom too. However the wash basin was the smallest I have ever seen and bathroom shower setting and taps setting were a real trick to work out. A bit 'too cool for school'.

Apart from that the place is great with friendly professional staff and an excellent restaurant called the Jugged Hare (a gastro pub). I have an excellent burger there and the breakfast was also very, very, good.

I would highly recommend this hotel but ask for a run throug on how to operate the shower and taps. Bottom line. I would stay here again and plan to.",4,2015,06,10
128,one of the best hotels we have stayed at in London,"We stayed at the Montcalm because it was very very convenient for our son's wedding at the adjoining Brewery.
We were extremely impressed with the very friendly and helpful front of house staff.
 We had booked an accessible room because my wife uses a wheelchair.The room was perfect as it was large and the wet room/bathroom was excellent.
 A request for extra towels,toiletries and pillows was actioned immediately without hesitation.
Despite being an old building access for the wheelchair was easily done using a convenient side door.
 Breakfast at the Jugged Hare was a very pleasant experience.The quality and the variety of the food was good.
 My wife and I look forward to staying at the Montcalm-London City hotel again in the near future .
 The hotel is conveniently situated for The Brewery and The Barbican as well as the rest of things that the City of London has to offer",5,2015,06,10
128,Amazing hotel,"In april me and my partner stayed for two nights for my birthday! I would highly recomend anybody to stay here, was made more than welcome by everybody! As it was my birthday we had free breakfast for my birthday free wine and a upgraded room! We will be stopping here again! 
The staff was very helpful as we did a lot if traveling in london, they showed us how to get to places explained the underground to us! I would never be able to put in words how amazing this experiance was! You need to see it for yourself!",5,2015,06,09
128,"Brilliant staff, brilliant hotel... Brilliant everything!","This was just a stunning experience, my wife and I decided to stay here for weekend away in London for our 5 year anniversary. I had contacted the hotel beforehand in secret to surprise my wife and to my surprise we were upgraded and several treats were left in the room. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and you never feel that you asking for too much. My wife and I originally only decided to stay at the hotel as a result of reduced room rate but I think when we return to London, we'd happily play full price.",5,2015,06,08
128,Fantastic stay!,"Had a brilliant weekend staying at the Montcalm (Brewery London City) this weekend. The hotel is located in easy walking distance to both the Barbican and Moorgate Underground stations and is nothing but a short tube ride to all major attractions in the city. 

Me and my partner arrived late on the Friday night and were greeted by the extremely helpful and polite staff who took our bags to the room and informed us of everything we needed to know. When asked if it was a special occasion that brought us to London (and after clarifying that it was a joint birthday weekend), we were sent a complimentary bottle of wine to the room and, staying in the Club Room, were told of the complimentary drinks and canapés in the club lounge. Within the first hour of the stay we felt like the hotel was worth the money we paid. 

The hotel rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable. Although the rooms are small in size, we have stayed in much smaller in London and we did not feel cramped. I recommended paying the little extra for the club room to have that extra space. The rooms are equipped of everything you need and more, and I was impressed by the little things such as a good hairdryer (not the small powerless ones you get in some hotels) and the umbrella in the wardrobe you could take out of the hotel free of charge. The hotel even had hair straighteners if you needd them.  I could not get the coffee machine to work while I was there and could not find instructions to use it, however I was impressed by the fact the room had both tea and 'good quality' coffee making facilities. The room was also equipped with complimentary fruit and water bottles which we took out during the day. 

The included breakfast in the Jugged Hare next door was fantastic, the buffet including continental breakfast, full English, as well as fresh fruit and yoghurt. We ate a larger breakfast at 10-11 and did not need to eat again until the evening. 

I could not recommend this hotel enough and will certainly consider staying here again on my next visit to London.",5,2015,06,08
128,Excellence,"Incredibly helpfull and kind staff all around the hotel, but i must mention especially Marcello's and Biyat's name here.. Very clean, close to the central, real five star.. This was my second staying at the hotel but I guess it will be staying there constantly for my London visits.. Thanks again everyone..",5,2015,06,08
128,A hidden gem of a hotel,"Excellent hotel providing 5 star service.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the juggard hare inn is an additional plus to this hotel, serving excellent breakfasts.  This hotel is a bit of a hidden gem and we will be back !",5,2015,06,07
128,Don't think you'll find better!,"We were looking for a hotel for the weekend close to Smithfield market for an event we were attending.  When we arrived it was a little daunting..in a good way! we were so unused to having so many attentive, helpful and genuinely happy staff to help out.  From then on our experience was excellent, nothing was too much trouble, lots of offers to assist with everything.  Breakfast in the Jugged Hare was also excellent, probably the best spread we have come across, and again the staff were attentive to every need...and were genuinely happy to be there!

Accommodation was smart, clean, modern and did exactly as expected...gave us both excellent nights sleep.

can't rate this hotel high enough....was definitely a fantastic experience :-)

Top of our list going forward.",5,2015,06,07
128,It just could not get any better!!,"Wow, what an amazing hotel with even more amazing staff. My husband and I took our two children (age 12 and 8) to stay in London and visit a few attractions. We opted to stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery and did not regret the decision at all. The room was amazing and offered everything we needed all to a high standard. The cleanliness throughout was to a very high standard and the staff very attentive and could not do enough to help. We enjoyed breakfast at the Jugged Hare and I cannot recommend the Eggs Benedict highly enough! 
We booked directly with Simona who arranged everything perfectly and were then looked after by Megha who was lovely and super friendly ( she even earned a hug from my 8 year old son!). Megha made the visit very memorable for us as a family and we would definitely not hesitate to return. Definitely a must for everyone!",5,2015,06,07
128,Friendly & Convenient,"I stayed here for 1 night with a friend and would recommend it for a really comfortable stay. We asked for twin beds which they were happy to accommodate, the beds were comfortable & room was much bigger than I had expected. The staff were the real stars, super friendly & lovely from start to end.
The only downside was the shower in the ensuite. It really wasn't up to 5star, a small shower at an awkward angle. However as the rest of the experience was so pleasant I would definitely book again but just check the shower in the room first!",4,2015,06,07
128,Really Cool,"Good location. Rooms full of character and great staff. Brilliant price. The rooms are spacious, stylish and quiet. The bed is the most comfortable bed you will ever probably sleep in. The air con was slightly annoying, but that really is clutching at straws.",5,2015,06,07
128,A terrific base for central London,"I have stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery several times, and it has always been a great experience from start to finish.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The rooms and public spaces are impeccably clean and well appointed. Room sizes no doubt vary, but I was staying in their less expensive rooms and found them very spacious for central London.  The only very slight caveat to note for some travelers is that the layout is a little quirky, with quite a few small flights of stairs, so anyone with mobility issues should check with the hotel to make sure this can be accommodated.",5,2015,06,07
128,This hotel is absolutely awesome,"We spent our last couple of days in the UK in this beautiful hotel . We booked the hotel through bookings.com and definitely were impressed. Upon arrive we were welcomed with what felt like open arms and were given an upgrade with complimentary breakfast. We were definitely staying 5 stars. The rooms are beautiful and the bed is luxury comfort. I asked if we could possibly get a late paid late check out and this was no problems and was complimentary , the following day we discovered that our flight was delayed and once again I asked if I could extend  the late check out and pay for this . I was told by Mana ( name probably incorrect) and she told me that its not about the money and upgraded the departure time to 6 pm, she was just wonderful ... I could not recommend this hotel enough it was just superb",5,2015,06,06
128,Very good choice in the lovely business district,"We are very happy to have chosen this hotel for our 5 nights stay in London and would both recommend it and stay here again. 
Located in the beautiful business district it is in short walking distance to must see places like St Paul's cathedral, Tower Bridge etc. Although a bit far from some of other main landmarks it is within a 3 min walk to a subway station so this is not a problem at all. 
The staff was friendly and very helpful, with some very small exceptions. 
The breakfast at Jugged Hare was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
The room we initially got was a bit small and some things weren't working but we were moved in a better, more spacious one the next day, after we kindly asked reception to show us more options. The furniture needs a bit of update but it is overall nice.
Please note that this is mainly a business hotel and it gets crowded during working days. Also, if you want a late drink, except for the mini bar or room service, it will be a bit difficult :)

All in all it was a good choice and we would return.",5,2015,06,06
128,Wowsers at Montcalm,"From the second we walked in we had a great vibe about this place. Very trendy reception but quite classicsl too. Excellent check in and Sangeev was the perfect host. Not only did he give us a personal tour of the hotel, history and facts but personally showed us to our room too. 

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to one of their 4 WOW suites and WOW it was. Very impressive room, plenty of room to dance too !!  Henry Viii would have been delighted with the Tudor 4 poster bed - probably more comfortable than what he would have been used too. 

Great facilities in the room too. Can't rave enough about our stay. 

Doorman with bowler hat adds a perfect English touch. 

We loved our night at this hotel and can not wait to return. See you soon.",5,2015,06,06
128,Great location and perfect for business traveler,"Stayed here for a week on biz. The service was great, the room was really big and the room service had an ample menu. The place is really big so leave time for walking - to the gym or lounge rooms.  Yes, it's that big. Only complaint was it was a bit drafty.",4,2015,06,05
128,I'd go back,"Stayed on a Sunday night in preparation for an early presentation nearby the following morning. At check in was told I'd been upgraded to a club room - it's location means it's hardly going to get much business at weekends - and the room matches most of the other TA reviews.

Rainfall shower was closer to a slight drizzle but apart from that everything was excellent. Good value for £150.",4,2015,06,04
128,Quiet and good hotel,"Very Quiet Hotel. To reach out the room first time you will need a map, it's like a labyrinth, because of it maintains the same structure than the ancient brewery. I missed out a little more light in the room, I guess it's not enough with the current lights. Very City Centric, you can walk from the hotel along the City until the Thamesis river in less than 30 minutes. Free WIFI in all hotel with good coverage. Maybe the breakfast could be little better. I cannot use the wellness area: Sauna, Gym, but they were there. In the room there is a desk very useful, in where you can use wall sockets for UK, 2 rounded pins and USB.",4,2015,06,04
128,Center City luxury,"The location is ideal, with a bus stop right outside the door. Very beautiful lobby with dark finishes and leather furniture. From Concierge to maid service, their attention to detail is impeccable. We had a double, and the room has every amenity you could need, straight down to universal outlets to plug I n whatever you need. American, UK, USB, perfect! 
Fantastic wash room amenities including rain fall shower and ultra modern decor. Super comfortable bed, though with my tall husband a bigger bed would've helped. I'd definitely recommend this hotel, and stay here again.",5,2015,06,03
128,Nice stay,"My partner and I had a nice stay at the Montcalm. It was my partner's birthday and the hotel (in particular Megha, who made sure we were welcomed) made sure that the room was decorated for the occasion, which I appreciated.",4,2015,06,03
128,Beyond expectations.,"We booked in for a 2 nights holiday. Our room was upgraded by the hotel staff. It wasn't large, but it was fully equipped and well organized. the bed was comfortable. The shower was spacious. The minibar was full of beverages and we got fruits and chocolates daily without any additional charge. The room was Very clean and comfort and in a winning location. The staff was very polite and always willing to help.

I would surely recommend it to my friend and come again the next time.",5,2015,06,03
128,Fab!,Everyone is so nice friendly and the atmosphere is great would recommend to anyone who likes to have a good relaxing time! Just again want to say a big thank you to all the staff that made us fee welcomig!!,5,2015,06,02
128,Wonderful stay,I booked a night in a club room at the Montcalm as a suprise for my husbands 40th birthday.  On arrival we were greeted by extremely friendly and helpful staff. The room was fantastic and had everything we could need. Also in the room was a gift of some wine and a card for my husband.  We visited the club lounge for complimentary drinks and snacks later in the day and found the staff once again friendly and attentive. After a comfortable nights sleep we had breakfast in the Jugged Hare which was extremely good. All in all a wonderful stay at the Montcalm and we hope to return one day.,5,2015,06,02
128,Business and leisure,Very friendly staff! Specially Claudin S. !!! Rooms clean with plenty amenities. We recommend the pub restaurant under the hotel! The Jagged Hare ! Amazing !!!!! Thank you for a lovely weekend . We will come back . June 2015  ................,4,2015,06,02
128,Stunning hotel with high class service,"We stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights. The hotel was beautiful, the extras in the room made our stay even more special and the service from the staff was excellent. The breakfast was also lovely. You could choose from a ful English to anything on the menu including eggs Benedict (my favorite).",5,2015,06,02
128,WOW - What a great hotel,"Simply a great experience.  I booked a night at the Montcalm Hotel for my husbands birthday and from the time we arrived at reception we were treated like royalty.  The reception staff were so nice, they informed me that because it was a special occasion we were upgraded to the WOW Suite.  Megha, the Front of House Manager met us at reception to escort us to our room.  The room was simply beautiful, and as the name suggests, WOW - it had a four poster bed decorated with balloons and flower petals.  Megha had also dressed the table with cakes, fruit and a bottle of red wine, she waited around to see our reaction and was satisfied to see our delight with the room.  The bathroom was lovely with a rainwater shower and posh toiletries.  When we came back to the room after seeing a Westend show, our room had been turned down, towel art on the bed, and a bottle of Champagne on ice waiting for us.  There was also a card from Megha wishing us a lovely stay.  The breakfast the next day was in the Jugged Hare, one of the best breakfasts we've had for a long time, very fresh, hot and plenty  of choice - definitely set us up for the day.
So in a nutshell - this hotel is superb, the rooms are fantastic, the service is the best we've ever had, the staff are great, Megha is lovely, the location is ideal for all areas in London with the Underground just around the corner.  Absolutely no negatives and will book again when we next visit London.  THANK YOU SO MUCH",5,2015,06,02
128,Great stay,"Stayed for one night, had the best night sleep ever! Old building so the rooms were very well sound proofed. Mix of contemporary style with old quirkiness of the brewery. Staff were very friendly and very attentive - there seemed to be lots of them everywhere. The Jugged Hare bar /bistro and The Chiswell street dining rooms are attached to the hotel which were both very busy for Friday night. We were given free access to the club lounge in the hotel which was a little soulless but it did give us time to look at maps etc over a drink. Couldn't find any fault with the hotel, great stay and lovely hotel, staff really went out of their way to do all they could to make us welcome.",4,2015,06,02
128,Nice hotel in rebuilt old Withbread Brewery.,"Almost in the busy center of London City, enough of beat to be in a silent part of it. The old graveyard Bunhill Fields in the neighborhood where the famous poet and artist William Blake as well as the author Daniel Defoe are buried. A short walking distance to The Gherkin, The Cheese Grater, Walkie-Talkie and Lloyds Bank of London, for those interested in modern architecture.",5,2015,06,02
128,Wonderful,"Great and attentive service.
Very comfortable spacious room with lovely excellent quality toiletries. Other nice touches included complimentary fruit, bottled water and magazines.
Room service breakfast was very good quality and delivered on time.",5,2015,06,02
128,Fantastic staff compliment this great hotel.,"Found the staff very accommodating and the hotel clean and the rooms, we had a club room, very nice indeed. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Well situated next to the barbican centre, near both the Barbican and Moorgate underground stations. Next time I stay in london, will look at this hotel first.",5,2015,06,01
128,Incredible hotel,"Had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Montcalm for 3 nights. The hotel itself is beautiful and modern. The location is excellent and many of the popular attractions are easily accessible by metro. The rooms are extremely clean, the beds are quite comfortable, and the bathrooms very nice as well. We happened to be celebrating an occasion in London and the staff actually went out of their way to acknowledge the occasion and festively prepare our room with some decorations and complimentary items. They also upgraded us at no additional cost to a nicer room. It was a really thoughtful gesture and made our experience that much more special. It was clear that they take a great deal of pride in their customer service and ensuring their customers have a great experience. I couldn't recommend them more strongly. Will be our first choice the next time we're in London.",5,2015,06,01
128,Montcalm,"The stay was amazing from start to finish. On arrival there was staff to greet us at the door, we were then greeted again when we got inside. The staff at the reception were very polite, kind and helpful. On check in they informed us on all goings on in the hotel, they even upgraded our room with a complimentary bottle of wine due to it being our one year anniversary. They had a member of staff show us to our room and carry our luggage. They ensured the room was suitable and in working order. The beds were so comfy and the room was squeaky clean. They also have a concierge service of which was amazingly helpful, we asked for recommendations on restaurants and gave our choice of cuisine. The concierge found us a restaurant in reasonable distance, booked our table and also printed a map with a quick route. Undoubtably one of the greatest hotel experiences so far. Would highly recommend to any one thinking of staying there and will definitely be returning. Thank you for a pleasant stay :)",5,2015,05,31
128,The Best.....,"Had a wonderful stay in the hotel for one night. We where in London for surprise birthday party. 

The room was spacious and very well equipped with a nesspresso coffee machine ( nice touch!!), tea coffee, mini bar and a lovely bowl of fruit. We had one of best nights sleep ever.  

The front of house staff where really helpful and polite",5,2015,05,31
128,Beautiful hotel in very good location,"This is a gem of a hotel. We stayed there for one night for a stopover in London and we were so pleased with our choice. The service is A star and the staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean, cosy and very quiet. The location is also perfect, we found it easier to walk to Barbican Station rather than Moorgate and Barbican had better connections too. Both Are about 5 mins walking distance. We would definitely stay here again especially if we catch it on an offer.",5,2015,05,31
128,Fantastic,"Just returned from a weekend in London celebrating my partner's birhtday with an overnight stay at the Montcalm.  We were kindly upgraded to the Montcalm Club room, it was amazing.  The hotel is beatufully decorated throughout and the staff were superb, they are all extremely professional and they make you feel very special.  We will definitely return very soon.",5,2015,05,31
128,Outstanding Service  & Excellent Staff,I've stayed at the Montcalm three times and always had great service hence returning. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who made my wife's birthday extra special. As we had a club room we used the club lounge which has an excellent choice of drink. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,05,31
128,A great find with exceptionally friendly and helpful staff,"The Montcalm at the Brewery is a fabulous hotel located a short walk from Moorgreen tube in the city of London. The staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful. They couldn't do enough to help - a sign of being extremely well-trained I'm sure. We stayed in a club room which was lovely and quiet and beautifully appointed (although more towel rails in the bathroom would be helpful). The complimentary breakfast in the Club Lounge was a great way to start the day with a selection of fruit, pastries and continental fare, enjoyed in a peaceful lounge with the morning papers. I would thoroughly recommend The Montcalm at The Brewery as a London base. We hope to go again before too long!",5,2015,05,31
128,Terrific,"As a small group of friends, we stayed here as a base for a couple days of shopping, dining and theatre going. 

Our suite was large, clean and more than adequate! We enjoyed the hotel bar with its' variety of house drinks and excellent service before embarking on a fun night in Londontown. 

This hotel has an upscale feel and superb service. I will be staying here again. ",5,2015,05,30
128,Wonderful 50th Birthday Break,"I and my husband have just had a superb long weekend away at the Montcalm to celebrate my special Birthday.  I cannot praise the staff at the Hotel enough - they were just so friendly, helpful and genuinely wanted to make our stay as memorable as possible.  I had balloons, fruit, wine and other extras in our lovely room upon arrival and throughout our stay and this was all organised by Megha, the marvellous Front Office Manager.  The full buffet breakfast was gorgeous and very relaxing and the Club Room was also great as a place to chill out and have a quiet coffee or other beverage.  We can't recommend it enough and are booking again very shortly!",5,2015,05,29
128,FABULOUS!,"Spend a night at this lovely Hotel.  Room very elegant and super clean!! Staff a joy to deal with, nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfast was included in price, which was extremely high standard, every you could want was available at your wish.  All in all a very enjoyable stay in this wonderful building. My praise to all the staff who were warm and welcoming.......Superb!!!!!",5,2015,05,29
128,Superb standard - as I've come to expect ,"My third stay at the Montcalm was fabulous as usual. 

Each time I've arrived I've been upgraded to a superior room than I paid for, which is always a nice touch! The check in experience is quick and pleasant (there really is nothing worse than a check in that drags on...), and we were shown to our suite by the duty manager. 

The room was faultless, and the turndown service is a touch that is missed at far too many hotels. 

This will remain as my favourite hotel in the city - well worth it's ranking. 
",5,2015,05,29
128,Gem of a hotel in the heart of the City,This is a fantastic hotel in a great location. Staff are great and both restaurants offer up great quality cuisine. Rooms can get a bit warm in summer so be sure to leave the air con on when you go out which means you need to request two keys so that you can leave one in the room to power everything.,5,2015,05,29
128,Stunning experience,Spent a beautiful weekend at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City with my partner. On arrival we were welcomed by very friendly staff and made to feel very special. A big thank you to Megan (front of house Manager) and her team for doing an excellent job. I will stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to any visitor to London. Well done Montcalm!!!,5,2015,05,28
128,A wonderful and unique hotel with the most helpful of staff,"Two of us stayed here as part of a last minute thing and were treated like royalty. When we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded to a better room for no extra charge which was fabulous. The staff were both engaging and friendly whilst being professional and incredibly helpful. A chap called Claudiu was particularly helpful in showing us to our room whilst telling us the history of the old brewery that the hotel is built in. The room was of a very high standard and the hotel felt very safe and welcoming. I cannot recommend the place enough. Our first stay but we will certainly be back whenever we come to the Capital.

I would recommend this place to anyone but particularly those who appreciate good service and professional staff.",5,2015,05,28
128,Birthday stay,"Having stayed in Feb and again in May. I can say this is my favourite hotel in London. The service is second to none, the Montcalm club rooms and wow suites are exemplary and the character of the building adds to the experience. I will definitely go back and cant wait to go back ",5,2015,05,28
128,Very comfortable stay...,"I stayed at the Montcalm for almost two weeks in early May. The location was excellent; within 10 minutes walking distance to Moorgate tube station and my office. 

I stayed in a Club room which was very spacious and gave me access to the Club Lounge that served complimentary continental breakfast and canapés, beverages and spirits in the evening. The bed was really comfortable and the mattress was not too soft. The downside; it was difficult to work in the room because the desk was smallish and the lighting was insufficient but not something that would stop me from returning to this hotel. If possible, do ask for a higher floor as the pub below my room on the second floor was quite lively till about 1 am on some nights and could be difficult to sleep. 

The bathroom had a great rain shower with good water pressure but the wash basin counter space was quite limited. I did enjoy the warm toilet floor and heated towel rack. 

I dined in the restaurant once and found the food to be of very high quality and the service was good too. The menu is quite extensive and I would have dined there again if I had the chance. 

Overall, I quite liked my stay and be warned that the layout of the hotel is very unusual because it is not your typical hotel building. It is an old brewery building and is spread out over different wings. Some guests were visibly annoyed at the maze-like layout but I enjoyed its and figured out how to find my room by the second evening. 

There are several pubs and some dining options closer to the main road and the tube station and even more within a 15 minute walk from the hotel. 

The staff at the hotel were very pleasant, efficient and obliging. I was quite surprised to receive a bottle of the beer brewed in-house with compliments from the hotel manager; much appreciated. 

I will definitely return to stay here when I visit London on business. ",4,2015,05,28
128,Excellent Staff and Great Hotel,The hotel staff were very friendly and the service that every single member of staff gave was exceptional. The hotel was beautiful and the facilities were excellent. Great location in London relatively quiet and our stay was perfect.,5,2015,05,28
128,A good place to stay,"The check-in was quick and efficient and due to the slightly unusual layout of the hotel we were shown to our room. The room was not the biggest but for the price it was lovely - good rain shower, comfy bed, free fruit and a USB port for phone charging.",4,2015,05,28
128,Wonderful hotel worth every penny,"Very friendly and welcoming extremely well looked after. Would definitely recommend people to go we will certainly be returning.  Amazingly spacious room with lovely finishes and top quality products and equipment.     
      
      
      ",5,2015,05,27
128,Fantastic hotel and staff,"On our arrival we were asked if it was a break or celebrating something special. It was our 10 year wedding anniversary I informed the reception. From here on they made our stay so special, up graded room, cup cakes, wine, rose petals, swans made out of towels and balloons each time we returned to our room there was a new surprise. The decor is fantastic and staff are exceptional. 5 stars all round",5,2015,05,27
128,Problems dealt with brilliantly,"went to check in recently for a business trip only to find out that the hotel was having ""maintenance issues"" with one wing. Disappointing, but the reception staff dealt with the situation brilliantly.  They asked if I would be Ok to transfer to their sister hotel - M by Montcalm approx 10 mins away.  They were hugely apologetic, offered taxi transfers (I walked, because it was a nice evening, I had limited luggage and it was 10 minutes). They had maps available.  The reception at the other hotel were expecting me, they did email the receipt the next day and the room at the M hotel was lovely. 

So bad situation made good. Thank you Montcalm.",4,2015,05,27
128,Perfect Anniversary getaway ,"Went here for my 2nd wedding anniversary! Easy access to the tube to get around all of Londons main sites, the rooms were just amazing, couldn't fault this place in anyway, would definitely return to this place! Got such a good deal on Lastminute that it was quite unbelievable the room we got for the money 5* all the way ",5,2015,05,27
128,birthday weekend,"We stayed here for my Wife's Birthday for two nights the Hotel staff were the best we have experienced in London Hotels, They could not do enough for us. The Hotel is lovely and has maintained the original architecture and some of the features from when it was a brewery which ads to the atmosphere. Our room was a Montcalm club room and probably the best nights sleep i have had, well decorated and nice touches like the Nesspresso machine etc.   We will definitely be staying again",5,2015,05,27
128,"Freindly, helpful, quiet and wondeful","This place is a gem. We had a one-night stay and were given free lounge access (where you can get free wine and spirits and food) as it was our wedding anniversary. Our room was comfortable and well-appointed and the bathroom was spotless. Its a 10 quid cab ride into the West End but there is plenty to see locally around the Barbican/Smithfield and the Jugged Hare (which is joined to the hotel) is a wonderful pub that serves excellent food and choice ales and wines. Moreover the hotel breakfast is also servid in the Jugged Hare. The breakfast is delicious and plentiful and the service is first class. In short, a very good London hotel with great staff, food and amenities.",5,2015,05,27
128,Quirky brewery architecture in the center of London,"A short walk from the Moorgate station, this funky hotel has great architecture and a very pleasant, accommodating staff.  The hotel includes rooms created in the original brewery space as well as the building across the street which is slightly more traditional in room layout but still very classy.  A full time concierge is stationed in the reception area of this building so you don't need to run across the street.  The attached restaurant, The Jugged Hare, is fabulous.",4,2015,05,26
128,Stylish hotel with great staff,"My husband and I had booked a 2 night stay to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. On arrival we were pleasantly surprised to be given a complimentary room upgrade. We were shown to our room by the very personable and friendly Vlad. The room was very stylish and well appointed, rainfall shower, great lighting , brilliant hair drier , Hermes lotions and potions and a very comfy bed. There were rose petals scattered on the bed which was a romantic touch. Shortly after we arrived in our room we were given complimentary wine, cupcakes and fruit which was lovely. There are plenty of staff in the hotel to ensure that guests have everything that they need. The staff are extremely well trained and friendly. We will definitely stay here again in the future",5,2015,05,26
128,Excellent Hotel and Perfect Location,"The hotel at the Brewery is perfect for business accommodation or a weekend break in London. Close to The Brewery ( no connect), The Barbican and London Underground. Staff very friendly and professional. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of buffet choice or from their A la carte menu.  The room was spacious with fresh fruit in the room on arrival plus mineral water and a Nespresso coffee maker. I particularly loved the pillow menu and the choice of air freshener available. Overall an excellent one night stay. I would certainly book this hotel in the future",5,2015,05,26
128,"Very welcoming and loved the ""old style"" service","We arrived early to the bowler-hatted doorman's smiles and welcome.  I was expecting to leave our cases and go for a wander as it was only 11am, very pleased to hear that our room was ready for us (I had mentioned on booking that we weren't sure what time we would arrive, and already asked if we could leave the cases there).  We were shown to our room, as indeed the hotel is a maze, which to me added to the charm, being a publicans daughter I loved the fact the hotel was on the site of an old brewery! Lovely comfortable room and bed, the only downside was no view (another building was right next to us) which made the room dark.  I found all the staff very friendly and accommodating, helping with our sight seeing questions, and special thanks to Vlad, the head concierge who indulged my request for an extra set of toiletries for my mum! They were with us within minutes.",4,2015,05,26
128,Olde World Hotel in the heart of London,"Enjoyed our stay at The Montcalm Hotel, staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful.  The rooms were lovely, comfortable, very clean although a little small.  This hotel is close to parking and the London Museum. No restaurant on site but a nice family friendly restaurant close by.",5,2015,05,26
128,PERSONALISATION AT ITS GREATEST,"What a fabulous hotel! The staff were extremely pleasant - the personalisation was something I will remember specifically. I was celebrating a birthday and had a wonderful treat in my room of cupcakes, wine, fruit and balloons, which was a lovely surprise. Amazing history of the building which is incorporated into the hotels decor. Really nice change to see no greasy fry up food at breakfast - great options available and very tasty. The hotel itself is in a great location and very easy to get to from Barbican underground station. I would definitely recommend.",5,2015,05,26
128,Very nice stay,"A friend set up rooms here for two of us. The hotel is a bit of a maze, but nicely finished in a sleek, modern style. Once you get hallway navigation down, easy. 

The rooms themselves were oddly small with huge bathrooms, but was plenty of space for one person to stay in. We stayed two nights and quite enjoyed it. 

The location was great (right by our friend's flat), cute little neighborhood, and very quiet. I'd recommend to someone else and/or stay there again on my next visit to London. ",4,2015,05,25
128,Great hotel,"Superb location, the team made it very family like with greetings and acknowledgements!

Room, super and the food that I got the time to try was excellent!

Two competing hotel restaurants with great reviews that I ran out of time to try!",5,2015,05,25
128,Nice weekend trip to London,"We stayed two nights at the Montcalm, and we were very happy with our stay. They upgraded us to Club Room for free at check-in. The room was nice, not very big, but with a table and two chairs it was enough for us. The bathroom was nice, with bathtub. The pressure in the shower wasn't all that, we had to shower quite long to rinse out the shampoo. They cleaned our room two times per day, and left a goodnight sign and chocolates on our pillows. We didn't eat at the hotel, we ate breakfeast at a nice place just down the street from the hotel. Nice and cheap. Across the street from the breakfeast place it was a Tesco express if you need to buy water etc. Quite calm neighbourhood, but with two tubestations nearby(barbican and moorgate), it is easy to get to the hustle and bustle! 

BUT the best thing about this hotel, is the incredible serviceminded staff. We managed to forget our passports in the safe after checkout, and we called them from the trainstation and they sent one of their employees with a taxi down to us with them. We will be forever grateful for saving us that day! We will stay here again for sure.",5,2015,05,25
128,"Very disappointing - poorly-maintained, noisy, hassle.  Can obviously be much better.","We had a mostly unpleasant time here.  The hotel itself looks very swish, and the greeting was warm on arrival.  Things went downhill from there.  First, there was a mistake in the booking on their side - they'd booked us two rooms rather than one.  No big deal in itself, but perhaps a forewarning of what was to come...

We were taken to the room (they do this because the hotel's a maze - I think it's a nice touch, anyway).  Once the pleasant staff member had left us to it, we tried to operate the motorised blind that visually separates the bathroom (including toilet) from the rest of the room.  It didn't work - it was jammed open.  We phoned for help, and quite a long time later (due to the maze of corridors, presumably) a member of staff arrived and effectively wrote-off the room.  If you're going to have these IMHO completely unnecessary design features in a room, you should at least make sure that it can operate to give privacy to someone needing to use the toilet!

At this point we'd had to wait around quite a while, but hoped that the new room would at least be basically fine.  It was right next to the club lounge, so we asked the different (and surly) member of staff that showed us to the room if it would be noisy.  He gruffly said it was the same as all the others.  This was very much not the case, as we later discovered when the staff and possibly other guests opened and closed the doors to the lounge loudly for a good part of the night and throughout the morning.  It was also directly above a bus stop.  The sink had a large crack in it, the safe didn't work, and even the kettle failed to operate properly, just to add to the sense of woe.

In the morning, we complained again, and were assured that they would resolve the situation to our satisfaction.  Upon returning later in the evening, we'd been moved to one of the WOW suites.  This was indeed better than either of the two rooms we'd been saddled with before, but I think the night rate for it would have been well over 300 quid had we been paying full price.  It was actually a lovely room, but even then the toilet had a leak following flushing.

Summary
-------------

Positives: the apology wine they give you is very drinkable.  The breakfast in the Jugged Hare is nice.  The decor is good.  The second duty manager we dealt with was very professional.

Negatives: needed two bottles of apology wine.  The first duty manager we dealt with punished us for their poor room maintenance by giving us what I can only assume is the worst room in the hotel.  If it isn't, I'd be appalled to see what else they have up their sleeve, although I'm certainly not returning to give them the chance to show me.

A frustrating experience overall - most of the hotel's reviews are very positive, so it feels like we were unlucky with the first room, then the hotel made things worse for us when they should have tried harder at that point, rather than subjecting us to a lousy room for the night, then making things ok for the final night.",1,2015,05,25
128,Chic and stylish,"Very good hotel; excellent service at reception.  Nicely fitted out, spacious rooms, 10 minute walk from Old Broad St and about 15 minutes from Liverpool St station.  Breakfast is light but tasty.  A very good quality business and pleasure hotel, more spacious bedrooms than most.  The bar/restaurant attached gets extremely busy and there's not too much else of equal quality around it that's easy to find, so book ahead. Good stuff. ",5,2015,05,25
128,Luxury at a great price,"This hotel is excellent. Bed comfortable, well equipped room (iron, hairdryer, tea, coffee) Bed is comfortable. Most importantly - staff are lovely and go out of their way to help you. Really enjoyed my stay and would fully recommend. Thank you",5,2015,05,25
128,Nice and close to tube,"Very clean, but rooms are not too big, I got free upgrade to club room which was quite big (for a hotel room). Very helpful service. Nice restaurant next the the hotel and good breakfast cafe close th the hotel",4,2015,05,24
128,AB FAB,"Absolutely fabulous. 6 out of 5. Completely spoilt. This was a birthday surprise booked by my wife and it was an amazing place to stay. Location is very good, close to three underground stations all within a short walk and two rail stations as well. The staff were simply great and couldnt do enough for us, a free upgrade to a club room was totally unexpected. The room amenities are superb, plush inside and out and all mod cons. I cannot fault this hotel in any way not that I would want to. Breakfast was excellent too. Stay if you can as its a treat worth treating yourself to.",5,2015,05,24
128,Now one of my London TopTips!,"A great find, we were treated like royalty from the minute we stepped through the door. The staff were excellent and Megha looked after us brilliantly, she could not have done more to make this stay feel really special. We had a Club Room that was well appointed and comfy. Slept really well.",5,2015,05,24
128,"Fabulous hotel, amazing staff.","This is a little gem of a hotel, the service was outstanding, a warm greeting, friendly staff but professional, they made our stay perfect after a late night arrival from Paris, they gave us a beautiful room with a bed that was heavenly. Beautiful bathroom products, fruit in the room, and as I had just reunited with my first love after 37 years, they gave us breakfast on the house as a generous gesture that made our experience of this hotel a memory to treasure forever. We will be back, if all goes well it will be our honeymoon. Thank you all xx",5,2015,05,23
128,Lovely hotel and staff,Stayed one night after a work party. Reception staff were very welcoming and i was shown to my room personally. Beautiful hotel. Very quiet. I stayed in a deluxe double which was furnished very nicely and bathroom had Elemis products. When i arrived back in my room in the late evening there were chocolates on the pillow and a goodnight card. Lovely touch. Very reasonably priced for London.  A lovely place to stay and i will definitely look to return when next staying in London.,5,2015,05,23
128,Best hotel the city,"My wife and I stayed in the hotel for 1 night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
We were welcomed by the porter who couldn't have been more helpful, he showed us to reception and we were told that our room had been upgraded to a suite with a four poster bed and access to the club lounge which included complimentary snacks and drinks!!

Room was fantastic and every single member of staff was super friendly from the manager to the maids.
When I return to London I will defiantly stay there again!! 

Overall superb value with no compromise in service. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.
Thank you for a wonderful stay in the heart of the city!! ",5,2015,05,23
128,wonderful stay,"Rarely have I come across a hotel as good as this. For a start the location is excellent, central yet quiet, easy to get to. From the doorman to the manager Megha, everyone was extremely helpful and went the extra mile. I wanted a good room as it was a special occasion (my partner's birthday), and without any prompting was given a room upgrade, a celebratory bottle of wine, and a card for my partner,  all waiting in the room for us! The rooms are great quality and spacious, and the restaurant was also very good. This is without doubt my hotel of choice for London, I am already planning another stay in the near future, thanks to all the team who made it such a memorable stay.",5,2015,05,22
128,Wonderful hotel and wonderful staff create a truly memorable stay!,"We were made to feel very special from the moment we checked in until the moment we collected our bags for the journey home. 

Our visit to the Montcalm at the Brewery was truly wonderful, the staff were all welcoming, friendly and professional. We arrived early to drop our bags and were delighted to be personally greeted by the front of house manager who was equally as delighted to offer us an upgraded room. If this excellent service wasn't enough Megha then showed us to our club room which she had decorated in honour of our anniversary celebration! This personal touch was entirely unexpected and made us feel truly special. 

The room was spacious, tastefully decorated and well equipped, with complementary access to the club lounge we didn't want for anything. As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is luxurious and comfortable and yet not at all pretentious. Just a short walk from Liverpool Street Station, Barbican and Moorgate stations the Montcalm at the Brewery is ideally placed in a central yet quiet location with easy access to the city. 

We would like to thank Megha and her team for making our stay truly memorable. We highly recommend this hotel and we look forward to returning again for a longer stay.",5,2015,05,19
128,5 stars but does not wow,"I stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights, in a Montcalm club room. The room was nicely decorated with good use of a window between the bedroom and the bathroom. The room had some special other surprises, such as a fragrance machine and nice Hermes amenities. Staff is welcoming in a less formal way then I sometimes see at such hotels, which is nice. 

The room felt a bit small for 5* benchmark, but then again: this is London. The hotel had a quite confusing lay our.

The price of room service was outrageously expensive, including different additional fees. In addition, the food could have done with better seasoning. There are quite a few nice take aways in the area, sushi/traditional local food/chinese/pizza etc, so opt for that option. 

Book ahead for good prices. Well located for the city.",3,2015,05,19
128,Fantastic hotel in the City,"I stayed here for two nights whilst attending a conference (at the Brewery). Very convenient of course. The hotel itself is wonderful. Every staff member bent over backwards to be helpful. The room was comfortable and a great bed. Wonderful shower and great toiletries. The club was wonderful - great service and an outstanding G&T in the evening. Alice on reception and Megha Singh (front office manager) were both most charming and very, very helpful, as was the door man whose name I can;t recall. I will stay here again if at all possible!!",5,2015,05,19
128,Impeccable service in the City of London,"Nothing was too much trouble for staff at this hotel.  High spec Bedroom was decent sized (for city) and exceptionally quiet in the heart of the city.  I was here for a formal dinner and overnight stay.  Food was very good.   Some might say it was Quite pricey at c£250 for a std double room, but I'd say this was fair value for the std of service I received in such a central city of London location.  On the plus side wifi was fast and free. I'd definitely stay at a Montcalm again.",5,2015,05,18
128,"Excellent customer service, cannot fault anything!","Having booked the Montcalm at the brewery, our first night saw us transferred to ""m"" by Montcalm, it's sister hotel due to maintenance issues. This is an amazing high tech hotel, the staff are friendly and accommodating,and we were upgraded to a junior suite.
However, we did request to be transferred back to the Montcalm at the brewery as this was more our type of traditional hotel. Once transferred back the following day we received an amazing welcome, upgrade to a 'wow' suite with champagne on ice. The welcome from all staff was above and beyond any expectation. We would return without hesitation. Also, would highly recommend the m hotel for anyone loving high tech facilities. A big thank you to Simonar and Megha for making our stay so enjoyable. You made us feel very special. As an added bonus the food was also excellent.",5,2015,05,18
128,"A great, luxurious, relaxing weekend in a very friendly and comfortable hotel","Great location, well positioned for getting around London. Right next to the Barbican arts and culture centre (art show, theatre, cinema). Very good service team led by the very friendly and dynamic manager, Ms Mega Singh, who really takes an interest in all guests. We used the club room and would highly recommend it because it is like having your own sitting room to relax in after a hard days work, shopping or sight seeing. The rooms are very comfortable. This visit in May was not our first visit and we plan to return.",5,2015,05,18
128,Great location and great staff,"We stayed here for my wife's birthday. We had a fantastic time. The concierge Megha was particularly welcoming and made sure we had a great time. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Great location, comfortable room, interesting building and fabulous staff.",5,2015,05,18
128,Lovely hotel.  Convenient location for the City.,"Stayed one night for business.  Very attentive staff.  Nice service.  Rooms not huge, but large enough.  Proper coathangers!!!  Quiet and the curtains black out effectively, always helpful in London.  Would stay here again.",4,2015,05,18
128,Excellent friendly service,"We stayed in the Montcalm on Saturday 16th May, a truly excellent hotel in every respect. The arrival was very welcoming and indeed all the staff proved to be extremely warm, friendly and efficient throughout our all too short stay. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2015,05,18
128,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"When we arrived at 11.00 a.m to leave our cases so that we could go out in London for the remainder of the day, we were very impressed that our room was ready for us as 2.00 p.m was the check-in time. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay and we were made to feel very welcome. The room was very comfortable and had everything we could possibly have needed, including air conditioning. It was also nice to have a dressing table and mirror making doing hair and make up easier than in most hotels who seem to overlook this facility. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,05,18
128,"Lovely hotel, luxurious fantastic staff","I booked for me and my husband to stay at this hotel as a birthday treat. The staff were friendly and welcoming in reception.
I asked if they had any upgrades available as it was my husbands birthday and after a brief check they upgraded us to a Club room which was lovely. It was nice and spacious. The breakfast in the Jugged Hare was delightful and the quality of the food was divine. The bell boy took our bags to our room and gave us a brief history of the building as he walked us to our room. There were a lot of corridors lifts and stairs but that was all to do with the hotel being a listed building so they had to work with the structure. Quirky but luxurious. The staff were helpful and friendly. Absolutely would stay here again. My husband who loves luxury fell in love with the place!!",5,2015,05,18
128,Great hotel and very friendly staff!,We got a great deal on a room at the Montcalm for the weekend and were really impressed with the facilities on offer. The staff were as courteous as you would expect from a five star hotel. Our room was quite a bit smaller than we expected but still lovely.,4,2015,05,18
128,"Second time, just as good. Practical location for excellent price.","Great value, good location, nice modern rooms & friendly service.

Second stay in this hotel and I am pleased to say that it maintains its high quality.

Conventienlty located for both rube access as well London shopping.",4,2015,05,18
128,"Lovely Hotel, Very Small Room","Before everyone jumps on me for saying the room was small, I know that European standard rooms are smaller than US standard rooms, but for the price I was paying to stay at the Montcalm - my room was tiny. Luckily it was just me staying, as 2 people in this room would have been unbearable if we had to spend any time in the room together beside sleeping.  That being said, this is a lovely, old hotel with lots of character, and an excellent trained staff.  Be prepared for some twists and turns if you are staying in the wing opposite the lobby.  I don't think I returned to the lobby by the same route twice during my 4 day stay.  Location was great for me as I had business at the Helicon building a short 5 minute walk away.  I saw one of my colleagues room, a Club room, and it was much more spacious than mine although we paid the same rate and I booked before she did.  Expect to pay $$$ to stay here and get a club room if possible.

Also - I still have an outstanding discrepancy regarding the bill.  Their customer service only works Mon-Fri, so hopefully will be resolved this week with the efficiency they showed throughout my stay.",4,2015,05,17
128,Amazing stay,"I recently booked up for my partners birthday , from the moment we arrived to the checking out the stay was perfect , rooms were great , staff were fantastic and perfectly mannered . Location is excellent for all areas of Central London . Megha the front office manager was amazing in making my partners birthday one to remember . Will 100% be staying there again :)",5,2015,05,17
128,Great Hotel Great Staff 10/10,"First a big thanks to Simona who ensured we received a Club Duplex room.It was a two level room and had everything you could wish for.Great bed and great lighting and very very quiet part of hotel.Access to Club lounge for free drinks and snacks between 5.30 and 7.30 also made for a great start to the night.Staff in Club Lounge were great and always made sure you had a drink or anything you wanted.The Jugged Hare downstairs is a nice pub however be careful as one or two of the barmen tend to try and charge you more by pouring the more expensive spirits.Drank in there both nights before heading into London and each time (6 occasions) given a different price for the same round of drinks ??? Hotel is honestly one of the best we have stayed in and big part of this is down to the staff (especially Simona ,Karrina and Alice ).Family wise then Central London is better but for a couples weekend you won't find a better hotel in London.10 mins from Moorgate or Barbican Tube and 25 min walk from Liverpool Street .We will definitely return and hopefully to the same type of room.ps.Only had continental Bfast which was very good ....never tried the full breakfast.Go on and treat yourself to this hotel.You won't be disappointed.",5,2015,05,17
128,Absolutely Flawless....,"From the moment I was greeted at Reception, nothing was too much trouble in this oasis in the centre of the City. My original weekend getaway was scuppered by catching a heavy cold en route but upon check-in, the effervescent Megha even offered to send up a home made flu remedy! Every single member of staff was informative, highly professional and service orientated. As someone who has spent their life travelling for business, I would highly recommend this beautiful plush hotel to anyone wanting to have a 5 star experience - from the delicious, fine dining room service through one of the most comfortable beds I've had the pleasure to sleep in, to the cheerful merry band of staff that do everything to make you feel at home. I can't wait for my next visit! Simon John.",5,2015,05,17
128,Beyond expectations,A small boutique hotel in a big city. Staff are friendly and warm. Room conditions are good although room numberings are a bit confusing for first time visitors. Do try their omelettes at breakfast.  I enjoyed my stay there.,4,2015,05,16
128,An unexpected treasure,"Booked this hotel for a theatre trip. It was not in a part of City I knew well. It exceeded our expectations from the brilliant staff who greeted us at the door and conducted a tour of the hotel for us detailing the history of the former brewery on the site to the outstanding reception staff.
We were provided with a map of the hotel as the layout is interesting necessitated by being a listed building and a former brewery. 
The rooms are well appointed but the bed is to die for, what nights sleep and so comfortable. Look forward to returning",5,2015,05,16
128,Wonderful stay made even better by the superb staff,"A really impressive hotel that is enhanced by staff who genuinely care about their visitors. I loved my room...the bed was cosy and the bath was absolute heaven. The breakfast was perfect. 
I loved that the wifi was so easy to use. There also was a great selection of TV stations.
I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone! It is fantastic!!",5,2015,05,16
128,Overnight stay visiting family,"We booked the London City Suites and expected a comfortable but basic room
When we arrived we were told to check in at The Brewery opposite which was a lot more 'swish' than we expected and we felt distinctly underdressed!!

Very efficient, polite and friendly staff showed us to our beautiful room.  Building is very old but well converted,  I only wish we had had more time to make use of the facilities.  Would definitely visit again since very convenient for family in the Barbican.",5,2015,05,16
128,Wonderfull first stay at the Montcalm Brewery,"This was our first stay at the Montcalm Brewery, and we were not disappointed. We were also lucky to get a room upgrade. The staff could not be more helpful, nothing was a problem, all were very knowledgeable when we needed help to find out information. Breakfast was excellent with so much to pick from. Spoil yourself and book a stay",5,2015,05,16
128,Amazing,"From the moment we stepped though the door to the moment we left we received first class customer service. We received a room upgrade on arrival, and the rooms where perfect. 

Very short walk from the underground. 

We enjoyed the Gummy Bears from the mini bar ;-) 

We will definitely be staying again, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,05,15
128,Hidden Hotel - great value for a 5 star,"Very close to Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations. Very quiet location, superb kind attentive, helpful, professional staff. Very comfortable room and bathroom, the attached bar was fab and the restaurant food looked great, is was full of very happy people on my visit. Well done, would love to stay again and check out the spa.
I needed to use the concierge service to send a DHL parcel, they were spot on and sorted it all out while I relaxed....excellent and thank you.",5,2015,05,14
128,Class Comfort with Great Beer Below,"A great London day out starting with the Impressionists at the National Gallery, then a walk through Covent Garden and the nearby law courts and chambers, then along the river to Tower Birdge, fruit cocktails at Pont de la Tour, Sunday lunch at Brindisa London Bridge, and the latest version of Far from the Madding Crowd (a tear rolled down my cheek) at the Barbican cinema. A good bed was essential, and the Montcalm provided just that. I don't know what make the mattress was (I should have looked !), but it was as comfortable as I have slept in. The room was well stocked (yes, I did have the small bottle of red to wash the cashews down), and the beer at the pub below was just excellent, beautifully kept Adnams Southwold bitter. I awoke refreshed, ruing only my solitude.",4,2015,05,13
128,5* Service,A wonderful hotel with attentive staff and comfortable room. A 60% discount upon booking through a 3rd party made this stay even more enjoyable.  5 star treatment from five star staff especially Vlad & Megha.  Would not hesitate to stay here again in this smart boutique hotel with lots of character and history.,5,2015,05,13
128,Fabulous central London hotel,"I stayed here for one night on 7th May in a double club room. The room was lovely with all the touches you'd expect from this standard hotel including lovely free toiletries, complimentary water and fruit, the latest magazines etc.  The room was quiet, very comfortable, of ample size, finished to a high spec - we particularly enjoyed the heated floor in the bathroom and warm towels!  The club room entitles you to use the club lounge free of charge.  We enjoyed a couple of complimentary early evening drinks and sandwiches before heading out and if you'd prefer a quieter breakfast - the continental offering here is very enjoyable with morning TV and free papers.  Will certainly stay again.",5,2015,05,13
128,Overnight Stay,"Staff are 5 star. Nothing is too much trouble. One gets treated like royalty! Highly recommended everyone. They cater for 'food intolerances' too.
Close to Barbican tube stop and not far from any other sight-seeing. Very impressed with this hotel!",5,2015,05,12
128,The best hotel we have stayed in,"Last weekend my wife and I stayed at The Montcalm at The Brewery for our fifth wedding anniversary. All of the staff we encountered were extremely helpful and friendly. They provided a level of service which matches the glowing descriptions throughout the reviews on this website. As it was our anniversary they provided a free upgrade on our room and complimentary wine. The room was clean, modern and comfortable. Without doubt this is the best hotel we have stayed in, made such by the level of service they provide.",5,2015,05,12
128,Personal service,"My wife, son(2.5yrs) and I stayed and had a wonderful time. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The facilities offered by the hotel were excellent but what was most memorable was the service, which seems to be a consistent theme with the reviews. 

We were made to feel very welcome, the staff were genuinely interested and engaged, not like your typical idle chit chat at checkin, but genuine interest in what we had planned, what they could do to help etc. nothing was too much trouble. They made my son very welcome, took him on a quick tour of the hotel, made a fuss of him whenever we were in reception, arranged a dinner reservation and ensured he was catered for. Simona, in particular, was very kind and really looked after us.  

I can only liken it to going to a very small, independently owned and well run guest house where you, the customer matter, but all within a large London hotel with all the facilities you expect of 5* hotel.

We'll be back.",5,2015,05,12
128,"service, service, service.","Its difficult to find these days, but its here and lots of it, the customer is warmly welcomed
and given a big dose of service, makes a big difference when your used to staff who are air heads, badly trained, and are as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
someone in management is doing a first class job here.
excellent breakfast, good coffee, nice rooms, will come again, perfect for our venue at the brewery. stayed one night only but was the right choice.
very happy.",4,2015,05,11
128,"Great location, even better service","I stayed here on business recently.  The location is excelent but I have to say that the staff are waht mad it such a good saty.   Mandeep and Snjeev went out of their way to make a complex booking easy and to ensure that the stay stood out from the norm.  I stay about 100 nights a year in london, and this was the best I can remember.",5,2015,05,11
128,A very special evening,"I could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Montcalm. 
Checking in, i was made to feel like a special guest and was greeted happy anniversary and was offered a room upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine. 
We were shown to our room with some history knowledge of the hotel, it did seem like a bit of a maze to get there, 2 lifts but it didn't seem a problem for us. 

The room was beautiful, a high and large soft bed with perfectly placed tv for us to watch a movie.
the light underneath the bedside table was a bit pointless as sometimes i wanted the room to be more well lit. 
we decided to stay in the room and have room service - romantic yes.. 
and the steak i had may be the best steak I've had, my partner was very jealous and kept stealing the béarnaise sauce. I was desperately wanting chocolate and although there was none on the menu, i rang up and asked for anything chocolate and they bought up a selection of chocolate puddings with milk. I felt like they'd gone the extra mile for me. 
The room service staff were lovely and full of conversation, i feel very uncomfortable having staff in our bedroom but they were great and got on well with a lady who seemed to be loving her job!

Bathroom was nice and spacious, but had a long blind reaching to cover the shower and bath wall. I would have rathered the blind to not be there or frosted glass.

In the morning we went down to the jugged hare for breakfast. 
I didn't like the buffet service for hot breakfast - this should be a waitered service as it is more personal and attention to detail. I feel uncomfortable walking around with a plate and for the price we'd paid i expected a bit more of a personal service. When ordering coffee i expected a pot of coffee but instead got one tea cup of coffee - this wasn't enough and again felt as if they were giving me the bare minimum. 
Sometimes felt uncomfortable as the staff linger around the table to take away plates, as they tried twice when we hadn't finished. 

The location of the hotel is a bit of a problem as on the weekend the city is dead. 
We went for a morning walk to get the paper and box of chocolates ( yes more chocolates ) and felt like we were walking in a post apocolyptic city. We managed to get to liverpool street shopping centre and decided to retreat back to the hotel and read the paper on the nice sofas. 
They didn't know or didn't have squash for us to drink. It was a hot day and we fancied something refreshing.

On departure, we were asked on how our stay was, and my partner said it was ok. He'd seen the WOW room and has expensive taste and said he wanted to stay in there. The manager was very kind and even though did note his comments she decided to action on them to go that extra mile. We got an email to tell us to let them know next time we'd like to stay and that will be the room we will have. I was very surprised with the excellent customer service and of satisfaction. 

I'd say in terms of value for money - it is a little steep but i wouldn't go as far to complain. 
It is a little gem in the city, a secret venue where if you can afford to stay there, you will be treated like royalty.",5,2015,05,11
128,An oasis of calm in the City.,"I was attending a function at The Brewery on Thursday the 7th May and this hotel was extremely convenient if a little expensive. On arrival the level of expense proved excellent value as service is superb form the moment the liveried door man lets you in with a polite greeting. An upgrade to a magnificent club room didn't hurt and it proved exceedingly comfortable.
Despite being in the City there was very little noise and I slept very well and undisturbed despite having the windows on the 4th Floor open.
Overall a very very pleasant stay in a fabulous hotel.",5,2015,05,11
128,Great stay,"Only stayed one night, but it was lovely. Staff are so helpful and friendly, hotel room was clean and nicely designed. Breakfast was excellent. Stayed in a club room so had access to the club lounge where complimentary canapés and drinks are served. Overall very good and would stay again. ",5,2015,05,10
128,Fabulous hotel in a Good location,"When planning to visit London to celebrate my wife's Birthday with a night out at the Radio 2 VE Day concert, we came across the Brewery at Montcalm.
It was booked through Booking.com and contact was made with the Team at hotel, from there on every single thing was Excellent, an Email from the team offering an Upgrade an unexpected bonus and What a room (fantastic) and superbly appointed.
We arrived early on the Saturday and check in a pleasant experience, room 32 a Club room with All its benefits, quickly settled and a short stroll around the local area provided a Great Pub lunch.
The evening, after great advice from concierge We walked through past St Paul's, over the river along South Bank, back over river and into Horseguards for an excellent experience at VE Day concert, the return along South Bank a few Beers before a great nights sleep.
Breakfast is easy, great service & good food. Checkout also an extremely comfortable experience.
All in All, a Great choice and would thoroughly recommend, Thanks to All the hotel Team.",5,2015,05,10
128,Superb service,"The level of service and attention to detail at this hotel was superb. From the moment we checked in we were very well looked after by the very attentive staff. We even got a lovely bottle of red left in our room because we were celebrating a birthday.

Room was great, all that we needed.

Location was spot on, no more than ten minutes walk from Barbican tube.",5,2015,05,10
128,The Montcalm was a very pleasant surprise.,"I stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery as I was attending an event at the Brewery itself.  However, I was impressed by the service, the room and above all the price - I have stayed in budget hotels in London that cost more!
I will certainly return.",5,2015,05,10
128,The best hotel to choose in the City !!!!,"Amazing service, great location and wonderful staff. The rooms were well equiped and spacious for a City hotel. The Club Room breakfast and evening snacks/drinks is perfect as an es I had a unique request and they went above and beyond to help me. Cant praise them enough !",5,2015,05,10
128,Excellent highly recomm,"I booked this hotel as we wanted somewhere close to central London. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman on reception who was extremely helpful and provided us with all the information we needed. We were then upgraded to a club room to make my boyfriends birthday that extra special!! This was such a lovely gesture having stayed in London on so many occasions this is certainly the first time I have been upgraded free of charge just out of the goodness of the hotel.

We were then offered a late check out also free of charge!!

This hotel has outstanding customer service and I wouldn't hesitate to book here again.

Thank you also Megha Singh who personally emailed to check if my stay was satisfactory.

We look forward to staying here again :)",5,2015,05,10
128,Went away with my better half,"Everyone was welcoming and friendly, It was a stunningly neat and clean hotel. They showed us to out room and made sure we knew where things were and how things work. I enjoyed my stay away in london, and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.",5,2015,05,10
128,Exceptional with Personal Touch,"The staff went out of their way to make the stay comfortable. When I could not find the entrance of the hotel easily, someone from the hotel came running and personally led me to the reception. Also, upon entering the assigned room, I requested another room with a shower (instead of a bathtub), Rumen who was kindly accompanying me with my luggage offered me to wait in a lounge and returned quickly to take me to a new room. The hotel was very well designed, and the room facilities were simply excellent.",5,2015,05,10
128,Lovely escape away,"A fab hotel, sophisticated and has a really luxurious feel. From booking in until we left we were very well looked after. The staff couldn't do enough for us (especially Simona.)
The rooms are top quality and we had a wonderful break. We would highly recommend.",5,2015,05,09
128,Very close to Barbican,Slick reception with polite staff. We were in a club room which was very comfortable. We didn't have any food at the hotel so can't comment on that. We have already recommended this hotel to friends and family.,5,2015,05,09
128,Fantastic Boutique Hotel,"I travel a lot internationally for work.  One hotel really doesn't usually stand out over another.  This hotel was in a great location, had really outstanding service and great rooms.  I stayed in the suites across the street from the front desk.  I really loved the privacy in these large rooms.  The breakfast at the pub was really good.  I mean REALLY good and I usually don't go for hotel food.  The front desk staff and doorman were just delightful as well.   We also held our event in the hotel, the service and amenities were top notch!  15 people on the wifi and not one glitch over the 3 day event.  If I ever have to go to london for business again, I will definitely stay here!",5,2015,05,07
128,Great stay... brilliant service,"The hotel was fantastic. It is in a great location and the staff were excellent. I had a very comfortable stay and nothing was too much trouble. The place was very clean and tidy, I will definitely go back again as the",5,2015,05,07
128,Excellent hotel in the city,"We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery in London city for three days in April. The location is perfect, in the heart of the city, but close enough for a walk to the hipster Brick Lane Road and to Shoreditch. The hotel is perfectly installed in an old charming brewery. The facilities are very nicely decorated. The rooms are just perfect and the beds are within the best we have ever slept in! Very comfortable! The staff was always very friendly as well. Breakfast (continental or English) was always very good. Sometimes we had to wait a bit for the coffee and had to insist to have it, but nothing that the good quality of the food would not compensate. The toiletries from Hermes available in the room were also an excellent touch. All in all, a great option for business or leisure. It is not the cheapest option, but hotels in London are pricey and, at the Montcalm, comfort is assured! Highly recommended without any doubt!",5,2015,05,07
128,superb - my new favourite London hotel!,"This is super hotel with excellent staff and service.  Our room was a great size, well laid out with a great bathroom.  We stayed for two nights to celebrate my husband's birthday and the staff really made the occasion special.  The hotel is situated in a really interesting part of the city with lots to explore on foot.  Looking forward to returning!",5,2015,05,07
128,Great service and location,"I got a teeny tiny room in the attic, where the ceiling was very low in most of the room. Regardless, I was in town on business and needed a resipite over the weekend. The facilities and service were lovely and the location was very quiet (not as much during the weekdays). I enjoyed being near the Barbican and the City Museum. I would definitely stay here the next time I'm in London.",4,2015,05,06
128,Does just what it says on the can...,"Recently I have had the good fortune to stay at a number of hotels around London, yet calm and tranquillity-of-sleep have all too often eluded me. Not so, at the aptly named, Montcalm. For the first time in an age, I was able to sleep right the way through to my in-holiday-mode body-clock awakening (let’s just say somewhat indecently passed 10:00...). 

I may have just been fortunate on the 3 mornings I was resident, but there were no annoying sounds of doors repeatedly being opened and closed, no service staff noisily setting up the day’s endeavours and no hint of the rumbling traffic beyond.

This alone, at least in my book, would be reason enough to return to this fine hotel. 

Yet there’s more: the bedroom was admirably luxurious (with enough condiments to keep even Jeeves busy – from clothes brushes, shoe cleaners, slippers, an umbrella, a very useable hair dryer, etc., to a well-stocked body-care products supply in the bathroom...). The bed itself, subjective as I admit it is, was the most comfortable I’ve had the pleasure to sleep on in any hotel – the linen and pillows up to the elevated standard of the mattress itself.

The shower was particularly refreshing with a delightful combination of normal-head and raindrop function from vertically above – and enough water-force to enjoy the two.
The staff were attentive and courteous. The main entrance area clean and welcoming and well befitting of an establishment with such an illustrious past...

My only cavil would be that in a room for two, only one bottle of water and an odd number of fruit awaited our arrival – furthermore, in the subsequent days of our stay, neither were replenished – making it feel as though this gesture-of-welcome had been selectively removed.... Generosity once denounced does not return one to a neutral position but to one of personal slight....

128,Stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery,"Our  stay at The Montcalm was excellent.   We were there for a wedding on Sunday 3rd May and stayed overnight at the hotel.   Our room was wonderful and the hotel in general was of an excellent standard.   All the staff were very friendly and helpful - especially the reception and conciege staff, also the doorman was very helpful too.   The room where the wedding was held was beautiful, a lovely mixture of the old building and new decoration.  Also the reception hall was beautiful.   Food at the wedding and table service by the waiters and waitresses was first class.   We will definitely visit the hotel again.",5,2015,05,05
128,"Best experience in a hotel. Great freebies from the bathroom, Hermes Lotions and Potions!","Fantastic all round, quite, central, very clean, modern, classy, great size room, all the amenities you could need. Coffee tea provided as standard in the room and the best service possible. Would go back in a heartbeat.",5,2015,05,05
128,Wonderful hotel,"Me and my partner had booked this hotel for our one year anniversary. Megan we arrived, the receptionist immediately upgraded us to a much better room at no extra cost once they realised the occasion. They also gave us a free bottle of wine along was free access to their cloud lounge where they served delicious finger foods and refreshments. 

Everything from the room itself to the service provided was spot on. All the staff was lovely and helpful. Breakfast was fine, although it wasn't the best I've had but that never bothered us too much. 

Overall, I had a pleasant stay and experience with the Montcalm hotel, and will definitely be recommending this to all of our friends and Family. We also look forward to our next stay!",5,2015,05,05
128,A wonderful stay,My experience at the Montcalm was just brilliant. The staff were more than helpful and very welcoming. The room was lovely and they went the extra mile to make our stay just perfect. Very inexpensive room for what it was. Will definitely go back.,5,2015,05,05
128,"Excellent location, modern interiors","The Montcalm was truly a ""calm"" experience.  I stayed here for a business trip.  At first, the maze to get to the room was a bit overwhelming.  But once I saw the interior and the amenities offered for the price, it was rather satisfying.  The hotel is in the financial district of London, very close to many business destinations.  It's not exactly tourist central but this wasn't an issue for me.  The staff was absolutely pleasant and helpful.  For breakfast, I tried the Jugged Hare on the basement and it was delicious and I recommend it.  I didn't get to try lunch or dinner there but it's quite crowded and I would imagine it won't disappoint.  I will definitely be staying here again in the future.",5,2015,05,04
128,Another fabulous visit!!!,"This hotel never disappoints.  The room, location, facilities and staff are all top notch.  Alice  (the manager) went above and beyond to make sure my visit was perfect, she could not have been nicer.  I highly recommend this hotel, believe me you will NOT be disappointed.",5,2015,05,04
128,Simply Exquisite,"Beautiful hotel perfectly situated and within walking distance of some of the city's best museums and attractions. Warm friendly staff make you feel very welcome, and did I mention the shower! Oh my god the shower....made me not want to leave!! Definitely one of the most exquisite hotels I've stayed in, and perfect for couples looking for a city break",5,2015,05,04
128,My stay at Montcalm,I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights on a business trip. My overall expereince of the hotel was extremely positive. From the staff to the location the hotel checks all boxes. The hotel has nice charm about it and its a good mix of contemporary and classic styles. The rooms could be a bit small since the building was not ment to be a hotel. Overall thumbs up and reccomended from me.,5,2015,05,04
128,Great overnight stay,Booked as a last minute deal.  Very helpful staff and the room was a good size double.  Hadn't realised that with club room you get use of club lounge and refreshments.  Drink and sandwiches provided from 5.30.  Breakfast was substantial and covered all tastes.  One to go back to.,5,2015,05,04
128,excellent stay,"The staff were excellent at The Montcalm, we were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a Club room and also a complimentary bottle of wine. It was a surprise trip for my boyfriends birthday! He couldn't thank me enough for my choice in hotel!! Everything about the hotel was fab, the pillows were the best I have slept on!! We didn't have breakfast as we thought a little pricey at £50 for the two of us.",5,2015,05,04
128,Exceptional standards ,"We stayed here with friends, for one night, whilst in London celebrating a birthday. A great location, very close to Barbican tube station. All aspects of the hotel were of an extremely high standard. A little bit of luxury, at a very reasonable price.
The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Modern decor, and excellent facilities. 
The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and courteous, and couldn't do enough for us. 
I will definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again. It's a lovely hotel!!  ",5,2015,05,03
128,Wonderful,"The Montcalm was a lovely hotel to stay at.
The breakfast served was excellent and the staff were all very courteous. 
I will definitely be reserving a room here again when I come back to London in the future.",5,2015,05,03
128,Luxury in London,"I can't say enough about the quality of service I got at the Montcalm.  The staff are polite, of course, but better yet, they're proactively helpful, and will go above and beyond the call of duty to make your stay better - inside the hotel and out.

I think my room was technically part of an expandable suite with the adjoining room (there was a door connecting my room and the adjacent one), and I could occasionally hear the guest nextdoor talking on his phone, but it was never loud enough or late enough to be bothersome.  The room itself was very comfortable, with a large bed, modest closet, a desk with numerous power formats (although the 110V outlet didn't seem to be active) to suite multi-national needs, a much-needed, much-used, and much-loved coffee machine (with generous supply of complimentary coffee pods), and spacious bathroom with a great shower.

The room was very well tended, and as a result of my joining the Montcalm Club (you can enroll online or at the hotel's front desk), room service provided the occasional bottle of water and plate of fruit, which was a nice little add-on.

The hotel's fitness center is basic, but suitable.  I don't imagine it's used very much, but I was glad to have it.  It included a stationary bike, elliptical trainer, a treadmill, a floor exercise mat, and a collection of free weights, a TV on the wall, and very good Wi-Fi coverage.  I regret not getting a chance to use the sauna & steam room nextdoor, but on my next stay there, I'll make a point to do so.

All in all, a very nice place to feel welcome in London City.",4,2015,05,02
128,Excellent stay,I was very impressed with the hotel. The staff were friendly and they guided me to my room. I also thoroughly enjoyed my room service which arrived quicker than expected. The room was also very nice and I had a lovely relaxing evening.,5,2015,05,02
128,Enjoy staying @Montcalm at the Brewery,"The hotel looks great. Rooms are clean and staff is helpful, with smiles on their face and always willing to help you get a taxi, recommend a good restaurant or giving directions. The girls serving breakfast are great, nice and pleasant.",5,2015,05,01
128,The FANTASTIC Montcalm,"The best hotel I have stayed at EVER !  Fantastic location, room terrific, staff courteous and attentive ..... quality.  On arrival was greeted by the concierge, was offered a refreshing face towel passed to me with tongs from a silver platter ! Had my luggage taken to my room.... perfect.   Quality brands of tea, coffee, biscuits, shampoo, shower gel as well as fresh fruit.   On return from my function, there were chocolates on my pillow along with a note wishing me a good nights sleep and a weather report for the next day !
Attention to detail amazing, great value. 100% recommended.",5,2015,05,01
128,"Great hotel, excellent rooms...",Arrived at hotel where staff were attentive and courteous.  Then shown to my room and advised of all the facilities. Room was better than expected a true 5star start to my stay... Breakfast was included in the rate and was great.,5,2015,04,30
128,Another great stay,"This was my second stay at the Montcalm.  My first was a few years back and what a difference.  The hotel has expanded and still has managed to keep its 'W'  feel I mentioned in previous posts.  With that in mind the hotel gives you access to food at neighboring restaurants one of which is a gastropub on the corner outside the hotel.  This place is very 'gastro'  with very gamey meals available.  We just made it for dinner.  I wasn't the hugest fan at the time probably because my flight had been delayed on both sides and I got stuck in a 2 hour line at Heathrow customs. Normally I am all about adventure with food so certainly will he back! 

The hotel staff are still amazing and friendly.  Cant say a bad word on that front.  Overly eager to help in any way they can and a nice hello after a long day at the office. 

Overall,  I will definitly be staying here again and am looking forward to it! ",4,2015,04,29
128,"beautiful hotel, lovely experience","I booked this hotel for a surprise night away for my other halves birthday, from even before I booked I could tell the hotel and it's staff were a world away from any other hotel I've had experience with. Any questions I had via phone or email were answered in a helpful fashion and really put my mind at ease that I'd made the right choice! 

As soon as we entered the hotel we were treated like their only guests and the whole building really is beautiful. 

We were escorted to our room whilst being told all about the hotel and it's origin and were over the moon to discover that we'd been upgraded to the most beautiful 2-storey suite, it was stunning! We were also provided with a lovely little birthday note, birthday cake and a bottle of prosecco which was a lovely touch. Room was clean and just generally lovely. Only fault we had was that the blind between the glass walled bathroom and the living area was broken so wouldn't rise, which obviously did not affect stay but has the novelty factor which some may enjoy. My partner did contact the concierge about this (men!) who did come and try to fix it but were unable. I did receive a follow up email after our stay apologising again for this but it really was just one of them things and we couldn't complain at all.

Bare in mind if you've had a drink, the key entry to the doors is more of a scanner as opposed to a ""insert key card here"" type thing....unfortunately after one too many I did have issues with this and was unable to get back into the room for quite some time - oops!

All in all an amazing hotel and I can't to return, it really is special.",5,2015,04,29
128,We'll definitely be back!,"I stayed here for 2 nights recently with my partner. From the moment you enter the hotel you feel the welcoming atmosphere. The doorman, concierge and receptionist did their utmost to make us feel welcome and helped with any query we had. 
The receptionist obliged us with an early check-in which was much appreciated. 
The rooms were decorated to a very high standard and were extremely comfortable.
The location is great with a tube station only a few minutes walk around the corner. 
My only disappointment was that we didn't use the bar or restaurant facilities as we had made prior arrangements with friends in the city. 
We will definitely rectify that when we visit again!",5,2015,04,29
128,One night at the Montcal,"We stayed at the Montcalm by accident as we were booked at the sister hotel in Bayswater. This was double booked for some reason so we ended up at the Montcalm. I have to say it was a beautiful hotel with excellent customer service. The Jugged Hare where we had breakfast was very good too, just along the street. I would definitely go there again!",5,2015,04,28
128,Lovely stay,I stayed here with my best friend for her 21st birthday and was very happy with the service we received! During our check in the staff knew it was her birthday so upgraded us to a better room which was lovely. It was also Easter weekend and received Easter eggs in our room which was a special touch! Staff were great and the hotel is beautiful. Will return!,5,2015,04,28
128,Lovely Hotel,"This is truly lovely hotel, from the moment you enter the building you are made to feel very welcome.

128,A great stop to relax before a meeting,My regret is that I only got to spend an evening here. It was a wonderful stay in a very friendly hotel with a wonderful atmosphere. Great central location as well. The room as well was wonderful with an amazing bed and a shower that made the whole stress caused by a day spent in going from trains to planes and back just melt away. Definitely will be coming back.,5,2015,04,27
128,Great service!,"I can really reccomend this hotel. Everything was Perfect! Our room was even ready severall hours before check-in. It's in a quiet part which i like.
 There's lot's of nice places whithin walking distance plus the tube is nearby. Staff was very helpfull.",5,2015,04,27
128,Amazing hotel!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night to celebrate his birthday. I'm so glad I picked this hotel as we couldn't have asked for more. The staff were so welcoming and friendly and the hotel is very modern and clean. We had a standard room which included everything we needed such as hairdryer, tea and coffee facilities etc with the added bonus of Elemis products! The hotel is very easy to get to from the station. As I mentioned before the staff are so helpful and as we were celebrating my boyfriends birthday we were given complimentary breakfast! I really cannot recommend this hotel enough. We will definitely be staying here again when we next visit London.",5,2015,04,27
128,A very special hotel,"We have stayed in many hotels, in many countries, but the Montcalm at the Brewery delivered the best experience of any of them. From stepping towards the hotel entrance to leaving the next morning, we have never experienced such courteous, pleasant and helpful staff. Our room wasn't ready and we were immediately offered an upgrade, without any prompting whatsoever, to a suite. The accommodation was absolutely immaculate - I honestly cannot list a single fault. Breakfast next morning was excellent, again, with courteous and helpful staff. The only down side is that we didn't book for 2 nights!

A special mention to the Front Office Supervisor, Anna Sabau. You truly are a credit to Montcalm!!",5,2015,04,27
128,Excellent Customer Service,"I stayed at this hotel entirely because of an industry event taking place there so it was convenient.  Initially, I was not expecting much since I was on a business trip and would not be at the hotel for long during the day.  When I arrived, my luggage was taken before I was even in the hotel and this was very much appreciated as I then had my hands free to deal with the check in details.  Check in was straightforward and within minutes, Claudiu S. (the concierge) took my luggage and showed the way to my room.  Unlike many trips with the concierge to your room (usual awkward silence), Claudiu was very friendly and explained the history of the hotel to me.  It was great to see someone so proud of their job.  The room was very spacious and it had complementary fruit and water - something I do not see in many hotels these days.  The Internet was very fast and free - I could work from the hotel room with no issues.  In the evening, after a day of meetings, I came back to my room to find chocolates and a note which read: ""Good Night"" and the weather forecast for the next day.  The TV had been switched to the music channel and had classical music playing - it was a very relaxing experience.  During my stay, I unfortunately lost a pen I was emotionally attached to so I advised the concierge of this.  It was a great surprise to come home and a few days latter, my pen was found and posted to me straight away at no cost to me.  Needless to say, my stay was excellent and I would recommend friends and work colleagues going to London, to stay at this hotel.",5,2015,04,27
128,Top hotel in excellent location for Central London,"Reception superb. Rooms large, clean and very well appointed. All staff very pleasant and helpful. Easy access to Tube and plenty available on foot.
For hotel to access central London I would recommend without hesitation.",5,2015,04,27
128,A wonderful anniversary visit,"We stayed here on Saturday night and had a perfect stay.  We arrived early thinking just to drop off our cases but our suite was ready. When the staff knew it was our wedding anniversary we were made a big fuss of and a bottle of wine sent to our room ""which do you prefer, red or white?"". 

All the staff were marvellous, so welcoming and nothing too much trouble, great pride taken in their work and Megha so efficient and friendly.

The suite was really comfortable and elegant, every creature comfort taken care of (including my very favourite Hermes shower gel/soap etc). Fresh fruit, nespresso coffee machine, glossy magazines. Lovely.

Housekeeping decorated our bed with love birds and rose petals, so pretty.

Breakfast in the hotel bistro, The Jugged Hair was delicious, everything possible was on the buffet or a la carte available too......you waddle away from this meal.....a greed fest, YUM!

Hotel location is very convenient for the Barbican and an easy ten minutes walk to the tube.

We would definitely return here.......soon please!",5,2015,04,27
128,"Comfort,luxury and a very warm welcome.","On arrival we were immediately upgraded for no reason into a suite with a kitchenette. When I mentioned to the lovely receptionist that we were here to celebrate my husbands birthday, she sent a bottle of red wine to our room with compliments. The bed was comfortable and the room airconditioned and very quite. The room isn't  large but has been well designed to enable a place for all you need. We had a delicious breakfast in the Jugged Hair opposite which offered the same luxury and care. We will be back. A very friendly and pleasant stay.",5,2015,04,27
128,Perfect Wedding night ,"From booking to check out, the team at Montcalm were incredible! The guest relations team communicated with me prior to my arrival, and nothing was too much trouble. I was staying the night before my wedding day and our wedding night, the team greeted me on arrival, I was roomed by a very helpful concierge, and was delighted to find I'd been upgraded to a suite.
The room was well equipped, tasteful, modern and luxurious; complete with four poster bed, Hermès bath amenities, excellent media system, nespresso machine, and a fantastic bathroom with rainfall shower and large tub.
Breakfast on both mornings was excellent, particularly the crêpe with cheese & bacon, and a good selection of Jing tea. 
We were very touched by the attention to detail; on arriving back to our room on our wedding night there was a bottle of champagne and rose petal turndown to greet us. 
The staff were genuine, helpful, friendly and I could not fault the service at all. One minor plumbing fault was responded to quickly and efficiently by the maintenance team and housekeeping.
We couldn't have been more pleased. 
Thank you to the Montcalm team for making our wedding day even more perfect!",5,2015,04,26
128,Fabulous staff in a beautiful setting for a hotel.,Fabulous weekend and the hotel and it's friendly and helpful staff definitely added to that. The Old Brewery setting is lovely.  A piece of history as a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was the only slight disappointment but that was partly our fault as we were in a rush. But the club package was brilliant and the rooms perfect. Definitely plan to revisit.,5,2015,04,26
128,Short holiday ,"I would say this hotel is one of the best hotels I stayed in. The service and staff were so nice and very helpful. They made sure everything is perfect for their guests. I lost my ring in the room and they managed to sweep the entire place to find it for me -:)
The rooms are very clean and very comfortable and includes all the requirements you need. And for morning coffee lovers all rooms have a Nespresso machine which made our stay even better. 
We have booked for dinner at the hotel restaurant the Jugged Hare and it was very delicious and will definitely recommend it for anyone staying at the hotel.
Our stay was very enjoyable and will definitely go back .
",5,2015,04,26
128,Love this hotel!,"Fantastic hotel, cannot fault our stay! We stayed for my 30th birthday and the hotel gave us a free upgrade. Rose petals sprinkled on the bed were a nice touch, had a great nights sleep after a busy day sight seeing, the continental breakfast in the club lounge was yummy! All staff were polite and attentive. Will definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,04,26
128,Wonderful weekend,Came to the Montcalm for a weekend away in April! Room was spacious with lots of lovely little touches such as complimentary fruit and a very comfortable bed! All staff were extremely friendly and helpful! Close to two underground stations so easy access to all of Central London. Would definitely recommend.,5,2015,04,26
128,Amazing visit,"Just come back from an amazing visit to the montcalm. We stopped for our anniversary, and were upgraded to a wow suite which was beautiful.  Staff went to extra trouble to arrange a surprise, which was lovely.

Rooms are amazing and we'll equipped and customer service is amongst the best I've ever experienced from a large hotel.

I will definitely be returning, thanks again",5,2015,04,26
128,Excellent day in london,"Really good Hotel, 5 star plus!
Excellent food and a really good breakfast. Staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble.
Great location and very comfortable club room.
Will definitely stay again.",5,2015,04,25
128,"Excellent stay, great service and amazing breakfast","There were a group of 6 of us who stayed in January at this hotel. We loved the whole experience. We paid extra for an upgrade and had access to the club lounge where they have a variety of spirits, wines and a few canapés. We thought this was a great idea however I should say that the atmosphere in the lounge was a bit lacking, it was very quiet with no background music. Overall amazing stay and the staff really were wonderful. They helped us surprise my sister on her 30th birthday and helped us organise a cake etc. Great stay and would definitely recommend. Thank you",5,2015,04,24
128,Great hotel in the City!,"Loved it! Took a little getting used to orientation but room was lovely, staff very attentive and supper in the Chiswell Street dinning room was fantastic. Will be my choice of City hotel from now on!",5,2015,04,23
128,Highlight of my London Visit,"The staff at this hotel really make your visit special. I travel for work rather a lot, and after a while a room is a room. This was my last stop in a business trip to the UK, and true to the other reviews it was a fabulous choice. 

The rooms themselves are extremely well equipped, the bed is comfortable, the air conditioning is easy to find and operate (not as easy as you'd think!), the hair dryer works, and the toiletries are so lovely I want to see if I can find them when I get home! I found the rooms extremely quiet and dark so sleeping was easy. 

The gym - such that it is - was small and difficult to find (hint - the entrance is under the stairs!) but there is still a treadmill and bike. However information is provided on jogging routes so I would prefer to do those. 

Only two other minor comments - I had to play the game of what switch turns off which light, which is fine, until you are tired and want to go to sleep but can't work out which switch does what! I'm not sure how this could be addressed and perhaps this is just something which confuses me........ the other thing which some people may be interested in, was that in the room that I had the shower was over the bath and it is quite a step into and out of the bath.

Having said all that about the room........the staff really did make my stay. From the first moment I arrived, they were friendly, helpful and extremely welcoming. Vlad, the Head Concierge, was so helpful when I came up with the idea to post my winter clothes to Australia (what turned out to be not the simplest of ideas), because I was travelling home via Malaysia and didn't  want to take boots/heavy coat etc. with me. He arranged it all, notified me via email when the courier collected it, and have provide a copy of the waybill. I am very grateful for his assistance. It really has made my travel home easier without having to carry all those items with me. 

All the staff I had interaction with were lovely - the hotel can be rather tricky to navigate, long corridors, two lifts etc and every time I was found wandering around someone happily pointed me in the right direction. The hotel is quaint and charming. 

Further, the friendliness of the staff makes this hotel feel safe and secure, which as a single female traveller, is one less thing to worry about. 

In terms of the location, it is a short walk to a tube stop and St Pauls. It is a business area (a lot of large law firms are nearby) so week days/nights it is busy, but quiet on weekends. This does mean that there are limited food/bar/shops open on the weekends, but as this is London it is only a short stroll to any amenities that you are seeking. 

This hotel has everything that you could ask for.",5,2015,04,23
128,First Class,"Spent the Easter weekend at the Montcalm at the Brewery. Staff, service, location all excellent. All the staff we met were professional yet friendly, nothing to much trouble. The members lounge was really welcome at the end of a long day in London. Very convenient for reaching most areas of the city. We would have liked a slightly larger room with more storage space, but I believe those are available if are prepared to pay a little more. Best thing I can say, we will definitely return.",5,2015,04,23
128,"Unbelievable stay, haven't stopped talking about it yet!","Honestly this hotel is the best I've ever stayed in in London by far and I've stayed in a lot. The customer service is truly outstanding. My wife and I stayed here for her 30th birthday and the team couldn't have done more to make it an extra special experience, being extremely generous to us! 

The rooms are beautiful, clean, spacious and modern with very comfortable beds. A convenient location for the underground and local places like spitalfields market make it a good place to stay and it's a more quiet area on weekends being in the finance centre which was just what we wanted.

Thank you Montcalm team for making us so welcome and giving us a very memorable stay! Can't wait to visit again soon! 

",5,2015,04,23
128,Extremely hospitable,"Came here for a birthday weekend with my boyfriend and we were immediately welcomed by extremely friendly staff who took our bags straight away whilst we waited to be served at reception, and preceded to be handed fresh hot towels for our hands and face. At reception we were asked whether we had dinner plans, if not they offered to recommend places and also book, as it was we'd already made plans. We were shown to our room by the concierge who carried our bags for us, informed us that we had no neighbours, let us into the room, showed us around before asking if needed anything before prompting leaving us to settle in.
The room was gorgeous!
We got a phone call approximately 10 minutes later from reception asking how everything was.
Although we weren't in the room for long we had no disturbances from staff or other guests and felt like we were treated personally and hospitably and if necessary any needs would have been met!
Would definitely stay here again, loved it.",5,2015,04,21
128,Absolutely fantastic,"The best hotel experience I've ever had, the hotel itself is amazing, I could not fault one thing but the main strength of this hotel are the people. They were brilliant from start to finish. I thanks all the wonderful staff who made this short but very enjoyable trip one to remember, if only everyday was a Montcalm day. If you are thinking of staying in London then this really is the place to stay. Again me and my partner thank all at this amazing hotel. Simply stunning",5,2015,04,20
128,Stunning Hotel,"I stayed here for one night in December 2013.

The staff are so helpful, the hotel grounds are beautiful, the rooms are stunning.

I would highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay in London for one night or more!

Just be aware that the rooms are pretty small if there are a few of you... 

Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2015,04,19
128,Ideal during the weekend,"The hotel is a real gem surrounded by offices and skyscrapers, so it's very quite during the weekend. The hall is marvellous and the atmosphere is very ""masculine"": brown leather sofas, wooden walls, etc. Our room was at the 4th floor and it was tiny but well-equipped and quite. At the reception staff was very friendly and able to satisfy any request. You can also dine at the nearby pub, the menu is delicious. It's the ideal place for a weekend escape or perfect for a business trip, as it's located in the City.",5,2015,04,17
128,Always a pleasure to return,"Stayed at the Montcalm Brewery last week and it was just as good as all the other times I have stayed. I have found the service at the hotel to be always top notch and you get a 5 star treatment. The rooms are well appointed and all quite interesting. On this visit I had a smaller room but it still had all of the essentials ;like a very comfortable bed, powerful shower etc. The quality of the rooms are good and in the ones I have stayed in are not worn or looking tired. The rooms also come with an iron and board and a fruit bowl with some fruit of course.
I have stayed in some of the suites and these are also good with split levels on some with the bedroom above the lounge.
For me its the place in London where I would choose to stay subject to my budget. Keep looking on the usual web site for the deals that might be out there at the time.",5,2015,04,17
128,Beautiful holiday in great setting,"This hotel is a real treat as it's so close to the city and Old street but has a strong character all of it's own. The design and format has it's quirks with lots of bare brick and steps in small hall ways, it's hard to navigate.
The service is fantastic and the staff really care about exceptional service.
The only disappointment was a very small and very very hot gym that was poorly equipped and too hot to use, in this hotel I expected much better. Otherwise it was a lovely stay.",4,2015,04,16
128,Five Star Service,"Booked a room for a surprise for my wife for her birthday. Upon arrival were we treated to the best levels of customer service. My wife was offered a complementary bottle of wine and when given the pass card for the room, I was informed we were upgraded to the Wow Suite. I have never been upgraded before and it could not have happened in a better hotel. There was even a birthday card in the room for my wife which was a nice touch. The staff were exelent, even popped in to the attached pub to tell me our cab had arrived for my wife's other surprise, a meal in the Shard. The room was great, four poster bed, leather furniture etc and one of the best bathrooms and showers ever. I would like to personely thank the staff at The Montcalm for a truly wonderful stay and the five star service we received. Would liked to have stayed longer and would recommend The Montcalm to anyone wanting a touch of Five Star luxury.
Thank you Mountcalm, best regards, Don & Jayne",5,2015,04,14
128,Fabulous start to husbands 50th birthday celebrations.,"From our arrival to our departure, everything was great, the staff were faultless, they couldn't do enough for you,  we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will without doubt return soon. The location for us was perfect,  a few minutes walk to everywhere. We were celebrating my husbands 50th birthday and stayed in the Duplex Suite, fabulous, book it!!!  Thank you Montcalm :)",5,2015,04,14
128,Best hotel bed I have slept in,"I travel a lot and stay in lots of hotels, but I was truly impressed by this hotel and especially the bed. I normally sleep badly in hotels, but this bed was so comfy with luxurious bedding and excellent pillows. The other little things in the rooms were perfect - the obligatory iron and ironing board, TV system and tea/coffee. Take note Marriott, they still provide shoe mits!! I definitely will return.",5,2015,04,14
128,"Classy, with just the right amount of care and attention","Arrived earlier than envisaged to the hotel, and found myself being ushered up to my newly upgraded room.  Large, comfortable, and well presented, the room had everything required to meet my needs.  It turned out that I had access to the Club Lounge, and after a short amble up and down a few short flights of stairs I found myself in a lovely and quiet room that can only be said to be based on the old style club lounges of the 19th century (but with the added graces of attentive staff, and good coffee).
I was situated in the room right above the pub downstairs, and can honestly say that there wasn't a peep past 11pm from underneath.  There were a few loud bikes and cars outside through the night, but  can't really fault the hotel on that.
The staff were excellent, the amenities excellent, and the breakfast (smoked salmon and scrambled eggs) was also excellent.
I would certainly like to stay here again.",4,2015,04,14
128,Deserves its 5 stars,"When booking I most definitely recommend speaking to Mandeep in reservations, he's very knowledgeable and helpful and will make sure you have the best stay possible. When booking be sure to book the club lounge as this is an added bonus. It provides complimentary drinks from 5.30-7.30 and has a great atmosphere, snacks and a chance to chat to other guests if you want, or if you'd prefer to keep yourself to yourself and have a quiet drink & nibble. We took some friends along with us this time who were amazed by the rooms, staff and experience of staying here. We were greeted by Alice who was as always friendly, efficient and happy. She is always vwry helpful & will help provide information or anything you need. Check in is always quick and easy and the staff always happy and helpful. The rooms, bathrooms & hotel are always spotless. Lovely showers, comfy beds and lovely toiletries provided. I stay here very frequently and have never had one issue or problem. I would recommend a barbican suit or wow room to anyone asking. I'm so glad my friends enjoyed their time there aswell as I'd spent a lot of time talking the place up so was happy that it fulfilled expectations. We will be returning again. Definitely deserves 5*. Clean, friendly, with decent, happy & helpful staff. Great club lounge and great breakfast. See you all again very soon 💋",5,2015,04,14
128,"location, style and service","fantastic location at the border of london city, coles to barbican centre (with good parking facilities close by). great service from all the staff (specially Vlad, the head concierge, knows everything about london and is very helpful - as are the rest of the staff). nice rooms, excellent breakfast. taxi always available, and tube station at walking distance.
nice running parcours for sunday mornings, at the thames borders.",5,2015,04,14
128,A regular traveller - and this is grim!,"I have stayed at this hotel on probably 8 or 9 occasions, mainly because it is very near my London office.  I haven’t stayed since January, because frankly I would rather travel than stay in this place.

On the positive side, the staff are very friendly, not particularly helpful, but extremely friendly.  I spent one of my nights there with hissing aircon - reported it three times, not much sleep was had that night!

The rooms are hit and miss – small and dingy – or rather, the first room they take you too is.  The second room is always much better – yes I always end up being moved.  I should add, this is not just my experience, but also that of a number of my colleagues visiting from throughout the UK and Europe.  The bathrooms are, in the main, dark and tiny (extremely small), and no five star hotel should have a bath over a shower.

It is a large hotel, and doesn’t have a lounge area as such, but rather a pub and a restaurant/wine bar.  The pub is an “uncomfortable” place for a lady traveller and the restaurant is equally uncomfortable.  There is a “Club Lounge” – which sometimes I have had access to and other times not – never been able to get to the bottom of that!  

The room service menu is poor, very little choice and frankly way over priced for at best average food.

There are much better hotels in London, although I have never stayed in one, I suspect the Travel Lodge would have the edge on this hotel. 

Worth noting, if you stay in the summer – they have regular, late night, events.  Ensure you insist that you are not near the Courtyard and on the ground floor.  That is unless you enjoy being kept awake for most of the night!",2,2015,04,13
128,A wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel,"We had a wonderful 3 day stay at this lovely hotel in the City of London celebrating our anniversary and my husband's birthday. The service by all the staff was impeccable and friendly from the moment we arrived. Anna on reception helped me order a cake for my husband's birthday - it was delicious - and Ruben on reception and Rumen from the Concierge also provided an excellent welcome to the hotel. We also got lovely birthday and anniversary cards and some wine from the hotel - a nice touch and much appreciated.

Part of its charm is because it's a historic building with rambling corridors and little flights of stairs - every trip out of our room was a magical mystery tour - delightful! The offerings in the Club Lounge were worth the extra cost  - it's definitely worth upgrading to a club room.  Breakfast in the Jugged Hare was also very good - eggs beautifully cooked any way you like by a very friendly chef and an excellent range of hot and cold buffets. My husband said they were some of the best fried eggs he's ever had! The local brew - Jugged Hare IPA was very good.

Our room was lovely, very well appointed and clean. We loved the glass wall in the bathroom! The turn down service with it's charming ""good night"" cards and weather forecast for the next day was a nice surprise.

In terms of location, though the City is very quiet at weekends with most bars/restaurants etc closed, the rest of London is easily accessible by nearby tubes and buses and it's within walking distance of St Pauls, the Sky Gardens and other City attractions.

All in all, we had a wonderful 3 days here - it will definitely be our first choice hotel in London from now on.",5,2015,04,13
128,Tranquil haven in the City,"I recently had the pleasure of a last minute weekend stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery. From the moment of check in it is apparent that this is a City hotel with a difference. Far from the standard corporate product with varying degrees of luxury, the Montcalm differentiates itself through its staff.  They are notable in their personable approach. Genuinely helpful, attentive and with an eye for detail, the experience is raised beyond expectations through their care. Worthy of particular mention are Vlad the Head concierge and Simona on reception whose can do attitude steamrollers even the slightest of issues.  Yes the hotel is ideally situated for a weekend cultural tour of the square mile, yes the standards are high, yes it has a superb, busy and buzzily atmospheric gastro pub attached and great cocktails in the Chiswell st dining rooms, but it is ultimately the staff that make this place. Thank you. I will be certain to return.",5,2015,04,13
128,Overnight in London - good spot,"Attentive staff, nice rooms and good location. Very happy with my stay and the pub on the corner is also a bonus being part of the hotel. Great atmosphere in there.
Staying again next week and will continue to stay over on business if they maintain these standards.",4,2015,04,13
128,World Class,"We stayed for one night at this hotel. The hotel is situated a short walk from the Barbican tube station. 
Everything about this hotel is world class. The facilities are brilliant. What makes this hotel extra special is the staff. They were all professional, friendly and very helpful. 
We were given a free upgrade on arrival which was a nice surprise. We stayed in a club room. The room was very spacious and finished to a high standard.
This hotel provides a great base to explore central London and we will definitely be staying at this hotel again.",5,2015,04,13
128,Wonderful Find,"I took my boyfriend to the Montcalm at Brewery for his 32nd birthday last weekend. I had read great reviews prior to booking this hotel and so expected good things. I wasn't disappointed! On check in we were upgraded to a better room which was great. A short while after checking in, we were presented with a complimentary bottle of wine for my partner's birthday, which was a nice surprise. The room was large and comfortable, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully return again in the not too distant future!",5,2015,04,13
128,Weekend in London,"We chose this hotel because it look smart and was at a very reasonable price on the internet. When we got there we could tell it was the right decision from the moment we arrived at the door and had our luggage taken in for us. We were looked after and treated so well by the staff in this beautiful hotel. The location for visiting London was ideal. 2 stops from Kings Cross and a 5 minute (covered) walk from the tube station. So quite at night and early morning, perfect night's sleep and a long lie in in the morning, very unusual for city hotels. Definitely decided on this as our base for future trips to the Capital.",5,2015,04,13
128,Amazing,"My wife and i stayed here for my birthday and it was simply stunning.  The decor and class of the hotel are superb.  Considering the quality of the hotel we felt the room rate was actually very good. 
The only slight down side was the location. There didn't seem to be lots in the immediate locality but with the tube station close by this didn't matter.
We would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",5,2015,04,12
128,Amazing," Excellent staff, luxurious room, delicious food. Absolutely faultless. It made our three night stay in London more enjoyable and special. We will be back. Good location to access the city, very close to St Pauls Cathedral. The little touches the staff put into your stay are adorable eg. Goodnight cards placed on your pillow, weather update for the following day, curtesy wine on arrival to your room. The little jars of nuts and sweets in your room are yet another pleasant touch to your stay at Montcalm at the Brewery. You will not be disappointed. ",5,2015,04,12
128,very pleasant stay ,"very nice and well presented hotel set in an old brewery, good to see they have kept some original features of the building.

very friendly, helpful and welcoming staff. 

nice bar attached to the hotel ( jagged hare) prices are ok as well.

very close to Moorgate tube station and cheap parking even closer at the barbican theatre.

room very nice and modern, clean bathroom and good shower. Loved the turn down service the hotel provide. pleasant surprise.

only reason knocked it down a star was because its a bit of a maze to negotiate to the room and have to swap lifts, the room had a small amount of wall paper peeling off, the wardrobe looked a bit shabby and had to request an iron and ironing board which took a while to arrive. other that that all good and would certainly book again. 
 ",4,2015,04,12
128,Wedding event and stay at Montcalm,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst attending a family wedding at the brewery. The hotel was excellent and the staff outstanding. Sanjeev treated us with the utmost respect and couldn't do enough for me and the family members staying. Breakfast good and the really enjoyed the food at the jugged hare which is one of the hotel restaurants. All in all an excellent stay and will hopefully be staying again very soon. Don't be afraid to book this hotel-excellent team of hotel staff.,5,2015,04,11
128,Perfect Hotel in Paradies city,"The Hotel was absolutely gorgeous, the staff was very forthcoming, the Rooms Are beautiful with luxury Furniture. Bonus: Hermes Beauty Products!!!! You can reach the Hotel Quote easily with the Tube or Bus, and St. Paul's is within walking distance. The Breakfast is Another Highlight: Great Quality Food!",5,2015,04,11
128,"Good hotel, terribile gym","I visited Montcalm as part of a business trip the other day. The advantages to the hotel were that the service was excellent, room was nice (comfortable bed and great shower). They even had some fruit and a bottle of water in the room which was a nice touch. 

Only disappointment was the gym. I generally like to go to hotel gyms when I go on business trips as to not fall out of my routine, so I have an idea of what to expect. The gym at Montcalm was one of the worst seen at any hotel. The room was tiny, with just enough space to squeeze in 3 cardio machines and some free weights. Also, the cardio machines looked ancient and wobbled when I used them as if they were going to fall apart at any moment. I would understand having space issues (particularly for a listed building), but there's no excuse for not updating the machines every once and a while. 

It's a shame because it was otherwise a nice hotel with a good location. But I will probably have to consider another hotel next time I'm down in London on business.",4,2015,04,11
128,A calm and comfortable luxury hotel,Excellent staff from the welcome we received until the moment we left who were superbly managed - could not have asked for better service. Calm and comfortable rooms with every facility. Lovely bathroom with rain shower and large bath. Fast efficient WiFi.,5,2015,04,10
128,By far the best hotel I have stayed in London!,"Thank you again kindly for making our stay a memorable one. It was very good of you to upgrade us and the attention to detail was not missed at all.

We shall of course be returning hopefully very soon.

10/10 all round!",5,2015,04,10
128,Nice Hotel,"The initial impression of The Montcalm as you walk through the doors is excellent- the lobby is beautiful and the receptionists are so polite and accommodating. I contacted the hotel ahead of our stay to advise them of my partner's birthday and they upgraded us, offered us complimentary wine and left a birthday card in the room- all such nice touches and really appreciated.
I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed with the room- even after the upgrade. We were put in a duplex room- Room 137, and it felt claustrophobic. The varnished staircase looked outdated and the carpet also made the room seem slightly outdated. There was no mirror above the vanity table upstairs and the stairs were incredibly steep to climb when trying to go up and down to get ready (I sound more like I'm in in . The sofa downstairs also looked like it had seen better days. However, we had a bathroom with a glass wall which was fun and the pillows were incredibly comfortable.
This hotel is good- perhaps I was just let down by my own high expectations. I think perhaps the other larger one story rooms in the hotel would have been better. Having said that, the price was very good and the staff provided excellent service so I shouldn't really be disappointed but it just didn't quite hit the mark. I would probably try to find somewhere a little more luxurious for the next time I stay in London.",4,2015,04,09
128,"Fabulous, well positioned hotel","My third stay in this excellent hotel. Staff always welcoming, friendly and attentive. Rooms are very well furnished and equipped with a clean, contemporary look. En-suites are large and immaculate. Beds very comfortable with very good quality linen. 
Breakfast is served in the adjoining Jugged Hare (which, by the way, is an excellent place to eat in the evening). Offers breakfast buffet or orders from the menu.
Located in a converted brewery (as the name suggests!) less than 5mins walk from Barbican tube station.",5,2015,04,08
128,5* stay at The Montcalm,"Arrived on Good Friday at midday. We were greeted by the most courteous doormen who took our bags. We thought we would have to wait until 2pm to check in, but the wonderful team on reception booked us straight in. The hot towels whilst checking in was a really lovely touch. Two gentlemen took our cases and led us on the winding corridors to our beautiful room. We were very lucky to get the room for less than half price via trip advisor, we travel extensively and have paid much more for much less. The heated floor in the bathroom, the lovely toiletries, the nespresso machine, huge, comfortable bed, free wifi, iron and board blah blah blah. I could rave about this place all day. Book and I promise you won't be disappointed. The tube station at Barbican is 5 minutes walk away. This hotel is ideally suited for all the main tourist attractions. Thanks to the team for the swan towels and rose petals on our first night. The main joy of this place is the super attentive team who go out of their way to help you and make you feel so very welcome. Thank you x",5,2015,04,08
128,"A very good, central hotel","Have stayed here twice now following work events.  The first time was at Christmas and I stayed in a lovely room overlooking Chiswell Street.  On the second occasion I was upgraded to a room further inside the hotel.  I have to say I preferred the first room which, although a little smaller, was easier to get to.  However, both rooms were lovely.  The beds are huge and very comfortable.  Bathrooms are very nice, with the usual toiletries etc.  The public areas of the hotel look great, and the staff are all very friendly and helpful.  The location is also perfect, about 5 minutes walk from Moorgate train station, right next to the Barbican centre.  Although not cheap, I would thoroughly recommend staying here.",4,2015,04,08
128,Fantastic London hotel,"Excellent value for money. Very helpful and kind staff. Very nice and quiet room, Modern bathroom, Club Lounge breakfast is very convenient with wide choice. Close to public transportation, close to London city Airport, Definitely recommend this Hotel.",5,2015,04,08
128,Great Hotel! Excelent location and service,"Stayed at the Montcalm Brewery hotel for 1 night during a business trip to London, the location was excellent with easy access to Liverpool Street or Old Street subway stations and the service was second to none! Very friendly staff and an excellent property",5,2015,04,08
128,Our kind of Hotel...,"I stayed her with my wife for the second time in a month (that speaks volumes)as we both like it's level of service,situation and all round pleasant nature..
It is a minutes walk from both The Barbican and the Cinema with what must be the cheapest car park two minutes away,at Eight pounds a day at weekends we drive in from rural Berkshire.
On entering the hotel lobby the doorman complete with Bowler hat greets you with a warm smile and the staff inside seem genuinely pleases to meet you.we were welcomed back and even had an upgrade which was great.
Attention to detail and comfy rooms are what you get here,you even get a decent shower gel and body lotion when showering (Hermes)

This hotel is becoming our New favourite place to stay

If I had to find something picky then it would be... Please can we have a few more coffee sachets as we do like our coffee.
That said there is free coffee in the Club lounge.",4,2015,04,07
128,Great hotel,"Lovely one night stay at The Montcalm. Fantastic warm welcome from Marcello at the front desk, and Claudio who showed us to our room. Hotel very well presented throughout. Our room (301S) felt a little on the small side - it seemed to be the additional bedroom for room 301 next door - but lovely decor, clean and comfortable and as we were only there for one night it wasn't a problem. Ate lunch at the Jugged Hare and the food and service were great. Ordered room service late that night which arrived promptly and was delicious. Would stay here again. ",5,2015,04,07
128,Very nice hotel perfectly situated near Liverpoolstreet station,"I was already twice in the Montcalm at the Brewery hotel and in both cases the service has been exceptional. Very friendly people from checkin to the people in the restaurants or bars 'til the checkout. Amazing how much more guest I was compared to other hotels in walking distance.
The rooms are nice (club rooms even with Nespresso coffee machine for coffee addicted people like me), clean and big enough. The only negative point was that I did not find out how to stop the airco in the bathroom, because of the cold floor in the morning.  
The food in the restaurant was very good and not terribly expensive compared with other hotels I have been in the past. I cannot judge the breakfast because I'm leaving always before they start serving it.
All in all a very pleasant stay and I'm looking forward being their guest again soon.",4,2015,04,07
128,Superb experience!,"We stayed at the Montcalm for two nights over the Easter weekend and had a brilliant experience! From the moment we arrived our bags were taken for us and a hot towel was provided before we'd even checked in! The room was spotless, elegantly decorated and featured small details such as a doorbell and the scent of our choice. On the second night we returned from dinner to find rose petals on our bed and swans made from towels, such gestures make such a difference! We will most definitely stay here again as the value for money was superb.

Finally the crowning glory of this establishment is the staff, they are polite, charming and went above and beyond - they are a credit to the Company!",5,2015,04,07
128,Birthday at the Montcalm ,"Had a fantastic stay here. Booked 4 rooms for the 8 of us and we all got upgrades when we arrived, as it was my birthday they also gave me a free bottle of wine. Every member of staff was courteous and friendly and tried to help at all times. 

The only downside was that my plug sockets in my room didn't work so had to charge my phone in a friend's room. 

We did end up going to the jugged hare and the guys behind the bar are a good sport and it was great fun.

Will definitely be returning.

Thank you for making my birthday such a special time :) ",5,2015,04,07
128,Excellent,Excellent hotel and excellent service. Our room was quite small but very comfortable. The kindness of the service is the best . Breakfast room very nice.  Complimentary drinks very appreciated. We will come back with pleasure,5,2015,04,07
128,Amazing time in this hotel,We arrived on Good Friday and left on Easter Monday and had a truly amazing time.The hotel staff were courteous and nothing was too much trouble.We were upgraded on arrival and the room was unbelievable and faultless.A lovely stay and we will definitely be back.,5,2015,04,06
128,Another great visit,"The Montcalm at the Brewery London City provided another great stay.  The rooms are very spacious and the beds very comfortable.  The location is great, close to many sites and tub stations just a few blocks away.  You can be at any of the major tourist sites in about 15 minuets by the underground and go back to a quite room.  I look forward to my next visit.",5,2015,04,06
128,Outstanding service,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to be treated as well as accommodated like a five star customer. We arrived before check in and were expecting to have to wait around for a while, however, rather than inconveniencing the staff at the Montcalm, they went out of their way to start our weekend away in style. We were seated with refreshments whilst we waited for our room. The lobby was very welcoming and the literature provided catered for both of our needs whilst we enjoyed some tea. The room, ready early, was beyond our dreams.
As we were celebrating my birthday the Montcalm upgraded us to a beautiful split-level room. It was truly heavenly. The service, too, continued to be exquisite. I found the whole stay to be comfortable, clean and would return again in a heartbeat. Thank you Montcalm staff for making it a truly memorable experience.",5,2015,04,06
128,Great staff and extras but overall doesn't quite hit the mark.,"This hotel was very well priced and when we arrived staff were fantastic and reception very impressive. The staff continued to be amazing throughout our two night stay. 
The room was big, but seemed cramped, things seemed to be on top of each other so planning wasn't great, however bathroom very nice. 
What really let this place down was not having its own bar. The bar is a pub and its not very big and popular with locals so you cannot sit down. its cramped. If it had another bar, perhaps for hotel guests only, it would be perfect.",4,2015,04,06
128,Impeccable service,"Service was excellent from start to finish, staff couldn't do enough to help. The hotel has everything you could want and expect from a hotel of this stadard. I would definitely again visit next time I'm in the area a great location for a weekend break somewhere a bit quieter in London.",5,2015,04,06
128,Exemplary service in gorgeous surroundings,"We stayed overnight in this beautiful, historic hotel. Having booked a deluxe double we were told on arrival (amidst a flurry of hot towels to wash our hands with and trays of complimentary chocolate Easter eggs) that we had been upgraded to an apartment in one of the annex houses. This was beautiful and the service we received was exemplary. The continental breakfast was beautifully presented with a huge range of food on offer.  The hotel is ideally situated with the bus stop outside and tube just down the road and benefits from being away from the hustle and bustle of the West End as the feel is very relaxed but attentive. We will definitely be returning. ",5,2015,04,05
128,Scrumptious stay,"The Montcalm is lush n luxurious. Was old Brewery. ( Whitbread)
Wonderful reception staff. They can't do enough for you. Room v comfy n lovely V &Boch en-suite. Cosy bed, Super sleep. 
The Jugged Hare pub attached is lovely old pub. Had tasty pub bites. Great beer. Shame it was only for one night. We had evening venue in the vaults at the rear inner courtyard. The meal served was very good and the service excellent. Most pleasant stay. Highly recommended to spoil a partner.
Hope to try another in the chain soon.",5,2015,04,05
128,You would never know it was there but very worth finding,"This place is a tardis you would never know it had so many rooms, hence the comments about it being a bit of a maze being true. But have no fear the staff are great, check in very welcoming after a long day. Room a bit quirky making the most of an old building with heritage. The night I stayed the wind was really blowing & hence the sash windows rattled. I just mentioned it on check out and even though it wasn't a problem in their control they were very apologetic & I received an email later they day confirming they had noted my concerns and would ensure I was especially looked after should I visit again. And I hope I do!",4,2015,04,04
128,Amazing hotel with excellent manager Alice,This hotel offered genuine hospitality all through our two-day stay.  The staff were marvellous and extremely helpful.  Thank you for making my husband's birthday such a memorable event. We will definitely visit again.,5,2015,04,03
128,Fabulous,"We stayed  justone night as a surprise with my wife and it was a very sumptuous hotel in a great location, convenient for central London and numerous bars and restaurants. We'll definitely be back soon.",5,2015,04,02
128,Montcalm - good place - great service,"The Montcalm at the Brewery London is a good place. great service.  Will surely use this hotel again.  
My booking was in the name of London City Suites, this was a bit confusing.
Surely a place I will recommend.",4,2015,04,02
128,Oasis of calm in London,The Montcalm is in fact an oasis of calm in London. Located in the old Brewery in the City not far from the Barbican this is an up-to-date luxury hotel offering great rooms and old fashioned service. It's worth paying the extra for the club rooms since then you have access to the club lounge where snacks and drinks are inclusive. It's close to the west end either by tube or just 15 minutes on the bus that stops outside. Highly recommended for a weekend in the capital.,5,2015,04,02
128,"Simply amazing 5*++ hotel where ""above"" & ""beyond"" customer service is just a normal day...","We booked two rooms for one night as part of 18th Birthday celebrations in London for our daughter. A courtesy call from Sanjeev (guest relations) the day before to confirm arrangements, a complimentary upgrade as well as welcoming us in advance to the hotel, reassured me that I chosen well. 
Having advised Sanjeev that we would be checking in early as we had matinee theatre tickets,we were reassured that at least one room would be ready for us to ""freshen up""...
Upon arrival, we were greeted by a genuine smile from the doorman who made us feel like returning ""family"".  This remained the overriding theme right throughout our stay.  Check-in was welcoming, professional & seamless... We were then greeted by Sanjeev who escorted us to Sophie's room.  We opened the door to find ""Happy 18th Birthday Sophie"" in rose petals across her bed, a gift wrapped chocolate birthday cake, a fruit basket & a bottle of rose wine on ice! I could not have done more had I prepared the the room myself - her smile really was priceless!
It's the little things that really do matter & whilst I'd like to think that the extra attention to detail was 'just for us', I believe it's simply the norm as everyone that we came into contact with, right from the doorman to the maid that turned down our bed, was a true customer advocate... I've worked years in the financial sector promoting the benefits of employee engagement & the links to improving the customer experience - The staff gave a masterclass in exactly how it's done!
With regard to our rooms, they were spotlessly clean, modern & for London a good size.  Again it's the little things like Hermes toiletries in our bathroom & Elemis is our daughter's, bath robes & slippers that added to the sense of luxury and being spoil t... 
This was the first time that we stayed at the Montcalm but definitely not the last -there's part of me that wants to keep the hotel ""our little secret"" but the team at Montcalm really do deserve to be recognized for not only understanding what it means to put the customer at the heart of everything they do but actually bringing it to life... they just get it & I would like to say to Sanjeev & the team that helped make my daughter's 18th simply amazing -  a BIG thank you for the memories!",5,2015,03,31
128,Wedding Anniversary Stay,"We stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery last year for an anniversary treat and returned this year as we had enjoyed it so much. It can be a bit risky to go back to somewhere in case standards have fallen but it was just as impressive with fantastic customer service and some extra special touches such as access to the Club Lounge. The bed was by far the most comfortable we've slept in in a hotel, the room was spacious and the electronic blind to open up the bathroom area enabled soaking in the bath whilst watching tv ! A very short tube journey from London Kings Cross makes this a great choice for you if you don't want the stress of struggling across London with luggage. The breakfast in the Jugged Hare was freshly cooked to order if you wanted, i would recommend the delicious Eggs Royal. We will definitely stay again.",5,2015,03,31
128,Lovely hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay. The room was a little small but had all the amenities. Service was fantastic. The location is not so great as there isn't much nearby particularly on a weekend, that said I would still recommend this place.",4,2015,03,31
128,memorable  stay,"Alice and her team made our stay really amazing; they gave us free upgrade to a montcalm suite and organized a beautiful anniversary surprise on the night of our arrival. 
The hotel is amazing, brerakfast delicious and the staff very supportive. I'll definetely come back again while in London!",5,2015,03,31
128,Very pleasant,"Stayed here for a single night weekend break after finding a good deal on expedia, and was very pleased. 
It's location is very good, in a very cool area with some awesome bars nearby (Jugged Hare next door is great). Near to the underground Northern Line so easily accessible to the tourist attractions without much of a walk. Northern line goes straight to/from Euston station too. 

The lobby is awesome, very well decorated and the brewery building area as a whole is very cool - people looking for something a little historical will appreciate the building.
Stayed in a deluxe double and the room was modern which I like (but historical people please note). The room was smaller than expected too but the bathroom was huge which I loved, with a heated mirror and rainfall shower.
As expected with a 5 star, the essentials were provided, umbrella, ironing board, hairdryer, slippers, toiletries etc. 

The lobby staff were extremely helpful, I actually found it a little over the top...English was not their first language and unfortunately they couldn't always understand what we were saying, we found we were repeating ourselves a lot, however, not the end of the world and we didn't want for anything, they were very attentive. 

They looked after our luggage when we checked out so we didn't have to lug it around which was a relief.

Didn't try the breakfast as I thought £20 was quite expensive, so we walked to All Bar One and had a brilliant breakfast for £24 for the 2 of us.

London can be a very expensive place to stay, and this room was reasonably priced at £142 for a 5 star. I would definitely recommend people to stay here, we had everything we needed and nothing was too far since the underground is so close. Will stay again.",5,2015,03,30
128,One tiny bit away from an excellent!,"I booked a 1 night stay here for my boyfriend and I as a birthday treat for him last weekend. Over all I was really happy. The staff where great, as was the decor in the main reception & restaurant. It was in a great location and very accesible to all main areas you would want to visit on a short London break. The breakast was amazing! I would recommend booking it when there as we got it a much more discounted rate than priced when booking the hotel directly. The only downfalls I found where 1 - The noise from the street when trying to sleep. 2 - I requested a room with a glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom, seen on a tripadvisor photo. It was explained to me on check in that my request had been met but unfortunately when we arrived to our room I found it hadn't :( It wasn't too much of a problem, as our room was lovely anyway but I was just dissapointed that I was told differant. 

Overall, It was a lovely stay and thank you to all the staff for being so helpful and friendly!",4,2015,03,30
128,I challenge you to find better customer service in London....,"Having chosen the hotel purely because the bride and groom of the wedding I was attending were staying there, I didn't know much about it. All I knew is that the hotel sounded like a cross between an expensive pen and a place of tranquillity. I also knew that I needed an early check-in to ensure the wife had enough time to glue her hair on and apply the copious amount of makeup she needed to make her look even remotely presentable. Thus I called the hotel with my request and got put through to the duty manager himself, Sanjeev, who was awesome from the get go. Nothing was too much trouble and while I told him we would probably arrive at the hotel at around 11.30am, he kindly replied, ""arrive anytime Mr Liew, your room will be ready."" And it was. Upon arrival, the staff were overwhelmingly accommodating and friendly. I don't even get that kind of welcome when I visit my parents. Checking in was efficient and quick and Sanjeev even found the time to come over and welcome my wife and I personally. A charming man with a great head of hair. 

We were shown to our room by Claudie who carried our bags and showed us the features of the room. He correctly guessed we were there for the wedding and did everything he could to make us feel at home. I had a good feeling about this man.

The morning after and having  spent a good 10 hours drinking myself into an early grave at the wedding of one of my best friends, I awoke early, praying for a new head in a semi drunken stupor with a mouth that tasted like a bear had kindly relieved himself in it. Upon turning over to see the wife asleep in a pool of her own alcohol-laden drool, I mustered up the energy to ask if she wished to join me for breakfast to which she replied with a monosyllabic grunt and an expletive I can’t share on tripadvisor. I took that as a no. I managed to crawl to the lobby to ask where I needed to go for breakfast only to be met by the delightful and smiling Claudie, who at that point was a vision. Claudie greeted me warmly and correctly noticed (and probably smelt on me) that it turned out to be a fab wedding and that I drank the bar dry. After which he kindly walked me to breakfast. I say ‘walked me’ but I really mean he practically carried me there in an Officer-and-a-Gentleman-kind-of-way given my lack of ability to open my eyes fully, let alone move. What a guy, my good feeling was accurate.

I soon found myself sat at a lovely breakfast table in the delightful pub, which is part of the hotel, to find an awesome buffet awaiting me. More sausages, tasty scrambled eggs, bacon, beans and mushrooms than you can shake a stick at. A sight for some very sore eyes. The service was impeccable and the waiters quite rightly assumed that I needed black coffee and water which appeared immediately. I loved these guys. They were polite enough to refrain from commenting on the fact that I looked and smelt like a pig farm but instead kept checking on me to see if I needed anything else - more coffee, more juice, perhaps a .357 Magnum to put myself out of my own misery. Two or three trips to the breakfast buffet later, I stumbled back to the room to find the wife sprawled out on the bed looking something reminiscent of Linda Blair in The Exorcist. Only covered in slightly darker vomit. 

Somehow we managed to throw some belongings into a bag and staggered to the lobby to check out where Sanjeev, Claudie and the rest of the staff gave us a fond farewell that made us feel like Posh and Becks, when in reality we looked more like Beavis and Butthead after a stag weekend. 

Sanjeev – you and your staff are assets to the hotel. I still have your business card you gave me and I will most definitely take you up on your offer to call you directly when I return. If only to ensure that you haven’t changed a thing about your hotel.",5,2015,03,30
128,Unique hotel,"This was my 2nd time in London and wanted a really nice hotel near Barbican center. Montcalm met my needs and booked it. From the first minute it seemed like it was the best choice. The employees were very helpful and kind. 
We were staying at the east section, above Jugged Hare and had no problem at all with the corridors (I can say that I loved them). The first day the elevator was not working but was fixed so this didn't annoy us at all.
The room was spacious and without any mark of wear (first time I've met such a room) an it was like we were the first ones to occupy it! Apart from that, it was very clean and the bed was soooo comfortable!
The hotel is very near to the Barbican center and the tube station as well, which makes it ideal for almost everyone!
The only negative was the fact that the vacations ended and had to get back home but I am sure that one day we will return!",5,2015,03,30
128,City Hotel Perfection,"We stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery for our wedding anniversary celebration. The location, staff and hotel room met our expectations. 

A very special mention to Anne at Reception for her professionalism and attention to detail. Her smiling demeanor each time we saw her was a wonderful contrast to the rainy and windy weather we encountered during our stay. She is an asset to any organisation.

The Concierge desk was most helpful and attentive. Thank you to Binay and Mihai for your services. Another gentleman at the desk was very helpful upon our departure.

If there is one meal you must have in London, please go to the Jugged Hare. The food is of Michelin-starred quality and the wine selection is superb. An excellent hotel restaurant.

We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we visit London.

Many thanks,

Mr & Mrs Frawley",5,2015,03,30
128,Perfect stay for a romantic London getaway,"Highly recommend this hotel. Will definitely be returning. Not only is it an ideal location for hopping on tube to main shopping areas - Covent garden, Oxford circus etc. but close to brick lane as well. Stunning hotel and staff can't do enough for you. We ate in the restaurant which was delicious. Why stay anywhere else?",5,2015,03,29
128,The art of good customer service isn't dead,"Just treated my Mum to a weekend in London and stayed at this hotel.  The rooms were spacious well equipped and nicely decorated and all the staff are friendly and very helpful.  This hotel would have received 5 stars, but my Mum's room was close to a part of the hotel hosting a wedding and while she likes dancing to ""come on Eileen"" with the best of them, it was a bit too noisy into the night for her to get to sleep straight away.  That said, I had a great nights sleep in my quiet room.....and the staff dealt with her concerns extremely well and I would like to thank them for their professional service which was excellent and how things should be handled.  His is my second stay at the hotel and I will be back.",4,2015,03,29
128,wonderful stay,"We were greeted by welcoming friendly staff upon our arrival and all facilities were explained to us as well as complimentary items, such as free WiFi and newspaper. Our  room was very comfortable and clean and what we saw of the hotel was what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. We did not have breakfast but felt it was quite expensive. Overall based on our experience I would definitely recommend the Montcalm.",5,2015,03,29
128,5 star doesn't do it justice!,"Wow is all I can say about this lovely hotel and its staff. It has gone straight to the top of my best ever list of the many I have stayed in over the years. From the moment we arrived we could not have been made more welcome. As our visit was a special occasion we were given a free room upgrade. On learning that it was my daughters graduation Sanjeev the duty manager arranged for a bottle of wine which made us feel very special indeed. A big thank you to Sanjeev, Simona, Viktor, Anne Adam and all other staff whose names I did not manage to get. My room was gorgeous with every amenity for comfort which as a disabled person makes a big difference. Loved the rainforest shower. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough its a must try.",5,2015,03,29
128,Second visit ,"This is my second visit to this hotel. It is a lovely hotel and provides a great, comfortable place to relax in after a day's sightseeing in the capital. We were upgraded to a club room (but only after our first room was situated right next to the lifts so we were concerned about noise). The staff are very helpful and attentive (especially the reception staff). I do have a few niggles though...our room was opposite a service room and on both mornings of our stay, the staff congregated outside our room and chatted to eachother extraordinary loud at 8am on the second night this was around 3am. I would have thought that the staff would know to keep their voices down in the corridors during the night and early morning when guests are sleeping. 

We stayed two nights and paid the same rate for both nights. However on the second night the room was not replenished with toiletries or water. I think this is naughty. For guests staying two nights and paying the same price for both, the same amenities should be provided for both nights. I understand if the previous toiletries had not been used but my shampoo and conditioner bottles were empty and were just left for me when I returned to my room for my second night. I had to call reception and ask for more toiletries so I could take a shower! 

Turndown service was a nice touch but was only for the benefit of one guest in the room. One pair of slippers left by the bed, one chocolate left on the pillow etc. when I came to make coffee in the morning we only had one sachet of coffee. We booked the room for two people so not sure what happened there. 

Overall though I do like staying in the Montcalm and the above niggles wouldn't stop me booking again. 

",4,2015,03,29
128,Perfection from start to finish,"What a fabulous stay we have just enjoyed at the Montcalm!
From the moment we arrived the staff were outstanding. Every one of them were charming and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. They met needs we didn't even know we had, anticipating all we needed to make our stay comfortable. 
The hotel itself is fresh, clean and spacious with a decor that is contemporary with a great attention to detail. Rooms were spotless and elegant. Good bed and curtains ensured a good night's sleep. Free wifi.
Great location for the Barbican Centre and also good shopping and eateries.
I will be delighted to stay here again. Very happy.",5,2015,03,28
128,Perfect!,"Fantastic weekend away in London. Was surprised at how lovely this hotel was. We had a beautiful room which had probably one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in within it! Fantastic service from all of the reception staff and hotel porter.
Definitely will return.",5,2015,03,28
128,"Smart , well presented and very friendly","I've stayed here a few times in recent months. It's a 5 minute walk from Moorgate station . It is a really interesting building although it can be a little confusing of you are in the South Wing !  The rooms are modern, very smart and well furnished , and a good size.  The staff are great - very friendly and welcoming. It's a hotel I will definitely return to when staying in London.",4,2015,03,28
128,Really Nice Hotel,"Stayed here one evening as was attending a conference locally.This is a really nice hotel which oozes history and class.  Whilst I have given 5 stars as a review, there are certainly better 5 star hotels in London and elsewhere, I doubt though they would be close to the price of this place though.

Rooms are lovely as is the bathroom.  Lots of luxurious goodies including slippers and dressing gown.  Watch the nibbles though, as they may look free but actually cost a fortune.

Really nice welcome from staff and bags taken up to the room.  Have to say the staff were great.  

Breakfast is served outwith the main hotel at the hotels bar, can't remember the name.  The bar and indeed the breakfast/restaurant are both excellent.  Great ambience being a pub.

Myself and a colleague got a taxi into Soho, maybe 10 minutes away. Plenty of action there as it was a Sunday and St Patrick's weekend.There did not appear to be much round the hotels area on a Sunday open (could be wrong as not a local).

If I had anything to criticise about the hotel itself, it would be the hotel and rooms are very dark.  it's a romantic dark but still dark. After coming back to hotel after a few beers it was like Krypton Factor trying to work out how to switch the TV off and the lights in the room. Especially the LED's along the skirting boards. Never did work it out but had a great sleep none the less.

Would I stay again?  Absolutely in a heartbeat.  

Not knowing London well I don't know how well positioned this hotel is but for the price, it would be hard to beat.",5,2015,03,28
128,Birthday visit to London,"Never really know where the best place or area to stay when visiting London for a couple of days. This time was to celebrate my birthday with a reservation at a thoroughly recommended fish restaurant close to Liverpool Street station.  The Montcalm @ The Brewery was rated No. 1 in the area on Tripadvisor so it was high on our list, as we would be arriving late afternoon it was important it was close to the station so we could relax as soon as we arrived at our destination and didn't have to trek miles across London.
On arrival the hotel looked lovely and we were greeted with a very warm welcome. The lady at reception was very helpful and when she found out we was celebrating a birthday she arranged a lovely bottle of wine to celebrate in our very nice club room. The club lounge was a lovely touch with the option of relaxing in a comfortable lounge with canapés and a glass of wine or 2 before returning to our room to get ready. The room was spacious with some lovely touches including the glass wall in to the bathroom. 
A lovely full English Breakfast was delivered to the room the next morning. 

A perfect hotel in a great location, walking distance to Liverpool Street station and a great nightlife. 

It's little touches like the hotel being this good that makes you want to return to out capitwl City more often. 

Thank you for making my birthday special, especially when you get this old!",5,2015,03,27
128,"Great service, incredible bed","Probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Fantastic service too. Very personable and friendly. Highly, highly recommend this hotel. The restaurant and pub are also really pleasant. I'll definitely come back here next time I'm in London.",4,2015,03,27
128,Fabulous Hotel,"After a very busy couple of days I arrived at the Mountcalm to a very warm welcome. The staff at this hotel are very attentive and can not do enough for you. We had a Mountcalm Club room and it was definitely worth the extra as the club lounge is very relaxing with complimentary drinks and snacks between 5.30 and 7.30.

The room was lovely with a great rain shower and wonderfully comfy bed.

go back!",5,2015,03,27
128,"Very welcoming, spotless room and quirky building","If you like quirky hotels you'll like this one. Stayed overnight for the first time and really liked it.

Despite pre-arranged late arrival, the check in was smooth as silk (as it should be-right?) and staff very prompt on guiding me to my room (which was a bit of a walk though corridors). 

Room was spotless and bed very comfortable.

Breakfast was served in The Jugged Hare (not the Club Lounge which is reserved for people way more important than me, it seems), a pub on ground floor street level that's integrated into the hotel building. 

Never had breakfast in a pub before but that too was good quality and the the hot food was properly hot, not like you fond in some places.

Service with a smile throughout breakfast, which is always appreciated.

Check out was a effortless as check in. 

Didn't have time to try facilities such as wifi speed and other services.  Maybe next time (I'd like to stay again) 

Scoring this high on service but average for value.",5,2015,03,27
128,confusing corridors,"Gorgeous lobby and room was nice but a bit pokey. Good location and convenient pub next door. Wasn't keen on the idea of walking down the road for breakfast though, shame there is no on site restaurant/breakfast room. Only real problem I had was finding my room due to bizarre room number system but helpful staff made sure I found my way.",4,2015,03,27
128,My first FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE Exceeded my expectations on ALL levels!,"This is a review of my three night stay at this fabulous hotel from Jan 16-18 2015.
Late last year I suddenly had a very favourable change in my financial circumstances, previously I had always booked on a frugal budget. 
In January I suddenly needed to seek a London Hotel for reasons I don't need to share here. 
My original intention was to book just one night as this would facilitate what I needed.
I soon decided that to give the best advantage to my task, nothing less than Four Star would suffice.
Via a well known search engine starting with G I soon found The Montcalm, and it just JUMPED out of my laptop!
Initially I booked just two nights via another last minute site which ironically could have cost more and did NOT include the full English Breakfast option. Fortunately I was able to cancel the original reservation and re-book direct with the hotel.
So my learning experience is that more often you get a better deal if you book direct. I paid nearly £100 less AND had the breakfast included. 
On a point of principle I will NEVER book 4 star plus unless breakfast IS included.
Within hours I decided to book an extra night and make a long weekend of my stay.
I waited 56 years for my first FIVE STAR experience and was blown away!
You may be reading this review and be thinking 'why pay so much when I can find a bed for much less?' 
Would you stay in a budget hotel for eighteen hours without leaving? Well I did at the Montcalm!
From start to finish everything was perfection.
On arrival I was offered an upgrade, and a very fine complimentary half bottle of red wine.
The room was out of this world! Spacious, with attention to detail and the bathroom wow - I love to luxuriate in a proper bath - that you can view the bathroom via a huge glass panel from the bedroom was what essentially 'clinched' the booking.
The staff were brilliant, the ambience everywhere was so terrific that I luxuriated within the Montcalm for eighteen hours without leaving.
Essentially my only meal of the day was breakfast, it was all I needed! Even if you selected the continental option you would not be disappointed - delicious, mouth watering, quality.
The 'Piece de resistance' was the Club Lounge offering a complimentary bar from 4.30 to 11pm! and delicious canapes until 7pm. Find another Four/Five star hotel in London that has anything to compare?
Will I book to stay at The Montcalm again? OF COURSE. Will I consider other 4 star plus London hotels in the future? NO!",5,2015,03,25
128,Excelllent as always,"I stayed here twice in March with upgrades to an amazing duplex suite and one of the hotel's WOW suites. The service and attention to detail as always was first class. 

The breakfast is as good as it gets with unusual choices like smoked salmon, Eggs Benedict and Granola adding to the other hot and cold items. 

The hotel is of course a little bit of a maze but that just adds to the charm. It is not a standard building such as many chain hotels but it is quite easy to find your way around the place. 

If you can enjoy a WOW suite try it but even the standard rooms are very nice.",5,2015,03,25
128,I like this hotel,"A solid hotel in the city of London. 
I stay here a lot when I come to London on business.  It is very centrally located in the City of London, a walking distance to everything I need to get to - Gherkin building, St Paul cathedral, Liverpool street station.  
The rooms are small but it is London after all. Everything you expect in a 5 star hotel room is in the room: the ironing board, robes and slippers.  They will give you a pass to a gym nearby if you ask.  The hotel is actually an old Brewery so you may get lost going up and down and  across the street but it has a lot of charm.  The people are very helpful and will walk you to your room.  The continental breakfast in the club room is not  abundant but sufficient for my taste (fruit, pastry yogurts, etc.).  
I will come again.",4,2015,03,25
128,Very nice hotel in a an old building,"We stayed here for one night in a club room. The was useful emails providing information about the stay and he to obtain answers to any questions. I even had a call from the hotel, then put through to a manager on the day before, asking if they could assist with anything. 

I did contact the hotel to as about parking and was told that valet parking was available at £40. So on arriving I was surprised to find that the doorman knew nothing of the parking arrangements stating the car park does not belong to the hotel.  He did helpfully take our luggage in to the hotel prior to us finding the car park. Parking is available around the corner in the Barbican centre at £32 per 24 hours. From parking space to door was under five minutes walking distance. 

Prior to our arrival we also booked to have afternoon tea at the hotel. Unfortunately, the booking was lost when we arrived. However, we were promptly seated and there was no delay in receiving our refreshments. 

There was some confusion at breakfast as the restaurant did not have our room listed for the day. However. Again we were promptly seated and provided with a wonderful buffet breakfast, very tasty and fresh. 

Despite these little niggles we had a great stay. All the staff we encountered were extremely polite and helpful. The hotel has a very modern theme using the best parts of an old building. The room was very nicely appointed with a half bottle of wine and selection of nespresso coffee, fruit and bottled water all complementary. We particularly like the turndown service leaving a goodnight message on your pillow. 

It is a good location for the city particularly the Barbican. 

Overall it was very reasonable for the quality of the hotel, the location and experience we had.",5,2015,03,25
128,Good city location,"A good hotel for access to the City. 5 mins walk from Moorgate tube. Comfortable and quirky (the old Whitbread brewery site in Chiswell Street). Friendly and efficient staff. Quiet rooms, comfortable beds. No complaints at all - have stayed three times in the last few months.",4,2015,03,25
128,Great Hotel,"Really enjoyed staying here. 

Just for one night, but staff were great, room was excellent. Great location, very handy for tube and Barbican Centre. We stayed on a Saturday so the area was quiet, didn't hear any outside noise. 

Didn't use the bar, restaurant or room service but the continental breakfast was good.

The pub next door, The Jugged Hare (think its part of the hotel) was good and they allow children in in the evening. Unusual around here.",5,2015,03,24
128,Wow what an Hotel,"We just came home from an amazing weekend in London , and this hotel is one of the things that made it so amazing
From the moment we came in the door we felt very welcomed .
We were celebrating my husband’s birthday and the staff went out of their way to make him feel special
They upgraded our room to , what I think , was the best suite in the hotel.
And wow what a suite !  It was clean , beautiful and had all the things you could need in a hotel room.
Rainforest shower , big bath and a very comfortable bed .

The Hotel was very clean , and not to say the least very beautiful. Fresh flowers everywhere , and beautifully decorated 

The staff was exceptional and very attentive of our every need .
No matter what we needed they did everything they could to help us. 
And all the smiles made you feel right at home .

Sadly we never got the time to eat in the Hotel , but I’m quite sure that this is as great as the rest of the hotel 

The hotel is located in a very quiet part of London , so if you need peace this is great .

And the best part is that it’s not that expensive

I will highly recommend this hotel to everyone.

You may by now think that this sound too good to be true , but if you book a room in The Montcalm you will see that everything I’m telling you is the truth",5,2015,03,24
128,Very posh ,"I stayed here for 1 night in March with my boyfriend, as it was his birthday they upgraded us to a ""wow suite"", gave us some complimentary wine and breakfast if we wanted some. 
I've stayed in 3 hotels in London in 2015 and this one was definitely my favourite. We had a four poster bed with a rainforest shower and an amazing, big bath. 
It was the little touches that meant the most, they did a lot for my boyfriend to make his night special. You can also choose a scent in your room and choose which pillows you would like to sleep with.  
It wasn't too expensive and I would stay here again. One down side was a small stain on the carpet, the tv was very far away from the bed so was hard to see and we found some rubbish on top of the bed, other than that the hotel was lovely. ",5,2015,03,23
128,exceptional service and staff!,"the length at which the montcalm went to make me feel comfortable, at home, and well taken care of is what makes this a 5* hotel. i would stay here again in a heartbeat and am reassured that the service is spectacular everytime! thanks again team!",5,2015,03,23
128,SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STUNNING LUXURY HOTEL,"My boyfriend surprised me for our anniversary and it was such a wonderful experience right from the moment we stepped into the hotel. The hotel is stunning and so close to the tube stations Barbican and Moorgate - 5mins walk. Perfect for a weekend away!

The bedroom was stunning and extremely clean. The club room was amazing, this is certain rooms that can get complimentary alcoholic drinks and snacks, I thought that was a lovely touch.

Best breakfast!! all you can eat buffet.. YUM

The staff here were so polite and helpful in every way possible, I would certainly recommend this hotel to people that was a luxury stay with no hazzle :)",5,2015,03,23
128,Quirky,"Stayed here on business and hotel was chosen and booked for me.  A converted brewery it is a quirky hotel which is a bit like a rabbit warren, not in a bad way though.

WiFi was free. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was behind a clear glass wall, I was told it was so you could watch TV when lazing in the bath, but there was a screen that lowered at the push of a button for when more privacy is needed in the bathroom.

In the blurb in the room was a list of local restaurants, which was interesting and I could have spent quite a bit of time reviewing what was on offer if I wasn't already booked to eat with friends in the hotel.

The bar was initially a bit too noisy for my liking but that was because there were some after work drinkers there, one of whom would definitely be kicked out of a library or museum but (not at my instigation) the manager had a quiet word and quietened them down.  Jugged Hare beer was good, as were the nibbles.

Evening meal menu had a decent variety to choose from.  The food was well cooked and tasty.  The wine list was good and not ridiculously priced.

Staff were very attentive and helpful throughout the hotel, particularly when my razor broke the following morning and the concierge arranged for a razor kit to me presented to my room within minutes.  Can't beat service like that.

Breakfast was fine, except the coffee was what I can only describe as weird as it had a funny scenty flavour to it - I restricted my drink to one sip. I should've complained there and then but couldn't be bothered.

When checking out I was being charged separately for the breakfast coffee, which I couldn't understand as I've never been charged separately for coffee at breakfast before.  Anyway it was all sorted out amicably in the end.

I quite liked the hotel and whilst I would stay there again it would not be my first choice.",3,2015,03,23
128,"Great hotel, superb customer service!","We stayed at the London City Suites this weekend and couldn't have asked for a better stay. From arrival to departure the hotel staff were amazing and the room (Deluxe double) was one of the best I've stayed in London.
Would thoroughly recommend and will definitely be visiting again.",5,2015,03,23
128,best hotel,"combine class with personal. thats this beautiful hotel. even better than the pictures. 
all smiles and service. all clean and tastefull. all modern and spacious. but with big wooden details and authentic ceilings. big showers, big beds, even a private roman steam room and sauna - and its free.
THIS JUST HAPPENED: i told the crew i have the flu. the manager and a waiter just brought camille tea in my room. as a surprise! WOW.",5,2015,03,22
128,Mrs Jackson,"An exceptional 5 Star Hotel with super, friendly staff that would "" bend over backwards"" to help you, nothing is too much trouble. Customer service is 100%

128,Excellent room and staff,"Good rooms and attentive, friendly staff. A little out off the way from  where I wanted to be but great for the Barbican or those wanting to be near St Pancras (3 stops on tube). Great value with Hotwire deal. I did not use the restaurant so can't comment on breakfast.",4,2015,03,22

128,Decent hotel but avoid room 101!!,"Checked in only for one night  and on arrival staff were very friendly and efficient. A welcoming lobby nicely designed. We were allocated do 101, which should have been the warning!!!  Room itself was on the small side (not much room to walk round the end of the bed) and a little dark, but decently equipped. The bed itself was comfortable but quickly found out it was as two single beds pushed together with a mattress topper; sadly the topper wasn't big enough!  The main problem was that the room was right next to a service cupboard a which was constantly in use.  If you're in this room you ca forget any kind of relaxing stay with the noise starting around 6.45. When I mentioned the problem on check out the staff were very positive but I'm not sure they can actually do much about the situation of the room.  Happy to stay here again but please avoid 101!",4,2015,03,22
128,There is just something missing but we like it,"We have stayed in most room categories in this hotel from a standard deluxe, a duplex suite and a WOW suite, all of which are well appointed with various levels of facility's and extras.
We find the staff in general very polite professional and attentive, though sadly this cannot be said for the Club lounge when on three occasions we have found the staff inattentive and even extremely rude on one occasion. In our opinion the cause of this is the management, as the club lounge has no consistency for the general staff to adhere too. We found the Club lounge set up for breakfast one evening as early as 9pm and the staff member had to remove the breakfast items for us to sit at a table, A general manager then proceeded to get defensive when questioned about the club lounge and then  only offered excuses for the club lounges inadequateness and said once it had been moved to the ground floor it would be better, not an ideal excuse if you are paying for club lounge privileges at the time!
That said, apart form the club lounge fiasco on three occasions, the rest of the hotels facilities, staff and location are excellent.
I would like to add some constructed criticism though... Could you please provide a table or at least a larger table in all categories of rooms as on all occasions when ordering room service there is nowhere to put the tray down and eat comfortably. On one occasion I think in the duplex suite, I had remove a lamp or vase from a corner table once the food had arrived for the member of staff to put the tray on.

All in all we really like the Montcalm Brewery and would like to have gave 5 stars but there are just a few things missing at the moment, perhaps next time?",4,2015,03,22
128,An Oasis in Busy London,"Summary: I really liked this hotel.  It had something traditional about it even though it was a modern hotel with all the key amenities one would expect.

The Good: Comfortable and pleasant.  Since it seems to be part of the brewery, it has a very traditional yet modern feel about it.  The rooms are small but nicely appointed.  The breakfast in the lounge was excellent.

The Bad: I missed the slippers and gowns you typically get in a hotel of this class.  I am used to traveling in Asia and these amenities are pretty basic I would think.",4,2015,03,22
128,Great hotel!,"I stay here regularly while on business and have never been disappointed. Fantastic location, lovely rooms and atmosphere and very friendly and helpful staff  who make every effort to ensure my stay is as enjoyable, relaxed and hassle free as possible. If your looking to stay in the City, I highly recommend the Montcalm!",5,2015,03,20
128,Good hotel,Stayed here and it was fantastic all staff were very helpful and would definitly recommend will definitly be back again. Even the food and breakfast we had was amazing as I said definitly would recommend,5,2015,03,20
128,"Great hotel, lovely helpful staff.",Stayed in the Montcalm in Barbican last weekend. Found the staff very nice and helpful. Great facilities and lovely room. Had breakfast in the morning in the Jugged Hare which was lovely. Would definitely recommend and stay again.,5,2015,03,19
128,Wonderful Surprise,"My husband surprised me with a nights stay at this fantastic hotel for our anniversary on 28th February 2015.  He arranged with Alice, the duty manager, to view one of their rooms  - which unbeknown to me, we would be staying in that evening.  Alice went out of her way from the moment we got there to make sure our stay was special, from assisting with the initial surprise, to helping my husband locate a shop so he could buy a new jumper for the evening as he forgot to pack the one he was going to wear!  The suite was amazing and decorated beautifully and it really made our day and evening memorable, so much so that we will be staying here again later in the year for a family birthday, and hope Alice can help out with another surprise!",5,2015,03,19
128,Wonderful!!,"My husband and I were having a date day/night in London to celebrate his birthday. As a birthday treat, Ruben (very helpful) upgraded our room to a suite, and sent us a bottle of wine. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Claudiu was also especially helpful. We had a lovely stay and will definitely stay again at this hotel.",5,2015,03,18
128,"Comfy room, great location, friendly helpful staff","A little hard to find as the address I had been given at booking was across the road, but when I did locate it, I was not disappointed. I have been used to small unfriendly rooms in London and this is not one. We would stay again.",5,2015,03,18
128,Mr,"I found the staffs welcome and demeanor to be friendly, courteous outgoing and very professional. Especially considering my introduction to the property when I finally arrived as first.
I have to admit that I was not in the best of humors when I arrived.
I had taken to the incorrect MountCalm location by our transport, so the staff at the (Correct) Brewery location more than made up for it. The night manager, Hiral(?) because it was nearly midnight when we arrived, really went to extraordinary lengths, MUCH further than was expected, to ensure our satisfaction that evening. Because the evening canapé bar was closed he offered us and had other food delivered to the room comparable to that which we would've got had we arrived when that snack bar was open. The room was very comfortable, though there were some minor maintenance issues, but MOST importantly, had a plate with 3 fruits to revive our wearyness . 
The evening prior to our leaving we requested and were delivered some packing supplies to enable a box to be left for pickup. 
That morning Hiral, again, went to extraordinary lengths to ensure our satisfaction by preparing a breakfast ""to go"" for my daughter and myself in a bag and sending with us in the taxi and which he and his staff had also arranged, ensuring our safe and economical comfort and satisfaction.
The person I left the box for, communicated that the box had been picked up.
Task completed !!!
Because there is no higher rating to give,
 I must give it five stars !!!
well-done Hiral 
I plan to return. 
GW from Texas",5,2015,03,17
128,Quality at last!,"Our first time here and it outshone all the other hotels we have used in London. The staff training must be exceptional and all the staff were delightful. The room was not too small and the fittings were quality and all worked!
So the hotel was great and we will be back. But the highlight of our stay was dinner in The Jugged Hare. There were 6 of us and all had something different but each dish was outstanding.
Fantastic service was provided by Victor from Granada. Muchas gracias.",5,2015,03,16
128,"Lovely hotel, nice staff, no bar in hotel","Really nice hotel, with unbelievably comfortable bed and lovely shower. Only criticism is you have to go out of the hotel to get to their bar which is actually a pub about 50 yards down the road. Therefore there is no option for a drink after hours.  Very friendly staff. Great value for money as booked late and therefore got a very god price.",4,2015,03,15
128,Brilliant stay!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay here with my husband, we stayed in a Montcalm club room which was a good size with everything you could need and very clean. The cooked breakfast in the jugged hare was fantastic and the club lounge a great bonus which we made use of! The staff in the hotel are exceptional and go out of their way to ensure your stay is perfect. I would love to return to the hotel again! ",5,2015,03,15
128,Warm services,"Only my first night and I'm impressed. Should have checked the housekeeper""s name. The lady who serviced rm 310 tonight. She insisted on helping with my bottle of red, which i seriously damaged the cork. Rushing back with victorious smile from getting professional help at Room Service, she firmly refused my tips. Respect! Claudiu of Concierge has been great too :)

Not a very strategic location for touristy action, great for business purpose in this financial district.  Very unique transformation from an old brewery, very English...  I usually reviewed after my departure, but the Housekeeping lady truly inspired me!",5,2015,03,15
128,Hotel has luxury facilities,"I booked WOW Suite-Complimentary English Breakfast in this 5 star property, room has outstanding facilities like 24 hour service, meeting and event venues, two restaurants and bars. I enjoyed the stay with nearby attractions- St Paul's Cathedral and tower of London.",4,2015,03,13
128,"Stylish hotel with excellent decor, service, staff and facilities","This was our second stay and we were just as happy as the first. The staff were very friendly and helpful just as before. The hotel was luxurious, very clean and the room was amazing. Definitely will be going back for a third visit and to enjoy the yummy breakfast. ",5,2015,03,12
128,A good hotel for the area and price - but not truly 5*,"The Barbican area is a love it or hate it part of London.  The 'brutal' great, concrete architecture will either inspire you or send you into a deep lasting depression. But I digress.  The hotel itself was fine, the staff friendly and attentive and the rooms are decent but a little on the small side - I was in the Deluxe and yet it was still a bit of a squeeze to get to bathroom.  The one saving grace of the room was the bed - luxury comfort indeed - but that was the only Luxury to be had during my stay.  The cost for breakfast or anything food or drink was very dear - it was a company paid for expense otherwise I would have thought twice before ordering room service. To be honest, I have stayed in much better accomdodation in London for the same price, but it served the purprose.  It's just not somewhere I would bring my wife.",3,2015,03,12
128,Great bed and great shower!,I travel to London a lot and very few hotels have a great bed and a hot shower. Montcalm makes it happen. Thank you team Montcalm...especially Ann!!  I hope to stay there often as it's very convenient for access to Liverpool St. Station. ,5,2015,03,12
128,Wonderful staff.,"Every member of staff we met were excellent and couldn't do enough to help. The hotel blends the old fashioned listed building and modern fittings perfectly. The room was very nice, well equipped and quiet but a little small however all the other pluses made up for this. The hotels pub the Juggged Hare was great. We would definitely return but think about booking a larger room.",4,2015,03,10
128,Very Nice Hotel,"I stayed here for one night.  It has tremendous character. Its quite a nice historic property.  I was in London on business at the Barbican Centre and this hotel is right around the corner. I had a spacious room with Hermes toiletries.  When i got to the room with the bellman, i wanted to open the drapes.  He didn't know how to do it either.  We opened them by holding them with chairs.  When we opened them, we realized that the view was pretty unappealing.  The bellman was incredibly helpful and even though i was staying for one night, he wanted to explain every feature of the room, including the heated bathroom floor, heated towel racks, Do Not Disturb button, and the climate control. Loved him. The bed was outstanding and its the first hotel i've ever been to with a scent vaporizer. 

As the building was an old brewery, its quite a distance from one end of the hotel to the other.",4,2015,03,10
128,"Excellent Location, 5 Star Service","The Montcalm lives up to all expectations, a great location, attentive staff and always helpful and accommodating. 

The room was sufficient and welcoming. We wanted a central location for exploring and with a bus stop right outside heading towards St Pauls then this is as good as it gets. 

We thank the staff at the Montcalm for a wonderful stay",5,2015,03,10
128,Over attentive service,"The history is great being a hotel converted from an old brewery.  We booked a club room for breakfast and access to refreshments.  The complimentary Lounge area felt more like a waiting room and was part of the main access to other parts of the hotel, so it sometimes felt like you were sitting in a corridor as people walked loudly past to their rooms. 
Hotel staff couldn't have been more attentive though and went the extra mile to make sure the stay meets your wishes.  Being used to surly English service I found this over attentiveness a little uncomfortable - a bit like having an overly needy partner always asking if you are enjoying yourself.  I guess that's just me and it's way better to be on that side of the scale. 
Hotel is situated near the barbican so ideal for entertainment and what must be one of the cheapest car parks in London at just £24 for our three day weekend parking. ",4,2015,03,10
128,Fabulous in every way!,"From the moment you arrive, you are warmly greeted by every member of staff, nothing is too much trouble, and they will do their level best to cater for your every whim. The suite and bathroom was spotless, the bed I didn't want to leave it was so comfortable (Elemis pillow spray and tailored room vapouriser), and all the public areas are amazing with bowls of apples, designer sculptures, and fantastic flower arrangements.
We were celebrating our wedding anniversary in February, and apples with ""I Love You"" marked into each apple and a bunch of red roses were left in our room.  Just wonderful, and I can't praise the staff and this Hotel highly enough.",5,2015,03,09
128,Fantastic hotel- a real treat,"My partner and I stayed at the Montcalm on Saturday night and had a really wonderful experience.  We stayed in the Barbican suite which was spacious, luxurious and just what we wanted.  The beds are really comfy and the staff are courteous, polite and professional.  I would definitely recommend this hotel- truly fantastic.",5,2015,03,09
128,Excellent hotel. Friendly staff,"Stayed here over a weekend. Friendly welcome on arrival, check in very slick and actually shown to our room rather than just given directions. Beautiful reception area. Room looked exactly as shown on website, bed extremely comfy.  Rain shower was amazing. Even an umbrella in the wardrobe to use if needed. Found it a good location and value for money. Suggest ring hotel direct for any special deals.  Went to the juggled hare pub just along the road for drinks but then ended up having drinks in the lobby after a night out. The night duty manager Hiral was more than helpful. Wanted to make sure everything we were enjoying our stay and went out of his way to help. Will definitely return.",5,2015,03,08
128,Great bed and lovely room,"Had a super stay, bed was comfy and bathroom lovely. A bottle of wine was delivered to our room in error which we let reception know and they sent to the correct room and let us keep the one in ours. Super. Black out curtains were great for a lie in but it was a little noisy as room not double glazed.",4,2015,03,08
128,Simply outstanding personable staff and a lush fantastic location a+,Simply outstanding I can't ask for more seriously the most personal staff and management trained to the highest standard and deliver a class experience 2nd visit this year and I will be returning again and again regards bobby dew thank you to all of you,5,2015,03,08
128,Our 3 night stay March 2015,"Everything went smoothly.  It was only a few hundred yards from the Barbican underground exit and most of that is undercover.  Check-in was smooth and efficient and we were given a complimentary upgrade as it was our anniversary celebration - very welcome.
Room was well soundproofed, the room temperature thermostat worked so it was not too hot or cold.  Bed very comfortable.  On our first night (Thursday) we went to eat at the Jugged Hare but it had a 2-hour wait (so you need to reserve) so we went just across the road to a quite adequate Bistro.
Because it is a listed building and during renovations they were not allowed to change the internal structure there are quite a lot of 5/5 flight up and down stairs to negotiate when actually trying to move on a horizontal plane.  Even though there are lifts, for people needing zimmers or walking sticks this will be a problem.
Otherwise, recommended for a stay in that part of London.  We walked from there to Leicester Square in 20 minutes!",5,2015,03,08
128,ONE OF THE BEST,"Second time myself and my wife have stayed at this wonderful hotel,were upgraded to a club deluxe room by the polite and courteous staff as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.Room was very good and hotel excellent.The only downside was the breakfast,there was no organisation,the staff did not know what was going on and we were left waiting for what seemed an eternity,will definately be staying here again but we will not be having the breakfast.The club room is a very nice touch and very well set out.",5,2015,03,08
128,Great value for spacious room,"We stayed at Mountcalm due to business reason and was pleasantly surprised. Good value for London, great staff and the room was large and very clean. If you stay there make certain you ask for a room in the back off the main street as the only negative is that rooms in the front are very noisy. ",4,2015,03,08
128,First class hotel,"Extremely good hotel.   A blend of superb quality and great character, with exceptionally attentive staff.  I only used the Jugged Hare for breakfast but again, it couldn't be faulted.  Not the cheapest hotel in London, for obvious reasons, but my Friday night stay was very reasonably priced.  I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel. .",5,2015,03,08
128,VARSITY RUGBY HAC AND FAMILY DINNER,"We went to the HAC to watch a rugby match and decided last minute to stay overnight.  The room was fabulous *club room* staff were excellent - and the restaurant food really very good and extremely well priced.  We had a table for 8 and then went on to the Jugged Hare - all in all a really fun evening and we will be returning.

Special thanks to Costa who checked us out and helped me as I arrived home and realised my phone had been left in the room.  It has been found and kept safe.  Thank you so much.

We will definitely be returning and as it is next door to the Barbican make more of the City at the weekend.",5,2015,03,07
128,Best night sleep in a hotel,"I have stayed half a dozen times and never been disappointed - the bed is the most comfortable I have experienced in a hotel, the staff are always very helpful and the bedrooms are of an excellent quality.",5,2015,03,06
128,Great City of London Location,"I've stayed here a few times on business.  This is a great location with easy walk to most parts of the City.  Wouldn't recommend for tourists.  The building is quite a maze and hard to find your way around.  Also, the rooms vary dramatically in size, with many extremely small.",4,2015,03,05
128,Best hotel in London ,I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday and stayed on the 28th of feb. Although I was feeling pretty ill we decided still to go and so glad we did. We were upgraded to a wow suite and well when we walked in to the room we both went wow. The room was stunning and there are several lovely little touches. The staff are very very good at this hotel and nothing seems to much for them. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay an it made my wife's birthday all the better. Can't wait to rerun to this fabulous hotel and it's the best I've stayed at in this country ,5,2015,03,05
128,Lovely Hotel,The room was very nice and the bathroom was updated and well equipped. Still somehow missing something. That something that keeps it from being a five star in my review. It is a gloriously aged building with spirit and lore. I am afraid that in comparison the staff felt robotic. Although very attentive there was only one gentleman who had any spirit out of the 20 odd we dealt with during our stay. His name began with an A and he showed me to my room. Very personable Italian chap. They should use him as a example when training in the future. The pub downstairs is pretty decent. The breakfast in the restaurant was superb.,4,2015,03,04
128,Disappointed overall,"I tried the Montcalm as a different option to my usual hotels but won't be rushing back unless there's no room at my usuals.

+ hot towel on arrival was welcome.
+ service & information from the concierge was very good on arrival. 
+ breakfast was very pleasant but not a huge choice. Sausages were really good for hotel sausages. 

- had room 151 & it was so small, I felt I was going to be serving breakfast in the morning. 
- expensive room service. Hotel levied a £5 tray charge plus 10% tip on a burger and hit chocolate, making it £30. Far too expensive for average food. 
- my bottled water was not replaced on 2nd night, which is poor attention to detail.",3,2015,03,03
128,Calming nad relaxed,"Great attention to detail. A fabulous experience where every member of staff did everything possible to assist us on a business trip. I will certainly ensure we only ever use the Montcalm in future. The food at the Jugged hare was also very good. 
It is fantastic to see that the art of customer service is very much alive and to be honest this hotel has it perfected.",5,2015,03,03
128,Cozy and central,"My wife and I stayed at this place and really liked the place. The staff was extremely helpful, the rooms were a little small, but really cozy and comfortable. Best part was the location, specially for site seeing. Walking distance from St. Paul's Cathedral, and the Tower of London, and a 5 minute walk from tube stations like the Barbican. Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,03,01
128,Luxurious little mini-break,"Booked a deluxe double room for a birthday weekend in London; on arrival we had been upgraded to a Club room. Big comfortable bed, lovely bathroom with rainfall shower, fruit bowl and bathrobes in room. Everything spick and span. My only gripe - elegant tea cups don't suit left-handers! All in all it was just the luxury stay I wanted for Himself's birthday and just a shame we weren't staying longer. ",5,2015,03,01
128,A very pleasant stay,This was our first visit to The Mountcalm and it was a very pleasant experience.we found the location great as we had tickets for an event at the Barbican.staff were very attentive and the hotel had charm with very comfortable rooms. The shower was a delight ! We would certainly return again,5,2015,02,28
128,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for a single night due to a business trip. Great location, comfy beds, spacious rooms and excellent facilities. The staff were friendly and more than helpful. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,02,27
128,Best hotel I've ever been in.,"Stayed at the Montcalm just before Christmas and the experience was amazing. We arrived very early (8am) which wasn't a problem at all to the staff at the hotel. They took us straight to our room. We were upgraded to one of the club suites? due to it being my birthday.

The rooms are excellent, spotlessly clean and done to a very high standard. The blind in the bathroom which electronically lifts up so you can watch TV whilst in the tub is fantastic. 

The Moorgate Tube station is only 5 mins away and is on a good line so great for exploring.

The staff are excellent and very helpful. 

Would stay here every time i come to London",5,2015,02,27
128,Never disappoints,"I have stayed at this hotel many times & have never had a bad experience. The rooms are always spotless & spacious. Simone & Alia are always very welcoming & helpful, nothing is ever to much. We are always greeted by a smile & happy faces. Manik in bookings is also helpful so if booking I recommend asking for his assistance as he is both knowledgeable & helpful. The club lounge is a great bonus and it's lovely to sit in & enjoy drinks & snacks. We love staying here & it's where we now always stay when in London x",5,2015,02,26
128,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for business, excellent attentive staff, nice rooms, set in an old brewery building, cleverly maintaining some old features, with excellent food in the restaurant. My order of lemon sole and fresh salad was truly excellent, and the chocolate fondant with marmalade ice cream was a joy. Fantastic night's sleep and superb conference facilities mean I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,02,26
128,Excellent,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay. From the minute you check in to the minute you leave the staff are helpful and friendly with nothing too much trouble. Whilst it's a bit difficult finding your way around the hotel the staff are always on hand to assist. The rooms, lounge, breakfast and restaraunt/bar next door are delightful. But the overriding memory for me is the quality of the staff.",5,2015,02,25
128,A Wonderful Experience,"From the moment you enter this hotel you feel that it is going to be a very special experience.  The check in was probably the most attentive I've ever experienced - even given wipes to freshen up.  Because of the nature of the hotel it's a bit difficult to find your way around but that was no problem either as we were escorted to our room by a very friendly member of staff who even explained something of the history of the building.  Décor is beautiful and our room was delightful.  Complementary bottled water, fruit and magazines were all nice additions to the service.  The sleep quality was perfect;  comfortable bed, the softest pillows and sumptuous bed linen.  Also for London it was one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in.  Would highly recommend.",5,2015,02,24
128,Amazing hotel!,"We loved our stay at The Montcalm, the staff are really helpful and friendly and are there for any queries/questions 24/7. Our room was perfect with a comfy bed and a big spacious bathroom. The hotel is conveniently close to the tube station as it was just around the corner. We can't wait to stay again. ",5,2015,02,24
128,Lovely hotel for wedding party,"Our daughter had her wedding here with many of the guests staying in the hotel.  We found the whole experience a very positive one. Bryony was the main point of contact as wedding organiser and she, along with all the staff involved on the day, were pleasant, helpful and supportive. Everyone went out of their way to make the occasion a great success and all the guests commented on the excellent food, accommodation and staff. A great venue for a 'city' wedding!",5,2015,02,24
128,Sheer Luxury,"My partner and I have stayed here a number of times in the last 9 months and have always been looked after and always look forward to returning. Sheer luxury is the best way I can describe the Montcalm at the Brewery.

Rooms are beautiful. Beds luxurious and you don't want to leave. The service is excellent. We have been kindly upgraded many times to the Club and Duplex suites, all of which are a real treat and we simply don't want to leave.

We've yet to eat at the restaurant, but can highly recommend the Jugged Hare for a lovely atmosphere and fantastic service.",5,2015,02,24
128,"Lovely hotel, flawless service","This is a lovely hotel. I booked it because I loved the stylish interiors and its location was good for this particular trip. Terrific staff, couldn't do enough to help me.. I stayed in the West Wing which was a long walk from reception, up and down a few steps at intervals, plus a ride in a lift.. the steps  were not great if carrying luggage. .. but there was an alternative exit directly by lift to the ground floor, for immediate access outside via their own gastro pub, bypassing the lobby entirely, although a pity to miss walking through the gorgeous space with its rather special chandeliers and illuminated marble desks.
They have anticipated every requirement extremely well and choosing from their pillow menu resulted in a fabulously comfortable sleep. In the hope that if enough of us who share similar views express them too, I'm sorry to add that the only aspect I disliked strongly.. I'm sad to say .. were the hanging dead animals in the breakfast room, which is attached to their integral gastro pub.. the clue in the name I realise.. ""The Jugged Hare"". They have a lot of stuffed animal heads on all of the pub walls but in the breakfast room itself, real dead rabbits strung up by their paws .. birds hanging by their necks, albeit long since killed and stuffed .. were revolting. I don't eat animals so hated looking at stuffed dead bodies.. For breakfast on day 1, I chose mushrooms and tomatoes. These were taken from large heated domed dishes divided in 2, with the mushrooms worryingly on one side while bacon was on the other, sharing a dome. On the next day I watched as a member of staff swept bacon into the dish and although she was not careless, I saw bacon fat flick onto the mushrooms... she then re positioned the mushrooms using the same serving tongs she had just used on the bacon. None of this will matter to most people but for those of us who never eat meat and for anyone avoiding bacon/pork products, the bacon fat contamination is truly nauseating, so I then chose a fruit only breakfast, avoiding the hot buffet. I'm sorry to have something negative to say about such a lovely, well run hotel but the breakfast experience was unnerving for anyone who loves animals enough to not eat them. I would certainly stay at a Montcalm again but I would be less keen to risk the breakfast room experience if it's the same.",4,2015,02,23
128,Birthday treat,"My husband booked this hotel for a birthday surprise. Such an amazing hotel.... The room was gorgeous! Breakfast in the pub next door was lovely.... Which you can walk through the hotel to get to. We drank in both adjoining bars... The wine bar was lovely.... Very romantic and the jugged hare on the other side was very authentic and relaxed. 
The only tricky thing about the hotel is the distance from the city centre... But if you want to stay in the business district then this is perfect. It if you don't mind a little walking and changing on the tube. 

All in all a fab hotel ",5,2015,02,23
128,"Fantastic Place, Amazing.","Really nice expierence. On arrival doors held opened and luggage taken and carried by the waiter and given warm hand/face towels. All staff very friendly and warm welcoming. Got upgraded when checked in which was very nice. Arrived in the room which had a big bed with an extremely comfy bed/mattress covers and pillows, Tv on the wall, complimentary wifi, docking station and many other interesting things. The bathroom was very spacious which was spotless with heated flooring and heated towel racks which was pleasant. 

Location - as soon as you come out of the hotel you turn left and it's a 3-4 minute walk to Barbican tube stop which effectively could lead you to anywhere in the centre of london. 

All staff were very helpful especially the duty manager Sanjeev. 

All in all a very statisfying, pleasurable stay and couldn't reccommend it any more. 

Definatley will be staying again!

",5,2015,02,23
128,Lovely stay,"A friend and I booked this hotel for a catch up weekend and after checking in late morning and seeing the room, we made sure to not be late back in the evening so we could enjoy the room. We used Moorgate station and the hotel is less than a 10 min walk up the road, and very easy to find.Check in was easy, and the lady on reception informed us our room had been upgraded! We were shown to our room by a member of staff who carried both our cases for us. We were staying in a room across the road from the reception. We were then shown the facilities in the room - glad we took him up on his offer as we would never have realised the bathroom had a heated floor, which was a lovely find! The bed was so cosy and comfortable, the bathroom was very clean and had lovely Elemis toiletries so we took use of these! 
We went out for the afternoon and upon returning in the evening our bed had been turned down, the curtains drawn and fruit and water left on the table. The room didn't have a view of anything, but we weren't there to stare out the window! Overall, a fabulous hotel at a brilliant price for a Saturday night! The area was very quiet at the weekend but we spent the evening in Covent Garden anyway. The benefit of the area being quiet was a good night's sleep! We will definitely be staying here again. Thank you, Montcalm.",5,2015,02,22
128,"Great hotel, great staff",This hotel has a great feel about. Real character and the you can really see the history of the old brewery in its roots. Very friendly and a seamless staff. Rooms fantastic (we got upgraded on arrival) and lots of mod cons. Great location if you are visiting the City/Brick Lane or indeed the east end markets. Definitely worth a visit! ,5,2015,02,22
128,5 star,"Stayed with 2 business colleagues. Really lovely hotel, service could not have been better. Great meal in the Jugged Hare restaurant. I travel a lot and this hotel was a real treat.  Gym is a little small but I understand this is being addressed.  I will certainly be back next time I am in London.",5,2015,02,22
128,"Montcalm, London City Suites",Thoroughly relaxing stay in this excellent hotel located within walking distance of all means of public transport. The staff were extremely attentive and I couldn't have asked for any more. Will definitely stay there again.,5,2015,02,22
128,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is only 5 minutes to Moorgate (by foot) and 10 minutes to Saint Paul's cathedral. The rooms and reception are beautiful (a 5 star hotel!) and the staff is very courteous. The room has all the comfort you need. 
The hotel has a small building opposite to it with some rooms (the quality is the same as in the main hotel), but if possible, I would ask to have a room in the main hotel.",5,2015,02,22
128,Perfect hotel in the heart of the city.,"We arrived at the hotel (which is a short walk from barbican tube station) and checked in with ease, was upgraded and shown to our room. 
The room itself was lovely, clean and had a lot of amenities to ensure that our stay was a great one! 
It is about a fifteen minute walk to St. Paul's cathedral and has many transport links to get you anywhere swiftly in the city. 
When returning to London I will definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2015,02,22
128,Wow ,"Stayed at the Montcalm with my wife for a rare night away from the kids. We stayed in one of the Wow suites - if you do I challenge you not to say ""wow!"" as you the enter the room. 

A huge 4 poster bed fits well within this converted brewery, but is completed by a modern bathroom, a heated floor gives it a decadent feel. 

The staff were all lovely, we returned from our evening meal to rose petals strewn across the bed which we thought was a nice touch. 

The breakfast is amazing, served in the very nice Jugged Hare next door it's a top quality full English with loads of continental options as well. ",5,2015,02,21
128,Excellent hotel,"Excellent food in restaurant, extremely helpful staff, very comfortable room. The hotel is right next door to the Barbican complex, so just right for going to concerts. The bus stop is just outside and Barbican tube station is a short walk, just as well because car parking could be a nightmare.
Pricey but worth it.",5,2015,02,19
128,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Service, Tiny Bedroom!","Overall The Montcalm is definitely a 5* hotel.

To begin with, however, it was a little misleading to find. We booked through Booking.com, and booked a hotel that was called 'City Suites at The Montcalm'. So when we turned up at the correct address, with a sign not to be seen, our tired minds struggled to find the entrance to the hotel, which is actually called 'The Montcalm at the Brewery London City'. The entrance is tucked away off the main street, so perhaps the name of the hotel should be made clear from the beginning of booking. 

From the minute we stepped into reception, we were treated as 5* guests. The staff were kind and helpful, doing their very best for us, taking our bags to our room, leading the way through the maze of hallways. (Yes it is a very old, but beautiful building. Take note of the way that you are taken to your room, as the test is getting back out again in the morning!) 

The room, the decor and the facilities were excellent. We also ate dinner in The Jugged Hair' the restaurant - which was a delicious and impeccable service. 

Our only problem was the size of our room. I have never stayed in a 4* or 5* hotel in such a tiny room! We were in 409 - so we had a half decent view of The Barbican buildings which was lovely, but the size of the bed (which I guess was a 'normal' double bed) and the manoeuvrability within the room was a let down. It really was a tiny room. There were not enough work surfaces to put our few possessions down on (we were only staying for 2 nights) and the tea making area was too cramped that it was virtually impossible to pour water out of the kettle without making a mess!

However - although the room size was a slight let-down, we appreciate that in London, size comes at a cost, and other than the room size, our stay really was perfect. The TV worked brilliantly, the bathroom and shower was very clean and all in great working order. The room was very quiet and we slept soundly. The hotel location is good - very close to Barbican station, and The Barbican gallery - which we paid a visit to, also.",5,2015,02,18
128,Beautiful Hotel,"I have stayed at the Montcalm a few times now, always for business. The staff are always friendly and make you feel welcomed. The rooms are always clean, tidy and very inviting. Although some rooms are small when you're staying for a night or two it is perfect. The breakfast is amazing and the staff in the restaurant are lovely. Never any noise in the hotel, so it is perfect to unwind after a busy day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,02,18
128,A lovely hotel,This hotel was a Brewery and it got turned into a nice hotel. Breakfast was great and all the services that I used were excellent. The Hotel is located in the Business district and it's about 15 minutes walk to St. Paul's Cathedral.,5,2015,02,17
128,Perfect stay,"Staff professional and friendly, went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as it could be. Really close to tube station. Lovely building. Had the continental buffet breakfast in the club lounge - food and drink was of high quality, varied and plentiful.",5,2015,02,17
128,Luxurious self contained rooms,"A luxurious establishment, helpful friendly staff.  Very comfortable bed and bathroom has a monsoon and power shower.  Not being a local I would recommend using the Barbican as nearest tube and also note reception is opposite side of road.",5,2015,02,17
128,Quirky hotel,"This is not your average London hotel. The setting in an old brewery makes it feel very homely. The staff were helpful. The room was well presented although I did find that once the in room air fresher was off that the room was a little musty. Navigation around the hotel was interesting and I thought that the porter not being able to find the room was odd until I took 15 minutes finding it later that evening...!
The breakfast was good but not really up to the standard of the rest of the hotel.",4,2015,02,17
128,City luxury,"My bf and l stayed at this hotel for one night yesterday as a belated Valentines treat (way cheaper than on 14th!), and we had an amazing stay.  The hotel itself is very plush and with high end finishings, the staff at reception were most helpful and polite but not too stuffy.  It's in a beautiful building that you don't really get to appreciate from the inside but still nice to view the court yard in the morning on our way to breakfast.  The porter also gave us info about the place as he showed us to our room which was a nice touch.  I booked through booking.com with a deal of a club room with breakfast, at check in we discovered we were able to go for free canapes and drinks in the club lounge which was a great added bonus.  After a long travel from Brighton through heavy traffic it was just needed to relax with a glass of wine and some salmon sandwiches.  The room itself was very lavishly decorated with a glass wall partitioning the bathroom off (blind use optional!), ipod docking station and a well stocked tea/coffee tray.  For the price l was miffed that no water or light snacks were supplied free, only available from the mini bar, and a big disappointment was no bath robes. However, the bath was divine and big enough for two (tried and tested!), we refused the turn down service but happily received a card and a little tin of mints.  As the hotel is pretty central to Old Street we found a little Thai place about 10 mins walk away for dinner before returning to make the most of the room. When we got back there was still some crockery in the hall near our room that l'd noticed there when we checked in, for a hotel of this quality l would of thought that should of been dealt with much quicker.  The TV had a fairly poor quality screen but sufficed and the bed just made up for everything else - it felt like being enveloped in heaven.  Both my partner and l had a fantastic sleep, had to drag ourselves out for the hot breakfast in the adjoining pub.  Gave over our room number and there had been some mix up on the paperwork saying we could only have the hotel continental breakfast, however the waiter reassured my protests and sat us anyway, then went to check.  All was well and we ordered Eggs Benedict that my bf couldn't stop raving about.  Sampled the sausages, mushrooms, croissants and pain au chocolat from the buffet area, all of which were equally as delish.  Overall l really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would recommend it/go back myself but perhaps insist on robes and have time to check out the sauna/steam room in the wellness centre!",4,2015,02,16
128,Birthday Treat,"Booked this hotel for my husband's birthday, so glad I did. Had a slight hitch with the booking but it was remedied quickly and we were given a room upgrade (totally unexpected).  All the members of staff that we encountered throughout the weekend were friendly and extremely helpful, professional but not in a 'forced' way. The room was to die for every thing that you could want, clean, spacious and well equipped.  You must eat at the Jugged Hare restaurant food was fabulous but pre book. Personally we  would have liked a residents bar situated within the hotel to be able to have a nightcap before retiring for the night, having said that we cannot wait until we visit the Montcalm again.",5,2015,02,14
128,Unusual rooms and great breakfast,"We stayed one night at the Mont Calm. Really nice room with good facilities and a really comfy bed. Nice bathroom and lovely shower. Took breakfast in the Jugged Hare which was excellent! Good value and great service. As always, the struggled to confirm the company bill back arrangements so if you are using this suggest you take a copy of the email confirmation. ",4,2015,02,12
128,Nice place!,"Stayed at the Montcalm for business after attending an event at The Brewery in the same building. I enjoyed the quirky layout (you will get lost, but in a fun way). The room was excellent and very clean. It was a bit of a challenge to figure out all the light switches but besides that it was all you could wish for. Complementary nespresso in the room was also a nice touch, as is the glass wall from the bathroom looking into the bedroom (there's a blind if you're shy)! 
It's a lot of money for a night but at London levels it was worth it.",5,2015,02,12
128,Nice boutique hotel,The hotel was very trendy and chic. The rooms were decorated nicely and the bathroom was very modern and quite large. The location is quite good. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The only disconfort for me was the insufficiency of the closet. It was extra small and there were no drawers so I had difficulty in keeping my clothes organized. Overall it was a good experience and I will stay there again.,4,2015,02,11
128,Luxury hotel with excellent staff,"On arrival, the porter offered to take our bags immediately and we were given hot towels which was a lovely touch. We had booked a deluxe room but put in a club room which we were really pleased about! We were taken to our room and even given a brief story about the old building which again was nice. The room was gorgeous- big comfortable bed, heated flooring in the bathroom, surround sound and a glass screen between the bathroom and bedroom so you could watch TV from the bath! The turn-down service was perfect, and I felt like royalty throughout the whole stay. The staff couldn't have done enough for us, would definitely recommend and certainly love to come back!",5,2015,02,11
128,great for the City,"The Chiswell St Brewery development which this is part of is very convenient for the City. Service was excellent and staff very obliging. Only niggles were that some trendy architect had decided that one complete wall of the bathroom should be in glass with a pull down blind, except the blind didn't fully come down and the price of breakfast at £26 a head was an expensive add on given that there were lots of good coffee shops nearby where coffee and a croissant were just a fiver. Overall though very good and we'd certainly stay there again.",4,2015,02,11
128,"A gem of a hotel with friendly staff, great rooms and excellent service.","I stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery regularly when on business and when visiting London simply wouldn't stay anywhere else. From the minute you arrive you feel looked after - the friendliness of the staff, the quality of the rooms, room service, sky sports on the TV !, hotel facilities - all excellent. My tiring business trips to London are made just that little but better knowing I am staying at the Montcalm at the Brewery. ",5,2015,02,11
128,Cool hotel with a boutique feel,"Lovely converted brewery with a boutique feel throughout. Located in the city so the area is quieter at weekends but its only a few minutes walk from Moorgate, Old Street or Barbican tubes and 76 bus to waterloo stops right outside. The hotel has a nice pub attached - the jugged hare - which also has a dining room. Great value for money.",5,2015,02,10
128,Perfect for a business trip,I was lost a little bit to find my room but it's an amazing place. the bathroom is just incredible and you have to go with your wife or husband there and without the children :) The breakfeast is great also,5,2015,02,09
128,Exceptional service,"Exceptional service by all of the staff and especially the duty manager, certainly enhanced our stay at the hotel. Well appointed rooms with call the extras you would expect. Located close to either Moorgate or Barbacon stations and also close to bus routes.",5,2015,02,09
128,A very welcoming stay.,"From check in to check out, we couldn't fault it.
We only stayed one night for my birthday in The Montcalm Club room. Access to the Club room was a great addition after a day sightseeing, with lovely nibbles and sandwiches and a nice glass of wine all inclusive of the room rate. 
Full English breakfast was the best we have had whist staying in a hotel in London. 
The staff, from being met by the the door man on arrival and then saying our goodbyes after checkout were very warm and accommodating. 
On getting back to the room after a days sight seeing, a complimentary bottle of Rioja was waiting for me wishing me Happy Birthday. 
To summarise, we would definitely recommend this hotel for not only it's service but the little things that matter.
",5,2015,02,09
128,Excellent service and comfort!!! ,Stayed here for a couples weekend in London. The staff were absolutely superb in every way from check in to concierge service. Very friendly and helpful to our every request. Rooms excellent only slight criticism of rooms is they can be a little too dark but I am nit picking a bit here. ,5,2015,02,09
128,Amazing,"I was lucky enough to to stay here's for New Year's Eve! We stayed here for location and for a treat and that's what it gave us.

The staff are very we'll presented , polite and helpful. They advised us on getting to the Embankment to catch our cruise for the evening. 

The Wow Room was more of a suite with two bathrooms, a TVs room and a very large bedroom. The bed was round and very comfortable. There was an iPad with a great selection of music. You could also order champagne etc if you wanted. 

The bathrooms floors were heated and the main one had a 'magic window ' where the wall would become transparent so you could see through to the bedrooms whilst having a bath or shower. 

Overall, a great hotels. However so it should be for £600 a night (although reasonable good for London at new year I guess).",5,2015,02,09
128,Amazing stay at The Montcalm,"I have just returned from a one night stay at the The Montcalm. The hotel was very easy to locate from Moorgate station (around a 5 min walk). Upon arrival the hotel staff were extremely polite and friendly. We stayed in a double 'club room' and could not fault the room at all. The room was amazing, it was so spacious, comfortable, extremely clean and wonderfully decorated. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, I will certainly be returning. Absolutely 5 star!!!

128,I want to move in,"I've stayed at The Montcalm for the past 2 years and have another visit booked this year. Although the views each time have been a bit...well...I've kept the net curtains closed each time, lets put it that way, the rest of the room is perfect.
The pillows are wonderful, the bed is SO comfy that you won't want to get out of it! 
Staff are friendly, welcoming and can't do enough for you. 
The location is perfect for sightseeing and is walking distance from Liverpool Street station. Lots of restaurants around and the pub on the corner is a MUST visit.
Can't wait to stay again.",5,2015,02,08
128,Very hospitable and convenient,"I chose this hotel for its proximity to Liverpool Street Station and have no regrets. We stayed three nights in a very smart, well-equipped room which, although compact, was fine for our needs. The bathroom was very clean and with welcome underfloor heating! My only gripe about the room was that it was set up for one occupant (one glass, one bottle of complimentary water) which we thought was strange since our booking was for two. The room was quiet which was lovely, even on the Monday morning. We had a bit of a problem with our (lack of) technological expertise which meant our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was on for a day but I cannot fault the way the hotel management dealt with the issue. We will be back",4,2015,02,08
128,WOW!,"Booked into the Mountcalm as we needed to visit London to get visa's for a trip to Russia. It happened to coincide with my husbands birthday so I thought I would book a 5* hotel for a treat.
And it was a treat, we were upgraded to one of the WOW suites by the lovely Megha, and we were throughly spoilt, the staff were all very helpful and friendly, the room was a delight and I will definitely book again next time we are in London.",5,2015,02,08
128,Lovely hotel in the centre of the city,I stayed here for a night with my partner and was amazed at how beautiful the hotel was! The lobby maintains the history of the old brewery with images and plaques on the wall keeping the history alive! We upgraded to the 'wow suite' and it really was 'wow'. The bathroom and four poster bedroom were really impressive! The restaurant unfortunately didn't have a table for us as they were pretty much fully booked however it was just as fun to eat the delicious food at the stools near open kitchen. We received a complimentary wine flight and received good service! We also managed to extend our check out time by 2 hours! I will definitely be staying here again! ,5,2015,02,08
128,"Great location and service, difficult layout","I always stay at the Brewery when I visit London for work, because it's close to my office. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and the rooms are well-appointed (I particularly like the fruit plate, tea, coffee and cookies in the room). My favorites are the duplex suites, but this time I stayed in a club room. Room 224 was designed for those with physical limitations, resulting in a very spacious bathroom and a smaller bedroom. It was fine, but not ideal for me.

I enjoyed the continental breakfast in the lounge each morning (tea or coffee, juice, cold cuts, cheeses, toast, pastries and an excellent yoghurt and granola parfait).  I also had a very nice dinner at the restaurant, the Chiswell Street Dining Room.

The hotel is in a listed building, which means that it cannot be structurally altered. Thus, the hotel is a bit of a warren, and even rooms of the same type differ in size, shape and view. (Make sure to get a hotel plan at Reception when you check in!). The location is good, near the Barbican and Moorgate tube stations, plus banks, restaurants and basic shops (Marks & Spencer, Boots, Tesco, etc).  Of you need to be in the City, this is a solid choice.",4,2015,02,07
128,As friendly as always,"Another marvellous stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery.  Quite the friendliest place to stay.  Everyone at the hotel seems genuinely happy to see you. Hope to be back in June for our wedding anniversary! 
",5,2015,02,06
128,Historic building with lots of character,"We stayed 2 nights and were impressed with the style of this hotel, the rooms having been cleverly designed to make the most of the original features. An example of this is that room 404 has a beautiful brick vaulted ceiling. Unfortunately one or two issues arise from this not being a purpose built hotel - the sound of the next room's TV was heard so loudly in our bathroom, you did not need to turn your own set on! Secondly the sash window is original which sadly meant it is single glazed (traffic noise) and the sash cord is broken so you could not make it stay open (a discarded orange and a room menu on the ledge outside the window indicated that previous occupants had tried and failed to find ways to solve the problem!) We were shown to our room by a porter who was either new or with a poor sense of direction - we walked 3 sides of a square, across a bridge only to eventually find ourselves almost back where we started! We stayed in a room with club access and must say that I thought this to be a beautiful room although perhaps a little small for the number of people using it. Our closest lift took us straight down into the pub! A useful way in and out, easier that finding the main entrance. The room was clean and well maintained and the bed was very comfortable. It is easy to get a taxi from outside the hotel, which is useful as the buses do not stop close by and the tube station is quite a walk away. Sadly for us, as we did like this hotel, it is not in the best of locations for the things we wish to do in a weekend so we will probably not be back.",4,2015,02,05
128,"Great hotel, great location","Second visit after a superb first stay - this Hotel is consistently excellent.  Very friendly and courteous staff, very welcoming reception.  Extremely comfortable bed - well appointed all round.  Breakfast at the Jugged Hare  very enjoyable!  Looking forward to the next stay!",5,2015,02,04
128,Amazing hotel and lovely staff,"The hotel its very stylish and quirky in the same time. 
The attention to the details in the room its extreme. Everything from tea/coffee facilities to bathroom cosmetics was absolutely at the higiest class.
I must say I'm quite fassy customer and I would put the Montcalm in my top 10 hotels in London.",5,2015,02,04
128,"Stylish, a place ""with character""","My husband and I stayed for three nights to attend our daughter's graduation ceremony at Barbican Centre which is located just round the corner. We were pleasantly surprised on entering the premises of ""The Brewery"" - the warm welcome at the reception, the friendly staff, the tastefully furnished rooms, including the breakfast room with the atmosphere of a private dining room/lounge. The only downside was that the bedroom (although defined as a Club - halfsuite) was rather small - two coffee machines but only a very small desk with chair, nowhere to sit down, except on the bed - and a very narrow wardrobe with too little space for clothes. The bathroom, on the other hand, was enormous - the lighting sophisticated!
We also benefited from the excellent dining facilities of the hotel, ""The Jugged Hare"" and the ""Chiswell Street Dining Rooms"" - warmly recommended for their originality and atmosphere!",5,2015,02,03
128,Fantastic - will definately be back,"Stayed here for one night and will definately be back. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The room I stayed in was beautiful with everything you could possibly need for an overnight stay. All the facilities in the room were first class the bed was comfortable, shower was amazing and the tv huge!",5,2015,02,03
128,Beautiful hotel-amazing staff.,"We stayed here for my birthday. The hotel is in an excellent location. Looks beautiful from the outside & even more so once inside. Our room was upgraded to a club suite and everything in the room was immaculate,lots of extras. 
The staff could not have been more helpful especially Sanjeev who organised birthday roses, wine & cake on behalf of my boyfriend. 
I wish we had booked an extra night. Will definitely be returning. 
Thank you Montcalm @ the brewery!",5,2015,02,02
128,Excellent Place,"I would recommend anyone to stay in Montcalm Hotel. The hotel beautiful, the rooms aare warm and clean. Amazing hotel and the staff are very polite and approaching.. Great customer service!!! I will book with again in future!! ",5,2015,02,02
128,Lovely,"We were there for a special ocassion. Couldn't speak highly enough of Alice and Sanjeev, the hotel's managers. The hotel itself had modern rooms that were tastefully lavish and a good size.  We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend. 

We went out to Leicester square in the evening no issues with location of hotel in regards to this. 

Tip if you need an early night I suggest requesting a room away from the hotel's resturant the Jugged Hare when booking. 

Breakfast at the Hare was enjoyable and certainly at the special offer of £15 pp worth it. 

I would have given the service 5* but despite giving notice we wished to use the sauna and steam room neither were set up. It wasn't rocket science so we managed to work it out but would have probably of preferred not to have been waiting for them to heat up! Service at the Hare was abrupt at times. This all felt very minor however due to the high standard of service overall.

We hope to stay again soon! ",5,2015,02,02
128,Love the Montcalm at Brewery,They treat you with the utmost service from the minute you step foot on the property until the time you leave. The hotel is gorgeous and charming. Its a perfect blend of modern and classic. The Club Level suites offer the best amenities for your stay. I highly recommend getting a club level suite if you intend to stay at the Montcalm at Brewery.,5,2015,02,02
128,What an amazing hotel!,This is a gem of a hotel! Tucked in between Moorgate and Barbican its in a wonderful location no matter where you are heading in London. The hotel itself is beautiful - exactly the same as the professional photographs! Amazingly we were ugraded to one of the Wow suites as we were celebrating our 1st Wedding Anniversary which made us feel incredibly spoilt (its customer service like that which means you know you are in a wonderful 5* hotel). The suite was gorgeous!! Really spacious with a four-poster bed. And the bathroom was wonderful designed and spotless - I loved the glass panel separating the bedroom and bathroom (with privacy panel if required). The staff were all wonderfully friendly and made us feel nothing was too small to be asked. I would definitely stay here again regardless of the upgrade - I can't believe I didn't know about this hotel before!!,5,2015,02,02
128,Exquisite!,"Couldn't of asked for a more enjoyable stayed, stayed one night to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. 
The moment we arrived the staff are all extremely friendly and couldn't greet us fast enough. Reception staff (Rubin) was very welcoming and couldn't of done more for us whilst we waited for our room to be ready. He informed us of the wait and got us a tea whilst we waited in the reception. 
Only a couple of minutes past and Rubin shown us to the breakfast room and got us a glass of wine whilst we waited in there, couldn't of asked for better customer service. 
The room was absolutely outstanding and had lovely décor! There was a birthday card in the room for my boyfriend and complimentary breakfast. 
From start to finish the staff couldn't of done more to make the stay anymore enjoyable!",5,2015,02,02
128,Absolutely beautiful!,"Checked out the Montcalm this morning, stayed for the weekend as a treat to celebrate with my boyfriend. Absolutely stunning hotel- exactly what it looks like in the professional photos which makes a change! Bathroom was spotlessly clean- absolutely couldn't fault it and lots of lovely little extras which just made it the 5*- even complimentary cotton buds! Rainfall shower was a first for me and was just lovely- and the bath was so large it could fit two people. Glass wall was a nice touch and just added a bit of individuality- and space- to the room. 

We were upgraded on arrival and stayed in a 'Club suite'- beautiful room with lots of complimentary goodies- had to be very careful as was a little confusing as to what was complimentary and what wasn't- there was no way we could afford the mini bar prices! The only faults I had was that the walk to the room was rather confusing- the reception staff helped us on arrival but after that it was up to us- we even got lost making our way back to reception the first time. Luckily by the time of checking out we had mastered it.

Only downfall was that the double bed was actually two singles put together- which we hand't been told about! However it was so large and comfy that it hardly mattered- however it may have done to some people. TV was wonderful & easy to use. Wifi was brilliant and no issues had with it.

We would have used the spa/sauna area but weren't really told much about it- we didn't know how much it costed or if we could just walk straight in- however I'm sure if we had asked reception they would have assisted us no problem- we were just too shy & were happy enjoying London & the room.

I personally loved the 'turndown' service they offered- in the evening staff come into the room & fold the beds out to be slept in, put on classic FM & placed the next days weather forecast and mints on the pillow. Was a lovely touch that I have never witnessed before.

Would recommend the restaurant Cote to eat at opposite the hotel- wonderful atmosphere.

Finally, I'd suggest wearing something nice to wear to the hotel- my boyfriend & I showed up in typical travelling attire for the underground (Jeans and Hoodies) intending to check in & get dressed up to go out to dinner- were rather surprised (&embarrassed) to see swarms of clients in bow ties & evening gowns milling around- not sure if this is usual or if there was an event on! We were sad we were not invited :)

If we get a deal again we would definitely be back to explore more of London- very close to the station so a wonderful, luxurious base. Thank you so much to the staff at The Montcalm for a very joyous weekend, we both had a fabulous time.",5,2015,02,01
128,Would stay there again...,"Greeted and treated like royalty from the moment we entered the building. An impressive start. We'd booked online only a few hours earlier, and since our details hadn't quite updated in the system yet, complimentary tea or coffee was continually offered while waiting to check in. (Thanks to Asim at the desk for this 5* service).

Building looks great, carpets in the hallways seem new and put a spring in your step to walk on (you'll know what I mean when you walk on them), and the deluxe double room was of a very high standard too. (Huge bathroom with massive bath and cascading shower).

Only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5, is because the internet signal was strong most of the time but did get weak occasionally from our room on the 3rd floor of the East Wing, and we haven't yet eaten at the Montcalm or experienced any additional amenities -- so unable to rate them. (Had booked at through Hotels Combined app as well, whick promised a pool and jacuzzi, but those facilities are only at a sister hotel and not this Montcalm at the Brewery location -- does have a sauna and gym though).

Enjoyable stay though, and intend on returning to discover more.",4,2015,02,01
128,Very nice and elegant hotel!,"I spent two weeks at this property, is a very nice hotel located at a former brewery, the first room I was assigned was almost a cupboard, I would go mad if I had to stay there, the staff was kind enought to assign me a bigger room in a quiet area, but it was still small with no space around the bed, I understand this is a standard for hotels in London, a bigger option was going to be too expensive considering I was already paying over 200 pounds per night. I really enjoyed the free bottles of water and apples that are available everywhere, their international staff is very welcoming, service was great.  The hotel is close to St. Paul's Cathedral and therefore close to many of London touristic attractions, I went during summer a great street market took place just around the corner",4,2015,01,31
128,Can't wait to go back,"We can’t fault this hotel.  It’s spotlessly clean, the staff and genuinely friendly and very efficient.  It’s located right next to the Barbican and a 15 minute walk from Spitalfields and Brick Lane (Sunday markets) which are well worth a visit.
We stayed in the Montcalm Club room and had access to the club lounge (offers complementary snacks and beverages between the hours of 5.30 and 7.30pm).  This room also benefits from a bathroom with a luxurious rain shower and Hermes toiletries.
We had our evening meal and breakfast in the “Jugged Hare” which could not be faulted.  
If you are thinking of staying in the City we can’t recommend this hotel enough.  We have every intention of going back.",5,2015,01,31
128,Bite size of Luxury,"What an absolutely lovely hotel to stay in - if you can afford it. 
 I stayed here for a couple of nights. The rooms are truly lovely but very small with no view. 
The mini bar and food in the hotel are very over priced. 
All rooms and hotel common areas are lovely all the same. Great shower.  Lots of mod cons in the room, comfy big bed. 
Got the room on offer so was worth the price :-) 

Staff did make me feeL a little uneasy as I may not have been the wealthy elite clients that they were used to. Will stay again if we get a deal. 
Great location around the corner from Liverpool station.",4,2015,01,30
128,"Great central location, great luxury hotel.","The Montcalm is a beautiful hotel. I stay here on business often, but would happily take the family (although pricey for a city get away). The staff are consummate professionals. The rooms are well appointed and relatively spacious considering the location. 

The Barbican tube line is only 5 mins walk (with circle line) and Liverpool Street station (which also has Central line and National Rail) is only 15mins walk the other way.

This is one of my favourite places to stay in the city. ",5,2015,01,30
128,"Beautiful hotel, great staff","Very pleased with the Montcalm, close to the Barbican and other City sights.  Fabulous old building, teaming with character and history.  Definitely 5 star staff.  Best hotel bath - long and wide.

On the less good side.  Our room was baking hot, had to resort to AC - in January - and that made it almost bearable at the expense of noise through the night.

Low shower pressure.

Be aware the price advertised for booking directly does not include taxes, you will at best waste  time on their website (taxes added late in the process) or get caught out.",4,2015,01,29
128,The perfect honeymoon!,We have recently returned from a 3 night honeymoon stay at the brewery. It was perfect and just what we desired. A beautiful hotel with excellent staff in the heart of the city. Thank you so much to everyone at the brewery for making our trip truly memorable.,5,2015,01,28
128,Some small problems professionally dealt with,"We found this to be an excellent hotel with friendly helpful staff and good amenities.  The adjoining pub/restaurant served delicious food and beverages.

Unfortunately we did encounter some problems with the room; 

The toilet continued to run at one point after flushing, but a maintenance man came and fixed it quite quickly.
The 'aroma box' in the room didn't work at all, the bathrobes weren't in the room and the 'please make up my room' light outside our door wouldn't switch off.

However, we have to conclude that the message about the light, while not rectified, was passed on to the maid service did not disturb us.

Though you would not expect these problems with a 5 star hotel, importantly, at check out, the Duty Manager, a Mr Basnet, took care of us and was most helpful and generous.

We will certainly give this hotel another try.",4,2015,01,28
128,Superb place to stay,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location. Staff very helpful, professional & friendly.
Room was beautifully decorated and spotless.
Excellent room service.
My wife & I will most definitely stay here again when we visit London.",5,2015,01,27
128,Amazing value for 5* service,"Booked via booking.com and called to see if I could get a better price booking direct which I did. For a luxury hotel the atmosphere was warm, friendly and relaxed. The staff were attentive but not over the top. Facilities were great. Definitely going to stay there again. ",5,2015,01,27
128,Pleasant surprise,"This is a perfect location for the City of London. The hotel seems to connect a number of different buildings, even across an archway. So it has an individual feel with real professional flair. To find such excellent and personal service in this central location was a pleasant surprise. Staff really couldn't do enough to help and everybody was smiley and service-focused. The Jugged Hare was a quirky place for breakfast (full breakfasts only - otherwise it's served in a smaller room) and not the place for anyone squeamish about hanging pheasant. It's a one minute walk to The Brewery, so couldn't be better if you're attending an event there. Bathrooms would benefit from a few more surfaces, especially round the cool sink. But a very comfortable and restful stay in the City.",5,2015,01,27
128,Well looked after at The Montcalm,"We stayed two nights while my wife underwent treatment at a nearby hospital. The hotel staff were - without exception - friendly, very efficient and caring. My compliments to Alice, the manager, on her superb team. We also thoroughly enjoyed our first class breakfasts and dinner. The club lounge is a great bonus. ",5,2015,01,27
128,A Boutique 'W Hotel',"Beautiful Hotel in a great location. The rooms are very small but that didn't bother me as I don't spend much time in the room.

The bed in the room is soo comfortable, pillows and sheets soft leading to an amazing nights sleep!

The location is great in city center. I needed to be in the wharf and bishops gate which were easily accessible.

The hotel is very posh with great staff. I highly recommend this boutique hotel to anyone on business or pleasure!",5,2015,01,27
128,Take your business elsewhere,"For a hotel based in the heart of London's business area, its policies for dealing with business customers is truly remarkable. If you're travelling for business you should quickly find somewhere else to stay! The hotel is OK in itself, but really not worth the hassle of booking. The short version of my story: It took at least 4 emails, about 6 phone calls (lost count) and 4 credit cards  to secure the reservation! (And 30 minutes to check in). The credit cards I presented, all valid and with plenty of liquidity, were rejected by the hotel on _3_ occasions _without_ the hotel notifying me! It is simply luck that prevented me from showing up late at night to find my reservation having been cancelled! The hotel's routines for 3rd party consent is extreme, and if you're concerned about sharing sensitive information about yourself or your company, you must book elsewhere! 
So, why didn't I simply take my business elsewhere? I'll get to that, eventually. Here is the long story of what happened:
I booked a room for myself and my colleague for one night through the hotel's website. To secure the rates, I had to make an advance payment and used my credit card. I received automated messages to confirm the reservation and to welcome me to the hotel. All well. My colleague then emailed the hotel in order to try to extend her own reservation and to add another colleague to the booking. She was then notified that the original reservation had been cancelled as my card had been rejected. No one from the hotel ever told me my card was rejected!  My colleague alerted me to the problem. As she had wanted to change the booking and thus increase the costs, I decided I no longer should use my own card, and called the hotel to use my company's credit card. I was then informed a 3rd party consent form was required as the card holder would not be staying, but not only that; in addition the hotel required a legible photo copy of the card to be used, front and back, a copy of the card holder's photo-id and the card-holder's signature. I'm uneasy about providing such sensitive, and complete, information by email but the card holder said OK, so I went along with it (the hotel is conveniently located and looked really nice on the website). I never received the confirmation email I had been expecting, so sent an email to the hotel again. I was then told the 3rd party consent request had been rejected as the signatures on the card and the card-holder's passport did not match. The card holder then intervened and wrote to the hotel, explaining the discrepancy and confirmed that it was OK to use the card. Nothing happened. I called the hotel again, was promised a response, no response came, I called again and was told the request from the card holder was still rejected as the signatures didn't match. Now, I understand the need to be cautious to avoid fraud, but when booking a 3rd party reservation, you're asked not only to provide all the information listed above, but also the contact details for the card holder and of the organisation you represent. The card holder was never contacted, and a quick search on the organisations website would have identified the card holder, myself and the other guests easily. The risk of accepting the card holders explanation of the problem with the signatures seems very small... At this point, I really should have taken my business elsewhere, but knowing that the hotel sat on the complete (and fully usable) details for making the charge of the 'non-refundable' reservation to the business credit card, I simply couldn't take the risk that they wouldn't exercise their 'right' and charge us regardless at a no-show. So I persisted. I called the hotel again and provided details of my personal card again (with the technical issues causing the initial rejection fixed). I then received a confirmation email, upon request, that all was OK. Apparently it was not. And, again I was not told! Moreover, the card had been _accepted_ for two of the rooms, but rejected for the third. This makes no sense! I have also checked with my bank which confirms there are no reasons as far as the bank or my account is concerned for why this third transaction should not go through. How did I find out what had happened? When I asked upon arrival! I presented my card again in person: rejected. My husband (who was not a part of the business group) tried his card; rejected. Finally, as luck had it, I had brought a third card for an account we rarely use, and this was accepted. Phew! My colleague would have a room when he would arrive the next day (after I would have checked out). Now, you think it is all over, but no. Despite me being there in person, paying with a debit card, I still needed to complete extensive 3rd part consent forms for  both of my colleagues and allow a photocopy of my card and passport. Why? I'm paying there and then, in person, with a debit card?? It shouldn't matter to the hotel who payed for these rooms as long as they know they got their money, which they knew they had given the debit card. 30 long minutes later I could finally go up to my room. Having seen my frustration, the reception did have a bottle of vine sent to my room. They should have sent a bottle of something much stronger. I needed it. Coloured by all this I can hardly give balanced review of the hotel itself, but the facilities were OK, the staff polite, but the charm I had hoped for in the old brewery was not there. It was in fact quite 'corporate', so disappointing on that front as well. I never thought I would write an 'awful' review on Tripadvisor, but there you go, nothing else would do..",1,2015,01,27
128,Excellent and so close to the Barbican,"We expected the rooms to be good - the staff, however, were simply superb.  We were having a rare child-free weekend of culture visiting the Barbican.  The hotel's proximity to the Barbican is a real bonus (from bedroom to theatre seat in under 7 minutes!)  The real crowning glory, even when taking the previous comments into account, together with the food, enormous bed, fabulous smellies, stunning bathroom, was the level of service.  On realising we were ""off the leash"" the staff sent us a complimentary bottle of wine - and the service continued all weekend. I just wish we were going back soon.  My only reluctance to write this review is that it gives more people knowledge of our very own recently discovered secret.",5,2015,01,26
128,Very convenient for the financial centre,"You can't really judge a hotel on a one night stay. This was the last leg before heading out to Heathrow and the hotel was chosen on the basis of ease of access to meeting friends for lunch in the Financial district, getting to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express and cost. Full marks on all counts. The room was small but totally adequate for my single needs, it is nicely furnished and clean and had all the things I needed for one night. The hotel does try to give a five star impression when you arrive, helpful doorman in nice uniform, attractive lobby area helpful concierge who takes you and  baggage to your room. Check in was a bit over bearing since everything was already done on the Internet, I felt like I was making a new booking. As from previous comments the hotel is a bit of a rabbits warren but really if you can't find your way to your room what chance do you have finding your way around London. And yes there are an awful lot of light switches in the room but it only took a minute or two to work out which turned what on and off. I didn't eat at the hotel as I thought breakfast was too expensive and you can eat just as well for  half that or less around that area. I ate near Leadenhall Market which for Harry Potter fans is the area they used for Diagon Alley in the first film. For tourists there is a lot of history within walking distance and getting to the West End isn't that hard. 

There was no view to speak of but I wasn't bothered by that, who sits or stands staring out of the window in the middle of a city unless you are 30 floors up?! And the street noise was barely audible. 

As I first mentioned I like this hotel as it is more comfortable than some of the alternatives, Travelodge, Premier Inn and totally adequate for what I needed. Could I stay there more than a few nights, only if I got a bigger room, is it 5 star, I don't think so more around the 4 mark.",4,2015,01,26
128,Great hotel and highly recommended.,"Really great stay and couldn't of asked more of the helpful staff. Great food and room really good value for money. I would highly advise giving The montcalm a visit when looking for somewhere to stay in London. 

",5,2015,01,25
128,"Lovely, like the movies","It's like stepping back in time when someone in a top hat beckons you across the street to take your bag and announce you to the staff.  Non-stop superb service from start to finish. I was staying for work for one night.  I found it hard to find but then mr Top Hat shouted at me and all was well.  Got a hot towel at reception too.  Which was odd, but a nice touch.  
The hotel overall is beautifully done, my room was very good, but surprised to find the maid had been in while i was out for dinner.  The room was just about big enough to be comfortable and the general ambience more than made up for it.  The in room entertainment was excellent too.",5,2015,01,25
128,Fussy and overly complicated,"What I like about the Montcalm:
- Great locaion (at least for me)
- very quiet (most rooms, although some have no double glazing)
- Occasional upgrade with a free bottle of wine (a 750ml one!)
- Toilettries

What troubles me:
- Way too many questions and so much false friendliness at reception.  I just want to check in and move on, not make friends.
- I can find my room on my own.  I feel like a right knob being led to my room every time I stay
- It is like a rabbit warren.  That gives it some charm, but can be frustrating
- Way too many complicated lights in the rooms.  I have been in rooms where I have not been able to find a switch to turn a light off and had to remove the bulb!
- Air con is random.  Have stayed several times and at least three times I needed to call to get it reset because it was not working
- Rooms are very variable.  Due to it not being built as a hotel there are some pretty odd ones.  On the positive side you get the odd gem.
- Very little choice for dining in the area",3,2015,01,24
128,"Hope to return, great place.","Had a fantastic stay at this hotel during the week due to work taking me to London. Very easy to find, conveniently near Moorgate tube station - is also near Barbican on the other side of Chiswell Street. The hotel is essentially split into two buildings - one that has the reception area, the club room where breakfast takes place and accommodation, the other on the opposite side of the road where there are several ""suite"" rooms. 

On arrival I couldn't have been greeted any friendlier - very cheery, helpful staff to check you in, take you to your room and just generally greet you. A big thank you to them all! 

The room I was in was 609 - one of the suites. Very nice interior, relaxing and comforting. Bathroom and shower facility was excellent - heated floors being a very nice touch and little Hermes washing and shampooing products to keep you fresh. The tea is very nice - proper leaves in a little wire bag to add hot water to - there was even hot chocolate as an option. The bed was super comfy, I had a great nights sleep. TV had a great collection of channels, including all the Sky Sports options and several non UK channels for overseas visitors. 

On check out all was very smooth and a genuinely warming goodbye. I hope to return in a few weeks!",5,2015,01,24
128,Amazing hotel - A very special treat!,"A totally luxurious experience! The hotel is absolutely spotless with beautiful interiors, and we were given 5 star treatment from the moment we arrived. The staff were courteous and friendly and couldn't have done more for us. The location is very quiet at the weekend but ideal if you want to get away from the hectic hustle and bustle of central London. Having said that, you can access the heart of the city in minutes via tube. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2015,01,22
128,Its OK. Service is good Hotel has some little issues,"Stayed here for the week on business. 
The staff are attentive and very  welcoming and the hotel clean and nice. 

There are just some ""if I knew I would haves "" that would have made the stay better

The hotel is like Narnia, corridors and stairs lead to all sorts of places so its easy to get lost. The welcome does take you to your room - which you need so it takes a while to get your bearings and if you have any disability then do let them know in advance. 

My room, 152 was on the first floor and really needs double glazing (apparently planned to happen) as the bathroom is uber drafty/cold but more of an issue is a  external door downstairs that slams when people use it which did happen throughout the night so sleep was broken at best. I managed Ok but it does need to be addressed .

The bar / restaurant / pub - the jugged hare - is nice but on arrival is not an easy place too get a drink and definitely not a place for a quiet drink or chat with colleagues as its VERY busy as VERY noisy. Booking is needed to eat at the restaurant there (and at the Brasserie across the road) so do plan in advance. 

Room preparation was mixed. ""complementary papers"" only arrived on the last day of my stay, biscuits and evening mints were inconsistent in their provision and there was no obvious way to NOT have towels changed each day (and save the planet)  or if there was it wasn't being actioned.

All in all the stay was good (better than average) but short of what it could be. .",4,2015,01,20
128,Oasis of calm,Perfect short break as a birthday treat for my wife. The staff were excellent and the room was surprisingly quiet given the hotel's situation. So good that she is returning the favour for my birthday - I hope!,5,2015,01,20
128,1 night stay for business,"Very convenient for meetings in the Barbarian/London wall area. Room was nice and service top notch. My room on the 1st floor got a little bit of street noise, but it was Friday night so busier out than usual.",4,2015,01,20
128,Staff go out of their way,"We have now stayed at The Montcalm for four nights and the staff have gone out of their way to make up from an initial hiccup, we would recommend this hotel to anyone, and the staff have really done everything to make our stay as smooth as possible.

Coming home from the theatre to find rose petals across the bed was a beautiful touch, and book-ended our stay here in London nicely.",5,2015,01,19
128,Consistent after Time,"I've not stayed in the Montcalm at the Brewery for sometime due to work committments taking me elsewhere.   I'm pleased to say it's not changed, if anything it has improved.  A warm welcome from the front office staff who remembered me from previous stays.   A great night's sleep in a very comfortable bed.   I stayed in the South Wing this time which takes time to get to but probably the quietest room I've every slept in on my travels.",5,2015,01,19
128,Wonderful weekend stay,"Thank you to the staff here for making my Mothers Birthday weekend so very special.

I booked two rooms - a Club and a Montcalm Club and informed on the booking that we were in London for my Mothers 60th.

The hotel manager greeted us at check-in to wish Happy Birthday and promptly upgraded their room to a WOW Suite (very, very nice) and then arranged for a cake and bottle of champagne to be delivered to the room - a really nice and unexpected surprise and highly appreciated.

Generally, nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the hotel is in a great location (next to the Barbican - parked overnight for £16).  Rooms were very good - our Club Room was to a high spec and spacious and the WOW Suite was much larger with a great bathroom and plenty of space.  Breakfast was included (at the Jugged Hare) and was very good - a self service hot buffet with items that you can order and a continental selection too, all very nice.

Would certainly recommend if you are in London on business or down for a weekend and want to stay somewhere that is just a few minutes away from the noise / traffic.  Will certainly be back and am very grateful to the hotel for making my Mothers Birthday weekend so special.",5,2015,01,19
128,Amazing Service!!!,"We were staying for one night while visiting friends, thought we would treat ourselves to a nice hotel!! When we arrived the manager realised it was my birthday and kindly upgraded us to a deluxe suite.... Legend! Made my birthday weekend away! All the staff were extrely friendly and helpful, the hotel is beautiful and the restaurant was stunning. We didn't have dinner as we were tired from sightseeing all day, but the breakfast was the best eggs I've ever had!!! Thanks for making my birthday one to remember!!!",5,2015,01,19
128,Stay after function,"From the minute you arrive you are well looked after, the attention to detail and customer service is fantastic. Plenty of people on hand to help. Rooms are spacious and well designed. Lovely little extras in the room.

Great price, would definitely return.",5,2015,01,18
128,Quite simply excellent,"Wow what a hotel , very attentive staff great rooms and facilities, the jugged hare pub is superb , will definately recommend and most certainly will be staying again . One of the best value stays in London ",5,2015,01,18
128,London Hotel in Financial District,"This hotel is in London City, the Financial District.  Very close to my meetings.  Easy walking distance.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Many restaurants in the area.  Close to 2 tube stations.  On a bus route, and many black cabs go by.",5,2015,01,18
128,Excellent stay near the Barbican,"Excellent service and very nice staff at this hotel and the available restaurant e.g. the jugged hare. 

For the 40th birthday of my fiancée they arranged a small bottle of wine and a card to be brought to our room.

Very stylish, luxurious and modern rooms with parts of the old brewery structures integrated in the room design. Sure well worth the money while staying in the Barbican area.",5,2015,01,18
128,Thank you Sanjeev,"After a slight disappointment with the room being a little smaller than I had expected and it had Elemis toiletries instead of the expected Hermes. Sanjeev the duty manager gave us his personal attention and moved us to a Montcalm club room which was great. 
We had complimentary wine as it was husbands birthday and a personalised birthday card from Sanjeev.
The bed and pillows were so comfortable it was like sleeping on a huge marshmallow. I chose the ladies delight from the pillow selection and it was superb. Everything about the room was first class, little touches like a snake reading light at each side of the bed, every conceivable plug socket, modem, usb port the lot. A Nespresso  machine as well as the usual tea and coffee making stuff.
I could go on about the room but there is much more to tell, everyone was so attentive and friendly, the concierge Irvlat (I'm so sorry if I mispelt his name) was very helpful in getting us tickets to a show, we had come without booking and it was Saturday night so no surprises that many shows had sold out. Irvlat did his best and as a result we had a great and scary time at The Woman in Black.
We had access to the club lounge and had continental breakfast in there each morning, however the best bit about the lounge is that between 17.30 and 19.30 they serve finger sandwiches, canapés, nuts, crisps wine, spirits, beer etc and it's all included in the price of the room. Definitely not to be missed.
During the rest of the day the lounge offers soft drinks and other refreshments.
I will definitely return to The Montcalm and Sanjeev certainly made it special for us. Thank you Sanjeev.",5,2015,01,18
128,I've had two very good stays at the Montcalm recently,"I stayed at the Montcalm prior to Christmas 2014 on business and was so impressed I returned with my wife the following month for a long weekend Birthday trip.

The rooms are well designed and comfortable (though a little short on draw/closet space) but the overall impression that I left with on both occasions was of really great service. I don't mean obsequious, pretentious service but really friendly, professional and efficient service.  

The location is great for Barbican tube station (from my hotel room to a meeting in Piccadilly in 25 minutes was pretty impressive). Then from the hotel to Heathrow in 60 minutes (via the Heathrow Express/Paddington). 

The hotel has two F&B properties connected to it (a bar/restaurant and a pub/restaurant, the latter is decent to quite good, the former I have yet to try). 

I'd happily stay here again.",4,2015,01,17
128,My favorite hotel in London City!,"The Montcalm at the Brewery is my first choice hotel any time I visit London city. It is very clean. It has a warm, modern atmosphere thanks to some of the historic features of the building that were preserved.",5,2015,01,17
128,Jugged Hare a must.,"Really excellent welcome at reception. The hotel is a bit of a maze, but as the former Whitbread brewery the courtyard is an excellent example ot turn of the century architecture. We ventured to have a quick admiring glance at the marvellous square behind reception only to be confronted by a jobs worth with a bowler hat telling us it was 'private property"". Clearly our eyeballs were offending him.
The pub/restaurant the Jugged Hare is well worth a try. Well priced wine list - noticed that the Chateau Musar was a similar price to the amount we paid to,a retailer several weeks ago. Service was attentive but not overbearing. Excellent herring roe starter and tender steak -wonderful.",4,2015,01,15
128,"""The only place to stay""","Only our second stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery, but what a wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable experience. We both wished we could have stayed longer and from now on will always want to return here when in London. From the moment of arrival through to the time of our departure, everything and everyone made our visit absolutely perfect. The hotel, apart from being in a great location, is a very elegant and interesting building. Also, all the staff were extremely helpful and particularly good at ensuring we were made to feel welcome throughout the stay. The duplex room we were in was well furnished and amazingly comfortable, making it the perfect place to chill and relax.",5,2015,01,13
128,A taste of luxury!,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Montcalm. We did book a twin and arrived to find a double but this was rectified very quickly. The bed was comfy and the room was very well designed. An added bonus were the complimentary canapés and drinks offered if you had booked a club room. The ambiance of the lounge room was totally relaxing and all the staff were attentive and helpful. Would love to return again.,4,2015,01,11
128,Great staff and wonderful service,We stayed at the Montcalm for our wedding anniversary and the staff were fantastic - the hotel is wonderful and good value. When the staff new we were celebrating our anniversary we were upgraded to a suite and given a complimentary bottle of wine - the Jugged Hare pub attached to the hotel is very good ,5,2015,01,11
128,Elegant luxury,"The Brewery does elegance and luxury very well. This was a charming experience. Service, atmosphere were both first class. The hotel is well situated if you're coming in from the City airport as it is close enough to Bank to walk it.",5,2015,01,11
128,Nice + Comfy but they forgot my birthday :(,"Pros:
+Clean + pristine - felt new
+Comfortable
+Contemporary and Modern
+Friendly and very helpful staff
+Great decor + pretty property
+Waterfall shower + handle option
+Convenient restaurants and markets nearby

Cons:
-I had contacted the hotel to say my stay was for my birthday and requested recommendations for nearby restaurants and clubs. It looks like other travelers got treats for their birthday stays. Maybe this is random but I felt left out.
-Drain was broken so the tub was flooded
- My room was a bit smaller than I expected. Since it was a short stay, I didn't mind the slight claustrophobia.

Overall it is a great property and I would still come back or recommend it. However, I decided to book my stay in London next weekend at a different property.
",4,2015,01,10
128,Average,"Public spaces are very nice and well equiped. Hotel rooms are very nice and well designed, all the luxury you can ask for. The point is this hotel is a very confusing, you need like internal GPS to find your way in the hotel. The pub/restaurant is very good.",3,2015,01,09
128,A tremendous hotel,"My client had failed to book me in.  However, reception were only too pleased to sort maters out and even gave me an upgraded room so my Montcalm introductory experience was great!

The staff were very friendly and always used my name which was impressive!  The room was superb and attention to detail second to none. The 'luxury level' was high and the room had central heating that actually worked...as did the wifi!

I am thinking about bringing my wife to the Montcalm for a weekend in London on our wedding anniversary (I liked it so much!)",5,2015,01,09
128,Fantastic Weekend Stay,"I stayed 1 night here at the weekend for my finance's birthday. When we arrived we were upgraded for free to the Duplex Suite. Great start!

Thoughout our stay all the staff were very nice and helpful, and also had a sense of humour! Unlike most hotel staff nowadays!

The executive lounge is one of the best aspects of the Montcalm. Great selection of snacks and premium beers and spirits in the evening, and breakfast is delicious in there! I kept going back for more.

Only things stopping me from giving 5 stars is the hotel restaurant, which is on the corner of the main building. The menu is very 'game' focussed and the drinks are even more expensive than usual London prices.

Overall a wonderful stay made better by the lovely staff.",4,2015,01,08
128,A 5 star hotel with 5* staff & service,"A superb hotel in a unique building manned by wonderful staff who go out of there way to make your stay the best it can possibly be.
It's a pleasure to stay here whether on business or pleasure. I would highly recommend this venue.",5,2015,01,08
128,I will repeat,"I was staying at the hotel in late December 2014, the hotel is a wonderful architecture in an old building in central London. It is the first time I stay in this hotel and surely I'd stay in the hotel, in my opinion the hotel is good they offer a warm upon arrival washcloth, but should be complicated mejos, with hallways where you get lost, you need a map to get to your room, the reception staff are very friendly and respectful, Ciara to the reception treated me very well and was very kind to me, the check in was very fast, the concierge helped me carry our bags, (weighing a little) David was helping me find a restaurant for dinner with my partner, was very friendly and I met very quickly. The truth is that it is a 5 *. I was also having dinner at the Jaget Hare, the waiter was very attentive, fast and friendly. The hotel is not well connected to the airport but hey, are near the Barbican station.",5,2015,01,08
128,Exceeded Expectation,"I booked this hotel because of it's close proximity to the Barbican Theatre. knowing nothing about it except what I read on line.

From the moment we arrived we were treated with kindness and courtesy.  My eighty seven years old husband has limited mobility and we were quickly shown to a room with disabled facilities.  The bathroom was beautiful easily accessible but without the clinical appearance one usually finds. Although we only stayed one night we felt we had had a lovely break. Never again will we make the journey home late at night after a play or concert.
Thank you to all the staff at the Montcalm.",5,2015,01,08
128,Excellent hotel,"The service at the Montcalm is second to none - it is consistently excellent.  The staff are very attentive and nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are modern, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  

I have stayed in a number of hotels in London, but in my opinion the Montcalm is by far the best and is my preferred hotel when in London on business.",5,2015,01,07
128,Exceptional service,"Myself and my family stayed at the hotel for 3 nights over new year including New Years eve. The staff were outstanding nothing was too much trouble and the manager Megha made our stay so special . The rooms were very well appointed with fabulous amenities , very clean with great house keeping . I didn't use the gym but my son and husband did and it was good . We had breakfast in the jugged hare which was great and we also ate there on New Years eve which was superb all the staff are a credit to the hotel and we will definitely be staying there on our next trip to London .",5,2015,01,07
128,Perfect Hotel,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for a short city break and we couldn't be happier with the hotel and the staff! 

They were all very friendly and helpful. We were escorted to our room and given a demonstration of the features in the room and what was available. 

As we were unfamiliar with the area we spoke to reception to ask for advice on where to eat, they were very informed and even reserved a table for us and offered to flag down a taxi for us!

As a nice touch, my phone charger broke during the journey and they sent one up to the room for me to use during the duration of our stay. 

My girlfriend and I would thoroughly recommend this as a place to stay! It's pricy, but for such a great hotel in one of the most vibrant cities in the world, you really can't complain! 

You get exactly what you pay for, a top quality hotel!",5,2015,01,06
128,Still my favourite,"Yet again we had another wonderful stay. As a guest who continues to return I don't think you would be disappointed if you visited here. I advise speaking to Mandeep in bookings who is very knowledgable and goes out of his way to make sure your stay is perfect. It was lovely to catch up with Megha (one of the managers) who always takes time to come out and greet us. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. The club lounge is an absolute gem and a must for hotel guests. This hotel is a firm favourite of ours and we wouldn't stay anywhere else. I would choose this over the Mayfair hotel anyday. Proffessional, helpful staff who go the extra mile. Great rooms and just a great place to be when in London. We shall as always be back again. Also be sure to go to the jugged hare for breakfast, it's lovely and again the staff were very helpful.",5,2015,01,05
128,First class!,"Well I decided to treat my girlfriend to a couple of days away in London and looked for the best hotel, for price and location the Montcalm was perfect. 
Situated within 5mins walk from the nearest tube it was very easy to find. Upon arrival we realised that this was no ordinary hotel, the building was amazing to look at, we walked in and were greeted by reception staff, very friendly and keen to help us check in smoothly, arrived earlier than check in time, around 3hrs early!! but that was no problem. Our baggage was taken from us and handed over a map for our room! A map for a hotel room, we were in for a treat! 
A friendly bellhop(a very courteous gentlemen) took us to our room, it was a lovely room, a little smaller than we expected but nonetheless a great room. Very clean, contemporary and classy.
Slept extremely well and the next day we left very happy customers and we hope to return again this summer! Thank you for the excellent customer service! Highly recommend this place :)
 ",5,2015,01,04
128,Not up to the hype!,"We were really looking forward to staying at this hotel. It looked exciting and historic, had a 'club' option that came with a 'happy hour' of drinks and snacks, and for the price we expected something quite grand. All went well checking in. We were taken to our room, and found that the sleeping area was accessible, only by quite steep stairs, as a 'loft' . Not what you need after treading the tiles in London for a day. The room was hot at night and there was no explanation as to how the system worked. We eventually found out that the temperature was controlled from the loft level, not the main floor where there was also an a/c looking panel. As for the club stuff...we went along to the room where it all was supposed to be and were very disappointed. The food ran out within 1/2 an hour, and was not replenished. To our astonishment some people were visiting the room, loading up plates and then leaving, probably to go back to their rooms to eat and drink. We noticed that one couple made several such sorties while there was food, and never was anything said. The hotel staff were mute about this. There was a complete absence of any notion of providing for guests who didn't come at 'opening time.' Not good!  It would have taken nothing to replenish the finger foods that were supposed to be there...they certainly weren't gourmet in my view. A waste of money for us.

Anyway, the time came for dinner...it was a Saturday so we went to the Jugged Hare which is supposedly the Montcalm's gastro pub and were told that there were no places until 10PM...fair enough, we should've thought of that. What was amazing was that we were recommended, by the person doing the seating on the door at the Jugged Hare, to try the Chiswell, at the other end of the hotel. ""Ok"" we thought, we'll try it and see. So along we go, and the Chiswell is not open on Saturdays. So why were we asked to try it in the first place? This is inexplicable. The concierge at the hotel was no help to us in solving the 'where to eat' dilemma we now faced. I don't expect such 'assistance' from a hotel promoting itself as this one does. We only stayed one night. We won't be back to stay there.",2,2015,01,04
128,Wake up in my dream hotel!,I stayed at the Montcalm London City for four days before Christmas with my son and was one amazing experience for me since my arrive! The welcome was very warm with a nice doorman and towels offered from the receptionist staff. I had some problem with my English but Chiara (one of receptionist team) helps me and we spoke in Spanish. Was nice saw how warm and genuine was the welcome from her and is not easy find this in everyone! She show us the way to the jugget hare and gave us some informations about London in the meantime and my son was happy because she send us to winter wonderland! The hotel is a very wonderful place like a paradise and the staff is properly trained. I will recommend this experience to everyone and hope to come again in the future! Thank you to all the staff,5,2015,01,04
128,Good Value 5 Star Hotel for Weekends in London,"This was my second stay at the Montcalm. On both occasions at the weekend and with my wife. On both visits we have been lucky enough to get special rates that include the use of the Club facilities. On this visit we were also given an upgrade, as were our friends. 

The staff are always welcoming and very professional. Their advice with regard to local restaurants has always been good too. The rooms very clean and are a good size, the beds are comfortable and the facilities everything you might want. There is also a wellness centre at the hotel but I have not tried it yet.

Breakfasts are very good and everything is fresh. You can have a buffet breakfast in the Club Lounge or head to the pub on the corner for a larger choice and a cooked breakfast. It might be possible to get to the pub without going outside, but if you can, I don't know how. It has not been a problem but I could understand if some people found it awkward.

The Club Lounge has a finger buffet in the evening and you can help yourself to drinks (house wines etc) up until 11ish. Which is good value. There is a further bar and within the hotel but it does not appear to open at the weekends. The location of the hotel makes that understandable as I think it mainly caters for people working in the City.

Although it cost about £6 pounds by Taxi to get to the centre of town, the saving over other 5 star hotels in the centre makes that worth while. There are lots of good places to eat nearby, the Barbican Centre next door, a tube station 500 yards down the road, St Paul's a 15 min walk, along with the nearby shopping centre, which has a busy bar on the roof with excellent views over London. I would also recommend a visit to the Museum of London, about 10 minutes walk away. It's well laid out and very interesting.

On both occasions we have used Hawksmoor for dinner and their steaks are first class. We also visited the L'Anima in Snowden Street, Broadgate West, EC2A 2DQ, which is within walking distance and was very good too.

I like this hotel and will use it again.

PS: we went to see the Curious Incident of Dog in the Night Time. It was superb and well worth watching.",5,2015,01,04
128,Dream hotel,I booked for a double room but the bath tub was not working so they up grade me to WOW suite. It was a mazing suite! U can see the bath tub from the bedroom!it was seperated by a glass ! There was ipod player and u can adjust tge music from the bathroom! The bed was royal bed! Beautiful! The staff were proffissional and provide amazing service! The food was delicious. I enjoyed my 2 nights stay and will  recommend it to my friends.,5,2015,01,03
128,The best hotel I have stayed at in a long time,The staff were extremely attentive and could do no more to help and assist me during my stay.  The standard of service was unsurpassable and I would highly recommend the hotel and its staff to anyone looking to stay in London.  There are may hotels to compete with and this is probably the best I have stayed in.  The hotel amenities are excellent as are the standard of rooms.  It is the standard of service that excels and sets this hotel apart from its competitors.  Highly recommended.,5,2015,01,03
128,Underwhelmed,"We stayed at the Montcalm on New Years eve. The Montcalm is advertised as a five star hotel but I have to say that we have stayed at better four star hotels for less money in central London. Initial impressions were favourable. The hotel is in a beautiful building and is extremely well located for the Barbican centre (literally next door). The receptionist was welcoming and friendly enough, however, whilst checking in another staff member handed us warm hand towels but then there was nowhere to put them once used and the receptionist had to locate a bin.

It appears to be he policy of the hotel that all guests get escorted to their rooms by a staff member, even if you say you are happy to take our own luggage. This could be because the layout inside is slightly confusing (it is roughly set out around a central courtyard). However, it felt more like an exercise in trying to obtain additional cash tips from guests.

Ours was a standard room and it felt quite small inside and the bed, though a double, was a small double. We have definitely enjoyed better rooms at cheaper establishments. The bed itself was ok but not that comfortable. There is a mini bar in the room and a large flat-screen tv. Complimentary water and fruit are provided. The bathroom has elemis products and it is a good size compared to the room itself.

The hotel is adjacent to the Jugged Hare gastro-pub (and there is a lift from the hotel direct into the pub) which specialises in game and is worth eating in. Breakfast was also served in the restaurant of the pub the next morning. Again, we have had better breakfasts with a  wider selection of cold dishes and cereals etc to choose from in other hotels. We had also almost finished eating before the tea and coffee was served (even though we were the only ones at breakfast at the time).

Overall, the staff are friendly and welcoming and the hotel is very well located, especially for the Barbican centre. However, you can definitely stay at better places for less money in London.",3,2015,01,03
128,trip to london for 30th birthday,We stayed here for my daughter's 30th birthday which we spent in London.  Check in was quick and room ready early.  The doorman opened front door and cases taken to room.  Room very clean comfortable bed and all amenties.  High quality shower gels etc.  Only 5 mins walk from Moorgate tube so easy access into city.  The night we stayed there was a wedding on and music was loud till midnight but we were given a complimentery breakfast for this which was a very nice gesture.  Also my daughter given wine and biscuits for her birthday.  I would stay again as in a good location to get into the city without being right in hustle of the centre.,4,2015,01,02
128,A truly exceptional hotel,"We've stayed here twice - most recently on NewYears Eve 2014 - and it really is an exceptional hotel.

The staff are probably the most attentive I've ever experienced. They go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable and hassle-free as possible. Nothing is too much trouble, and everything is done with a smile and cheerful attitude.

The hotel is quite beautiful and the rooms come with every possible comfort and mod-con!

Can't recommend it highly enough!",5,2015,01,02
128,"A beautiful hotel with real 'wow' factor, paired with attentive and genuine staff.","We booked this hotel for New Years Eve 2014, opting to pay a little extra for one of the Club room bedrooms. However upon arrival we were advised that we'd been upgraded to the 'Wow' suite- room 127 (great to see that hotels still offer complimentary upgrades!). The room was truly breathtaking and offered everything we wanted and more! So ok, I guess you'd expect a suite in a 5 star hotel to be spectacular but regardless of the standard of the room the staff really made the hotel for us- they were genuinely friendly and always seemed to go that extra mile with their attentiveness when considering our needs. Fabulous hotel experience, that we'd recommend to anyone regardless of the nature of their stop over. ",5,2015,01,01
128,Gorgeous boutique styled hotel,"This hotel has some of the most polite and helpful staff I have come across. Checking in was easy, as was checking out. 
My only qualm would be the unannounced deposit fee of £50 you pay at check in as this was not indicated when I booked.  ",5,2015,01,01
128,GREAT HOTEL,"Great welcome with a hot towel, excellent staff and great food at the jugged hare.
A wonderful New year experience. Rooms were clean, warm and well serviced.
Hotel close to Liverpool St. station and ideal for Barbican concerts.",5,2015,01,01
128,Amazing!!,"Me and my partner stayed at the Momtcalm to celebrate NYE. Everyone was really friendly and couldn't be anymore welcoming. 

The room was spotless and to top that, we received an upgrade on arrival due to my pregnant partner. Highly recommended!",5,2015,01,01
128,Not a bad word to say about it - brilliant stay!,"Stayed here on New Years eve. It was a Cold afternoon when we checked in so they greeted us with warm towels which was lovely. All the staff I came across were excellent - all would go that extra mile to help you in whatever you needed, please give them some recognition for all there hard work. Rooms are great, spotless, comfy bed & excellent shower! Good location, not in a noisy area and only 5 minute walk to the tube station. Cannot think of anything bad to say about this hotel, would 100% come back if I was in the area. Absolutely loved it!",5,2015,01,01
128,Excellent stay,"We had an outstanding stay at the Montcalm. The location was ideal as we were attending a play at the Barbican. We are occasional travellers (3 or 4 times a year) and both agreed that this is the nicest hotel we have stayed at, staff are friendly and helpful without being pushy or making us feel awkward, the room was lovely and on the whole our stay was really good value for money. We ate one evening at The Jugged Hare, and had a drink there both evenings, and enjoyed that very much as well.",5,2015,01,01
128,Pleasant experience,"I stayed at the Montcalm in September with my husband to celebrate my birthday.  The greeting upon arrival was pleasant and check-in was efficient.  We arrived late on a Friday evening.  We had been upgraded to a club room, but the room was tiny, even by London standards.  The view from the window was blocked by some kind of wall and it felt very claustrophobic.  I had also been promised by the staff some kind of amenities (as a birthday treat) in the room but didn't see anything.  A gentleman whose name I didn't catch was very helpful and showed us to another club room which was larger and faced the street (however, the next morning, a Saturday, we awoke to pneumatic drills hammering into the road outside our window - this was unfortunate, and obviously nothing to do with the hotel).  It's not a large hotel but there was a myriad of corridors and several staircases, making it slightly confusing to navigate to/from your room. Obviously, it's an older building with some modifications, so I guess this added to its charm. Our room was clean and the bed quite comfortable.  The hotel is connected to the Jugged Hare next door - quite a cosy pub/restaurant.  

We were charged twice for breakfast one morning which I didn't realise until after we got home and I looked at the guest folio.  I emailed the hotel and the staff was very efficient at rectifying this error.  I think that's the best thing about this place - on the whole, the staff was very attentive - they were helpful and assisted my husband with the delivery of a beautiful bouquet of flowers for my birthday. 

I probably wouldn't stay at the Montcalm again only because the location as well as price wasn't ideal.  I did a lot of research on various hotels beforehand and read many reviews on Tripadvisor, so I was disappointed that not much was within walking distance.  In addition to that, the restaurants in London City, as opposed to other areas of London such as the West End, close at the weekends which I didn't realise.  This meant jumping into a cab quite a few times but I love London cabbies!  We stayed at the Montcalm for three nights and overall it was quite pleasant.",3,2014,12,31
128,Good Expierence,"lovely hotel, friendly staff, will be go back for sure, breajfast was nice too, will recommond to friends and familyies. We were originally looking for a hotel in west end but fnally we choosen this hotel!",4,2014,12,30
128,Fantastic Hotel A+++,"I recently stayed at the Montcalm London City Suites for 2 nights with my Girlfriend this December. Upon arrival at the hotel (a 2 minute walk from Barbican tube station), the standard 5 star service (Door opened, showed to the reception etc, offered a hot face towel). At reception we were informed that we'd been upgraded to a Montcalm club room (instead of a standard double). The staff showed us to our room and were extremely friendly and chatty. The room itself was wonderful, large space, nice bathroom, comfy bed, big tv, free coffee machine, heated floor, large bath etc. 
Overall, and I'm someone who doesn't mind complaining if something in a hotel is wrong, I couldn't fault a single thing with Montcalm London City Suites. Fantastic value for money, location, room and service. Would 100% stay there again, and would recommend to anyone.",5,2014,12,30
128,Fantastic!,"Upon arrival the concierge met us before entering the hotel premises and was incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. From that moment on, our stay at the Montcalm was absolutely wonderful. Just a shame that it was only for the one night. 

The only downside was that the room was slightly on the small side. But still sufficient for the needs and warm and quiet as you'd expect from a hotel of this standard. 
Wonderful staff throughout who all went that extra mile to help. 

Cannot recommend this hotel enough. 

Unfortunately we did not eat with the hotel",5,2014,12,30
128,Spectacular!!!,"Myself and my partner had the most amazing night here.. The hotel was second to none.. It really is 5*!! The staff were so polite and friendly.. The room was,, well even better and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a spectacular stay. By far this was one the best hotels we have stayed in and will be coming back!!",5,2014,12,29
128,Lovely,"Only stayed for one night however had a lovely time. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The location was good and the hotel was very well presented and maintained.

The tube station is only around a 5 minute walk which makes it extremely handy.

I would certainly return again when visiting London.",5,2014,12,29
128,"Easy to get to, a pleasure to stay","I've chosen the City Suites as a bit cheaper option to the Montcalm at the Brewery located across the street, still not discriminating the quality of the stay. The property is easily accessible; from Heathrow airport by Heathrow express to Paddington and then you change to Circle line and terminate at Moorgate. Booking the tickets for Heathrow express online saves some pounds. The property itself is a boutique hotel featuring with nicely decorated and comfortably furnished rooms. Wifi is included in room rate and works perfect. If your daily schedule allows do not miss the opportunity to have full English breakfast which is combined with continental one and offers everything you like, however, at the cost which is a bit higher. The desk staff is very helpful as much as the concierge services. Not sure if i was only lucky but early check in (at about 9-10am) was possible on both trips. Since the place is close to undergroung it makes it perfect spot for moving around London.",5,2014,12,29
128,Excellent choice for a central location!,"Great location, excellent price, friendly staff and a very nice room. If you're looking for a bit of luxury you can't go wrong with this hotel, you even get a glass-window for the bathroom! Not to worry though, there's an electric blind you can lower for privacy when needed!",4,2014,12,28
128,Very friendly and attentive .,"Everything about our stay was excellent.  We were greeted from our taxi and checking in was fast and friendly.  Our room was clean with everything we needed. After an evening out we  ordered room service on our return , fantastic food. Will certainly be going back,  the staff were lovely and welcoming and the service was top class. ",5,2014,12,27
128,Comfortable Luxury in London,"Vert attentive staff. We even got a birthday cake delivered to our room for wife, compliments o the hotel. A very nice touch. Comfortable, well organised room. Great location, within walking distance of Central London and West End. Well located for public transport. Nice pubs and restaurants beside the hotel . We'll be back ",4,2014,12,25
128,If you have to stay in a hotel in London make this the one.,"This is the most amazing hotel we have stayed in, in the UK. Everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication from the staff to the facilities, the foodand drink. We came across the hotel by chance and made a mistake in the booking through an accommodation website.The staff and in particular the manager were brilliant in the way that they sorted the matter out and looked after my wife who was checking in alone until I arrived. The manager in particular should be singled out for looking after us during our stay but having said that every single member of staff that we came into contact with was exceptionally good and professional in what they did. This hotel is the kind of gem that one rarely finds and so you do not want everyone else to find out about it ,wanting to keep the find to yourself. That however would be exceptionally selfish. I urge everyone to try this hotel You will be so pleasantly surprised. BS",5,2014,12,23
128,Historical Gem,"This is an excellent boutique hotel adjacent to the Barbican in London.  It is part of a converted Whitbread brewery which makes it quirky and interesting.  The walk from reception to our room was a bit of a hike and involved a few up and downs but, on the advice of the staff, we used another elevator which allowed us to enter and exit via the “Jugged Hare” pub which felt pretty unique and special.   The history of the brewery was clear from our bedroom windows which overlooked a courtyard where you could really imagine horse drawn carts pulling up to load up with barrels of beer.  The room was well appointed, clean and modern and the staff were friendly and accommodating especially Donatella on the front desk.   
The only downside was the breakfast.  We had room service twice and on the first day we didn’t receive exactly what we had ordered. Our tray charge was refunded without question which was a great response, but there is no substitute for getting thing right first time, every time.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone wishing to spend a great weekend in London slightly away from the madding crowds.",4,2014,12,23
128,A pleasent stop on business,I can remember this when it was a brewery so was pleased to see this building being reused in this way with some original features being retained. Room and facilities were more than adequate for a one night stay with a safe big enough to take iPad / laptop on charge. The hotel provided two mental exercises for guests - one was finding your room unaided (they give you a map should you get lost) and the other was finding all the light switches in your room.  There seemed to be a lot of them to work your way through.  Breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of staff willing to help out (even wanted to do my toast for me).,4,2014,12,23
128,Pricey for what you get.......,"To me, this is a nice hotel, with good rooms, and a load of very attentive people at the front desk. I counted 6 on arrival, and at least 5 when we left the following day.

For the money you pay however, you get a room, with a bed, a TV, a bathroom etc. Not much different from any other hotel. Granted they are all very very nice, but how good / different can they be.

The reality is, you don't get parking - £32 a night at Barbican. 
You don't get Breakfast - £30 approx for 2 (we had a Pret on the way home)
You don't have a view (unless you count a brick wall outside our room!)

I also find it annoying that on arriving home, there is champagne on ice to tempt us. It's not the end of the world, I know, but there is no note to say it is complimentary, or if it is chargeable. 

I have to say, I wish my wife had booked a travelodge / premier Inn a lot sooner, as this hotel is not value for money.",3,2014,12,23
128,Great hotel.,"Just to start I want to say something about the pre-arrival service. Initially, I thought I would have a problem being able to make my stay at The Montcalm and emailed them to ask them if they could change the room type in case my husband wanted to take a friend instead. The were extremely courteous and said that would be absolutely no problem. In the event, I was able to make it after all.

The front of house service is very good from the moment you step through the door. We were shown to our room by a courteous member of staff. The room was a club room (which I had booked) and was luxurious. There was everything you could want in the room. The mini bar was stocked when we were in there but that was not a facility we wanted to use. 

The club room includes access to a lounge with drinks/snacks. The only thing I would say is it is not really that obvious when you walk into the lounge that you then need to go into the bar area (beyond) to get your drinks. I would have felt more comfortable to have that explained as I did not know what the set up was and you can't see the bar area from the lounge. I guess I thought that drinks and snacks would be available 24 hours but I think the lounge is available 24 hours but not the drinks. There were no snacks available when we went in there at about 10pm on Saturday night anyway. The lounge is also where the continental breakfast is served which is inclusive if you book a club room.

A slight niggle (having paid for a club room) is that there are only specific newspapers that are complimentary and I was told that my choice was at an extra cost. A bit penny pinching I thought! 

It being the last Saturday before Christmas, the Jugged Hare pub was too busy, so we opted for a room service meal which was very good.

The location of the hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Barbican and the venue car park is the nearest and is not over priced for London.

Over all I would say a very enjoyable stay, just need to think about information for guests who are staying for the first time. I would definitely choose this hotel again if staying in London.",5,2014,12,22
128,Poor rooms – excellent team,"For those visiting the ‘City’ there are a limited but growing number of hotels. Readers will know that I prefer Mayfair and Knightsbridge and sadly this hotel has not changed my mind.

The positives, at the reception, concierge, housekeeping, club room the team are warm, friendly and very well trained, worthy of the better 5 star hotels so my compliments to the management and training.

The hotel is a curious rabbit warren of a hotel designed at many levels with buildings, guests are even given a map to find their way around but even so there were no shortage of guest lost on each floor.

The two dining areas, a pub and a restaurant are at each end of the hotel. Both are easier to reach by leaving the hotel walking along the pavement in rain or sunshine than facing the maze of the hotel labyrinth.

I reserved a Club Room which provided access to a Club Lounge. As Club / Executive lounges go this would rate in the bottom 10%, dark, unfriendly, cheap in nature and on two occasions full. I struggle to see the value.

The hotel is a dark in most rooms, corridors or public areas and the marketing photographs are very generous. I had room 203, having requested a quiet room. Positively it was not on Chiswell Street but a corner road but sadly it had an adjoining room, not ideal for a good night’s sleep. 

Many of the rooms have long Victorian windows but this room had a prison / small window which should have been a bonus for sound resistance but sadly it was broken and not perfectly sealed. The window itself was the most marked/ scratched/ tainted I have seen in my life.

I could suggest other ‘large’ window rooms but it is clear that due to planning permission all windows have seem to have poor sound proofing.

The room is dark with poor lighting but good WIFI IT toys but considering the price, shoe box proportions. The bathroom has a Yotel, compact feel and despite being only on the second floor, a dismal shower pressure.

I skipped breakfast in the Club Lounge as it was full and the selection not terribly appetising. Instead the Plan B option if selected was breakfast in the hotel owned pub. Although the food quality was not always excellent, the management and team were. Also the chef on the cooking station was warm and friendly and my compliments to him.

Upon checkout, I was asked about my stay and commented upon the noise and was offered my water complimentary. A nice touch which I declined as I had purchase ear plugs to address the issue.

I was asked if another room was offered and it had been but with no material difference.
In short a superb team, management and service tarnished by a tired, dark, cold property. For the staff, I would return tomorrow but I fear if this property represents the group, I will not join their loyalty programme.",3,2014,12,22
128,Another fab stay at the Montcalm,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from another lovely stay at the Montcalm. The visit to London was to celebrate my boyfriends 30th birthday and having already stayed at the Montcalm brewery I knew we wouldn't be disappointed . When we arrived the once  again very polite reception staff gave us a free upgrade to a suite and wished my boyfriend a very happy birthday. We were then shown to our room and what a room. It was the barbican duplex suite which was lovely.. Similar decor to the previous room we stayed in but queen size bed, two bathrooms with waterfall shower and sound system in one. The glass between bathroom and adjacent room meant I was able to watch tv whilst in bath (nice touch)! My boyfriend was sent a birthday card and complimentary bottle of wine again a nice touch. Overall Another very relaxing two night stay in a hotel that has a real nice atmosphere. ",5,2014,12,21
128,Great service and central,"Great location and the staff are excellent, could not do more for you. The one negative was the noise at night. The room would really benefit from some form of double glazing. This is a quirky hotel and a refreshing change from the usual mundane stays you can offer have in London",5,2014,12,20
128,Great rooms and service but avoid roadside rooms!!,I stayed here after a work event in Chiswell Street at HAC so perfect location. The room was excellent and first class service. I was even personally shown to my room. Check in and check out was quick as well. Bathroom was a good size and the room had some nice extras too. My only complaint is that the room was on the ground floor and next to Chiswell Street so I was woken early by traffic noise - it is a busy road and from early in the morning. I would go back but I recommend you ask for a room away from the road or on a higher floor. ,4,2014,12,19
128,Engagement stay,"This hotel was booked as a surprise by my boyfriend (made fiancé on the day) as he proposed that morning during our stay in another London hotel! Therefore, I had no expectations of the room / service, etc. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly concierge team who quickly rid us of our luggage. I was still beaming from the shock proposal and so was quick to share our news with the reception staff, who immediately arranged we have a complimentary upgrade to the Barbican Duplex suite! 

The suite was amazing! I was especially impressed by the glass screen between the living area and bathroom .. It was a first for me to alternate between watching the news on the wall-mounted TV and watching my brand new fiancé shower ;) 

The hotel is very close to both Moorgate and Barbican underground stations! We had a beautiful day/night out in Covent garden & Leicester square with an easy journey back to the hotel! We also found the Tesco, which was less than a 2 minute walk away, very handy for picking up drinks and snacks!

Overall, our stay was amazing! I was understandably on the biggest high of my life, but the genuine congratulations and well wishes from each and every staff member made our night truly unforgettable.",5,2014,12,18
128,Exceptional,"Sophisticated, sleek and welcoming environment. Wonderful experience, right from check-in to the spacious, comfortable and well-provisioned room to the restaurant/bar and check-out. Can't pick a single fault.",5,2014,12,18
128,An eclectic mix of pros and cons...,"I've come to appreciate the benefits of a purpose-built hotel: easy to get to and from your room, convenient fitness facilities, outlets where you need them, etc. This is NOT a purpose-built hotel. It is interesting, however, and for some people perhaps that's more important. First the pros: it's got a beautiful lobby and a pretty handy location if you need to be near London City. The room service is good, and it has nice amenities (Elemis bath products, a hair dryer so strong it could blow your face off, coffee maker with a nice selection of coffees, teas, cocoa, etc.) They leave apples in the room for you, which is a really nice touch. The bed is comfy and the bedding is lovely and white. The bathroom fixtures are modern, though I'm no fan of the European half shower wall thing (why on Earth would anyone want a drafty shower experience that gets water all over the place?) Ok, now the cons: The hotel occupies two four-story buildings on different sides of a major road -- my room was on the side that is NOT the lobby side, so I had to scamper through traffic several times. Furthermore, though the pictures on the Montcalm website depict  bright, light and colorful rooms, my entire building was decorated in black lacquer and mirrors -- it would have been perfect for a 1970's porn shoot. The room itself was also rather dark, though it had at least 15 different lights with 10 different light switches that you will have to track down if you are going to get any sleep (this is apparently a little ""see-if-you-can-find-the-light-switch"" game played with you by the people who do the turn-down service). The biggest con from my perspective was the fitness facility. First, it was in a separate building, and you had to go down a very long, narrow staircase until you were well beneath the surface of the planet. Second, the room was tiny -- maybe 12' x 12', and housed three fitness machines (bike, eliptical, treadmill) and one stand of dumbbells. Pretty paltry. There was, however, a spa room that I didn't try. The funniest part was that in order to use the fitness facility I had to complete a form that verified that a) I hadn't eaten a heavy meal, b) I had no infectious skin lesions, and c) I did not have any illness that impaired my ability to sweat. My mind reels trying to imagine the catastrophic event that led to implementing these restrictions...

So all in all, I personally wouldn't choose this hotel again because I have a strong preference for a light, bright environment, a view, and a convenient fitness facility, but I might recommend it to my friends with more eclectic tastes.",3,2014,12,16
128,Great hotel. ,"I definitely recommend this hotel. The location is great, it's extremely stylish and the staff make you feel very well looked after. One of the most comfortable beds I've slept in for a while - I didn't want to get out of it - just as well I did though as the breakfast is top notch. 
I've read that it is worth asking for a room overlooking the courtyard, we didn't and to be honest I don't feel as though I missed out too much. The room itself was really spacious and well-equipped. Like many hotels now the iPod doc has been rendered useless for most devices thanks to Apple's constant 'upgrades' so it's probably worth bringing a headphone lead with you if you want to use the audio equipment (why don't hotels leave these in the rooms, it would cost next to nothing). 
The only other thing to mention is to check what is/isn't complimentary in the room, I nearly helped myself to some nuts, but thankfully noticed they were £6 a jar before opening them...a little excessive for nuts. ",4,2014,12,15
128,"Smart staff, smart hotel","Smart hotel with excellent staff in the heart of London. Close to Barbican and Moorgate tube stations. Couple of minutes walk from The Barbican and plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Booked room on booking.com so price was reasonable but although room was nice and had a good shower, it was round the back (South wing) with a view of the side of another building a few metres away. This was fine for acouple of nights but I would not have wanted to spend much longer there.",4,2014,12,14
128,Blown away by the service,"When I was checking out, I had to ask if the service I experienced was common across all London hotels, or if it was unique to The Montcalm.  I'm not even sure I got a direct answer, but it was really that impressive and made such an impression upon me.  They do truly treat you like royalty and it was really an impeccable experience.  No ""ask"" is too great for them.

A bellhop takes your luggage to your room and explains all of the features of the room to you, especially the lighting.  Trust me - when they offer to explain everything to you, take them up on it, as there are a lot of lights.  The quality of the hotel and the furnishings are really top notch.  It's really kind of a unique hotel with the long narrow, lit, hallways.  The building used to be an old brewery, which makes it all quite unique.

My rate included breakfast in ""The Club"" on the first floor, which is not served breakfast but more than sufficient to start your day.  We had dinner one night at The Jagged Hare, which is a gastro pub with awesome food and service.

My company has an office within short walking distance of this hotel, and when I was checking out, I told them that I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else in the future.  It was truly that much of an impressive experience all around.  As others have said already - service is second to none.  I can't wait to bring my wife with me next time, she'll feel like a princess.",5,2014,12,14
128,Free Upgrade,"This was my second stay at the Montcalm, with the first being 18 months earlier. 

I chose to return here as although on the slightly more expensive side, you certainly get a superior experience than you would elsewhere. 

Check-in was a little hectic as they clearly had too many people turn up at once. I did feel however that the front desk team were a little stressed and this came through in my experience as they rushed through in order to get to waiting clients - fair enough, but didn't feel great. 

We left our baggage and returned later in the day to be taken to our room and greeted with our luggage waiting in the room. I'd paid for a club room as the extra space is quite nice (the normal rooms can always be on the tighter side if you're not used to london), but we'd been given a duplex suite for no extra charge. 

As always, the room was immaculate and i have no issues here at all. 

Breakfast was included in the price and I wish i'd been more hungry to take advantage. Well worth the extra money to pay in advance, as would be quite expensive to buy on the day. 

5 minute walk from the Tube.",5,2014,12,13
128,Service is second to none at this hotel,"My husband was at a conference at the weekend so I took the opportunity to accompany him and visit London.

The staff are really what make this hotel and nothing is too much and is followed through, reception and room staff.  Particularly thanks to Rueben and the staff member who helped me when I arrived on Friday.

The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable and Elemis toiletries.

The location is fabulous, I love walking so took the opportunity to walk to Tower of London, Borough Market and the Tate and back again via Oxford Street (4 hours).  Some lovely places to rest along the way.  We ate in Cote for 2 nights (quick, simple and light) and The Jugged Hare for the Sunday evening (great roast dinner - very friendly and helpful staff).  I was on my own for most of the time and I never felt uncomfortable.

I would definitely stay here again, it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in within a city",5,2014,12,09
128,Great customer service from booking to check out. Highly recommended.,"I booked a room as part of birthday present for my wife and was surprised to have been upgraded to a Club room on arrival. The room was fantastic and a birthday card had been left with a complimentary bottle of wine which was a really nice touch. The staff were extremely polite and friendly and the concierge couldn't do enough to assist. I personally like the location but may not be for everyone, although the tube is in short walking distance for whatever you want to do. Would certainly stay again.",5,2014,12,09
128,The most amazing hotel in London,"My husband and I enjoyed 1 night at The Montcalm to celebrate our 10year wedding anniversary and I couldn't think of more luxurious, personable hotel. Everyone from the doorman, to Sanjeev to the gentleman who served us breakfast in bed did everything they could to make our stay pleasurable without being over the top. Our Montcalm Club Room was high-tech, comfortable and had everything we could need. I could go on and on but I don't want to spoil it for you - just go and see for yourself! Thanks to The Montcalm @ The Brewery again, we cant wait to return.",5,2014,12,09
128,Brilliant,Thanks v much for your service from beginning to end. Even when it was a wet Sunday night and nothing around was open it was your excellent food and hospitality that would bring us back. Little things where not a problem to you as when the room was a little cold as it was freezing out side. I rang the reception and they said they would adjust the temp for us well we then had to turn it down after an hour. We stayed in the wow room and it certainly was we took a picture of me on the plush leather sofa next to the four poster bed. Under floor heated tiled floor so it was a nice touch. ,5,2014,12,08
128,"Great location, super clean, friendly","Was upgraded which was nice. Old building townhouse converted into a hotel. Super clean, comfortable and friendly staff. I liked how they had apples everywhere. Would recommend. Good location too for the city. ",5,2014,12,08
128,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff!","Just returned home from a weekend stay at the Montcalm and was over the moon with it well appointed rooms and fantastic, helpful staff who couldn't do enough to help. Location was ideal not to far away from all that London has to offer but just far enough away from all the hustle and bustle. Some lovely places to eat and drink near by and 5 mins from the nearest tube station. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anybody.",5,2014,12,08
128,A comfortable night,"A busy hotel, well placed for the City. Not cheap, but I don't think that there are many bargains to be had if you want a central hotel on a Saturday night in December. 
Good points. Friendly, professional staff. Room clean, quiet and well maintained. Comfortable bed.
Things that could be better. Our bathroom was definitely on the small side for a Club Room. Full English Breakfast served next door at The Jugged Hare was verging on poor - food badly cooked and service slow. This was unexpected, we had eaten  lunch there the previous day and had dinner there in the summer and on both occasions it was very good indeed. Not sure what went wrong with Sunday breakfast.",4,2014,12,08
128,"Stunning hotel, a hidden gem in the heart of London","We stayed on a Saturday night, the room (duplex suite) was by far the best we have ever stayed in. We changed our plans to stay in and make the most of such a lovely hotel including the club facilities which were also first class. The bed was comfy and bathrooms were clean and packed with ammenities. 

The staff were attentive and polite couldn't do enough to help you.

Breakfast in the morning was served in the hotel owned pub next door. The range of continental and cooked options was substantial and service was outstanding.

My only regret is that we only stayed one night, we will definitely be back soon!",5,2014,12,07
128,Good enough to inspire me to write a review,"I've not stayed here before and was there for a single night. 

According to one of the staff it's  been open for about 4yrs and what was clearly a significant investment has worn well (or been well maintained) and the building and finishes are really quite nice without being too over the top. If you were looking to impress this would amply suffice.

The room was very good, well appointed and very clean. The bathroom was finished very well - the absence of a bath was more than made up for with an excellent shower.

The breakfast was also very good, whilst not quite the best I've ever had (at a hotel) it ran the best (also London hotel) a close 2nd with a clear gap between it and the rest. The only minor criticism was that there was no potato product choice on the hot buffet, but the quality and choice everywhere else helped me quickly forget that.

This hotel's greatest asset however is it's staff: without exception, whilst they were all as polite and courteous as you'd expect in a decent hotel, they were also all incredibly (and seemingly genuinely) happy and committed. Like all of us, i imagine working at a hotel is just a job, but they all seemed to take real pride in what they were doing and actually/really care. The management there also don't seem too reliant on this staff commitment as a way of skimping on total members of staff, if anything there seemed to be an abundance. 

In summary, if its just a business stayover or for pleasure i would not hesitate in both returning and recommending to others.",5,2014,12,06
128,"Great value for location, room size and service",Sadly we didn't get to take full advantage of the complimentary club room and kitchenette attached to our room as it was a one night stay for a bday party in the city but we were impressed with the service and room size for the price we paid considering the hote,5,2014,12,05
128,An all around great experience,"I stayed at The Montcalm in early November and have to say that it was nothing short of a great experience.  The quality of the service that I received and the way I was made to feel at home at the hotel was fantastic.  

My stay was excellent, but there is one experience that I had while there that I am truly grateful for.  Before I arrived at the hotel I was traveling for several weeks and arrived a bit run down.  I unfortunately fell ill one evening and called the front desk to ask for help.  After I explained my situation to Vidmantas (the gentleman who answered the phone), he went out of his way to help me that evening.  He found contact numbers for emergency services, called for help, and even ran out to pick up medicine for me.  I was bedridden that night because I was feeling so nauseous and when I offered him money for everything that he bought for me he turned it down explaining that he just wanted to make sure that I was alright.  He even called later on in the evening to see if I needed any further help.

I travel very frequently for work, but have never had an experience quite like that.  I truly appreciate the way I was taken care of by Vidmantas and the rest of the staff at The Montcalm.  I explained the story to everyone at my office upon my return to New York and will most definitely will be staying at The Montcalm on my future trips to London.",5,2014,12,05
128,really nice place,"feels like a 5 star that it advertises itself as which is a pleasant surprise as it '5 star' gets bandied on too many hotels nowadays.  room was excellent quality and staff were 100%.  the only slight downside is a lack of a proper dining room - eating was done in what felt like a bar area at the back of reception, but the food and drink itself, could not be faulted.  will give the montcalm marble arch a try next time to see how it compares.",4,2014,12,04
128,Excellent proximity for the Brewery - reason for booking,"Booked this hotel for a one night stay to attend a dinner at the Brewery in November 2014.  My review is of room 123.  Upon check-in, no queue, and staff were very attentive and helpful.  Room was quite small, but no smaller than you would expect for London.  Décor was very nice and bedding of a super quality as you would expect.  Downsides are that I would have liked a mirror over the desk / dressing table, so I could apply my make-up.  Also the grouting in the bathroom on both floor and walls looked dirty and needed re-doing.  I could hear every conversation from adjoining room and the mini bar prices were exceptionally over in flated.  Apart from that no complaints.  Best thing was the proximity to the Brewery and the customer service level of the staff.  I would hope for a bigger room and a view would be nice, if I returned.",4,2014,12,03
128,Not good,"Arrive by taxi as we arrived by car and had to drop wife and luggage off quickly and find a multi storey car park. Room OK but a long way from reception through a maze of corridors. Wanted a drink but the bar is a pub on the corner not ideal. Breakfast quite good but had to share table, wait 5 minutes for coffee and then they had run out of fresh fruit (10.00) and when asked they said only fruit left was in a display, whole pineapple, oranges and apples...........not good. Would not stay again",2,2014,12,03
128,Hard to Fault,"Saturday night stay:-

All the staff we had contact with were very customer orientated; this level of care and service is not normally something I would expect or indeed insist upon in a hotel stay, but it really did make a difference to our stay - it was impossible not to be both charmed and impressed.
Public spaces are also impressive. The room we stayed in retained the original window (with secondary glazing to keep out the drafts & noise), however most other features, if there ever were any, have been lost by overlaying the original shell with  a pretty standard, if very  high spec., modern bedroom and bathroom. 
Breakfast was fine though slightly let down by inability to seat people in good time as they arrived, i.e. queuing. We also ate dinner at their Jugged Hare dining room the night before and were mightily impressed with the traditional style British menu (Chop House style) and especially enjoyed the game pie 1st course, be warned - go hungry.
We will certainly book to stay again.",5,2014,12,02
128,Extra special touch,"I booked 2 rooms to celebrate a family birthday. The hotel is beautiful and the service very attentive. The Elemis toiletries were lovely. The bed was so comfortable.
 The guest liaison very kindly offered us an complementary upgrade on our room and included a continental breakfast to make our birthday celebrations extra special. The club rooms are gorgeous.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,02
128,Talk about comfort..!,"I have stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery several times: each stay has been consistently perfect. The reception team is amazing - introducing themselves, offering service, etc. The hotel location is quite nice -- short walk to Barbican station (Underground) and to Smithfield market.

But to be sure, the reason to stay here is the comfort of the room: the beds rival Westin's ""Heavenly Bed,"" the windows seal shut so it's quiet and dark, and the room itself is well appointed. Housekeeping team is efficient and tidy.

I've recommended this hotel to colleagues a number of times, and never heard anything other than ""Thank you--you were right, it was great.""",5,2014,12,02
128,Fantastic stay ,"I'd booked the hotel for a weekend away to celebrate my wife's birthday and glad I did. Location is pretty good as less than 5 mins walk from Moorgate tube station. We arrived early and wanted to leave bags off as were attending a matinee at the theatre and they let us check in early without any fuss. I'd paid a bit extra to get a Montcalm Club Double and I can't complain about the room. Plenty of space and very clean. With the upgraded room we'd access to the club lounge which was nice. Basically meant we could go there between 530-730pm for complimentary drinks and snacks and was also possible to have beer and wine after this time which was a nice touch. Breakfast was continental and very nice. I believe you could have a cooked breakfast in the Jigged Hare but we just had the standard one both mornings. 
Would definitely recommend here and stay in future.  ",5,2014,12,01
128,history & luxury,"We stayed at the Montcalm for one night on a fleeting visit to London. I booked through bookings.com & paid £180 for a superior double for the room. The welcome at reception was probably the best I've received at any hotel I've frequented, the room was very well equipped & comfortable, the fixtures & fittings ooze good taste & quality. At checkout the next morning we were directed to a separate desk & again dealt with politely, quickly & efficiently. Didn't try breakfast, partly because I thought the price was very high & the extract fan in the bathroom doesn't appear to ever go off, but these are minor gripes.",5,2014,12,01
128,2 night stay,"Great hotel. Stayed in standard double room. A little small but it's an old building so you will get that. Nice bathroom, decor and very comfy bed. Asked for a room away from the road and that wasn't a problem. The first night was very noisy until late as there was a Christmas party and there is no double glazing but second night was quiet. The area is a business district but there are a few pubs, plenty of places for breakfast and the tube was 5 mins away. Overall good stay and would stay again.",4,2014,11,30
128,Excellent (& quirky) hotel,"Stayed just the one night but would recommend if you need to be based in the City. Hotel is based in the old brewery buildings and to, to be frank, is an absolute maze. I must have got lost 3 times! However that just adds to the fun and quirkyness. 

Staff were very efficient and friendly. Breakfast, which you have in the in-house pub The Jugged Hare, was first class. 

My room was very comfortable with some great touches including a bathroom with a window onto the bedroom. I'm guessing a bit of fun if you are there on a romantic weekend, I used it to watch the TV whilst in the shower! I particularly liked the free Nespresso machine. 

I also though the hotel was pretty good value for London. So I would definitely stay again. ",5,2014,11,30
128,a night in the city,"Stayed one night in Montcalm, hotel is brilliant staff very polite and help full rooms tidy and very well equiped, had breakfast in Jugged hare restaraunt really good fresh food, easy parking in Barbican.",5,2014,11,29
128,Perfect in every detail,"I've stayed in Montcalm a few times so far and I most certainly will next time I visit London. The hotel is well situated - 5 mins walk from the underground. Also all of the most famous attractions like Big Ben, Tower of London or National Gallery are not far away. I was often going on foot, which took me less than an hour. 

Hotel rooms and bathrooms have everything that may be necessary, including European sockets. Every room has its own minibar and a set of delicious tea, hot chocolate and coffee. Beds are big and comfortable. Rooms are really quiet.

I especially enjoyed morning breakfasts at The Jugged Hare. One can choose from english breakfast, continental breakfast and the variety of pastry. In my opinion Eggs Benedict are the best dish. You always get served with a fresh coffee and a warming welcome, especially from Javier, who always cheered me up.

Staff at the hotel is always willing to help. An early arrival wasn't a problem. They were always so kind to prepare the steam room for me, which was extremely relaxing after spending an exhausting day at work.",5,2014,11,27
128,Lovely staff,"Stayed here for one night on business. Didn't eat there apart from a very tasty Club sandwich via room service. The room was pleasant and had everything you needed, however one or two tiles in the bathroom were chipped/cracked which really didn't bother me but I suspect some particularly fussy reviews would complain about this.  Bed was particularly comfy and there was no noise from traffic or other guests.  I wish to particularly comment on all the very helpful staff - all polite and nothing was too much trouble.  By far the best hotel staff I've dealt with, especially as I have stayed in far pricier hotels.  Will certainly use again.",5,2014,11,27
128,Nice hotel - lovely stay would use again,"Took my wife to London for a long weekend, and a treat stay in a nice hotel. We were not disappointed, the hotel is lovely, and tastefully decorated with respect to the buildings legacy.

Staff are very helpful, and have the genuine 'nothing is too much trouble' attitude. I needed to press a shirt, and asked reception for an iron, it was on my doorstep in 5 minutes, ready to go.

The club lounge is a nice feature, if you have a club room, there is no charge for its use, which includes snacks, and drinks, it was nice to chill out in there with a beer after a day Christmas shopping in London.

This hotel ranks very highly for value for money in my opinion, and is worth every penny I paid.

Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.",5,2014,11,26
128,Amazing Experience,"Stayed at this hotel 21st and 22nd November 2014. What a refreshing hotel experience! Megha and her team raised the bar in customer service from the moment we arrived with an overwhelming attention to detail. Nothing was too much trouble for them to make sure we had an enjoyable stay. Access to the Club lounge facilities allowed a quiet reading room with complimentary refreshments, tea, coffee and wine. Perfect way to relax before or after dinner or the Theatre. We stayed in a Duplex Suite which exceeded our expectations and more than satisfied our needs in terms of comfort and cleanliness. Top class Buffet or ' A la Carte' breakfast and we found reasonably priced French and Italian restaurants within walking distance.
If that wasn't enough the touch that made our trip so memorable was the fact that within a short time the staff acknowledged us by name and not by room number. They took an interest in what we had planned giving advice and recommendations and it was the extra personal touch that made all the difference. I would certainly recommend this hotel and hope to visit again on our next trip in March 2015.
Kind Regards
Rob and Stuart",5,2014,11,26
128,My favourite London Hotel - great service!,"Everytime I need to stay in town, I always try to book this hotel.  It has character but all the amenities are excellent. A real five star Hotel! 
Also whenever I book for a special occasion I am often helped by Simona who is efficient and professional - nothing is too much trouble for her.",5,2014,11,26
128,Highly recommend!,"We stayed here for a weekend, staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable, not a very big room, but had everything we needed and the lighting was excellent.The hotel was very clean and well presented, we would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,24
128,The best!,"My wife and I visited the montcalm with a couple of friends to celebrate our anniversary and wow! What a hotel. The staff are so friendly and helpful, check in was fast. As we had mentioned that it was our anniversary on booking they kindly upgraded us to a Barbican duplex suite and it really was amazing! Down stairs we had our bathroom and lounge with the bedroom upstairs. The room and all it's features really was stunning to say the least. We have stayed in many other london hotels and none have ever compared to this gem. Breakfast was amazing and so much to choose from. Can't wait to come back and thank you for making our stay memorable.",5,2014,11,23
128,Good but not Perfect,"We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery in London's Barbican for three nights in November.  We booked a Club room which was spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was nicely appointed and clean; however the shower shelf was loose and swung about and the lack of a towel ring was disconncerting.  The heated towel rail (albeit small) and underfloor heating were nice.  The bed was a double not king and fairly comfortable.  There was a good range of lighting and the room had air conditioning.  For a five star hotel to only have a kettle not coffee maker (despite being in an upgraded level of room) was not what we expected.  Additionally the one small bottle of complimentary water for two people seemed more of a joke than a benefit.  This was not replaced on the second day and we were told one bottle per stay not per night - which seems silly as if we had made three separate bookings we would have got 3 bottles.
We had twice requested a quiet room on a high floor before arriving but actually received a room on the second floor overlooking the street on the main corridor from the list.  This and the non-arrival of our newspaper were the first examples of service that wasn't five star.
The Club room gave us access to the Club lounge which offered tea & coffee plus soft drinks throughout the day and then alcoholic drinks and hors d'oeuvres from 5.30-7.30pm.  The food and drink was of a good quality and similarly the continental breakfast on offer was also excellent.  The frustration was that rather than welcoming you to the lounge each time (which was open access on a corridor through the hotel and so could not be restricted to those who qualified to eb there) the member of staff would always ask immediately for your room number in a tone that always suggested they expected you shouldn't be there and looked like a free loader.  I'd rather be welcomed first and asked for a room number later.  Additionally the fact that they would bottle up the fridge with alcoholic drinks in the afternoon to save them time but not allow drinking of them until 5.30pm seemed silly - it caused a number of guests to be challenged in an embarrassing fashion when they went to take a beer at 5pm say.  I would suggest having a separate fridge with a solid locked door as other concierge lounges do to avoid this conflict.
Main breakfast was the big letdown.  Instead of opening their proper restaurant (Chiswell Street Dining Rooms) for breakfast as you would expect in a 5 star hotel they offered you breakfast in the pub next door (The Jugged Hare).  On the first morning (hotel at 40% occupancy) we arrived to find no tables and were asked to sit on bar stools in the bar for breakfast.  We complied but found ourselves ignored by staff and couldn't get any coffee etc.  In the meantime though the pub ws accepting walk ins off the street and seating them in the restaurant side.  The cold food was of a good quality but the hot buffet was disappointing (and again for a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices I'd expect a la carte cooked to order).  We wasted an hour sitting uncomfortably and not really enjoying the experience.  Knowing we had pre-paid for B&B for 3 nights this did not bode well.
We did complain and to eb fair the Duty Manager was very apologetic.  As we wanted hot breakfast she offered us room service for the next day and sent us a half bottle of wine. We also received a fruit bowl and bottle of champagne on night two and it was very clear the Duty Manager was trying really hard to resolve our issues satisfactorily and we really appreciated that. Room service breakfast the next day was excellent however we were surprised when we checked out to have been charged £5 tray charge - we wouldn't have incurred this cost if the main breakfast service had been acceptable.
On the final day we had planned to have the Club lounge breakfast but were instead awoken by the same breakfast tray arriving as the day before unexpectedly.
We ate an evening meal in The Jugged Hare (having pre-booked for our first night) and couldn't say that the food/service was worth the price.
In summary the hotel is comfortable and reasonably well located (5 min walk from Barbican tube) with staff who do want to please.  However service was a let down in a few areas and we wouldn't stay again.",4,2014,11,23
128,A lovely stay at a lovely hotel!!,"This is the first time I have stayed at the Montcalm Brewery Hotel, and the experience was wonderful.  The staff were friendly and really were very happy to make our stay enjoyable.  The hotel is a bit removed from the Central London area, but very close to the tube so this was not a problem.  The arrangements for breakfast was little confusing, but eating at the Jugged Hare next door was a great experience as well, and I would most certainly recommend the Jugged Hare for a tasty and enjoyable meal in the evening too... Our friend from Munich said that the venison was one of the best he had tasted and the same could be said for the Jugged hare (hare cooked in a rich sauce and served in a jug!) if you like Game then you will love the Jugged Hare pub as that is their speciality... Breakfast was pretty good too! A wonderful experience and a wonderful weekend made special by The Montcalm and The Jugged Hare.. A big thank you!!",5,2014,11,22
128,Amazing!!!,"This is such an amazing hotel - rooms are modern yet traditional and no expense has been spared. 

The staff are more than welcoming, and cannot do enough to help you with anything. Lots of gadgets in the room which was great - and the bathroom was to die for. 

Can't wait to stay again xx",5,2014,11,18
128,Very pleasant stay,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Montcalm and I plan to stay there every time I need a room in London.

I work in London but live 30 mins outside, and decided to get a room here on Friday night as i was  seeing friends, rather than get the last train (12ish) home.

Check in was quick and I was taken up to my room and shown all the facilities. The room was spacious, very smart and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. the bathroom and toiletries were fantastic and the choice of lighting was extensive. 

The location of the hotel couldn't be better - right in between Barbican Tube and Moorgate.

One tip I would give travellers is to go to Smiths of Smithfield (5 minute walk) for breakfast as we did - you cannot fault it. 

All in all a perfect choice and I'm hoping that the management might offer me a complimentary upgrade next time I visit for writing such a positive review :).",5,2014,11,18
128,Under the radar,"Just had our second stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery, located close to the Barbican in the City of London this hotel is a little under the radar but so worth a visit.  You can stay in a luxury hotel club room with access to a stylish club lounge providing continental breakfast and pre-dinner drinks/canapés for the same price that a standard room at most of the other 4star London hotels will charge you.
Staying at the weekend? Then the finer dining room is closed but the Jugged Hare bistro offers great food just ensure you make a reservation before you arrive for your stay to avoid disappointment.  
Excellent, friendly service from all staff, Will definitely be going back for a third stay.",5,2014,11,17
128,Total pampering and indulgence,"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay. The staff were ever ready to help with anything. From the moment  we got to the hotel, myself and my wife were made to feel very welcome . We were shown our room and shown how the gadgets work . The staff were ever so ready to help with directions to places we wanted to visit. The staff gave service with broad smiles all the time.",5,2014,11,17
128,Perfect for The Brewery,"Could not be closer to The Brewery, so ideal if you're attending an event there. This is the second Montcalm I've stayed at and both have been superb. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and in London I think it's worth paying more if you can because the cheaper hotels can be very variable.",5,2014,11,17
128,Brilliant service!,This hotel is so convenient for The Barbican & surrounding areas in the city of London. The service was very good on arrival & they very efficiently managed to have our room available for an early check-in as we were attending a wedding at 2pm in The Barbican. On checkout we were very impressed with the customer service & can highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,11,16
128,Amazing,"Due to a change in circumstances ( babysitter couldnt make it) the staff and manager was amzing and understanding and changed our room to a comfy very clean accomadating room which the kids had an amazing time with us. This made our experience very rewarding and my wife and i enjoyed our experience with the kids, Staff very friendly and are very understanding. nothing to worry about just an amazing stay Thank you",5,2014,11,16
128,Top night out!,"Attended the LABC awards here and had a great night out. A pre drinks reception in the bar was followed by a 3 course meal in the Brewery with a casino afterwards. There was not much I could fault with the evening, food was excellent, service great and the venue itself was one of the best I've been to. I would recommend this place to anyone thinking of holding a large event or just staying the night!",5,2014,11,15
128,"They strive for quality, but but but ...","Stayed here for a weekend break. The hotel itself is located in the City district, making it less favorable for touristic purposes (count 20-30min subway to get anywhere). It's a refurbished brewery, which they have done beautifuly. However, I don't think this is 5 star quality yet :

* we were staying in a club room, which was quite small. The bed was a joke, was a small queen size bed. Good sleep quality, but not with two people in it.
* we got very unlucky with the concierge on duty when we arrived. We told him we had a free evening on saturday and asked for his recommendations, only being told ""it's a holiday weekend so everything is closed"". Kinda sucky when we found out later that evening (venturing out ourselves) it was Remembrance weekend and missed the parade, the fireworks, ... Not the kind of service we were expecting.
* when asking a taxi to go the airport, we got two different prices at reception. One said it was 75 pound, the other one said it was 65 if we paid cash else it would be +20%. Come on, get your figures and prices straight ...

I would advise to pay the extra buck for ""Club"", the Club room (breakfast and snacks) is worth it.Overall, I would rate this a 4+star hotel, but the need to work out the kinks and glitches. They charge a hefty price, make sure the experience is satisfactory.",4,2014,11,13
128,Nice Hotel for Short Visit,I am a business traveler and was delighted after coming off a long haul red eye flight that I could check into my room at 7am. Maybe just lucky they had a room available but either way it made my day. Thank you!!!! Got a good discount rate for a double room online and I must say it was better than I was expecting. Nice toiletries and good size room with all amenities. Would definitely use again next time as very close to the city for business and White Cross Street for the market food and Barbican cultural centre.,4,2014,11,13
128,Very Good Quality Hotel,"Very nice hotel, well appointed and friendly staff, excellent customer service and nice rooms, everything you would expect from a quality London Hotel.

They were in the process of redecorating but this didn't cause a problem.",4,2014,11,12
128,"A lovely, unique hotel.......",A great hotel and wonderfully attentive staff.  The rambling halls and stairs add to the unique character of the hotel.  Breakfast at The Jugged Hare was excellent.  Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars from us is the wrong luggage was delivered by American Airlines to the hotel.   The hotel staff did not confirm the name on the luggage tag before accepting the luggage.  Took us 3 days to finally get our luggage.  A mistake I bet the staff doesn't make again.  We would stay here again.  ,4,2014,11,11
128,Great Sunday stay,"A last minute stay. Been to the Montcalm at the brewery and was very pleased there. My husband had a Harley street appointment on Monday and decided to give ourselves less stress and travel up the day before. Yes Harley street is at the other end do of oxford street. The staff at Montcalm were exceptional , upgraded our room and were very friendly.,the rooms were clean and to a high standard. Would I return ohhhh yes !! A great, central hotel with great customer services.",5,2014,11,11
128,"Good Hotel, but...","The hotel was very nice - very clean and an attentive staff. I booked my room last minute for a quick business trip and just accepted the rate I was offered. Later I looked online and found several cheaper rates. My bad for not looking online at hotels.com first, but I got stuck with a substantially higher rate and was disappointed at how much higher it was. The hotel was within walking distance of Liverpool station (which is where my meetings were) so the walk was nice. Close enough to walk even in a drizzle. The restaurants attached to the hotel were also excellent.

The room I would up with was very small for the price I paid - I would have expected at least something larger having paid the higher price. While it had a window, it had a view of a brick wall 3 feet away - so it felt like I was in the cellar... The room was clean and well organized for business travel though.",4,2014,11,10
128,Surprisingly good and just a bit quirky!,"Our original booking was for a sister hotel but we were redirected at the last minute to the Montcalm because of essential maintenance work. The hotel is situated in a quieter part of the city near Bank in Chiswell street. A former Whitbread brewery it was renovated and converted into a hotel about 3 years apparently. Several separate buildings have been tastefully redesigned into a single hotel with linking bridge and lifts. Our room was on the ground floor but to get to it we had to take the lift to the first floor and then another lift down again. We soon found a quick route via the outside entrance! 
Our check-in was quick and helpful and staff were on hand to explain and direct us to our room to ensure we found our way! The room was ample and well decorated to a high standard. The ensuite was clean and well equipped although it took us a little while to work out how to use the bath taps (they doubled up as hand-shower and overhead shower as well). Fresh fruit and tea/coffee were complimentary in our room and there were bowls of fruit on the landings too.
As we had been redirected from out original hotel we were given a free upgrade and complimentary breakfast. Breakfast was in the next-door pub (the Jugged Hare) and was also to a very high standard. 
Throughout our stay the staff were helpful and courteous. Checkout was very quick too. I would strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,11,09
128,Excellent hotel,really lovely hotel with excellent service - expensive mini-bar but it is central London I suppose!!  Beautiful room though a bit dark - no main light just lots of spotlights which are lovely but not very practical.  Overall - excellent hotel.,5,2014,11,09
128,"London Rocks....""Go""!","We stayed here in order to go and see wonderful Livingston play at Hoxton Square.  The Montcalm Hotel was booked and paid for (thanks!) by my partner who stays in London on business and has stayed there before. It is near the Hoxton Square bar and grill and close to the financial district being a short walk from Moorgate tube.
It was a Friday evening for one night - for the two of us.
On arrival the reception was really first class - a porter on the door who offered to carry bags, opened the door and after checking in he showed us to the room - this may sound like over kill but it is an old building which used to be a brewery and is listed and paraphrasing the porter -those builders of old didn’t help the hotel guests find rooms.  It made the stay - since the route to the room was then known and quite easy, without that guide it would have been more problematic since it is a big place, with similar décor along the twists and turns of the corridors.
Back to check in - the reception is lovely.  I took photos - but found that those already on the Trip advisor site are better and really do it justice. While checking in the front of house staff, like everyone we encountered surprised me in that they appeared interested, made good conversation and appeared to take pleasure in working at the Hotel.  I soon relaxed and the experience maintained a level of welcome, warmth and personality that we found calming in such a busy location and made the whole trip really excellent.  The Montcalm Hotel on this experience was outstanding.
Entering the room - which was upgraded to Montcalm Club, it was adequate for a short stay and comfortable.  It had everything you need on a short trip -music flat screen TV, coffee maker lovely Jing tea and coffee, robes, slippers.  The bathroom although small was well appointed including Hermes products - creams and shampoos.
The bed was particularly comfortable and the window opened so you could have real fresh air or air conditioning (which worked well and was unobtrusive).
We decided on waking to have breakfast - which is a short walk at weekends to the Jugged Hare.  Ostensibly a pub -but actually on a Saturday morning was a very welcoming comfortable place to have a good breakfast. I am Coeliac and there was tasty Gluten free bread on request which was toasted for me to have with the scrambled eggs.  Coffee was also good and hot milk again if requested.  The pain au chocolate my partner had were authentic and also good. Total for this a la carte breakfast was a little over 17 GBP for two - which considering I pay around 14 Euros in europe solo for a breakfast that doesn’t come close was pretty good.  The Breakfast was served and service couldn’t be faulted
In short the stay in the Montcalm Hotel was a real pleasure from the moment we entered it was stylish smart and gave a sense of old style charm and quality.
I would recommend this particular to visitors who want quality and comfort and want to see Britain at its best, because this place not only knows what service is - but delivers.",5,2014,11,09
128,Be Very Careful About Your Booking,"This is a hotel in two parts, one is a very nice renovation of a brewery. The staff are all excellent, and the fittings in all the rooms I am sure are excellent. The other is a series of tiny townhouse rooms with close to zero storage in an annex across the road. The first may be 5 star, the second is not by any stretch of the imagination.
I had thought I was booking the main hotel, but it is unfair to rely upon the main hotel to get the booking and simply impose the townhouses, it should be made clear when booking what is happening. On leaving I was told I should have complained earlier, I don't think so, it is plainly a common complaint, and it only upsets everyone when the hotel is full as I was told it was. Guests should be told what they are getting so that they can make an informed choice of hotel. It is no excuse that it is in London, I have stayed in dozens of hotels around the same price with excellent sized rooms, try the Grange St Paul's for example, far bigger rooms and much better facilities but a similar price point area and description.
I have been offered an upgrade on return, perhaps.",3,2014,11,09
128,Amazing from the moment we arrived,"We stayed at the Montcalm Brewery to celebrate my husbands birthday. Upon check in we were given a free room upgrade. The guy checking us in was extremely polite and professional, we felt like valued customers right from the offset. We were shown to our room, where we was pleasantly surprised again at the immaculate condition. The room offered the highest quality furnishings, with everything you could think of from bath robes and slippers, to complimentary fruit and mints. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast in the Club Lounge was the most relaxing breakfast we have ever experienced. Beautiful fresh salmon, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, served by professional, helpful staff. The breakfast set our day off to the perfect start.

This hotel sits within the top three hotels I have had the privledge of staying in over the world and no doubt the best we have stayed in, in the UK. We never tend to stay in the same hotel twice but I am booking this hotel again for a return visit in December, that is how much we enjoyed it.

If you would like a clean, immaculate, well equipped hotel room, along with a great professional, helpful service, then this is the place to stay. It is located in a central position, making it easy to reach all the local attractions.

I have no doubt we will be staying at this hotel several times a year, we really will not stay anywhere else in London from now on.",5,2014,11,07
128,Pristine room and service,This is an absolutely beautiful modern hotel. With staff that are eager to serve your every need. We arrived late and left early and were unable to fully enjoy the hotel. The only down side to the hotel is it's difficult to navigate around,5,2014,11,07
128,Very good hotel in the heart of the City,"Very good hospitality: clean, silent and comfortable room (though quite small and not sufficiently well lit), outstanding breakfast, extremely kind and forthcoming personnel. The location is excellent for someone who has work to do in the City. I plan to return in the future.",4,2014,11,07
128,Superb but not that central,"A very posh hotel, very nice if yoy book Club-rooms, then you get free breakfast and evening drinks. For a swede, the rooms are dark, with black wooden-details, and the practical solutions is not that...practical, with a wardrobe close to the window instead of close to the entrance door. But the staff is extremely nice and helpful, the service cant be better and the food is good. Problems with the name at the Brewery, they only serve Italian beer, and the two restaurants which are connected to the hotel is fully booked very often. We had bathtub in our bathroom and a open window-wall to the bedroom-part...For us who like to get to Oxford street it is to far away, even if the underground is very close to the hotel.",4,2014,11,07
128,Awesome Hotel,I stayed here for two nights and was really impressed. I got an upgrade to the Barbican Suite which was a luxury. I usually stay at Andaz and this hotel is worth visiting in future. The staff was very friendly and is located near financial district. I will definitely visit this again,5,2014,11,07
128,Good location,Good location close to the Barbican Centre and five minutes waking from Moorgate tube station. The area might be very busy during week days so it is better to ask for a quite room not facing the main street.,4,2014,11,05
128,Great weekend stay,All aspects of our stay were good. Friendly and helpful front desk staff. Very comfortable room. Location proved very convenient for some key museums and restaurants. Room had no noise issues at the weekend.,5,2014,11,05
128,Nice to find a reasonable London Hotel,"I found the Montcalm by recommendation with some reservations about certain rooms.
The Montcalm is worth recommendating but there are a few caveats. Our first room was not good, it was the seond room of a suite and in reality only a single and was equipped accordingly. Worse was the noise from the main suite room via the adjoining door, the 'neighbours' cared little for those near them. In fairness to the hotel staff they understood the complaint was not a minor 'whinge' so found a much more adequate, this time a genuines double' which was satisfactory.
There is no bar (that I could see) so the short walk to the Jugged hare, the hotel pub, was OK but the pprices in the pub were, to say the least, a bit naughty. The beer menu indicates a half pint of crafted beer can be over £8.00 - surely not? A pint of 'orninary beer (which can be obtained anywhere & a glass of white wine was £16.00 = not good.
Restaurant and bar food is available at the Jugged Hare including a dish of the same name. Other game is also on the menu and is worth trying unless like me game is necessary food in the autumn,  this is a plus but again the prices and portions are not compatible.
For what is on offer in London, the rip off capital of the world, the Moncalm is a good hotel and worth recommending however, make sure when booking, you clarify your room requirements.",4,2014,11,05
128,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm in the City over a weekend. On arrival we had a bit of an issue with the credit card, as the hotel was asking to see the card which we used for the booking. This was very annoying but then the Front office manager Megha explained and handled the situation in a very professional way. It was our daughter’s graduation and she upgraded us and showed us to our room. Later a personalised card and a bottle of wine were sent to our room. Megha Singh also met us upon our departure to bid us farewell. The hotel is beautiful with lovely staff and the rooms are very comfortable with little touches. We will definitely come back.",5,2014,11,04
128,Monty Magic,"So it maybe a little more expensive than the travel lodge, but its the heart of the city, the rooms are simply fantastic, the food is rocking and then we come to the staff, they're just ace!!  Every time!

Ensure you say hello to Megha, Simone and Alice. They run the front of house at the hotel and will look after you like you live here, only better....

Every time i stay its impressive, the check in with hot towels, the to the room service from the concierge and the club lounge make the stay memorable.

The hotel is beautiful, the pub is a pub(real good booze and food) and the bar and restaurant is that little step upward for entertaining customers or workmates.

try it. i bet you'll not find better service or rooms for the price.  No way!!",5,2014,11,04
128,Amazing Hotel Stay. The Montcalm At The Brewery London,"My family and I, including our 7 month old boy, stayed at the Montcalm at the brewery recently on Sunday night. The hotel is located near the Barbican and Moorgate station. Parking was easy enough on a yellow line and the Barbican centre near by also had good parking. Even before walking into the hotel we were warmly greeted, and helped into the hotel by the friendly door staff. The staff at reception were extremely helpful with our booking. They even had a cot taken up to our suite. We checked into the Wow suite, which was visually amazing and very well equipped. The facilities in the room were excellent. We had dinner booked in the Jugged Hare restaurant which is one of the hotels restaurants. The gastro pub has a lovely warm inviting feel. The menu was very good and specialised in local game meats.  The service by the waitors was excellent and they had a child high chair which made dining easy for our family. Breakfast the next morning was also at the Jugged Hare, which was a freshly cooked buffet style, with also a great selection of croissants, cereals, yoghurts and fruits. The Hotel also had a fitness suite, which we couldn't take advantage of due to being a family trip. The hotel has a lovely warm feel, being built into the old brewery and has kept a lot of the old key features and charm lost in a lot of newer hotels. However you'll still find all the features you need in this fantastic hotel. We will definitely be using this hotel again.",5,2014,11,03
128,Fantastic Hotel,"We've just enjoyed our second stay at this hotel. Lovely room and very comfortable bed. The staff could not be more helpful or welcoming - thank you. The location is great for the City, and some sights - St Paul's Cathedral and Tower of London. We shall definitely stay again.",5,2014,11,03
128,Stunning,"Fantastic from top to bottom, arrived to find I had been upgraded free to a suite. Cannot thank the whole staff for an amazing stay... Thoroughly recommended. Would definitely stay again, perhaps for an extra night to get more out of the facilities.",5,2014,11,03
128,Perfect!,"Lovely hotel, the staff very friendly and helpful. This place is like a maze beautiful hotel. Location is perfect. If you do stay in this hotel make sure you try the food in the jugged hare pub next door. The food is amazing! Will be coming back to this hotel, hopefully sometime soon! ",5,2014,11,02
128,Fantastic London Hotel,"From start to finish, what stood out most in this hotel was the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and delivered with genuine aim to please. Megha Singh is a credit to your hotel, keeping front of house service truly customer focused, thank you..... We had a duplex suite, which was spacious, comfortable, with a superb bed. The Club Lounge is a real asset to your stay and sets it way above other London Hotels. The location is 5 minutes from Moorgate or Barbican. You will not be disappointed with your stay, we will be back soon.",5,2014,11,02
128,Classic Hotel,"We've stayed here twice now. The hotel is very classy. We enjoyed the free wifi and much liked our room which was facing the court yard. A few things in the room really did need fixing and even though we pointed it out, they didn't do anything about it. Otherwise the service was very good. The location was great to reach the City and also the sights of the city. We'd come and stay again.",4,2014,11,01
128,Quality without Pomposity or Fuss,"Another excellent visit to this hotel. Most impressed by the calm efficiency of all the staff from the concierge, to the reception team and the supporting team.  The rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable although the modern 'low light levels are challenging. The outward formality in the appearance of the team belies their friendly nature and helpfulness and ads to the sense of 'occasion' for anyone wishing a special stay in London. The adjoining Jugged Hare pub is vibrant and lively and although we did not eat there on this visit always has a welcoming and lively atmosphere and a great menu.",5,2014,11,01
128,A masterclass in hotel management,"There are a lot of nice, classy hotels in the world, and London is no exception. A comfortable bed is definitely not hard to come by. The amount of features and added luxuries you can get, is really just a matter of how much you are willing to pay. Which is why, the lovely bathrooms and comfortable beds at the Montcalm is not a special thing, it is 'basses covered'. If guests couldn't get that here, they would just go somewhere else. 

All of the aforementioned is all the more cause to pass tremendous amounts of praise, to the people that makes this place run: The staff. The way we were welcomed with effortless courtesy, expertise felt like it was second nature at this place. The concierge team was always available and extremely helpful. Furthermore there was a sense of unity in the entire staff about the way they constructed the great 'guest experience' which I will pass on as a huge compliment to the management. It felt like being swept away by a warm wave of professionalism. I am not even the least bit ashamed to admit, that I have used the staff here as an inspiration to how I work with the staff in my restaurant.

I always read the more negative reviews of the places I visit, and the people who find the layout of this place confusing, should really learn to read a map, research the place that they are visiting, and count themselves very lucky, that hardship in their lives, comes in the form of a tricky layout of a five star hotel. 
Also I honestly believe, that if people have had a bad experience at this place, they haven't given the staff the opportunity to properly help them out, which I am sure they would have.  ",5,2014,10,31
128,"Good place, great wifi",good experience. would have been perfect if the curtains on the shower were not translucent. wifi is free and the food was ok. Staff were helpful in various ways by answering all the questions asked. overall it was nice.,4,2014,10,30
128,Very good value in the city,"We stayed at this hotel as it was close to a function we attended in the city. Our room was upgraded on arrival. It was very comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet, given the location. The club room was good and the breakfast in the Jugged Hare was superb. The service throughout was of a very high standard. The only gripe we had was the lack of hotel bar space for an after-dinner drink. One has to venture to Shoreditch for that.",4,2014,10,30
128,Beautiful but slightly pricey hotel in good location,"Great service. Clean hotel. Good location (about 5 minute walk to the Barbican station). Once inside the hotel, it can be quite a maze to get to your room, however. We had to take two elevators and walk quite a bit. They do personally guide you to your room when you arrive, however, which shows their quality of service. Our room was small but clean and comfortable. If breakfast is not included in your room price, I would recommend going elsewhere. Full English breakfast is 22 pounds per person next door at the Jugged Hair. I don't think the buffet offerings are worth that cost, although the staff is fantastic, and grabbing a beer there at the bar in the evenings is reasonable and enjoyable.",4,2014,10,30
128,Another magical stay,The hotel was extremely comfortable and the rooms well appointed.The location was simply perfect for getting to and from the main sights.The metro is less than 5 minutes away.However it was the exceptional service from the staff at reception and the service we received from the duty manageress prior to our arrival that really made our stay. We were upgraded to their luxurious city suite a most welcome  surprise.Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed.,5,2014,10,29
128,Fantastic experience - customer service is second to none,"We recently visited London for the weekend to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. We spent our first night at this beautiful hotel and were blown away by the level of service we received. There was a slight mix up with our booking, but the Front of House Manager, Megha Singh, immediately offered us an upgrade to a Wow suite, which rightly deserves its name! It was a huge, beautifully decorated room, with a four-poster bed. We couldn't have received better hospitality. She also upgraded my daughter's room to a Montcalm Club room, which was beautifully furnished and had everything anyone could possibly need to be comfortable. The fact she could watch TV from the bath tub was a real hit!

Megha also organised cakes for my daughter's birthday, at very short notice, and made sure my son wasn't left out as he's only 10 years old and was feeling a little envious of all the attention she was receiving.

The hotel is stunning, the staff attentive and Megha even came to see us personally when we checked out. Her warmth and hospitality were definitely something we will remember for a long time. We all left happy.

We will definitely choose to stay at this hotel again when we return to London and would highly recommend it. The service really is second to none!",5,2014,10,29
128,fair price for very good standard and very friendly staff,"We have stayed for a longer weekend in Montcalm Hotel. It has good location, very friendly staff, very good room standard. It is also good value for money. If I would have to distinguish just one thing it would be definitely very good service.",4,2014,10,28
128,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff","Spent my wedding weekend in the Montcalm and we were instantly upgraded to wow suite which is spectacular, Thankyou  so much Simona.
breakfast and food was really nice. Had a good selection in the club lounge. Fantastic service even helped us find parking on the Monday morning. The hotel is stunning and rooms amazing in a perfect part of London. Yet staff made you feel comfortable and at home. 

Thankyou everyone for a splendid wedding weekend. 

Jennifer",5,2014,10,28
128,"Great stay, great room, friendly staff",2 night stay for my wife's 40th Birthday. We received a complimentary upgrade to a club room which was amazing. The staff we're really friendly on arrival and the facilities were all first class. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2014,10,27
128,Fantastic!,"Weekend booked in London to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. Hotel staff were absolutely fantastic. We were given a free upgrade from a deluxe room to a London City suite. It was amazing. Lovely surprise when a complimentary bottle of champagne was delivered to the room too. Will definitely return to this hotel. It was immaculately clean, lovely rain shower, lounge area to chill out and comfortable bed. Loved the Hermes toiletries too!",5,2014,10,27
128,"Nice facilities, nice hotel, great food","Two night stay, first on business the next for leisure. Hotel is well presented, staff are immaculate and very polite. I was shown to my room, the concierge offered a different room. Had a few drinks whist it was getting ready. Another concierge, Kalin, showed me the new room. Great, little traffic noise if any. Good room service food and menu. Will stay again. Cheers.",5,2014,10,26
128,Very friendly staff,"The staff here are amongst the most helpful I've ever encountered, a credit to the hotel. Cleanliness of the hotel was very good and the food at the Jugged Hare was outstanding. On the down side the room was quite small, but had everything you need, just not what we'd expected. There was more noise from the road than I expected but it was tolerable. Couldn't work out why there was a plastic bag tied around the smoke detector/alarm on the ceiling? Some loose tiles in the bathroom.

So not quite the 5 Star experience but would still recommend a visit.",4,2014,10,26
128,First Class,"This was a first class experience, from the Elemis bathroom products to the swanky room. The Jugged Hare was good too. Would like to go back and stay longer than the one night! 
Excellent, excellent and excellent!",5,2014,10,26
128,Mostly good,"The hotel is in good condition, staff were polite.  2 night stay for business.

Upsides:
 * large comfortable bed
 * very convenient location
 * best hotel wifi I've ever seen, no silly login screens and fast.

Downsides were:
 * Room was cold overnight -- single glazed windows!
 * A little noisy from around 7AM (not street noise, some kind of carts being moved around on cobbles below) -- again, single glazing!
 * Housekeeping wasn't 100%, used glasses not cleaned up by next evening and only a single towel in bathroom, towels not as warm+fluffy as they should be.
 * Hotel is quite spread out so getting from room to reception is a kind of interesting navigation experience.

So in general good, but not quite as flawless as I am accustomed to in a 5 start establishment.  Would use again for business but not for pleasure.",4,2014,10,24
128,Superb,"Stayed at the Montcalm for one night on a business trip. The hotel is first class, and the service doubly so. The room was (for a London hotel) spacious and spotlessly clean. The area is well worth exploring, with the City and Leadenhall and Smithfield markets not too far away. The pub next door (Jugged Hare) is very good, with excellent food, but crowded early evening (as, to be fair, all city pubs tend to be). I'd thoroughly recommend the hotel, and would use it again without hesitation.",5,2014,10,23
128,What an amazing hotel!!,"Stayed here recently on a business trip and was wow'd by everything. As you walk in you can feel and see the attention to detail level. From the smooth and friendly check-in, breakfast, room cleanliness and up to checkout, everything was just top notch. Will definitely stay here again.
Thank you all",5,2014,10,22
128,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel due to the history, fit out and great staff.  The Jugged Hare pub attached to the hotel is fantastic with the steak simply awesome and not a bad buffet breakfast.

My only issue was that I was located in a room that required a rabbit warren approach to the room from reception but nevertheless if I required to stay in London City again, I would revisit this hotel.",4,2014,10,21
128,This hotel spoiled me.,"This hotel is definitely a place where you want to start and end your day.  The customer service provided by the staff was amazing.  I have never felt so welcome at an establishment.  At first it was a bit jarring to have such service, but it quickly became evident that they truly wanted to make your stay special.  We had a club room which included breakfast and evening drinks with canapes.  I would highly recommend this option, not only is the food good, but the experience is better.

If you are lucky enough to be helped by Adrian, enjoy it!  He goes above and beyond the call of duty.  He helped us figure out where to go, helped us with luggage, and made sure we were taken care of before we headed to the airport.  He was also training a new hire, Marian I believe, who was also very helpful.  The employee who helped us during breakfast service was also very good, but unfortunately we did not catch his name.  

This hotel is a bit pricy, but it is all well worth it.  The rooms were very nice and clean, and the charm of the old building is perfect.  This is why I said this hotel has spoiled me.  I will need to save up before I go to London again, because I would not stay anywhere else.  You may not be in the center of everything here, but you can easily take a train or cab to another area.  It's sort of nice to be tucked away from the busy tourist areas though.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone heading to London!",5,2014,10,21
128,"Certainly not a five star, comfortable but small rooms","We were staying here as we attended an event at The Brewery so it was easy. Fortunately we got a discounted rate to the rack as otherwise it would have definitely been overpriced.
When we arrived we were put in an inter connecting room, a pet hate of mine and I never understand why hotels do this for parties who are not staying together.
I asked to be moved and they moved me to... another room with an inter connecting door. Finally we moved again to a standard double room, no inter connecting door.
Beds were small but comfy, not used to a double and usually hotels are at least a kingsize. Rooms were quite small but well equipped. In the 3 rooms we saw all bathrooms were different sizes, some huge some tiny so not sure why they are not all more of a standard size.
Some of the rooms have double glazing others don't so may have been more noisy, we were right next to some sort of generator which could be heard throughout the night. 
I realise it's a listed building so can't be quite as modern as other five star hotels I've stayed in however I think the rate reflects this.",3,2014,10,19
128,Calm and inspiring stay,"I stayed in Montcalm hotel for one night with my husband. I was there for a conference. It was a relaxing hotel with very friendly personal. The breakfast was delicious. Only the wellness is poor, one sauna and hammam (hammam was out of order). But maybe if that is fixed you can relax a little longer. Price/ quality is excellent for london!",5,2014,10,19
128,Pretty good - but one or two things holding it back,"Had high expectations as absolutely love their sister property near Marble Arch. However, the first room I saw was on the ground floor which I wasn't happy with in central London. The second room had a 'king' bed which was actually two beds pushed together and zipped up - incredlibly uncomfortable. 
The room was well appointed and spotless, the service was excellent and the club lounge offering great, but fundementally if they can't get the beds right, it's a big deal.",4,2014,10,14
128,Interesting experience,"This hotel wasn't too far from St James cathedral and the Barbican but then I was in London for work. It was a 5 minutes walk from Moorgate station which is convenient when coming from Paddington Station after getting off the Heathrow express.

Staff were very helpful and polite and hotel was very trendy. Rooms, however, though very clean, were a bit gimmicky with lights in strange places like close to the floor. It took me a good 1/2 hour before I figured out how to switch them all off... and that was not a good thing when you're jet-lagged. The bathroom had a sink as big as a loaf of bread. I could not lower my face close to the sink as my head hits the wall, if I did. Also, strangely, the bathroom mirror was about 1 yard to the right on another wall. Other than these, it did not really matter that the room was small as it was very comfortable and well equipped. They even provided a complimentary platter of fruits, which was a nice touch.

I hear that the restaurant at the hotel is well worth visiting, though I did not have the time for it.",4,2014,10,14
128,Quirky; good staff; good room service,"I had a somewhat odd stay.  I originally booked the London Suites by Montcalm which is located across the street.  When I arrived, the hotel was closed and I was told to check in at this hotel.  I wasn't expecting this, given I called the day before my check in to confirm my reservation at the other hotel.

At check in I was given a large room, which they insisted was ""the largest and most beautiful"".  It was a decent size, large for London standards and included club access.  

Club - The club, if you get access, is a comfortable room which as chairs, couches, free beer and drinks, some snacks in the afternoon and a nice breakfast spread.  

Internet - Very very fast and reliable.  No issues during my week stay.

Service - Great.  The doormen were particularly good and friendly.

Room service - I ordered it several times during my stay.  I found it to be a good value and the food was high quality.  I also had a chance to dine at the hotel's restaurants multiple times.  The Jugged Hare, their gastropub is quite delicious.  Highly recommended.

Room - The room was nice.  The bed was comfortable.  The shower was great lots of pressure.  My only complaint is that the fan in the bathroom was quite loud.  Also, the drains made some loud noises here and there.",4,2014,10,12
128,top service,great service..amazing helpful desktop named Manish. Helped me finding a friend in a nearby bar. gave me nice tips for my first London Trip..overwhelming nice service. will come back for sure. thank you very much for you kindness,5,2014,10,11
128,A Quirky Hotel in the City,"The hotel situated near the Barbican offers an interesting experience. On arrival, the staff were very attentive and the concierge staff showed me to my room. This was a necessity since the layout of the hotel is quirky to say the least. The room was very acceptable and comfortable but finding one's way back to reception was difficult. Since I was on the second floor I had to use two separate lifts to descend. Unfortunately I ended up in the staff lift, having followed wall signs to reception. This tatty lift took me to the kitchen area of an adjacent restaurant, So beware! A colleague took breakfast the next morning in the restaurant of the Jugged Hare which is used by the hotel. The comments were not favourable-cold coffee, lukewarm food.
Nevertheless I would recommend this hotel despite the cost..",4,2014,10,09
128,Excellent service,"The hotel sent a note ahead of our arrival asking if they could do anything special and I mentioned it was my husband's 50th birthday.  When we arrived, we had been upgraded to a better room and a bottle of champagne was provided on the house !!  What a fantastic surprise.  The decor was stunning.  Front desk staff excellent.",5,2014,10,08
128,Sleepless in the City...,As I write this I have had the worst nights sleep in years and I have a 9 month old daughter! Initial impressions of the Montcalm were positive and to be fair the room is nicely decorated and reasonably comfortable. However the room I was allotted (033) is literally on the main road at ground level and there is a single glazed window between the occupant and the constant stream of London traffic that passes 10 foot away. Not a great way to start your working day.....,2,2014,10,08
128,Good location and plenty of character,"Stayed here the first weekend of October with my wife and a nice stay. The Montcalm is a lovely building with plenty of history behind it being situated in the former Whitbread brewery, for which the management are rightfully proud. We felt the hotel had a good feel about it with helpful staff and exceptionally clean and well appointed public areas, as was our Montcalm club room which had all the conveniences you could want. We particularly liked the original exposed vaulted brick ceiling and pillars in the room but thought the lighting and controls were a touch frustrating. 
We visited the adjoining Jugged Hare pub on the Friday evening and were impressed - good choice of beers and a buzzy after work atmosphere 10/10. 
The club lounge on the other hand was a bit of a disappointment as it didn't really offer much of an exclusive feel or provide much of an incentive to spend much time there, even though it is pitched as a major plus to upgrading your room level for the perk of a fairly standard continental breakfast and complimentary(?) drinks and nibbled early evening in a ok lounge - not convinced.
We were however very happy with the location of the hotel - less than 5 mins walk to Moorgate tube and around the same into nearby Shoreditch which has a great nightlife and choice of very good restaurants. Taxi into the west end or to Kings cross/st Pancras about £15.

I can definitely recommend the Montcalm for a comfortable and relaxing stay, though can't help but feel the 5 star luxury promise is somehow delivered a little short sadly. ",4,2014,10,07
128,Great hotel but not the best location,"The hotel is an old brewery and part of its charm includes the warren of corridors and rooms. The hotel is charismatic and charming. Our room was spacious and very comfortable and close to lifts that took us directly to the courtyard or The Jugged Hare (Upmarket Pub) for easy access to the street, thus avoiding the many stairs and corridors. The staff were mainly helpful and there was a great feel to the hotel. We were in a Club room so we also had access to breakfast (fairly poor) and drinks and nibbles in the evenings (pretty good.) 
Unfortunately, we found the location difficult, especially if you were tourists. It was just a little too far from all of the main sites. We used the tube constantly but still found we were quite a distance away from the main tourist, theatre and shopping areas. A shame as we enjoyed the hotel.",4,2014,10,06
128,Nice Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the weekend.  

The check-in was smooth and although our room was ready as we were very early on Saturday morning, they stored our bags for us and when we returned a few hours later our bags had been put in our room.

We used the complimentary lounge which was stated as being open 24hrs a day for some refreshment late on the Saturday evening (we had wanted to go to the bar but there was a private function on and so we were not allowed in, also the pub on the corner was packed to the rafters), however there were no staff around in the lounge so we just went to bed.  Bit disappointing seeing as we were told the lounge was open 24hrs a day.

We used the same lounge for breakfast the next morning.  A nice young man took my order for a pot of tea but this took nearly 20minutes to arrive.  I asked 3 times for the pot of tea and on each occasion he said he was seeing to it.  I had finished my breakfast by the time the tea had arrived.  

The room in the hotel was lovely.  Very clean and very comfortable.  The bed was a little on the high side, not a problem for me as I am quite tall but I can imagine difficult for someone shorter.
However, the bed once in it was very comfortable.  

The location of the hotel is about a 10-15minute walk from Barbican tube station.  

Wifi is free within the hotel.

Overall this is a very nice hotel, lovely design and comfortable.  
Service could be improved in some areas.",4,2014,10,06
128,"Fantastic room and location, but snooty staff!","My friend and I choose this hotel as we wanted something nice, in a decent location, and affordable. I really liked the neighborhood it is in as it is easy to get around and not a far walk to other nice neighborhoods. The room was very clean with a nice modern decor. Plenty of space for luggage, clothing, and lots of outlets which I always like. Heating/ac worked well too. Very comfty bed and we got a fruit plate upon arrival which was an added touch.
   My only major complaint about this hotel was the front desk staff. Many times when we asked a question, the person we asked did not know and we had to wait for someone else. When we tried to order a taxi cab to go to the airport the next morning, the front desk staff member told us that it would be an extra 10 GBP to go to more than one terminal, but assured us both terminals were in walking distance. This obviously is not true, especially if it is an extra 10 GBP cost. I wasn't very impressed either with the concierge- give me some options, not just the two restaurants on the corner.

I would stay here again, but with keeping in mind not to rely on front desk staff.",4,2014,10,06
128,Good value on a deal,Got a deal on Expedia for £180 instead of £335 which was good value for a zone 1 hotel.  In the old Whitbread brewery which was the first commercial brewery in the UK.  The building is stunning.  Lots of people have commented in the reviews that it was hard to navigate your way around the hotel but I'd disagree.  Everything is clearly signposted and you are given a map on arrival.  The hotel has a pub attached to it - The Jugged Hare - where we had drinks with friends before moving on.  The room itself was OK - nothing spectacular.  God option if you need to be close to the City or Shoreditch.  We were out that evening in Hoxton and ate the following day at Spitalfields.,4,2014,10,03
128,"""Loved this place""","I just love places like this. I believe it was an old brewery and that the hotel has been designed throughout this wonderful place with a huge courtyard and a real taste of old fashioned London.
I was really impressed with all the staff from start to finish they were excellent. The room and facilities were great. Unfortunately we were only there for one night to see the rememberance poppies but will go back soon. Just a note that also on the site there are the Chiswell Dining Rooms that looked a lovely spot to dine at next time but for me the star of the show was the Jugged Hare an old fashioned pub that is really special, it's menu is predominantly game with some awesome bar snacks.",5,2014,10,02
128,nice,"This hotel offers everything you need to enjoy your stay in London: quiet, clean and well thought out rooms, all the services at a reasonable price. The lack of a restaurant is noticeable just when you pay the bill. There is plenty of choices for breakfast (with the possibility to order it the night before and have it delivered to your room), lunch and dinner just on your doorstep. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. 

Stayed September 2014, travelled as a couple",5,2014,10,02
128,Lovely.,"stayed here for my boyfriends birthday, upgraded to the club room, was spacious and very nice.
All members of staff were really helpful and very professional,
enjoyed our stay here and would go back again one day.

Its very basic but is good for a business stay or just an over night stay.",4,2014,10,01
128,Very comfortable,"Had a really nice weekend in London and this is a nice lush hotel to relax in. 
Bed was very comfortable and bathroom really modern.
The only drawback was the area. The hotel is in the business end of town so not much open nearby on the weekend. We tended to frequent the pub attached to the hotel.",4,2014,10,01
128,Good Hotel; Location OK; noisy in the morning; exec lounge poor,"I stayed at the Montcalm on the weekend of 27/28 September; arrived Saturday morning and left Monday morning.
The hotel location is OK. Perfectly situated if you are working in The City. A short walk from Barbican or Moorgate tube stations. The walk from Barbican is probably easier and mostly undercover if it is raining.
The reception staff were very welcoming. We were unable to check into our room straight away so they arranged to store our bags and take them to the room once it was available. Sure enough, our bags were waiting for us in our room when we returned. Nice touch.
Stayed in room 305; nicely presented room with plenty of space. Not sure about the glass partition between the bedroom and bathroom. I guess if you like relaxing in the bath you can see the TV. Not really for me though.
Our room came with access to the Executive Lounge which offered continental breakfast, drinks and snacks early evening and drinks on a 24 hour basis. We visited the lounge at 22:00 on the Saturday evening but nothing appeared to be available and no staff were around to ask so we gave it a miss.
Breakfast in the lounge on Sunday morning wasn't brilliant. The selection of food and drink was OK but the staff were a little too keen to help. They insisted on making the tea and coffee even though the machines were there for everyone to help themselves. The drinks didn't arrive for 15 minutes which was nonsense. The staff would be better focussing on clearing the tables rather than serving drinks. Also, one of the tables had finished and were sitting talking - the waiter asked them to leave as they were expecting more people coming in for breakfast. Don't really agree with this, especially on a Sunday morning. If more residents would have come in I am sure they would have found space somewhere within the room.
The main gripe was the noise from outside the room especially first thing in the morning. The soundproofing provided by the door was very poor and as a consequence you could hear a lot of what was going on outside. On Sunday morning we were woken up at 7:00 by the sound of doors continually banging. It would appear that the fire doors close overnight and as a result you have a constant banging every time someone walks along the corridor. This was very annoying.
As a summary; the hotel is very well presented and is enjoyable in parts but I would not return. In my opinion there are better hotels in London for a similar rate.",3,2014,10,01
128,Not quite 5 star,"I doubt that inspectors would still find this place deserves 5stars.  Too many small areas need tweaking to make it as expected.  This was my second stay in two years and I doubt I would stay again unless in the area and it had bargain rates.  Stayed in a suite room which was glad drain problems in the shower room and no bath.  Lights were not working properly either so moved to another suite.  New suite still had no working mirror lights and no working plug socket at the desk.  Convertible sofa bed which was fit for the bin and certainly not for sleeping on, have never slept on anything so ridiculous.  Despite making complaints heard these were not fixed.  Room service was also inadequate and needed three trips to get the correct order.  Upon leaving I was told my complaints would be passed on which was a disappointing response.  Having said this the hotel has some positive points in that the staff are helpful and friendly with good concierge.  The boutique hotel offers nice surroundings and not that of standard chain hotels.  To summarise I would only suggest a stay if you are not expecting 5 star service and rooms.",3,2014,09,30
128,5 star excellence,"Just a great hotel. A 10 minute walk to either Moorgate (rail & tube) and Barbican tube station. But some of the other tourist hot spots are also in walking distance: Tower Bridge is a 30 minute walk in one direction, with St Paul's a 20 minute walk in the other. The staff is very attentive, and will walk you to your room, while telling you about the historic origins of the building on your way there (a guide is needed because the hotel is a bit of a maze!) We stayed in the (smallest) Deluxe room, which is petite but large enough for that price. The glass room between the bath- and bedroom is interesting, and the electric blind that can be lowered in front provided at least 10 minutes of fun.  

Because everything is so perfect, it was the little things that stood out negatively: one of the small mirrors in the bathroom was loose, with glue showing. The soap tray in the bath was also loose, and the extractor fan made an annoying hissing sound. But these are very small niggles in an otherwise perfect stay. In fact, we liked it so much that we are cancelling the (much more expensive-) hotel we planned to stay in for a few weeks from now, and book another weekend in the Montcalm instead.",4,2014,09,30
128,Oozes Quality,"I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend who had organised the stay for my birthday. Upon arrival the staff were very attentive and carried our bags to our room. The rooms are fantastic - lots of character, but also very modern. The glass-wall bathroom means you can watch TV while taking a bath. The super-kingsize bed was incredibly comfortable and everything about the room was clean.

The hotel is only a short walk from Moorgate underground station so you're never too far from things. Only complaint is that there was some noise outside on both nights from people working in other buildings - it sounded like bins being moved and filled. The windows weren't double glazed so it didn't keep the sound out enough.

Overall though I can't complain too much because it's the best London hotel I've ever stayed in.",5,2014,09,29
128,Great Hotel !!,"From the concierge, to the reception staff, to the porters and management, the whole team really made our stay very enjoyable. The room was fantastic, not least since we were given an immediate upgrade on arrival, to celebrate our first stay in the Montcalm. The location was ideal and less than a 5 min walk to the nearest tube. Will definitely be returning !!",5,2014,09,29
128,1st Class Service,"This was my fifth time to stay in the Montcalm. It's a perfect location for my business meeting in the city. Once again the staff were excellent and couldn't be more helpful. The room was very well stocked with complimentary fruit,water and toiletries. A 1st class hotel with a 1st class service.",5,2014,09,28
128,10/10 ! A Superb choice!!,"Excellent in every way ....!!! The staff , the room , the location , the service!!! We have enjoyed every minute of our stay!!!! Very close to the underground station and as a result very easy to go anywhere in London.",5,2014,09,27
128,Amazing experience,"I had a one night stay here on 25/9 booked via LBG I was working in our local offices closeby.  The hotel was spectacular in every way and had really good 5* customer service and there is nothing they cannot do for you.  I was given an upgrade as it was my first visit which made me feel really special. The Front Office Manager Megha was really friendly and introduced herself and also her colleague the Exec Housekeeper Catherine who is from Glasgow so it was nice to hear another Scottish voice.  The rooms are luxurious and I had the best nights sleep in a long time. I had breakfast in the Club Room before departing for my flight home and there was a lovely selection of various fresh fruits, cereals, yoghurt, pastries, croissants, toast, cold meats, cheese and salmon all available. I will definitely stay there again and let all my LBG colleagues know when back in the office how good my stay was and let them try the experience themselves when they are next traveling to London - highly recommended.",5,2014,09,26
128,Solid London Hotel,"The Montcalm is probably the third or fourth chain to try their hand at this location (according to bewildered taxi drivers trying to find it) and it's safe to say they've done a good, but not great job at turning this hotel into a nice one.

First off, this hotel is very reasonably priced for a hotel with this level of amenities in London. The location is not ideal as it's not near anything except the Museum of London you'd want to go to, but tube stations are a five minute walk for the Circle Line/Northern which largely eliminates these issues. This hotel feels a bit like a business hotel, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's efficient and to the point.

We stayed four nights in a club room (marginally more than a normal room when I booked it) and had a lovely time. Minor mechanical issues (screen wouldn't shut, bathtub stopper was broken) were attended to promptly. The main benefit of the club room is free breakfast/an evening selection of drinks/sandwiches/appetizers that comes in handy when you're trying to stay fed in London. 

The layout is a bit awkward, but navigable once you figure it out. On the whole, a good hotel and a good value in London.",4,2014,09,24
128,Great Hotel,A wonderful place to stay. Great accommodations and the staff here are absolutely awesome. We were taken great care of after a very long flight from Canada and the hotel staff could not have done better to look after us. Koodos to management. Your people made our 3 day stay exceptional. Room was lovely & well equipped. Quiet area  but certainly accessible to get around. A definite reccommend. My sister and I would stay here again. Hands down.,5,2014,09,23
128,Luxury and service!,I have stayed many times here and will always go back. The service you get is second to none and I am always very well looked after by Megha and her excellent team. The rooms are fantastic. The Deluxe Room which I have used the most are so comfortable and the beds are to die for!! Rooms are spotlessly clean and the en suite bathroom immaculate. I have been lucky to also stay in the Club Double and Wow Suite which are both an experience. The Wow suite particularly with its four poster bed. The Jugged Hare is an excellent place to wind down and relax and the food and drink on offer is first class. I cannot wait to return again!,5,2014,09,23
128,Elegant and quiet,"Lovely Hotel in an area which is quiet at weekends. Just to the side of the Barbican centre, it has the Jugged Hare pub attached. It's origins are actually the old whitbread brewery building.
Check-in was smooth and welcoming, having noted it was my wife's 50th Birthday, we had our room upgraded, which was a bonus. 
The suite was excellent, comfortable, and very quiet. 
We went out through the Jugged Hare on Friday night and it was heaving, so we headed elsewhere to eat. 
As others have said, the extras ( minibar, breakfast etc) are seriously overpriced, we simply chose to avoid them. 
For a weekend break it was great, the downside is the location, which is a 30 minute tube ride from the theatres in the West End.",5,2014,09,22
128,One night in heaven...,"A very lovely hotel in a nice and quiet area. The underground station is only a short walk away (about 5 mins) and there is a ""Barclays Cycle Hire"" docking station just around the corner (We highly recommend to rent a bike because on short distances it's cheaper than a taxi and it's so much fun!) The staff is very attentive and friendly! The check-in as well as the check-out were very fast although at check-out were many people in front of us. The room was small but very comfortable, clean and nicely done up. We had a bottle of water and some apples in our room for free as well as a coffee machine for coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Highly recommended!!!",5,2014,09,22
128,Weekend in London,"I often use the Montcalm for work so it was the first choice when I took my wife to London for the weekend.  The staff provide a warm welcome, stayed in one of the club rooms with access to the club lounge for breakfast, the staff in the club lounge were very helpful and made a great cup of coffee!  The hotel is ideally situated in the heart of London, and surrounded with nice pubs and restaurants.  The room (Club Double) was spacious and had everything you needed for a weekend away.",5,2014,09,22
128,Lovely weekend stay,"A very lovely hotel, in an area that is nice and quiet at the weekend. Though should you want to party, Old Street and Hoxton are a very short stroll away, and there are plenty of nice pubs and eateries in the area. Stayed in a beautiful duplex room, and had a cracking meal in the attached Jugged Hare - the dish of the same name is exquisite, as is the blood sausage starter. Stayed on our anniversary after getting married at the same venue last year, and the staff were very attentive and friendly, which was the nicest thing of all. Highly recommended.",5,2014,09,21
128,Pure Bliss!,"We arrived and were welcomed by the very attentive staff who gave us a cold towel to wipe our hands and checked us in efficiently before personally guiding us to our room. The room iself (deluxe double) was quite small but had everything we needed for our 1 night stay. The rooms are decorated and lit beautifully with all amenities we could ever want- the rain shower is amazing and bed extremely comfortable!
Thank you for a lovely stay, we will be recommending to friends and this will be our first choice on any return visits we make to the capital.",5,2014,09,21
128,perfect,I stayed here for one night for my boyfriend's birthday and everything was perfect. The staff were so lovely and sent us up a complimentary bottle of wine. The rooms were clean and the hotel overall had a very friendly atmosphere. Location is also perfect if you're into the east London scene.,5,2014,09,21
128,A bit of a warren but comfortable,"I stay here on business trips as the location is perfect for the office.  The reception area is lovely and the staff welcoming and professional.  You are taken to your room as the layout can be confusing.  Lots of ups and downs and lifts going to some floors then stairs to take.  You are given a map of the floors on arrival, however, the signage is so good that the map isn't necessary.  The room I was in, 501, was lovely.  A good size, plenty of lighting options, nice bathroom, snug but everything you need oh and with a feature I liked, which was a powered blind over the glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom, plus volume control, which enabled you to raise it and watch and listen to the big tv whilst in the shower.  Small things make a difference.  The bed was very comfortable and I had 2 nights great sleep...very important on working trips.  Free wifi provided, plenty of storage space and a safe.  Continental breakfast was included in the club room.  This was plentiful with a good selection of cereals, porridge, fruit, pastries and bread for toasting. My only concern was the selection of cold meats and cheese.  All processed, with reformed ham and slices of square cheese you find in packets in the supermarket. I'd have liked to have seen real cheese and more meat options of a better quality.  All in all, I enjoyed the stay and will be back next time I'm in London.",4,2014,09,21
128,"Oasis in a sea of blah, blah, blah","The Montcalm at the Brewery is a charming and quaint hotel in a historically renovated building.  The rooms are very well appointed, with excellent features such as a ceiling rainfall shower and beautiful slate in the bathroom.  The two restaurants/bars that are part of the hotel offer excellent food and a lively ambience. The biggest disappointment with The Montcalm is its location. It's surrounded by office buildings with nearly non-existent restaurants, retail or activities nearby, and the area lacks any charm. As well the tube stop is a small bit of a hike to get to, especially if it's raining. Despite how nice the hotel is I'm not planning to stay here again because the surrounding area is a bit soulless.",4,2014,09,20
128,Disappointed by size of room given the price I had paid & staff did nothing about it.,"Was traveling on business by myself. Cost for room after taxes and fees for two nights came to about $845 US Dollars. Hotel is a maze to walk through or at least it was to get to my room on the 5th floor South. After traveling quite a distance from the hotel reception to get to the room - needed to use two elevators plus a lot of walking up and down steps finally got to it. The hallways looked very nice but the room was so small there is no way two people could sleep in the bed never mind stand in the room at the same time. Even for one person it was so tight to maneuver through the room. The ceilings were angled which made the room appear even smaller. The TV was attached to an arm bolted into the angled ceiling directly above the desk. You could not sit at the desk without hitting your head on the TV. The TV had lines running through it. The less than twin sized bed - more like a bunk bed size went wall to wall. I mentioned to the staff upon seeing it for the first time that I felt the room was very small. The bathroom was nice but had no electric outlets in it.  Could they move me into another room?  They acknowledged my complaint but informed me there were no other rooms available and because I purchased it through Expedia there was nothing they could do. Instead they gave me three apples.  Really? I know rooms in London are typically smaller but this was crazy. I have been to London four times in the past four years staying in downtown London each time. The room was so small that when you opened up an ironing board to press a shirt you could not move  within the room. You were physically stuck. 

For $842.50 USD for two nights am I unreasonable to expect more from the Montcalm? I don't think so. For a hotel that claims service and guest happiness are their top priorities, they have really let me down. Notwithstanding some of the other reviews, they did not care about me and probably won't care about you. They had an opportunity to make things right but didn't care to do so.",1,2014,09,20
128,Such a lovely hotel,"Stayed here with a friend a as we were going to a concert near by.
What a lovely hotel, easy to get to and great access to the city. The room was really nice and very comfortable, and the plate of fruit was really wonderful.
the next time we go to London I will definately be staying here!",5,2014,09,18
128,Just amazing in every way,"This is a late review as we stayed for a weekend at the Montcalm in May, but it's worth reading.

From the moment we arrived we could clearly see we were at a facility that knew how to give amazing Customer Service without the 'in your face type'. The welcome from all the staff was very professional and friendly. It was clear that they had good training and set high standards for hospitality. We stayed in a room on the Ground Floor but required to go up to the first floor to gain access, while this can be bothersome it was worth it really. 

The amenities within the room were truly 5 star - they had umbrella, extra blankets, cushions, shoe horn, cleaning kit, shoes bag, laundry bag, tea making facilities,TV with personalised welcome screen, free Wifi with good signal. 

The room was exceptionally clean, fresh linen and towels and had a wonderful minibar plus complimentary fruit on arrival. The fourposter bed was really comfortable and the double shower over bath was a delight. I could not find a fault and it was reasonably priced, cheaper than some hotels I frequented in central London last month. It was quiet and the concierge made a point of explaining all the facilities. 

Like other reviewers the hotel was a rare find and truly worth the little extra - keep up the good word guys.",5,2014,09,18
128,Not the greatness i was expecting.,"We were having a mini break in London for our wedding anniversary. We couldn't decide on where to stay, but after looking at their website and other reviews we decided to book a room at the Montcalm Brewery.

We had actually found a good deal with a 3rd party agent via who was offering a cheaper price with breakfast . I called the hotel to see if they could beat the offer, and they offered me a cheaper price. £4 cheaper and no breakfast! When i informed them of their best rate guarantee, they eventually gave me a better deal with breakfast included.

The hotel isn't located in the hustle and bustle of the city which is nice, but it's still located very centrally for you to get around. 2 tube stations are very close by, Moorgate and Barbican. Barbican being the easiest as it's just down the 1 pad to the hotel.

On arrival at the hotel, the reception staff were very pleasant and advised us that we had been upgraded to a club double room which was nice. 

The hotel is a bit of a maze, so one of the staff showed us the way. 2 lifts, a couple of corridors and some stairs later we arrived in our room.

The room was a lot smaller then i imagined, and this club room was 5 square metes bigger then the room we had booked, so i hate to imagine how small that would have been. We were quickly shown the amenities of the room, and how to use the air conditioning etc.

Window View: The view we had was of a building that was about 1.5m from the window. There was nothing to see except this building and what looked like store rooms. You really didn't get any natural light into the room, which was pretty dark as it was. Even during the day, it felt like evening time in the room.

Bed: The bed was very comfortable and the pillows surprisingly good, and we got a good nights sleep in it.

Bathroom: The bathroom was a good size, and came with Elemis amenities, which according to their website, is supplied in deluxe rooms, and club rooms should have Hermés toiletries. We wasn't to impressed with the bathroom though. The rain shower was very weak. It was easier to just use the shower hose as more water came out of it. Running a bath took a lot of time. We had the taps open full, and the water came out pretty slow. In total it took about 23mins to fill the bath up. We had a slight problem with the toilet where after it flushed the water kept on coming out into the bowl like it was constantly flushing. To stop it we had to press the flush button several times. The light on the vanity mirror did not work. If you was standing by the sink you had to be mindful of the bathroom room as it wouldn't stay fully open, so it would start to close on to you.

Bath robes are supplied for you to use which was nice, and they were soft and fluffy.

Air Conditioning: This worked pretty well. Luckily we liked the room cool!! The control panel (see photo) was complicated to work and set. We would adjust the temperature and it just didn't seem to want to do what we told it. it was pretty much on blowing cold air or off for us. We used the white dial as instructed and that just didn't do noting.

Breakfast: Continental breakfast was served in the club lounge. The lounge is nice, with the option of seating on the leather sofas, or use the table and chairs. It looked like it would accommodate about 20 people, so could be a problem if lots of people ate at the same time. However, when we went for breakfast there was only a small number of people. Breakfast was nice. The usual continental style of cold meats and pastries.

Overall, i was expecting a lot better from a 5 star hotel, but left feeling rather disappointed by what was meant to be a unique hotel.",3,2014,09,17
128,Fabulous,"This was the first visit to the Montcalm and I have stayed for one week. It was a good experience, the location, the room size and especially the welcoming employees especially the recipient lady ""Monia"" was very friendly with a lovely smile and ""Elice"" was very helpful tooo.  I love this hotel a lot.",5,2014,09,17
128,Amazing experience,This was my first visit to the hotel and I couldn't recommend it more. I stayed in the london city suites with my girlfriend for only one night but we were both extremley impressed. Amazing attention to detail and wonderful staff. The touch of the pub on the corner for breakfast was brilliant. The area surrounding is lovely as well. Will definitely be back again.,5,2014,09,16
128,Excellent,"I have stayed in many hotels on London but this is without a doubt my favourite. 
The reception is always efficient for checkin/out and the staff courteous.
The rooms are fab. Yes some are a bit smaller than other hotels but the facilities are first rate - I love the fact that the fruit is so shiny.
I always struggle to sleep but the beds are amazing and I always sleep really well.
Can't wait to go back ",5,2014,09,15
128,Very nice-would recommend,"I stayed on a Friday night and as other guests say, the welcome from all the staff was friendly, helpful and very professional. It was clear that they had received training in looking after their guests every need and set high standards for hospitality. (Included in the room were umbrella, extra blankets and cushions, shoe horn and cleaning kit, shoes bag, laundry bag, tea making facilities,TV with personalised welcome screen, free Wifi with good signal and no password to mess about with). 

The room was clean, fresh linen and towels and had a wonderful minibar plus complimentary fruit on arrival. The double bed was really comfortable and the double shower over bath was a delight. 

This hotel could teach many others a thing or two. I could not find a fault and it was reasonably priced, cheaper than some hotels I frequented in central London last month.

It was quiet and the concierge made a point of explaining all the facilities.The receptionist explained everything clearly about breakfast and spa facilities. (I didn't use these but it was good to know these are available).

Its also very close to Barbican tube station (5 mins) or Moorgate (10 mins)
I rarely find such a good hotel with amenities plus good customer care- well done Montcalm- your staff did you proud!",5,2014,09,15
128,Excellent Stay,"This was our second visit to The Montcalm at the Brewery London City, but our first for the Montcalm Club. It was a great experience and one we will use again. Great staff, Lovely rooms and a good atmosphere.",5,2014,09,15
128,Venue,"Excellent wedding venue. Visited for a friends wedding reception, friendly attentive staff, amazing cake decorating skills, good choice of rooms and even luxurious loos. Bar prices were a little expensive but it is London after all. We'll situated for public transport being less than 5 minutes from Barbican.",5,2014,09,14
128,Nice room,"My room was on the top floor. Whilst it took time to get to it, the room was modern, clean and well presented. Having stayed before I knew what to expect but this room was much quieter than those at the front and it was more spacious than others. Dinner at the Chiswell Dining Rooms was great also and just next door.",4,2014,09,14
128,Pure Excellence,"We stayed for one night in one of the suites. The room was lovely, spacious and spotlessly clean. The staff welcoming and extremely polite. We also had an evening meal and breakfast at the Jugged Hare which was faultless. We will definitely be back. ",5,2014,09,14
128,Good value,"Booked using hotel's own website and got a better deal than the discount websites. Good value for money particularly as upgraded. Extras like breakfast , film viewing etc a little expensive but cafes, Barbican centre, Tesco express nearby. In all would definitely come again.",4,2014,09,14
128,Business stay that was excellent.,"I stayed at this hotel as part of a teaching conference and everything about the establishment was excellent.

The staff are polite and are ready to help in anyway possible, the two gentlemen who showed me to my room were professional and making causal jokes while taking me to my room. The lobby has a lovely wall waterfall and is calming when walking in. The room itself (026) was on the ground floor, despite this no traffic or pedestrian noise was picked up at any point in the room. The blackout curtains made the room easy to fall asleep in without shedding an inch of light until you pulled the curtains back yourself. The bathroom is lovely equipped with under heated floors and a rainfall shower. The room and hotel was kept immaculately clean and was a lovely place to stay after 2 days of meetings.

Thank you to all the staff at The Montcalm for a lovely stay, I am sure a stay is coming in the foreseeable future.",5,2014,09,13
128,Unexpected bonus,"Rooms are spacious and clean. One of the benefits is it only a few minutes away from the Barbican tube.  The staff are very welcoming and are there for every need.  The breakfast offered is a continental one in the club room or you can have room service if you wanted something cooked.
A nice touch is the in room list of services and attractions, it's the most extensive I have seen. 
We would stay here again they made our 10th wedding anniversary a very special occasion.",4,2014,09,12
128,Weekend visit,I wanted to take my partner to see a west end show as a birthday surprise. I searched for a Hotel that would make the weekend extra special and came across the Montcalm at the Brewery and booked it. From the moment we arrived we were given the warmest of welcomes with nothing being too much trouble. We were shown to our room and straight away noticed the ventilation system was a little noisy. The hotel Manager immediately gave us another room without hesitation. I cannot praise the accomodation and staff enough as we had a fantastic weekend. I will certainly recommend this hotel and use it again for my next London trip.,5,2014,09,11
128,just excellent,"Property has wonderful decor throughout, really rather boutique.  Located a 3 minute walk from Barbican and five from others. The room was perfectly laid out, if a little on the small side.  The bathroom a bath/shower.  Everything very modern and well presented. 

Complimentary fruit and water was a nice touch along with the scent diffuser which can be changed to reflect what you'd like the room to smell like.  Great little idea. 

Staff are very very attentive, a real pleasure to deal with.  Had a problem with the TV, sorted immediately and then a follow up call an hour later to ensure everything was going smoothly.  Needed some more shower gel and asked reception to pop some in the room, came back to a 'Montcalm' Bag on the bed with a ribbon on containing a selection of new toiletries. 

There's a real focus on the customer here and you'll be very much looked after. 

Only criticism, the price of breakfast - nearly £60 for two of us having a full english, admittedly to the room.  

I'd return tomorrow!",5,2014,09,11
128,First class,"This is our second time in this hotel. Our first stay was a slight disappointment due to room size and location. However the hotel management made every effort to make us happy this time with upgrade and extra amenities.

In any case, the location is superb. If you enjoy London markets like us, Old Spital Fields, Brick Lane and Borough Markets are all nearby. Barbican Cinemas are across the street. Sushisamba and Tramshed are walking distance as our favourite eating spots.",5,2014,09,09
128,Lovely hotel,"I came for a very quick stay at the hotel and couldn't fault it I the slightest. 
My room was neat, the staff were super friendly, a happy customer.  
I will definitely recommend this hotel to my colleagues, as we often need a place for business trips. ",4,2014,09,09
128,5* Customer Service,"I got married at the Chiswell Street Dinning Rooms on Saturday and stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. From the moment we arrived we were met with smiling, professional and helpful staff members. We were upgraded to the Wow Suite for both nights (such a special touch). The staff did everything they could to make our stay hassle free, and all our requests were met with quick responses (we asked for extension leads, to champagne ice buckets). They really looked after us with all the little touches such as roses on the bed with a note on our wedding night. 
We have to mention Nicole who helped me plan my wedding, and was amazing in ensuring the day and set up was exactly as I wanted. She met with us the day before the wedding and stayed as late as possible to make sure we were happy with the set up. Both Mark and Anna helped on the day of the wedding (thank you Mark for popping out to Tesco to buy me paracetamol as I had a headache). Nothing was too much for your team. We had amazing praise from all of our guests on the level of service received (from cooking vegetarian meals on request on the day, re-cooking the meat as some guests wanted it well done to being amazing with our guests who had a 8 week old baby). 
You were all amazing, and our day wouldn't have been the same without your organisational skills. Thank you so much. Amed and Ghaz x
I highly recommend this venue for events, as well as a stay in the hotel.",5,2014,09,08
128,Quaint hotel,"We found this little treasure in the heart of London and fell in love with it immediately. A great 5 star hotel situated in the old whitbread brewery.

It is a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest Tube station Moorgate and has great connections all over this great city. As we arrived on the Saturday for a 1 day stop over, before flying out to the US, it was the perfect setting...Quiet,central and great connections.

We were greeted from the taxi, by the doorman and he took our cases while we checked in. We were a little early, but the lady behind the desk managed to check us in early, which was welcomed as we were tired from the flight and the early start we had that day to get to London.

Although the rooms were small, they were excellently maintained . They offer free Wi-fi  and complimentary newspaper in the morning if you wish. The shower was very good and had a big bathroom.

Our room overlooked a lovely courtyard, which was quiet and little noise even though there was a wedding in progress! We could't here anything :)

We did not get to sample the restaurant as we were catching up with what we wanted to do in London that day.

The check out process was quick and easy and the doorman again hailed us a cab to Victoria for the train to Gatwick.

Love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone staying in London either short term or long term.",4,2014,09,07
128,Great place,"The hotel is fairly well situated at the edge of the City, only 5 minutes from Barbican Tube station and 20 minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station.

This hotel has definitively flair, even if it lacks a certain patina. Our rooms wasn't big but fine and well equipped. The staff was professional and nice... 
At on week-ends the rates are fair, granting you a nice price quality ratio.",5,2014,09,05
128,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed her on trip to London to sightsee. About a 10-12 min walk to St Pauls Cathedral. From there you can pick up most of the bus tours that go to all the main attractions. For £5 extra we added a second day to this. On the alk to the Cathedral you will find lots of cafes/restaurants. Just 2 mins down from the hotel is a Tesco, saw lots of guest with a tesco bag. Its an express but a good one. Not much around the hotel by way of bars/restaurants. There is a cinema is the Barbican centre just across the road, about £14 to see a film. 
Room in the hotel was really nice, modern and comfortable. We did not eat at the hotel so I cannot advise on the food. Do go to see a show in the west end. We saw the Lion King and it was just fantastic. If you are going to Madam Tussauds, try to get some sort of fast track. We queued on the day, very early, and still took us almost 3 hours to get in. If you do go make sure to go to the 4D adventure show, its brill Lots of websites offering discounts on the attractions if you are going sightseeing as it is expensive!",4,2014,09,04
128,Great Hotel for business,"Fourth stay at this hotel. My expectations have been met or exceeded each time. Superb location for business in Moorgate. High spec, very comfortable rooms. Very quiet. Staff are professional and friendly. On my last visit I was upgraded to a Club Suite which was great. Nice room to grab a quick breakfast before setting off. Yes, the layout is like a rabbit warren but this adds to the charm and feeling of calm. ",5,2014,09,04
128,Hidden gem!,"Booked for a one night stay.   Upgraded to a duplex room with a lounge downstairs and a bedroom upstairs (with 2 bathrooms both with showers)

Fantastic hotel and impeccable service.   Ate at the Jugged Hare (part of the building) and charged to my room - wonderful food!

Will definitely be back when next looking to stay in London!!!!",5,2014,09,02
128,Comfortable and Practical for the City of London,"I stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery as part of a business trip to London, end of August 2014. As often the case when travelling, arriving late and staying one night, doesn't give you the time to really benefit from a hotel like this. I arrived by metro via Moorgate which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Service (even for a 23h30 arrival) was really very good and pleasant with a can do attitude from check-in to check-out. Continental breakfast was included in my rate and was very good quality. The building was cavernous but my room was situated in an annex building across Chiswell Street. Just a few gripes - the room was great but there was nowhere to put anything down as every surface had something on it, magazines, glasses, cups, etc and the AC was a bit noisy. none of this was earth shattering though and I can recommend this hotel and the helpful, agreeable staff.",5,2014,09,02
128,Disappointing,"Stayed for 2 nights at the end of August 2014.  Booked through Booking.com for a late arrival (~0100hrs).  Received an email at 2330 stating that my booking had been cancelled by the hotel.  No attempt was made to make personal contact regarding this matter.  Called the hotel and rebooked the room.  Arrived to find no record of my having rebooked and the staff sniffily informing me my card had been declined.  Subsequently booked for the 3rd time, and made payment without any difficulty using the same card with which the original booking was made.  No apology for the confusion and repeated cancellation was offered, and the attitude of the receptionist was surly at best - not the welcome to a luxury hotel one should expect.

Room service was prompt and the food provided excellent.

The hotel itself is clean and well presented.  The continental breakfast was poor value at £25/head; for that price surely a cooked breakfast could be provided, or table service at the very least.

I would not recommend this hotel; equivalent comfort and better service are available elsewhere in London at a lower price.",3,2014,09,01
128,We will always return,First class service. We completely screwed up our booking but the mgt team sorted everything for my wife's 40th birthday. I can't thank them enough. Above and beyond.... We had a fabulous stay.... As we have on prior occasion. We will definitely return.,5,2014,08,31
128,Posh Choice in a Quiet Part of the City,"We booked this for a special birthday celebration. (we went out to eat and used the hotel as a base) - so we didn’t mind paying for something with a bit of oomph and glamour.  And this has both!

We waited a while at reception to get checked in - the desk was small, there was insufficient staff and the place was rather busy. But after the check in (which went smoothly and agreeably once we got served) we were taken to our room which was in the main building (some rooms are in adjacent buildings so if you have mobility issues try to get a room in the main building.) Our room was a bit small,  but it was perfectly furnished, and it felt quite opulent. It had a large, comfortable bed, and a good bathroom.

The ‘restaurant’ is in a pub called the Jugged Hare (situated a minute’s walk from the reception - down the street - (although you can negotiate a maze of hallways to get to the pub without getting wet ... it was lashing down during our stay!)  This seemed a strange set-up. But the Jugged HAre was perfectly nice. Other buildings (that make up the hotel)  - are situated around an old stable-yard - which was once a brewery area. This makes the place seem a bit chaotic and maze-like.

The service at this hotel was excellent - the door man saluted as each time, as we left. And the place exudes charm and ostentation.  The area is rather quiet - a little way from the Barbican - and in an area that’s safe and secure. 

This is quite a good choice if you have the money (this hotel can be very pricey) - so search  on-line for a good deal. And you won’t be disappointed.",4,2014,08,31
128,Perfect location for business in the city,"Good location in the city of london, with just a short walk to Royal Exchange and the rest of the finance district. Perfect location for meetings around town. Nice rooms and bath rooms, and super helpful staff. However the AC and hallway was a bit noisy.",5,2014,08,29
128,"Nice place to stay, but not enough room to swing a cat","Look, I'm not the smallest person you've seen, so I need a bit of space. Fortunately I was in London on business. Couldn't get an early check-in, although I understand that it isn't always possible, it was still a bit of a let-down (at least I could have a shower in the gym). Lovely old place and really nice, knowledgeable staff. Room well decorated, but the mattress could be better (mine slanted to one side, not nice). Space for clothes is really a bit tight, I ended up living half out of my suitcase. 
Yes, I would go back there again if I am in London again.
Two tips - try not to be in room 217, it is adjacent to a storeroom of sorts & you've got people opening & closing the door at all hours. 
Another tip - get your own taxi to the airport, the one they got for me was twice the price of the taxi I used when I arrived.",4,2014,08,29
128,Wonderful!  The only hotel to stay in when in London!,Had a wonderful stay to celebrate a special Birthday!  We booked a Club room which was lovely and the bed so comfortable that we had the best night's sleep ever!  There was everything you needed in the room along with lovely Hermes toiletries!  It is well worth paying the extra for a Club Room as you have full access to the Club Lounge with snacks and drinks and complimentary continental breakfast.  All staff are really friendly and helpful and a credit to the hotel!  We loved our stay so much we are already planning to return and have recommended to everyone!,5,2014,08,29
128,One of the best of London,"This hotel has it all! It's a huge hotel, rather maze-y, it's one of the few ones I've stayed in that actually requires a map to get around inside the hotel! But other than that, it's got some very nice, spacious, clean rooms, the toiletries are from Hermes or Elemis (depending on your room type) and the receptionist (the romanian girl, whose name I actually forgot) can do wonders for you, you just need to ask and they'll make sure it happens. Service is impeccable, it's a true 5-star and quite frankly, the only hotel I'll ever stay in while in London.",5,2014,08,28
128,A bit out of town but a lovely hotel,"The rooms were nice and good quality furnishings, price was affordable just let down by the location being out of town and in a not very visually appealing area. Lovely stay though.

The adjoining pub food looked nice but quite pricey for what it was so we didn't eat there.",5,2014,08,27
128,Great Service,"This is the second time I have used this hotel. The welcome, as always, was superb, from the doorman to the gentleman on reception, both were polite and efficient; I was lucky enough to get early access to my room which I was not expecting. I stayed in a suite and the room was lovely, modern and spacious but comfortable with a superking bed. I was impressed with the emergency kit and the additional coffee machine. Nice to see semi skimmed milk in the room as most hotels only have UHT whole milk. The concierge was very well informed on the history of the hotel and was very helpful. This hotel has a great bar / restaurant attached downstairs and the bartender remembered our drinks and brought them to the table - nice touch. I did not have a full meal but I had bar snacks/ light bites they were great. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,08,27
128,Flawless,"This is one of these rare places where I, if given the chance, would not hesitate to sprinkle at least twice as many stars as allowed. Interior, service, flexibility. Everything absolutely perfect. From the booking procedure, through check in, to the lovely club room, and the fantastic staff, and lovely breakfast at the Jugged Hare, everything was absolutely outstanding. And oh, I forgot to mention great value for money. Can't see a reason for me to stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2014,08,27
128,excellent stay!,"The hotel is worthy of its price, which is very boutique and modern. I like the decoration of it ,which is very and comfortable and fashionable. The facilitates are more than other hotels. The lobby has changed the flowers in the hotel, which leaves me good impression. It cares much on details. The location is good and in a quiet area. Btw, I love the candies and biscuits the hotel provides.",5,2014,08,26
128,Good Hotel. Great General Manager,"1st night we had to move rooms as 206 was very loud and some sort of generator next door was shaking windows and thrumming stopping us from sleeping. At 1am moved to lower grade room but was quiet. 

In morning bleary eyed spoke to GM and she apologised and offered to upgrade us to a suite which was a fair resolution to the issue. Suite was lovely but some other minor niggles stops me from rating it as an excellent hotel. We would certainly consider staying again and staff were on whole very good. Club room breakfast was good and snacks at night OK to help keep you covered until a proper meal. 

I would also ensure you look out of the windows in the inner courtyard to get some appreciation of the historic building as inside it has been pretty much removed so you would not know you were in such a historic building. 

Finally the rooms do not believe in proper draws for clothes so be prepared to hang them or find some open shelving space. Storage is a bit tight.",4,2014,08,26
128,Great hotel,"It's a very nice hotel with friendly staff. We arrived quite early at 9 a.m. but were delighted that we already got a room. The room was perfectly clean, a comfortable bed and a beautiful bathroom. It was quite dark because we were at the back of the building and only had a small window. But we would definetly book the hotel again on our next visit.",5,2014,08,26
128,"Excellent 5 star hotel with excellent service, nice location and very welcoming and friendly staff!","The hotel is really fantastic, classy and cozy with very friendly and accommodating staff which made our stay a remarkable one. Thanks to Tim and Simona who were very helpful, pleasant and welcoming. The concierge team was also lovely and helped us plan a nice day out in the city. The english breakfast was a perfect start for each day as it was
really good with a variety of choices. The location was perfect as it is very close to the Barbican station and close to the top London city attractions. I would definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2014,08,26
128,Quirky (in a positive way),"This is a modern hotel that has been thoughtfully fitted into an old building so be prepared for it not being the usual endless corridors of homogenous rooms. This does bring with it some interesting quirks such as needing to take a lift, walk along a corridor, up a couple of steps and then up a flight of stairs to get to your room. It is worth it though.

The rooms are on the small side but that is normal for central London. The room had everything I needed, including the option to have either a shower or a bath and the bath was new enough and pristine enough for me to actually consider using it.

One thing I really liked about this hotel is that the bar and restaurant both have entrances on the street - a passerby might not even realise the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms was part of this hotel. The bar at the other end looks just like your average London gastropub which, by the way, serves an excellent breakfast - part buffet, part a la carte, all included in my room rate.

I don't think I heard a single English accent from staff the entire time I was in the hotel, but that didn't matter - ALL the staff were very friendly, very helpful and made me feel at home.

Although I stayed here because I had meetings in the City (the financial district) the transport connections to the rest of London are good with Liverpool St, Moorgate and Barbican stations all nearby.",5,2014,08,26
128,Amazing hotel,"My husband and I have just returned from a two night stay at the montcalm and it was truly amazing, from the moment you walk through the door the staff can't do enough for you. The hotel and the bedrooms are so luxurious this truly is a 5 star hotel. The breakfast offers everything you could possibly want. Everything about this hotel is first class and the staff are a credit to the Montcalm, thank you to everyone, see you soon X",5,2014,08,26
128,Gorgeous hotel with very pleasant staff but a few things to improve,"My boyfriend and I stayed here as a birthday treat for me; the staff were very pleasant and did their best to accommodate any requests we had. We also got a miniature complimentary bottle of wine as it was a special occasion, which is always nice. We were shown to our rooms by Georgi the porter who was very helpful and managed to fix our broken scent box! The room was a reasonable size, comfortable large bed with a selection of teas and coffees and biscuits. The bathroom had a rainfall shower which was a nice touch, however the piping around the base of the shower looked like it had never been cleaned. The hotel doesn't have a bar so we were recommended to go to the one a few doors down which was pleasant and not too expensive in comparison to normal London prices. We had complimentary breakfast with our room which we found to be the most disappointing part of our stay, as we both had images of full English breakfasts whereas there was nothing hot served just continental style options such as cereals, toast and pastries. This may be because the hotel doesn't have he facilities to cater for hot options, if so then it could be better for them to partner with the other bar/pub and serve you there instead. We would both return but definitely be heading further afield for breakfast in future!",5,2014,08,25
128,Best hotel in Central London,"I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. My husband and I stayed there for my 60th birthday trip to London.We were made to feel extremely special and very welcome.Every single member of the staff from the concierge to the head  of housekeeping, Catherine, went out of their way to ensure that every tiny detail of our stay was truly memorable and enjoyable .Sanjeev greeted us upon arrival and brought a pot of tea for us on hearing that our sat nav had broken and we had been driving around London for hours.His dedication to his job was clear .Also, we would like to thank Asim and Zdravko, who also added to the enjoyment of our stay with their kindness and  anticipation of our every need even before it was  articulated.Alice, on reception,thank you too for your valued input into making our stay at your beautiful hotel very special.The hotel itself is first rate but the people who staff this hotel make it altogether more special than any other hotel we have ever stayed, and we have travelled the world in our 43 years of married life. Well done the Montcalm! We will be staying with you on every trip to London that we make in the future, as will all the friends and family to whom we have recommended The Montcalm.",5,2014,08,25
128,Yet again a fantastic stay!,"Our first choice hotel every time we stay in London. The staff at the hotel never fail to ensure your stay is the best experience. They go above and beyond! After witnessing a wedding here at the brewery this weekend I would consider it as a potential wedding venue. THIS IS A 5 STAR HOTEL. We look forward to our next visit before Christmas.  
Mr Abbotts ( a regular montcalm guest)",5,2014,08,25
128,Nice Hotel But:,"We stayed here for just one night and thought the hotel was really good in terms of quality, friendly staff, location etc.  As previously commented on it is a bit of a maze for moving around especially when locating you room for the 1st time but this does add a bit to the character.

The rooms are of a high quality with all the ""trimmings"" you would expect of a good Hotel if on the slightly small side, but this is London.

We would have had breakfast but at a quoted price of £25 each I thought this was a bit steep and with hindsight I'm really pleased we didn't take up the offer as this is served in the pub next door ""The Jugged Hare"". I should have known by the name what sort of a place this catered for, still the various bodies of dead animals (be them real or for effect - I wasn't going to ask!) told me all I needed to know and the fact that we were asked to provide details of what we wanted for a Vegetarian Breakfast for the Chef to prepare meant they didn't have a standard option available either?",4,2014,08,25
128,Exceeded out expectations- beautiful hotel,"We are literally just leaving Liverpool st after a fantastic weekend at the montcalm. This hotel is absolutely stunning, we felt like royalty but the atmosphere is far from stuffy or pretentious. All the staff were amazing- they even sent up a bottle of wine as we were celebrating my husbands birthday, even though it was a month ago! We loved the club lounge- it's definitely worth upgrading your room if you can. Excellent service and drinks as well as a light finger buffet in the evenings. Breakfast was great too! Hot drinks were made for us as well as our toast. I'm sorry I didn't catch the name of the guy that served us both Saturday and Sunday- he was extremely professional. 

We will most definitely return to this hotel on our next stay in london. Well done to all that work there, this is how to run a hotel! And we have stayed at top hotels in Las Vegas, and the montcalm at the brewery is definitely on par!

 ",5,2014,08,25
128,Great place,The Montcalm at the Brewery London City is great place. Very quirky and the map of hotel is great as you will get lost! Location is great for transport links to anywhere you may want to get to. The room and hotel have some lovely touches. Breakfast was great. Will return again!,5,2014,08,25
128,Great Hotel,"I have stayed here a number of times, the rooms are fantastic, reception staff  are friendly and helpful.  Some very good places to eat too.  Only one drawback is no irons in the rooms, and sometimes take a while to get one into your room.",4,2014,08,24
128,Great hotel,"We had a brief trip to london and chose this hotel based upon the trip advisor reviews. We stayed over night Friday 22nd August 2014.  My husband checked in and was shown to our room and them as we had a club room enjoyed the complimentary club lounge food and drink before going out into town for the evening. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the tube, and walking distance from old street and shoreditch. The bedroom was excellent, the bed really comfy, heard no noise from the surrounding rooms and the rain shower was great. We didn't pay for the cooked breakfast as there's a continental one included in the room which was again excellent- I had smoked salmon- and the service from the gentleman overseeing breakfast was great.  The hotel refurbishment is beautiful I think for the price and location this hotel is outstanding.",5,2014,08,23
128,Fantastic experience,"Stayed at this hotel weekend 16th August for a family wedding. From arrival to departure the staff were wonderful, calm & professional even under pressure. The rooms were lovely & the dining rooms looked beautiful. A big thank you must go to the unseen heroes, the chefs as the food was AMAZING! Many thanks also to the housekeeping staff who were so helpful & calm in a crisis.
Would definately return to this hotel as Sabine & her wonderful staff made it a weekend to remember.",5,2014,08,23
128,Oustanding approach,"From the great moment of welcome for a returning guest as you walk in through the front door, through to the personal walk around the room (It was the WOW suite and its certainly a wow! Lovely 4 poster bed, huge room and thanks fo for the upgrade guys) through to the friendly service at all times with nothing being too much of a bother. This makes staying at the Montcalm the treat that it is and we had a great stay yet again, see you next week!",5,2014,08,22
128,A Luxurious Place to Catch Your Breath,"At the end of a mad trip through Europe, we stayed at Montcalm at the Brewery before returning home. The newly renovated hotel is a 7 minute walk from Barbican tube station on a quiet back street of central London. Newly arrived guests are made to feel very welcome by a polite and well-informed staff. Late afternoon wine, coffee and delicious snacks, served by a very courteous staff member were much appreciated. This was included in the package I booked online.
I also pre-booked a full English breakfast - approximately $40 for two - and it was well worth the money. Breakfast was served in the dining room of the lovely old pub next door, with full service. 
As for the rooms, we had the next level up from standard. No views but a lovely, good-sized room, with an excellent, brand-new bathroom. There was even a rain shower. Loved it. Our bed was very comfortable and overall, a terrific hotel. If I could think of a fault, I would have written it.",5,2014,08,21
128,5 star experience,"We stayed 15th - 17th August at the Montcalm in a room in the building across the road from the main reception. Location is very handy for a weekend leisure break, near transport, local restaurants and a brief walk to the river for Tate Modern, St Pauls etc. as well as being very near the Barbican with its bars and cultural attractions.

Genuine and friendly staff complement the excellent standard of room - little touches here do make the difference and made our visit a pleasure. Breakfast was excellent and reasonably priced if you book ahead and have a healthy appetite!",5,2014,08,20
128,Beautiful service oriented hotel.,The staff are very service oriented and pleasant. They are very in tuned to assisting guests in any way they can. The rooms are pristine and tastefully decorated. The bathrooms were also immaculate. Would highly recommend! In a quiet area with dining options very close. Ten minute walk to tube station. ,5,2014,08,20
128,Difficult to fault but...,"Clean and and well located in the heart of the city.  Efficient service but..

Very expensive and my room was quite claustrophobic.  This was also a preferential rate as I was attending an awards dinner at the adjacent Brewery!
 
My room also overlooked the front entrance and a drinks terrace with little privacy. Travelling alone I felt that I had been given whatever was available rather than a room allocated with some thought to the guest.",4,2014,08,20
128,Wish We Could Have Stayed Longer!,"We stayed August 2-5.  Everything was perfect.  Through the hotel, we arranged for transfer from Heathrow Airport.  We had an extremely personable driver who, despite unexpected road closures, finally managed to get us to the door.  We were greeted by friendly hotel staff, check-in was a breeze and our room was wonderful. There were lots of drinks and snacks to choose from in the mini bar. The bed was comfortable, and the room, although small, was well appointed, neat and clean.  The housekeeping service was superb, and the nightly turn down service was a nice touch.  We enjoyed the daily complimentary continental breakfast as well.  Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and very helpful. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely return if we get the chance to travel to London again!",5,2014,08,19
128,"Pleasant stay with a few flaws and some ""bad luck events""","My wife and I celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary with a stay in London and choose The Montcalm at the Brewery after reading reviews here on Trip Advisor. 

Overall a very nice hotel, the best hotel I’ve stayed at in London yet to date.  A few small flaws and some “bad luck events” lowers the score.

Upon arrival we were greeted by the doorman who also helped us with the bags.
Check-in was fast and smooth. We were guided to our Club room (which was much needed, it’s easy to get lost) and also shown the facilities in the room. Room was not that big but nice, clean and functional.  It had all the facilities you need including slippers and a bathrobe.
The beds were super comfortable. I don’t recall I’ve slept that good in a hotel ever. The rain shower was also great. Free WiFi and a lot of TV-channels. The rooms are quiet. Standing in the bathroom we could hear some noise from The Jugged Hare but with the door closed to the bedroom we heard nothing.

As guests in Club rooms/suites you have access to the Club lounge where complimentary breakfast is served in the mornings, and sandwiches, canapés, snacks and drinks in the afternoon 5:30-7:30. 

We thought the location was good.  The area is very peaceful and feels safe. Just a five minute walk to Barbican tube station. By tube it takes about 25 minutes to Oxford Circus. Westfield Stratford City shopping mall is just 12 minutes away. The Museum of London is very close. I recommend paying a visit. It was excellent.
 
So, the small flaws and “bad luck events” I mentioned earlier.

We requested an iron and iron board three times before we got it. 

We got the wrong toiletries in our Club rooms. It should have been toiletries from Hermés, we got Elemis. 

First night the safe run out of battery. It had to be opened manually by the staff and they changed batteries the morning after. 

Second night there was technical issues throughout the whole hotel. First the TV was down for a couple of hours, and then the WiFi was down.

Sunday morning a dripping sound from the bathroom woke us up at 6:30. There was water dripping from two spots in the ceiling. Apparently there was a pipe leaking from above.

That said The Montcalm handled it very well. All our appreciation to duty manager Alice for excellent customer service skills. She really took care of the situation. After the leakage incident she upgraded us to a spacious and very cool WOW Suite. She also offered us breakfast at The Jugged Hare and she talked to us in the morning after and also during check-out.

When checking out I filled out a customer satisfaction questionnaire. My feed back was pretty much the same as this review. Our flight departed late in the evening so we used the luggage storage at the hotel during the day. When returning back to get our bags Alice had read our questionnaire and immediately responded to it. We even get a goodie bag with Hermés toiletries.

Finally a few suggestions for improvement:

In our “first” room it would be great with a wall-mounting bracket for the TV so you could turn the TV towards the bed.

The first evening we got a bottle of water and some fruits in the room which was nice. However, in my opinion the guest should get that every evening, also one bottle of water to each guest not just one per room.

It was nice to have sandwiches, snacks and drinks in the Club lounge in the afternoons. I would prefer that the time for this service was longer, preferably 24-7.",4,2014,08,19
128,Surprise in the City,"Excellent hotel ,  the staff were lovely.
Our stay was a very special celebration and the staff looked after us incredibly well.
A fabulous up grade to a duplex suite and champagne in the room. 
Thank You.",5,2014,08,18
128,Gorgeous Hotel,"I Stayed here from the 20th July 2014 to 21st July 2014. 
Everything was perfect, we were welcomed by the doorman who helped us with our bags, check in was quick and a concierge man showed us to our room. 
The room was beautifully modern and up to date with the latest gadgets although the docking station was still a 16 pin for iphone4 etc. Had a great coffee machine and a lovely bowl of fresh fruit. Great variety in the mini bar although we didn't eat from it. 
The bed were incredibly comfy, superbly comfy pillows and duvet. 
We didn't have breakfast but were very please with the service provided from all the staff we came in contact with.
Fabulous hotel!",5,2014,08,18
128,Montcalm London City - 5* all over,"Fantastic - service was excellent - nothing was too much trouble.
We checked in after booking for our 10th Anniversary at the Montcalm - a little upmarket to the normal but a special occasion. We were greeted at the door then went through the check in with the delightful receptionist who then upgraded us to room 404 a Club room which was really lovely.
Would highly recommend the Montcalm - just such a special stay.
Thank you!",5,2014,08,18
128,Amazing Hotel,"I booked this hotel the night before i was due to go to London and wow what a great find. The hotel has brilliant with period features and the friendliest of staff to those on reception, walking the floor and in breakfast. I got an unbelievable last minute deal and phoned the hotel that day to say I was going to be late checking in but would it be possible to have a free upgrade. On my arrival I was upgraded so it always pays to ask. I was in a wow suite and it certainly made me go wow. Thanks guys for an enjoyable stay even though I was only there for 12 hours.",5,2014,08,18
128,Very small room and constant banging of doors,Having stayed at the Montcalm last night I was very disappointed with the experience! It is more like a 3star hotel with shoebox sized rooms. I could barely sleep due to the walls being really thin and constantly hearing doors banging shut. The hotel is incredibly overpriced as I have found budget hotels to have bigger rooms than the ones that the Montcalm has. I would not stay here again,2,2014,08,17
128,A Real Pleasure & Treat,"From the moment we arrived until we checked out the staff made us feel comfortable and relaxed. We were upgraded to a Club Room as my wife and I were celebrating a special occasion. We therefore had access to the Club Suite with complimentary canape's and breakfast in the morning. The little touches of detail in the room and a small treat of Red Wine when we checked in were great. Shame we could only stay the one night as we had the most pleasurable stay in a long, long time.
Thank you to all at the Montcalm and see you again on our next trip to London!!",5,2014,08,17
128,A Fine Hotel,"Stayed here for the 1st time and liked it a lot. Staff is friendly and helpful. Its clean. To London standards not even that expensive for the quality. The rooms were a bit small, where the bathroom was perfect. Beds were good.
Will definitely come back. ",4,2014,08,17
128,Shame there isn't a sixth star!,"The hotel is just stunning, they have managed to work the hotel around the original architecture of the brewery, and the room I stayed in had the original brickwork ceiling visible.

The welcome from staff was warm and honest, we were guided to our room by a friendly and warm member of staff (the guide was needed as due to the building's design the route to our room required going up one floor, going across this floor and then up and across again!)

The room itself was spacious and clean. The nespresso machine in the room is a very nice touch as was the free WiFi. The only slightly unusual feature was the moveable blind between the bedroom and bathroom, but it did add a romantic touch.

Both of the restaurants attached to the hotel are wonderful and worth a visit.

My main reccomendation is to book a Montcalm club room if possible. The extra cost is more than justified by the extra space, the free evening canapés and drinks (wine, beer and soft drinks all free) and the wonderful club breakfast (fruits, cereal, pastries and more) included in the room rate!",5,2014,08,16
128,Good but service not up to 5 star standard,"I was staying on a cheap weekend rate and wanted a hotel nr Liverpool Street. Reception and checking in was a bit chaotic as the layout is poor. Rooms are spread around the old Brewery Building, which some may find interesting but there is no way you can tell once in your room. The room itself was average to small size, but very well furnished and a good bathroom. Check out was as chaotic as checking in and in general the service given was just not as good as other hotels I have stayed in.",4,2014,08,16
128,Excellent,"A wonderful, polite greeting, followed by our bags being carried to our room. The guy showed us how everything worked in our room and was a absolute pleasure. The room was modern, very clean, comfortable and had all the amenities you could ask for. I'd definitely stay again. ",5,2014,08,15
128,Above and beyond!,"My husband and I stayed for a special Birthday experience and after calling and telling them we were celebrating, Simona Siupsinskaite upgraded our room and personally ensured we had a fabulous time.
This wasn't the first time either. We celebrate all our anniversary's and other special occasions here and they always go the extra mile to make this an excellent perfomance from start to finish.
Simona really seems to care and is a fantastic asset to this hotel!
The rooms are lovely, the staff are lovely and it is perfectly situated in the city.",5,2014,08,14
128,Fantastic stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City,"The team at the Montcalm are simply brilliant!  Every member of the staff we came into contact with was courteous, friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.  The rooms were simply brilliant and the food/service delicious.  Will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone for business or pleasure",5,2014,08,14
128,Outstanding,"Amazing historic property that was a former brewery, restored in a very sympathetic way into a beautiful contemporary hotel. Room was 1st class luxury. Staff were very well trained and attentive, couldn't do enough to help with taxis, restaurants etc. Would recommend and will return.
",5,2014,08,13
128,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service","This is my 'go to' Hotel when in London and I love it. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who are always friendly and so welcoming.
The rooms are lovely and always spotlessly clean. Having stayed here a lot I have been in many rooms and they are often spacious or quirky as the Building is unusual inside.
Great business location - walking distance to the City - but also close to Barbican & Moorgate tubes so easy to get anywhere in London.
Highly recommended!",5,2014,08,13
128,Perfection,"Stayed here for my girlfriends birthday, was treated like royalty from start to finish. Upon arrival we received an upgrade from the lady at reception, because it was my girlfriends birthday, to a club suite, our bags were brought up for us and we were told by a lovely gentleman everything about the room. The room was the best I've stayed in, everything you could want from a hotel room. Later that evening when we returned from being out all day, the hotel staff had left my girlfriend a birthday cake in the room for her and a card wishing her a happy birthday, an incredibly nice gesture. It was a a ten minute walk to the underground, which was fine, and only a few stops from the Main Streets in London. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel as it made our trip to london even better. I will most definitely be returning.",5,2014,08,12
128,Nice hotel AT THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT,"the hotel was very nice, and the staff was very polite, but we were there on a weekend so everything around was CLOSED, as it is in the financial district, this area lives monday to friday, and is literally dead on weekends, to take that into consideration.. not near turistic atracctions... but nice enough to stay there again if we are ever in london during the week..",4,2014,08,12
128,"Lovely hotel , excellent first class service","Everything about our stay was excellent , again :-) 
Comfortable clean , all the little extras , first class service , great business location - walking distance to The City 
Highly recommended 
Thank you",5,2014,08,12
128,What it does it does really well,"I visited the Montcalm at the Brewery on a recent trip to London.  I was quite expectant as had previously failed to get a booking and the overall reviews are very positive.  
General impression. Formed from a series of victorian 4 story town houses, it's a very impressive renovation. This inner layout is higgledy piggledy without being annoying. Lots of different routes to get to your room!   The lobby is very interesting and quite intimate, while modren, nicely done with water features and nice leather sofas.
Rooms.  Very well finished, to a high standard. Nice touches like complimentary biscuits and snacks. Good minibar, though limited selection. Bathroom to same standard, very good, though a bit chintzy for my personal taste. Don't really understand the fashion for glass walls between bathroom and room.  Was not delighted with room as it had a very small window, which couldn't be opene, at foot level.  Not complaining as someone has to have the odd shaped room, just stopped me seeing the room in daylight. Am sure other rooms had full windows as I saw them!
Staff.  Quite pleasant overall.  Breakfast staff seemed harried.
Food. Really nice choice between an attached gastro pub and a full restaurant. Both excellent.  Really good!  
I stayed in a club room, which had breakfast included.  Not at all worth it in my opinion, as was considerably more expensive and the continental breakfast was poor.  Nespresso is ok for home but pretty poor quality for a 5 star hotel

Looking forward to next trip",4,2014,08,11
128,Fantastic stay - cannot wait to come back,"Everything was superb, from the friendly staff to the lovely room and comfortable bed.
I have mobility problems, and the excellent staff could not do enough for me.
My room was spacious and the bed very comfortable (a rarity in my experience).  Everything was spotlessly clean.  Lovely bathroom with decent Elemis toiletries.  A decent bowl of fruit and bottles of water were provided, which were very nice.
I took breakfast in my room and chose the 8-8:30am slot - it arrived at 8am on the dot, and was delicious - lovely quality ingredients and piping hot.
I enjoyed my stay so much, and cannot wait for an opportunity to return
There was nothing to fault, and much to admire, so a 5 star rating is well deserved from me.",5,2014,08,11
128,A luxurious feel in a heritage property,"To be honest, I booked this hotel because it is next to the Barbican Centre, where I was attending an event, but am so glad that I did. From the check-in to check-out, and every stage in between, I felt like a special guest. Staff are attentive and friendly, and someone even came by mid-evening to check whether I needed anything. The room is well-equipped, and the bathroom is almost as large at the bedroom (at least, in my suite). For the first time in a long time, I luxuriated in a bath in their spacious tub, and the next morning had a rain-head shower.

Their gym is small (one stationary bike, one cross-trainer, one treadmill) but functional. My one complaint would be that it's not well ventilated. There is a fan, but you can't really feel the effects. It's a small quibble, though. The rest of the experience greatly made up for that small inconvenience.

I will definitely look at this property again when I need a place to stay in London.",5,2014,08,11
128,Montcalm August 2014,"We had a super stay.  Great location - especially at the weekend as the City is so quiet.  Near to Boris bike station and the Barbican.  The room was really comfortable - especially the bed.  Lovely bathrobes and very nice shower gel and hair products from Hermes.   Also, the fact that they gave small bottle of champagne which was on ice as we entered the room to mark a special birthday was a nice, thoughtful and appreciated touch.  The bath was unnecessarily complicated but no real complaints about this.  All in all, everything was just as described and perhaps better that I expected.  The conversion from Whitbread brewery made the building unique and of an interesting shape.  The staff were very professional and helpful but it would be nice to see an EO employment policy adopted providing a cross-section of different nationalities including maybe some native employees.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,10
128,Amazing service,"Room was lovely, staff were friendly and there were apples everywhere in the hotel in bowls, that you could help yourself too. There was a good variety of vegetarian food available as well. 

I left the hotel at late in the evening, and made a mess of the room, so I called the hotel to ask them if they could make up my room , and they did. They also left me a box of mints and a note with the weather forecast.",5,2014,08,09
128,Perfection!,"The Montcalm at the Brewery London City...well.....rooms are spectacular, staff is incredibly kind. I always feel welcomed here and I gladly choose the Montcalm every time I am in London, bothe business and leisure!
Oh by the way, see you soon guys,
Isabell! =)",5,2014,08,08
128,"Wow, great hotel with friendly staff","We were originally staying at The Shaftesbury Hotel, Shaftesbury Avenue but they had issues so they upgraded us to here. We had a Duplex Suite which was huge but very cosy. There was a ground floor bathroom along with a lounge area including a sofa, TV and desk. The bathroom had a large sliding blind window which could be left open if you would like to watch TV whilst having a bath or shower. Upstairs there was a very comfortable queen size bed plus another bathroom and TV. Complimentary tea and coffee making facilities and complimentary toiletries were included. A mini bar is available but at £14.50 for a small bottle of wine (which would be equivalent to a large glass of wine) we decided this was way too pricey. The room has air con, is nicely decorated and clean. 

We were also given a complimentary continental breakfast of which there was plenty of and very nice. Breakfast is served in the dining area of a pub attached to the hotel. Hot breakfast is also available. 

As the location is near the city it is a very quiet location and takes around 15 - 20 minutes in a cab or the underground to get to the West End. Very nice hotel but probably more suited if you have business in the city or want to explore in this area.",5,2014,08,08
128,"Great hotel, not bad location, nice food.","Situated in the old brewery building, new, good furnishing, clean, good service, very good in general. The only thing I did not get, is despite not big size of the room, the bathroom has the same size as a room itself, kind of 50/50% space distribution between room and the bath. So, the bath was cold a bit. The Jagged hare restaurant offers unusual design and high-quality good, nice to spend time there. In general good impressions, would like to stay there again.",4,2014,08,08
128,"Very nice hotel, and service is good but seems forced","Good location, but a bit of a walk to a tube station.
Extremely well-appointed hotel, looks recently refurbished to a high standard.
Young, friendly and very willing staff, but seems forced, as if reading from a script (everyone asks the same questions for example!)",5,2014,08,07
128,"Excellent, as ever","Regularly use the Montcalm as it's easily the best hotel within a short walk of the Barbican. Often get upgraded to a club room, but even when I dont it's always a fabulous room. So nice to have a friendly person take your bags to the room.",5,2014,08,07
128,Superb experience,"What can I say? We had a superb experience. I stay in many hotels around the world and our stay at this hotel was perfect.

The staff were great, friendly and attentive and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was exactly what we needed. 

I also think it's well priced.",5,2014,08,07
128,Absolutely lovely stay.,"Beautiful one night stay. Booked hotel for my boyfriends birthday and we were upgraded to a club suite - room was amazing, very spacious and comfortable bed. The staff and service were impeccable, I would highly recommend to friends and family. The only minor con would be the fact a full English was rather pricey.. But fully recommend!!",5,2014,08,07
128,I love this hotel,"A few upgrades since my last stay (bathrooms, windows, beds...). Consistently good service, great staff and a fantastic duty manager (Simona). This hotel is great for business or pleasure - really quiet at the weekend and a nice buzz in the week with the Jugged Hare pub/restaurant next door (also owned by the hotel)",5,2014,08,07
128,Decent hotel with a number of quality touches,"The Montcalm At Brewery London City is a quality hotel near London city, which posts impressive features in a gym, sauna and steam room with the level of top-notch service you would expect from this type of hotel.

Staff were friendly, took great pride in talking about the history of the hotel and there were some nice touches on offer such as free fruit/water and my room being prepared for bed by the time I'd come back in the evening.

My double room was small, but the bed was comfortable if not a little too high and quality furnishings and a good sized bathroom were on offer. Room service was also prompt and the club sandwich tasty - however the service charge of £5 alongside a tray charge of £2.50 was ridiculous and should be looked at by the hotel. 

The gym was incredibly small, but fine for a workout if you are the only person there. Unfortunately the sauna was unavailable but the steam room was one of the best I have used.

Whilst I think the Montcalm is a good hotel and I had a pleasant experience, I do think there are better hotels in London for the price and so unless there was an exceptional deal, its unlikely I would return.",4,2014,08,07
128,"Yes, yes, yes, but why?","This is a superb hotel, in a great, but not a touristy location near the financial hub of London. Our room was a bit small but our daughters' was a good size - I suppose I should have pulled rank and swapped but, hey, dads do dote on daughters. Everything was spotless, staff were very pleasant and helpful, soundproofing was good and beds were really comfortable. Our only wee quibble is that the little fitness room was airless to the point that my wife couldn't use it. In a gym, air conditioning is essential. 
We stayed on a special deal that brought the Montcalm within our price range - hence the 'why'? If you're coming to London, you're not going to hang around the hotel, so why spend an arm and a leg? SO long as they have deals to keep the price down, I'll come back but, at full price, you can get a good, clean, comfortable place to lay your head for a lot less. My score for value below is for the special deal rate.",5,2014,08,06
128,Amazing and full of surprises,"My partner booked us a Club Room room at the Montcalm as a surprise for my birthday. And what a surprise it was. 
We arrived at the hotel a little before 12:00 – check out time. Reception was fairly busy, so I took a seat in one of the plush dark leather sofas next to the water feature, whilst my partner checked us in.
A few minutes later he returned and explained that we had very kindly been upgraded to a suite to help celebrate my birthday. This was a lovely gesture and was really quite unexpected.
We were taken upstairs to the Club lounge, where we were offered complimentary coffee, water and macaroons – my favourite!!! A short while later, a kind gentleman returned to us with our bag and showed us to our room. Before he opened the door to our Barbican Duplex Suite (room 136), he said ‘prepare to say wow’. 
Well, ‘wow’ just did not cover it. 
On the ground floor we had a bathroom, complete with huge shower and Hermes toiletries. A work area, 3 seater sofa, chair, Nespresso coffee machine and flat screen TV. Upstairs was the most comfortable double bed, another bathroom, mini bar and wardrobe.
The room made use of dark leather and wood, giving a moody; relaxing and luxurious tone. Stepping into the room, you were hit with the discreet small of pink grapefruit – just one of the fragrance choices you have when booking at the Montcalm.
We left the hotel at lunchtime and were greeted pleasantly by every staff member we passed – it was extremely warm when we visited on 19th July but they were all impeccably dressed in full suits – I did feel bad for them.
We returned to the hotel to dress for dinner at around 19:30. The room had been turned down for us, sweets and the weather forecast left on our pillow, slippers and dressing gowns left out. In addition, another little surprise – a bottle of champagne and birthday card from the staff. 
The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my birthday celebrations fell nothing short of perfect. We will certainly return to the hotel on our next trip to London and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for luxury and calm in a busy city.",5,2014,08,06
128,Very good experience,"Nice hotel, clean (considering we're in London), strategic location, kind and helpful staff. My stay was just for one night so really can't say more than that. Anyway, good enough to save the details for future needs.",4,2014,08,06
128,Upgraded to this lovely hotel,"We were booked in at the Shaftesbury, Piccadilly, for our 30th wedding anniversary but, on arrival, were told that there was a problem with our accommodation and that they were offering an upgrade to a 5* hotel, with complementary breakfast. It was a 15 min cab ride from the Shaftsebury - which was a pain as we had dinner booked in Piccadilly - but they offered free cab rides to the new hotel - The Montcalm - and back again, as often as required. Of course, we accepted.
On arrival at The Montcalm we realised that the 5* rating was true. The service from everybody was excellently attentive, with nothing being too much trouble. We were shown to our room by adrian, and all room amenities were explained and demonstrated extensively and with good humour. He asked our reason for visiting and, 10 mins later, a complementary bottle of wine was delivered. The room and all common areas are excellent with a very upmarket atmosphere and decor. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in and there was an Nespresso coffee machine in the room too - a nice change from the usual coffee sachets.
After our trip back to Piccadilly, there was a good night sign on the bed with some lovely mints. Excellent service.
The breakfast in the morning was very nice indeed - I could've eaten ten of the freshly made croissants.
All in all, an excellent hotel which I'd love to stay in again....not sure the price of this kind of luxury would be anywhere near the amount we initially paid for the Shaftsebury though!

The only downside, and the reason I never gave the full 5 rating above, is that on our return from our meal (having travelled across London and back again) it was about 11.30pm. We wanted a drink in the hotel but only room service was available, and this had quite a limited choice - none of which appealed. 
But this is a minor point involving personal tastes in drinks, and I almost feel guilty for mentioning it.
To sum up.....A gem of a hotel. Thanks to all the staff for their wonderful service.",4,2014,08,05
128,Good service,"The hotel has a beautiful entrance hall and nice modern decoration in the rooms.
Very good attention on the turn-down service with the mints in the room. The parfum box in the room is a very good idea.
The only negative point is the acoustic isolation of the room, they have old windows so we could hear all the noise outside.
The size of the room and bathroom is quite small, but it is in the London standards.",4,2014,08,05
128,"Unique, pleasant stay in Central London","The first time I stayed at the Montcalm, back in 2012, I was leery of the ""old brewery turned into a hotel"" concept. But because of the proximity to my office, I knew that it was the best choice for me - and I'm so glad I chose it!  I've been back 5 or 6 times since then, and I am always pleased to stay on the premises.

The staff are incredibly polite and accommodating, every single time and for every single request. They easily managed any necessary room changes, assisted me with my heavy luggage up and down the maze of hallways which connect the building, and they go above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction.  

The rooms vary in size, although I'm not sure how the categories work. I've always been able to get comfortable, though, no matter the size or season.  The structure is centered around a courtyard, and so you may end up on the far side from the front door, but there is always a ""trick"" for getting back to the lobby easily.  There is a small business center as well, but I haven't really needed it with the free wi-fi throughout the property.

I love having access to the Jugged Hare for breakfast and for an after-work drink.  Plus, you can also navigate through internal hallways to the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms, which is an excellent spot for dinner.  I find the location to be lovely - situated between Moorgate and Barbican, with easy access to many Tube stations and a short walk to the Thames and the Millennium Bridge.  I'll be back here again soon!",4,2014,08,05
128,Love this hotel! ,"Love this hotel! My husband and I have stopped here twice now and we always book a club room. 
The club room facilities are fantastic. We had breakfast in the jugged hare which was excellent with a huge choice of continental items and a choice of a cooked breakfast too - can highly recommend ",5,2014,08,04
128,top notch!,"The people at Montcalm really thought of everything.
friendliness, atmosphere, very comfortable room with an eye for detail.
Non standard hotel in an original old brewery building. 
Great breakfast which is served in the cozy bar/restaurant on the corner

will go back for sure",5,2014,08,04
128,Wonderful staff that can't do enough for you.,"We found a really good deal for this hotel, through trip advisor. £270 for two nights in a club room with full breakfast. I was so pleased we picked The Montcalm Hotel it's one of the nicest hotels that we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in many in London. The staff were all so friendly nothing was ever too much trouble, we asked for an iron and within minutes they provided one, also we ran low of tea and shower gel and within minutes they provided two whole bags full. The breakfast was delicious especially the sausages. Just a couple of little niggles the air conditioning wasn't very cool we tried to lower it but it didn't seem to work. We asked at reception but it stayed the same. But it's probably because we aren't  to good with technical things. The other is, because it was a brewery it has an unconventional layout and my husband and I got lost a few times, but there was always someone around to help you find your way. All in all a great hotel in a good area. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks to the Montcalm. ",5,2014,08,03
128,1 night stay,"Stayed in an exec room for a 1 night stay. Arrived after 5pm and whilst reception was busy, check-in was efficient.  Very helpful to be told about the hotel and shown to our room as it is a bit of a maze.  Lovely room, although a little dark (and warm) for putting on makeup whilst husband using the bathroom.  Went to the excec lounge and this was nice and airy and had a quick drink and snack with a range of light snacks available.  Nice bathroom and powerful shower.  On returning from our event we went to the bar which had a lively atmosphere. When we were out we had our towels replaced and turn down and arrived back to classical music playing on the TV and treats on the pillow. Very comfortable bed and good night’s sleep as quiet in the hotel.  Had breakfast included in the lounge which was good and my husband’s request for a glass of wine was granted.  Didn’t feel rushed at all and quite relaxing.  Staff very helpful across the hotel.  Would stay again.",4,2014,07,31
128,Just WOW,"I took my wife here for our second wedding anniversary and we really couldn’t have had a better experience. We went for a WOW suite which lived up to its name with an attractive four poster bed, plenty of space and stunning furniture. We also had full access to the very classy Club room which included drinks all day, a finger buffet in the evening and continental breakfast, all of which were excellent. 

The hotel itself is in a listed building which means that the layout is quite unusual with lots of twists and turns along the corridors. However, the character of the building has been beautifully preserved with nice touches here and there reminding you of its heritage. The staff were also delightful and the welcome was warm yet professional. 

We tried the Chiswell Street Dining Room restaurant which was running a deal with 3 courses for £29 and was outstanding.

The only oddity I noted was a lack of tea bags in the room, although they were available in the Club room. Otherwise it was flawless. If you get the chance, do go.",5,2014,07,31
128,Cool Hotel,"Need to book a quality hotel in The City with an eye on price. 

£210 bought me a club room which included breakfast. 

The staff were very attentive and I'd return for sure. 

Breakfast was excellent with again, great service. 

The hotel itself is in a 300 year old brewery. Which makes for an unorthodox stay; with stairs on ones floor and corners in corridors etc. 

Hermes toiletries and a great, if small, shower and bathroom. 

Breakfast is in a pub. Bar In a restaurant. 

It's all odd. But weirdly, just works. 

Thanks Montcalm. I'll be back. ",5,2014,07,30
128,"Wonderful people and place,","I rarely write reviews on line. Particularly when I am happy. So, it says a lot that I am writing to refer the Montcalm very positively. From start to finish, the people were warm, helpful, and responsive. The room was large, well appointed, and had a great bed, bath, and shower. The A/C was well controlled. When I asked for more electrical outlets and adaptors, I had 2 men in my room within 10 minutes, setting it all up. 
The food was very good. And the club lounge was a total asset for snacks, drinks and a break.
The gym is rather small, and you may need a GPS to find your room each time. And, these are small prices to pay for such a great hotel value and experience.",5,2014,07,30
128,Great stay,Professional and efficient team in a well located are of London. Not a large room but quality fixtures and fittings. We were there for our sons graduation at the barbican which was just around the corner as was the tube station.,5,2014,07,29
128,Great hotel and service,"My daughter and I stayed here for a wedding. Beautiful room, fantastic service and the food was absolutely superb. The breakfast at the ""Jugged Hare"" was first class as well. Very quiet location.
Only a 7 minute walk to ""Moorgate"" underground station.",5,2014,07,29
128,Great place,"This was booked by my partner and turned out to be more than I expected, service brilliant, room brilliant and it was nice to sleep away from the hustle and bustle of central London, would stay again without hesitation. Didn't experience their restaurant or breakfast (a little pricey for us) so can't comment on those ...",5,2014,07,28
128,Amazing hotel and service,"Booked a one night stay here to go to the theatre at the weekend.  Really great hotel,  beautiful rooms,  fantastic service and great prices.  Situated in a quiet part of London but only a few mins walk from barbican underground and Liverpool Street station.  Perfect all round and would have no hesitation booking here again.  ",5,2014,07,28
128,The Montcalm at the Brewery aka how to run a hotel in London!,"The first thing I have to say is prior to arriving at the hotel I received an email from the Montcalm at the Brewery asking if there was anything I needed….I have never had that before and my wife & I have stayed at a lot of hotels in London.

We arrived at the Montcalm at the Brewery on a very hot day in Jul and I feared a prolonged ‘check in’ procedure as the hotel was bustling around check in time. However once we entered the lobby we were met with a blast of cooled air and my eyes were greeted by the impressive interior of the old Whitbread Brewery. 

The check in procedure didn’t take half as long as I feared and the staff on the Reception Desk was very attentive to our needs. We were engaged in charming conversation by the staff who asked us questions regarding our stay and if we needed anything whilst we were here.

We were then escorted to our rooms by a member of staff and the thing that struck me the most was that as we passed by other members of staff we were greeted by a smile and a hello, which is a rare thing in a lot of places in London.

The room whilst not enormous was a good size, very nicely furnished and all amenities were pointed out to us by the staff member before he left. The A/C worked perfectly and the bathroom was nicely laid out. Complementary fresh fruit & water were provided.

Adjacent to the Hotel are the Chiswell Dining Rooms which we didn’t partake in but looked lovely and was very busy. There is also a very nice Public House called the Jugged Hare at the other end of the Hotel which has a Bistro Menu and local Ales on tap. We did manage to stop here for last orders and were very impressed!

This was the first time my wife and I had heard of the Montcalm at the Brewery but we will definitely stay here again when we are back in London. Whilst the Hotel may be situated in the City it doesn’t take long to get to Old Street, Shoreditch & Old Spitalfields by foot. The Barbican is virtually on your doorstep and there is also Whitecross Street which is near by that gives off a cool relaxed vibe in the summer with plenty of restaurants and pubs available.

 The Montcalm at the Brewery is easily one of the best hotels in London in my opinion.",5,2014,07,24
128,great value for a 5 star hotel in the city,"I spent a week in the Montcalm and I have absolutely no complaints. I had everything i needed and more. Great breakfast, wonderful service, perfect location and even hermes ameneties (from the line of my own scent, no less). The staff was very attentive and helpful. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable, the bathroom facilities modern.
The hotel is located 2 minutes away from the Barbican center and there are several restaurants and pubs in the area. 
The price was more than right. I would certainly go back!

128,"Adrian steals the show! Great service, rooms, wi-fi and location","We were originally booked in the sister hotel, London City Suites, directly across the street. When the air conditioning in our room gave out to the unseasonably hot week in London, they upgraded us to an even nicer room at the Montcalm and offered us a complimentary bottle of wine and breakfast. The decor and amenities are nearly identical in the Montcalm at the Brewery, but the Montcalm rooms seemed a bit larger. The service here was excellent. The concierge, Adrian, helped us with every question we had about the hotel, London, the Tube, etc, arranged a cab back to the airport and was just a great conversationalist with a wonderful sense of humor. I can't imagine a better person to be out front for a hotel or restaurant. The manager, I believe her name was Sabine, came out and checked up on us the morning after we had to switch rooms and was very sweet and genuine. The Wi-Fi in this hotel was AMAZINGLY FAST, did not require a password, and provided a quick connection even when outside. This is no small detail since your trip may include researching maps, routes, restaurants and attractions. Surprisingly, the majority of hotels fail miserably with Wi-Fi service, either with clunky access, speed, spotty access in rooms or combination of all 3. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the desk offered UK and US (120V) outlets, a USB charging outlet and an HDMI port if you want to connect your camera/camcorder to the nice LCD TV. The only odd thing about the room (and this appears to be a common thing in London) is that the glass door on the tub/shower only extends about 60% of the way across the tub, so it can make for a drafty shower and the water can shoot out of the tub if you are not careful when turning on the spray head. This is a puzzling design, but a minor issue considering the quality of the room overall. The location of this hotel was nice in Central London, with a very short walk right down Chiswell Street to the Barbican Underground Station. Moorgate is equally as close in the opposite direction. It's also near St Paul's Cathedral and the Museum of London. We were dropping off our son for the Guildhall School of Music & Drama summer program, which is immediately next door to the hotel, as well as for a combined family vacation. We will definitely return to this excellent hotel and staff. Oh, and did I mention Adrian was awesome? Give that guy a raise! Hope to see him again someday.",5,2014,07,22
128,Lovely hotel,"I booked a double room (couldn't see an option for twin when booking) as a special treat for my Mum's 53rd birthday weekend. The hotel contacted me before our stay to check whether I needed anything and on advising them of the reason for our stay they arranged a twin room for us (Club Room 309) which was really appreciated.

On arrival we were greeted with a smile and then our luggage was taken to our room whilst we followed. The room itself and the bathroom were very modern and clean. Mum was very impressed! We went out for a drink nearby and on returning to our room we found a birthday card and little bottle of champagne on the table for my mum - a lovely little gesture.

The hotel itself is close to Moorgate underground station (about ten minute walk, if that) and really easy to find on exiting the station - another bonus! The hotel looks very grand with the decor and furniture - and staff were keen to help. Nothing seemed too much trouble and all of the staff we spoke with were very friendly which makes such a big difference. 

Breakfast in the nearby Jugged Hare was great, a help yourself buffet style for which we paid £15 per person (I think this was the discounted rate as it was £22 p/p on the menu inside our room).

I would definitely go back to the Montcalm for another special occasion!",5,2014,07,22
128,Nice hotel,Nice 5-star hotel in London. Good service. Polite staff. Quick check-in. Very good restaurants close to the hotel. The breakfast was very good! The room we got was a little small. A little far from centre of London. ,4,2014,07,22
128,Fabulous hotel,"This is a fabulous hotel and the staff exceed in every way. My husband brought me here for my birthday for the weekend and the hotel staff made sure it was one to remember. Club rooms are amazing, beds so comfy and everything you need.
The breakfast is a must, very delicious :-)
Thanks so much montcalm at the brewery will be returning soon.",5,2014,07,21
128,Wedding Reception,"Just brilliant,friendly staff , the room, fully air conditioned, free wifi, ideal size, excellent !!
Then down the stairs into the adjoining Chiswell Street Dining Rooms for champagne reception, then back into the hotel, for speeches and cutting of the cake, then into another large room for live band and disco.
Then in the morning another treat, full English breakfast served in the Jugged Hare :)
A superb weekend, faultless service, thank you :)",5,2014,07,21
128,Great!,"Great hotel in a great location. The hotel staff was quite helpful, and greeted me quite friendly and without fuss. The hotel is a former brewery that was rearranged into an hotel, which leads to a sometimes confusing maze of corridors and passageways to access your room. I was in room 322, which is almost on top of the adjacent pub, the Jagged Hare, which means that I had to use 2 different lifts and walk a bit to get to, but this is part of the charm.

The room was a little small, but very well equipped and with a great bathroom. Air conditioning was quite efficient during this week end which turned out to be one of the hottest this year, although a bit noisy.

I dined at the Jugged Hare, which is certainly one of those gastro pub, the food was excellent and the service friendly, if only a bit slow. The noise level however is quite high and not suitable to a date or a quiet evening.

A little turn down: we experienced two fire alarm malfunctions, one during dinner which lasted a very long 10 mn and one at 7:30 am on Saturday morning, both quite annoying. I hope this has been fixed.

Note that Chiswell street is undergoing repairs and is barred: be aware of this if you are not mobile for any reason (luggage, handicap).",4,2014,07,21
128,Exceeded our expectations,"Superb hotel, friendly staff and a fantastic base for visiting London, comfortable beds and air conditioned rooms, brilliant location within walking distance to Liverpool street and easy to find. Would highly recommend and hope to stay again,",5,2014,07,21
128,Memorable stay,"The hotel itself is a bit of a maze, which is OK since we are in London as space is both old and limited.  Pay attention though, we were all the way up on the fifth floor and if we didn't commit the way to our room to memory, we would've been lost.  The room was generously sized, clean and just fine.  The real success story is the staff at the concierge.  We emailed them from out of the country ahead of our arrival as we needed special transportation needs and they were all over it.  A very special thanks to Vlad and Kalin.  This was my wife and my first time staying in Europe and these two gentleman made the logistics of travel easy.  Also, as part of our booking, we were granted access to the 'Club Room' which boasted free continental breakfast and drinks and cocktails in a very loungy atmosphere, however, this review lost a perfect score due to the lack of enthusiasm by the staff in the Club Room.  The breakfast girl seemed annoyed, and the evening drink/cocktail server had to be reminded of his duties by management before he served us a drink.  Too bad.  Otherwise very memorable and a great stay.",4,2014,07,20
128,so kind,"A lovely weekend stay at this refined but very friendly hotel. I had told them that we were booking a weekend there to celebrate my wife's recovery from intensive surgery for a very serious illness and they immediately offered us an upgrade to one of their club rooms. I was touched by this gesture and we really appreciated the superior feel to the room we were given. All the staff were attentive and friendly but the best part, in my opinion, was the absolute quiet at night which is something you dont often get in a busy hotel in a large city. We will definitely book again whenever we are visiting London. Thank you, again, to everyone there who looked after us.",5,2014,07,20
128,Will always stay in this Hotel...,"Where to begin with this superb Hotel... Stayed here for my Girlfriend's Birthday, from the moment we walked around the corner we was greeted and our bags taken upstairs. The staff were all full of smiles and attend my every needs. The receptionist greeted my partner, and asked if  she was the Birthday girl, kindly upgraded us to The Club House. on arrival to my room, was a lovely card accompanied by some champagne nice little touch from them.. They even asked if I needed any help planning her Birthday... This hotel cannot be faulted and when ever I return to London this will always be my No'1 choice....

Thank you very much..... To all the staff that made me celebrate such a good Birthday...

Kind Regards..

128,Beautiful and classy,"Was whisked off to this beautiful hotel in barbican and was totally blown away! Staff were fantastic, so helpful and attentive. The room was  modern and chic, had everything we needed- the fruit was a great added feature. Wouldn't book if a spa experience is wanted though, sauna/ steam room are very small. Overall best hotel I've stayed in, in London. Perfect",5,2014,07,20
128,Superb hotel,"We stayed here for a couple of nights over the weekend. 
Location: the hotel is situated literally just around the corner from the Barbican Centre and is mid way between Barbican and Moorgate Underground stations (just a few minutes walk away). 

Hotel: As described on their website, it is a listed former brewery building. For us, this was a positive as it does add character to the hotel. It is based around a central courtyard.

The room: we stayed in 139 which is situated to the back of the building. To access we needed to go up one floor (stairs or lift) and then over a bridge that spans the courtyard and down a few steps onto our corridor. The room was very comfortable. Not particularly spacious but well appointed. As it is located to the rear of the hotel, there was no view (other than looking across to the lower floors of the adjacent building). This was not an issue for us. The bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning very welcome on the hottest weekend of the year so far, and there was no noise heard from other guests - resulting in a very comfortable nights sleep. The shower (over bath) was sublime. 

Services: we didn't eat at the hotel or adjoining pub as we were meeting with friends elsewhere so can't comment on food, drink or service. We did call upon reception to sort out an issue with our tv. Maintenance turned up in minutes to resolve the problem with no fuss.

The staff: We found them friendly, welcoming, helpful and professional at all times.",5,2014,07,20
128,Not a 5 Star Hotel,"I would not stay here again.
Lots of stairs up and down to get back to a room on the ground floor.
Bathroom dirty, bed uncomfortable, lots of doors banging in the night.
Charge for breakfast in the room was inconsistent from documents compared to that advised at reception compared to the final bill.
Breakfast items not quite as requested.
Staff were struggling with the english language so could not give directions to the exit.  Shame that there were no signs anyway.
Complained but no action taken.  Email complaint ignored.
Extremely expensive and not worth the money; especially when there are nearby hotels 10 times better.",2,2014,07,20
128,Fabulous Staff!,"From the moment of my arrival, I felt incredibly welcomed by the staff. Beginning with the doorman, who tipped his hat upon my entrance, the concierge who met with a smile, and the front desk staff who quickly guided me up to my room. The room itself was very spacious, even for American standards, and well-stocked with towels, soaps and shampoos. It even included complementary bottled water and fruit. The hotel was about a five minute walk from the nearest tube station, but make sure you have directions before leaving the station (I found myself quite lost while carrying a large amount of luggage)! The only negatives that I can list was the noise. My room had an adjoining room, which on the night of the World Cup game, was pretty noisy. I could clearly hear the TV in the other room. In addition, in the morning there was some sort of party happening right outside my window that was quite loud. But overall, my stay was fantastic and I would absolutely stay there again.",5,2014,07,19
128,Good value but not 5*,"When a hotel advertises itself as 5* you have certain expectations - unfortunately these were not met (cracked bathroom sink, dated gloomy Club room with very small bathroom, tatty lamp shades, damp smell in bathroom).

That said, the location is great and the bed was very comfortable I did sleep well. The air con is very efficient and the in-room toiletries and hair dryer were good. Club room was good value at £170 - but would not rush to come back.",4,2014,07,19
128,Nice modern hotel in Barbican,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times after finding it on booking.com (by the way the rates are better directly on their website usually). It is in a great location if you want to be close to central London and don't want to pay too much. It's not cheap but good value for money. 
It has an amazing restaurant with great food, and the way some of the rooms are in a separate building is quite cool. However to find some of the rooms you have to go through a maze of corridors and lifts and it's slightly confusing but nothing major. 
I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is in London for a couple of nights and would like to be not too far from everywhere. It's right next to the Barbican and St Pauls is only a short walk away, and you can catch the bus or the tube to anywhere in London.",4,2014,07,18
128,Plusses and Minuses,"My stay at the Montcalm should have been great.  The location was perfect for my work in the financial district, and for sightseeing by the Thames.  Its part of a larger group of successful hotels, several of which I've enjoyed and rated positively.  And, its housed in an old brewery and surrounded by pubs.  What could go wrong?

Well, there was the room.  The first room I was given had a window that was less than a foot tall and looked out on a shaft.  This made the room dark and depressing and small.  Even by European standards, it was pretty small.  The second room was a bit bigger and the window was much bigger and looked out on the road.  Much lighter and cheerier.  One bathroom wall was glass, allowing you to look into the room, watch TV, etc while showering (or keep a blind closed).  So, not a bad final outcome.

Then there was the concierge.  One of the staff was exceptionally talented.  He got me a great seat at a show, great directions to the tube and around the city, suggestion for climbing the steps at St. Paul's.  Another of the staff sent me the wrong direction for a local landmark, gave me bad advice on a running route, and seemed generally indifferent to my existence.  

At checkout, I was told that because I booked through Egencia (Expedia for business), they wouldn't give me a receipt, but would send it to Expedia.  I asked several times in several ways to get the receipt and was told no.  Never experienced that before.

So, some good, some bad.  Know before you go.",3,2014,07,17
128,A lesson in class,"We spent a long weekend in this hotel, as part of my partner's business trip. Couldn't have been better for my first trip to London. The hotel is a charm, hands down. Each part felt luxurious, classic and suave without a hint of ""posh"" attitude. The lobby, common areas, rooms, corridors with a view to the courtyard, and the service itself are spotless. 

Extra point, I was having issues with my debit card and was unable to check into our room (my partner hadn't arrived yet). Nevertheless, the reception personnel was really professional, polite, and showed sincere care to make me feel at ease. Thank you!",5,2014,07,17
128,Fantastic Service in a nice Hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night on a Friday night after having a good deal online (£150 a night) 

The hotel is within walking distance of the Barbican Centre (2 mins) and the staff and service is excellent from check in to check out. 

We were upgraded to a Club Room which was nice and were given some recommendations on some places to eat in the area. We decided to start off at the Jugged Hare next door which was a fabulous British Gastro pub serving great food and drink. I would recommend this place to all. 

I thought the club room was nice and the lobby was very nice but the hotel did lack something that some other 5 star hotels had. Not sure what it was though. 

Saying that the service was definitely up there with the best and this was confirmed in the morning when I realised I had forgot my cufflinks for my morning suit. I was attending a wedding in London in a couple of hours and the hotel come to my recuse. After 5 minutes wait Adrian provided me with his own cufflinks and said I could drop them back to him in the morning or post them back to him at the Montcalm. This was brilliant and was very kind of him.

I would stay here again especially if I can get a good deal as there is plenty going on nearby on a Friday night with plenty of people having drinks after work and Shoreditch around the corner. I would also recommend the rooftop bar at the South Place Hotel which is a 4 minute walk away.",4,2014,07,16
128,A lovely stay,"Spent just one night here and really enjoyed it.  The location is great, we walked almost everywhere but tube stations are quite nearby if you want them.  The whole feel of the hotel is very calm and comfortable and the room likewise, as well as being very well equipped.  Service was excellent and staff extremely helpful and friendly.  We had dinner in the Jugged Hare restaurant next door and enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere, which was really buzzing on a Friday night.  If you are here at the weekend you might want to seek advice on booking at a table, as it seems it can get very busy indeed.  My friend and I both thought this was a lovely hotel and we would certainly hope to stay there again.",5,2014,07,16
128,Wonderful Stay,"Spent two nights at the hotel with my sons (18 and 20 years old).  The rooms were very nicely equipped, clean and sufficiently spacious.  My only complaint was the outdoor noise that woke me each morning.  Staff was very helpful.  We had Club Lounge access, which provided a nice continental breakfast and snacks and beverages in the evening.  Loved the Jugged Hare restaurant and pub next door!",4,2014,07,14
128,A lovely treat!,"I stayed here with my husband for a birthday celebration. On arrival, we had been upgraded to a club room and had a mini bottle of Moët in the room which was a nice touch. The room was lovely and despite being quite compact and having a small double bed, it was nice and cosy and very comfortable. The staff were very polite and helpful and we had a very nice continental breakfast on departure day. Only a few minutes walk from the tube station so a great location. I would recommend this hotel for a treat!",4,2014,07,14
128,excellent hotel,"this hotel is excellent placed in the financial area of the town, but also amazingly closed to the Shard, St. Paul`s Cathedral, Barbican center, and many other beautiful places to be discovered wile in London. the staff is really great, eager to help, always smiling and always polite. my personal thanks goes to Adrian, who helped me with directions ad recommended some restaurants. the room is very quiet , and the bed is just perfect for sleeping. i would totally recommend this hotel to anybody that is visiting London .",5,2014,07,14
128,Average Stay,"I stayed here for business in July 2014. Whilst the hotel is ok I don't think its five stars (the room was fine but the public areas are very pokey) and I had two major gripes:

(i) there is no sound proofing between the rooms - consequently I was woken up during the night and at 6.30am each morning by my next door neighbour watching television and chatting; and
(ii) I was in a Montcalm club room. This entitled me to use the club lounge for breakfast and evening drinks/canapes. However every time I went for either of these I was challenged as my name wasn't on their list. Each time reception confirmed I was indeed in a club room but it was very tiresome to have to go through this process every day to get a beer.",3,2014,07,12
128,"A fantastic Hotel, with lovely staff and a great location - amazing","My Fiance and I stayed here Friday through Monday for a weekend away for his 40th Birthday. The staff were amazingly helpful in arranging a birthday cake, bottle of Moet & a 2 step free room upgrade prior to us arriving - such a lovely thing to have done, they really well above and beyond.
Our room was awesome, impeccably clean, lovely Elemis toiletries which were fully re-stocked every day.
I would recommend this Hotel and the Team that run it to everyone, a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back - Thanks again Montcalm @ The Brewery!!",5,2014,07,10
128,"Great, couldn't fault this hotel","Excellent location, this hotel has excellent meeting facilities and restaurants as part of the site.

The rooms, whilst not huge were well appointed and very functional. No traffic noise ensured good nights rest.

The rooms were clean and well maintained and the staff were very helpful not only about the hotel, but importantly they were very knowledgeable about how to move around London.

Would definitely stay there again. 

I was part of a group of 40 attending a conference and the food and beverage was excellent and catered for all dietary needs. The hotel also provided excellent wifi reception that was fast no matter where you were around the hotel.

",5,2014,07,09
128,Brilliant stay,"We stayed here last Friday and Saturday night, and were very impressed. 

The location was perfect for our needs, as we were going to an event in the Barbican on the Saturday night. About 90 seconds walk! Couldn't get much closer if we tried! I also didn't realise how close a) the hotel was to the Barbican tube station, and b) how close the Barbican was to King's Cross (where I had caught the train down from Edinburgh).

The service was excellent, and, when we said that we were here for our wedding anniversary, we found a little bottle of Moet had been put out for us. Lovely! The staff were very helpful, and gave us a room upgrade, which we weren't expecting. They were very attentive and solicitous of our needs.

The room was on the second floor, which was easily accessible via a lift (never did find the stairs!). We thought it a pretty good size, considering we were in the CIty. It overlooked a cobbled passageway, but was relatively quiet as it was not at the front of the building. The decor was minimalistic, but very nicely done. The bathroom was lovely - lots of light and mirrors against the black tiles with silver detailing. The bath products were Elemis, which we were very happy with. The shower was great - loved the choice of rain shower or normal one. My only niggle was that it was not possible to have the hand-held shower as a fixed shower, too - which would've been better when I didn't want to wash my hair. However, the shower cap also included a wee hair bobble - first time I've seen anything like that! There was a glass wall between the bathroom and the rest of the bedroom, which was good for light; there was also an electric blind so that you didn't have to see your partner do everything! My husband loved the hairdryer, and is thinking of getting one himself; high praise indeed, I can tell you! 
The bed was very high, but very comfortable. The pillows were like sinking into clouds, and the duvet was lush. We had two nights of good sleep.

We had breakfast in the Jugged Hare, which was very good indeed, and a dinner with friends at the Chiswell Street Dining Rooms, which will be getting their own 5* review. 

Have already recommended this hotel to a friend who stays a lot in the City - we loved it. Definitely one to come back to!",5,2014,07,08
128,Fantastic stay,"My boyfriend surprised me with a weekend stay at the Montcalm and I was blown away. 
The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, the staff are so helpful the service is 5*. The aroma in the room is a lovely touch, and I found myself blown away by the small touches around the room. I would definitely come back. 

",5,2014,07,07
128,Excellent,"superb service, very attentive staff, comfortable and quiet room, would highly recommend, convenient location. enjoyed a drink outside the jugged hare bar, breakfast there was also excellent.  I will stay here again.",5,2014,07,06
128,Incredible Hotel Stay,"My wife and I stayed at The Montcalm at The Brewery in June for our wedding anniversary and had a fantastic time!  The hotel was beautiful with all of the latest amenities and the staff were very courtesy and helpful.  In addition, the concierge worked with us before we even arrived to find excellent restaurants for our vacation as well as book all of the reservations.  The hotel is in a great location, just a few minutes from the Barbican Tube Stop.  Overall, it was truly an excellent stay that exceeded our expectations and we plan to visit again in the near future.",5,2014,07,06
128,Very nice - I could get used to this!,"I stayed at the Montcalm for one night, when in London to attend an event at the Barbican. I'd picked the hotel primarily on location, and was pleased at how close it was, both to the tube station and to the Barbican Centre itself.

I had e-mailed with a question about the room before travelling, and got a prompt response, and when I arrived check in was quick, and the staff friendly. I was told on check in that I'd been given a 'club' room, instead of the basic one I had booked, which was nice, and the room was available even though I arrived a little early.  I did notice that (despite having requested non-feather bedding before arriving) the bed had been made up with feather pillows, but fortunately I noticed when I first checked in - I mentioned this at reception on my way out for the afternoon, and they were swapped over while I was out.

The room was large, and the bed huge. I'm glad that I was on my own, however, as the gap between the bed and the wall on one side was pretty small, and could have been awkward if I'd been sleeping on that side of the bed. 

There was complimentary fruit and water in the room, as well as tea and coffee making facitlities (there was also a 'pod' coffee maker, although as there were no instructions I didn't dare use it!) 

It was very helpful to have (waterproof) instructions for the showers.

I didn't eat at the hotel or use the fitness rooms so can't comment on those, but the rest of the hotel was lovely.(and, unlike so many hotels, there was a electrical socket by the bed, so it was possible to charge my phone *and* use it a clock!) 

When I checked out, the front desk staff member I spoke to was the same lady who had checked me in, and she remembered what I'd said about my plans for the evening and following day, and asked about them, which was nice.

Nothing is perfect, and there were one or two minor points -  the room had a variety of lights, but was still pretty gloomy - a standard lamp would have helped. I also noticed that there was no room service menu in my room - not a big deal, as I didn't want to order anything, and I am sure that one would have been brought up if I had asked.

My room overlooked the courtyard and I think, was opposite the restaurant - it was a bit annoying to hear lots of crashing and moving glass at 8 a.m - I don't suppose that the hotel has a lot of control over when deliveries arrive, but it it was a little disturbing! 

But over all, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely return if I need to be in the same area of London in future. (assuming, of course, I'm feeling flush!)",4,2014,07,06
128,Lovely stay,"I visited the Montcalm in early June for a weekend and was not disappointed. The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate and very clean with everything you might need provided. The bed was big and very comfortable, and the bathroom was a great size too. Location was very good, really close to Barbican tube station with lots of bars and restaurants walking distance away. My only criticism of the room is that the do not disturb panel thing was very confusing and we ended up accidentally missing out on our room being attended to on our second day. In addition, the hotel breakfast was very expensive (for me as a student particularly!), but this didn't take away from our enjoyment of the stay.",5,2014,07,05
128,Winter treat 2014,"I took my partner here for Christmas and was amazed at the high quality of service this hotel offered. It was beautifully presented and in an excellent London location. We could easily commute around London as the station was a 3 minute walk. The rooms were big enough and were very modern and clean.We also was a 'Club Lounge' guest which meant we had access to the lounge room which served alcohol and food complementary, the breakfast was lovely. It was quite expensive but it was well worth it.",5,2014,07,05
128,Breakfast,"I'm staying on this hotel since more than 1 year and the breakfast on the restaurant below is fantastic.
Food is daily fresh and service's guys are lovely and always smiling, above all Javier and Natalia.
Thank You!",5,2014,07,03
128,wonderful place to stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery on 27 & 28 June 2014. The Montcalm is a beautiful place to stay. It is very clean. The beds were so comfortable which is a change from other places we stayed at. The staff were wonderful, so helpful and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. Vlad the Concierge was great he gave us a map where he marked places to go so it made things easier to get around London. Definitely would recommend this hotel as the No1 place to stay in London.",5,2014,07,02
128,Nice and stylish hotel,"Stayed at this hotel during a conference. The rooms are nice and clean, but very small. Be warned that the hotel is a maze - rooms are scattered across two buildings and you can get lost. Hotel employees are very friendly and helpful. Visit the hotel restaurant, it's worth it!",4,2014,07,02
128,EXCELLENT!,"My husband, two teenage boys and I stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City in mid-June 2014. The property is beautiful, clean and in an excellent location. The staff is terrific and even went to the trouble of putting City of London flags in our boys' room in honor of the World Cup! Can't say enough nice things. We hope to return.",5,2014,07,02
128,Great boutique hotel,"This was my 2nd stay at the hotel (and i swear i posted a review last year but I don't see it..??)
I have been going to London for business and the location was convenient for me. 
Last year the room was in the same building as the check-in/conciege but this time, the room was in the building across the street.  They have a front desk person in this building as well so it's still ""secure"" and you kind of feel like you're walking in to a private building which is nice as well (and avoid the checkin/checkout crowd).
Positives
1) Location: Close to transportation:buses, Moorgate and can walk to Liverpool stations. Simple dinner options in immediate neighborhood felt a bit limited by you can walk to Shoreditch for dinner/drinks.
2) amenities/bathroom were nice - nice bathtub and rainfall shower. umbrella (essential for London), free bottled water is always nice.  though last year, I got a free fruitbasket - don't know why things changed.
3) Generally clean. Nice furniture.
4) Free wifi
5) room faced street but wasnt' noisy.
6)TV wasn't working at all and they sent someone over which took a while but got fixed after numerous plug in/out testing.. no harm done 

Negatives:
1) details: no brewed coffee machine, just an eletric kettle for instant powder(!)coffee, tea.  chipped coffee cup saucer.  
2) improvement on phone reception training needed? When I wanted to reserve a room, I asked for ""reservation"" and she forwarded me to a show ticket desk.  So i had to call back...  
Note: last time the bedspread had stains on it so I made sure to remove it immediately this time. It was probably cleaner this time but I just don't trust hotel bedspreads. They are kind of a dying item anyway - seems unnecessary if only for ""show/looks""...

Overall, my stay this time was more pleasant this round (the gorgeous weather certainly helped my impression).",5,2014,07,02
128,Great boutique hotel in the city,"This is a recently built boutique hotel in the core of the city that is very stylish, great service, modern and comfortable rooms and overall avert well priced for the category and quality of the hotel. So a very good choice if you need to be in the core of the City",5,2014,07,01
128,Wonderful treat,"We were staying here for an awards dinner and as such this was a massive treat. 
The entrance is in the old 'Brewery' archway and looks quite quaint and low key for a 5 star hotel, but the welcome is warm and it has a relaxed feel.  The layout of the hotel is typical of a converted building with changes of levels on each of the floors.  This added to the charm from my perspective but those with mobility Issues may need to request a room with 'easy' access.
The rooms are luxurious and well appointed, it felt like a proper treat. Love the little treats left as part of the turn down service.  Beds very comfortable 
I had continental breakfast which was good but not inspiring.
Hotel staff were very helpful and attentive without being obvious.  Would stay here again",5,2014,07,01
128,Highest level of service with boutique hotel flavor,"It is not the classic, huge, anonymous  5-star hotel, with 200+ efficient but cold rooms. Although it assures the highest level of service (the personnel is simply superb for their kindness and readiness to help, whereas the rooms are modern with up-to-date facilities), it has a flavor of  the old London boutique hotels, despite its location in the heart of the financial district. Perhaps it is the influence of the 17th century building, or the classic British attires proudly shown by the doormen, who knows?

The rooms are equipped with all kinds of accessories – you name it and there it is; the internet connection is obviously complimentary. The breakfast, served in the pub around the corner just a few of yards away (it may be inconvenient in winter or when it rains), is excellent and complete. Prices are in line with London’s cost of living.

Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,30
128,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night and was very impressed with the hotel. The decor and atmosphere is really decadent, the staff is very accommodating and the facilities are great. 24 hour room service and gym is great and breakfast in the club lounge was very nice. Our room was on the small side and didn't have any sunlight come in due to its positioning in the south wing but since we got the room as part of a deal (£163 on a saturday night including breakfast) we couldn't really complain. Unfortunately we didn't have time to try out the gym/sauna facilities so I can't comment on that. Good location, very short walk to Barbican tube station and walking distance from Shoreditch/other great things around the east end of london. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay can only say that one night wasn't enough!",5,2014,06,30
128,30th Birthday stay!,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriends 30th birthday as we were going for dinner in the shard. I made a comment on the booking that it was his birthday. On arrival my boyfriend was greeted with 'a little birdie told me it was your birthday!' which was a lovely personal touch - they also upgraded us free of charge to a 'club suite' which was amazing. We were also given complimentary moet champagne waiting for us on ice in the room & a birthday card!
The hotel was beautiful, clean, and the staff were so friendy & made you feel like royalty! It made our weekend extra special. would definitely stay again.",5,2014,06,30
128,Overall experience,"The hotel is stunning , the staff very friendly.  The one and the only reason I haven't given 5 across the board is , the breakfast was mayhem ! Took a while to be given a table and even though the chef was doin all he good you had to wait for items and the items that were ready was only just warm. I have to state though highly recommended hotel with fantastic staff !! ",4,2014,06,30
128,Best weekend ever,"great hotel, great staff, great location!!!!!!!! we stayed at the montcalm for the weekend as a mini break, the whole experience was amazing the hotel staff were extremely helpful and the room service was perfect. I will defiantly be returning!!",5,2014,06,30
128,Great Service,We only stayed one night but the Room & Service was excellent. Very friendly & helpful staff. Look forward to returning for a longer stay. The food in the Jugged Hare was very good and of excellent quality.,5,2014,06,30
128,Exceeded Expectations!,Everything about our stay at The Montcalm at the Brewery London City was  superb. The service we received from the minute we arrived until we left 2 days later was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and we couldn't recommend staying at this hotel highly enough! We will definitely stay at the Montcalm at the Brewery again.,5,2014,06,29
128,Excellent but may be awkward for disabled guests,"Fabulous hotel, attentive staff, great location. Made us feel very special nothing too much trouble. Breakfast was delightful also. Only downside for some guests might be the number of steps up and down. The hotel is like a rabbit warren and although there is a lift you still need to negotiate steps around the hotel. This does add to its charm though.!! Perhaps ask for a room on the ground floor. Very nice experience and would highly recommend  ",5,2014,06,29
128,A pleasure as always,Stayed for a weekend for our anniversary. As usual the staff were friendly and obliging. Our Club Room was beautiful with a brick vaulted ceiling matching that in the reception area and a bed so big my wife and I were sleeping in different postcodes. Wonderful. We will return!,5,2014,06,29
128,"Well located hotel in the City, excellent service, but smallish rooms and odd layout","The best part about the Montcalm is the location- right in the city and very close to many financial services offices. Service was all around excellent. The price for the room was fair for the location. The rooms were new, with good bathrooms but quite small and mine overlooked a wall with little natural light. The location of some of the rooms, including mine on the 5th floor require taking two elevators and walking down a couple of corridors. The odd layout of the hotel, understandable due to its conversion from a very old building, is a labyrinth.  The attached Jagged Hare pub is a great feature- excellent beer and pub fare, nice atmosphere.",4,2014,06,24
128,Loved the customer service,"We recently stayed here and I must say we had a great stay. The room was fantastic and the bed was super comfortable. The staff are very friendly and courteous and willing to do anything for you. I must personally thank Megha the front office manager for the great customer service extended to us. My wife and I were looking for a restaurant within walking distance, and since it was Sunday, everything in the City was closed but Kudos to Megha - she went the extra mile to find a nice Indian restaurant for us. She also made sure that we were well looked after in the restaurant. If I compare five star hotels in London I must say the Montcalm London City is the best for customer service,and I will recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.
Well done Montcalm!",5,2014,06,24
128,Nice and stylish,"Beautiful, new Hotel in an old brewery, interesting architecture and great location two steps from Barbican Center.
I got a ""cosy"" room (cosy means also very small), which was basically ok, except for the noise the house keeping did in the morning (opposite to my room was a house keeping room, so they started working at 6:30am, making a bit of noise). 
The service at the reception is very attentive, helpful and I got a complimentary breakfast for my stay - thank you again!
Otherwise quite calm and comfortable.
Small room service menu, but good service and very nice personal.",4,2014,06,23
128,One night birthday treat,"Simply excellent. All the staff I met could not have been more helpful. The disabled access room was large, luxurious and worked well for us. We ate in the attached fine dining restaurant in the evening - excellent food and service. Breakfast in the Jugged Hare - again excellent. We walked to the South Bank of the Thames the following day - a great day out.
All in all the birthday treat was a notable success, the complimentary bubbly being an unexpected bonus.",5,2014,06,23
128,If Carlsberg did hotels,"As far as hotel stays go this was by far the best. The service was second to none. The room was well laid out with a stylish look. The bed was amazing, so comfortable. 

I am a young guy who was visiting London with my girlfriend. It was our first trip away and the hotel was perfect for us. Close to the tube station we found it easy to get around to see the sights and enjoy the nightlife. Highly recommended, would certainly go again  ",5,2014,06,22
128,Superb,"Stayed here 2 nights with my wife for our anniversary weekend and have to say we were blown away by this hotel.  Good location near Barbican so short walk to Liverpool St / Shoreditch area and close to tube / railway etc.  The hotel is the converted former Whitbread brewery and because of this it has many charming features not least its vaulted ceilings in reception.  Because it's a former working building it's a little higgledy-piggledy but this is part of its charm and most unusual for new hotels.

We were greeted by very friendly reception staff.  They very kindly upgraded our room to a Club Room which was very spacious with ipod dock, good TV, robes and all the things you'd expect from a 5* hotel.  The bathroom wall is glass so you can see in and out of the bathroom which is a bit weird.  There is an electrically powered screen for privacy but I'm not sure what the point of the glass wall is.  Nevertheless it's a talking point and didn't detract from the great experience we had,

The adjoining pub, the Jugged Hare, is really nice (but small) with attentive, polite staff.  We had a nightcap or two there both nights.  They didn't even sneer at my wife's unexpected request for a Martini and Lemonade!!!

One slight issue is the rather small reception area which, when busy, was a little chaotic so I would urge them to do something about this.  No big deal really.

No wonder this new hotel has made a great impression with its guests.  5/5 - well done Montcalm!",5,2014,06,22
128,Lovely people,"Montcalm at the Brewery was very busy for the duration 0844 453 7443 stay and yet every member of staff was fantastic.  All smiled, all did their job with cheerful efficiency.  My room was good and comfortable.",4,2014,06,22
128,Customer service at its best,The perfect hotel only 5 minutes walk from the tube. Everybody in the hotel was warm and welcoming and tuned into every individual to make there experience unique and personal. A huge thank you for acknowledging my wife's birthday and upgrading our room and as I final surprise coming back after a fantastic night at miss Saigon to a card and a bottle of bubbly for my wife. It's the little things that make a difference and we will certainly be using the Montcalm on our next trip to London. Thank you for a great experience,5,2014,06,21
128,Lovely decor ,"Stayed here as a friend was getting married at the same venue. Lovely decor in the lobby area and welcoming staff. Our room was lovely if a little on the small side but it was the standard room so understandable in London. Overall we really enjoyed our stay would recommend if in the area.

No parking but you can park 2 mins walk from the hotel in a NCP for reasonable prices.",5,2014,06,20
128,Excellent stay at Montcalm,"A perfect place to stay in London, queit but still near to city, Tube is 5 minutes walking, very friendly personal and the rooms are very decently decorated and very comfortable. will come back for sure. Thanks to the Montcalm Team",5,2014,06,20
128,"Beautiful hotel, hard to leave",My girlfriend and I stayed here for New Year's Eve and had the most perfect stay as hotels go! The location was decent but the room was lovely and so comfortable! I would for sure recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a classy hotel ,5,2014,06,19
128,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here twice now and the  front of house staff are excellent.  Rooms very nice too.  Meaks are taken in The Jugged Hare just up the road and thats excellent.

Hotel is in a good location too

Stay here and you wont be disappointed",4,2014,06,19
128,Lovely hotel in perfect location,"We stayed here in May just for a weekend break. Literally next door to the Barbican, this was perfect for our evening reservation. Easy to find from the tube station. Very helpful staff and lovely welcome. Great room with extremely comfortable bed! We had breakfast in the pub attached to the hotel - we couldn't fault it. Fantastic all-round. ",5,2014,06,18
128,another wonderful stay,"I stay here almost every week now, i've tried the others(all the big brands) but you cannot match the attention to detail Megha and her team provide.  From the moment you walk in till the moment you leave they are there to make it feel like home.  The service is outstanding, the place is beautiful, the rooms are modern, bed comfortable and the food is great, both in the pub and the restaurant.",5,2014,06,17
128,Beautiful spacious room and beyond exceptional service,"My recent stay at this hotel was superb.  From the lovely, lively, and prompt service at check-in to meeting Megha, the hotel Manager, all could not have been better.  I upgraded to a club room on the 3rd floor and was given one close to the lifts as they were aware that I was close to the end of my pregnancy and they didn't want me to have to walk too far.  Very considerate!  Megha was particularly kind, helpful, gracious, and accommodating.  She even arranged for fruits and juice to be brought to my room.  Breakfast at the pub around the corner, which was packaged with my room, was delicious.  A nice selection of full English items plus breads, yogurts, cereals, and more.  It was a delightful stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.  If you go, be sure to say HI to Megha...and enjoy your spacious, well-fitted, modern room with a clean and well-designed bathroom!",5,2014,06,17
128,Delightful stay at Montcalm,"I arranged to stay at the Montcalm London City Suites as a treat for my Wifes birthday. From the moment we checked in to when we left the staff were always friendly and helpful, and the Montcalm seems to be one of few places left where the small details are still looked after to make sure you have a wonderful stay. The hotel itself is well located for access to London attractions, and the food available on premises is superb (breakfast was amazing).",5,2014,06,17
128,Wonderful stay,"I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel, the staff was very helpful and nice.
Everything is made to measure for you in this hotel, the quality of the rooms is exceptionnal. 
I will return there as soon as I return to London",5,2014,06,16
128,Nothing less than perfection,"From our arrival at The Montcalm, the staff were exceptional. The hotel is stunning, the contemporary design was impressive and the room was delightful. The subtleties made our stay perfect and the staff were helpful wherever possible. We cannot find the words to explain how lovely our stay was and since we left we haven't stopped making plans for our next stay here. 5* service in a 5* hotel in a 5* location... What more is there to say?",5,2014,06,16
128,An oasis of (mont)calm,"I stayed at the Montcalm over the weekend whilst attending a conference.  As a female alone in London I found the hotel staff to be both friendly and extremely helpful.  The room was of a very high standard, comfortable and quiet considering the hotel's centre position.  I would have no hesitation in staying again or recommending the hotel. In particular the attentive attitude of all the staff I encountered was extremely wam and welcoming.",5,2014,06,16
128,Excellent Hotel,"Great customer service, luxurious rooms, clean and comfortable with nice finishing touches for customers. Staff are friendly and very helpful. Spacious accommodation and no queuing for check in or checking out. Turn down service was a great touch too.",5,2014,06,16
128,Lovely Hotel,"We had a fab stay. Lovely room - comfy bed, pillows and all types of lighting and room air freshener which was a nice touch.

The bathroom has a large window into the bedroom which makes the room seem a lot larger and with there being volume control in the bathroom you can lie in the bath and watch and listen to the TV!

Great location for seeing London. Only two tubes from everywhere we wanted to see and quick and easy walk down one road from Barbican to get the tube. Would stay again when visiting London. We recommend having breakfast at Cote Brasserie - half the price of the hotel and beautiful - just across the road.

The only thing that disappointed us was the room had a tiny window - built into the side wall - couldn't see out of it and offered no natural light.",5,2014,06,16
128,Wonderful little details,"My stay at the Montcalm Brewery Hotel was outstanding. Right from the outset I was made to feel welcome. The staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the hotel and the area making my stay as easy and comfortable as possible. The room was perfect for my stay giving me a wonderful haven of luxury in the City. All the wonderful little details really made it that extra bit special from the magazines left for me to read to the evening turn down service and the Elemis sleeping spray for my pillow. I would definitely recommend staying at the Montcalm Brewery and hope to do so again in the future.",5,2014,06,16
128,Fab fab fab,"A home from home. I was greeted at the door of the Montcalm by a very friendly doorman who immediately took my case and welcomed me to the hotel.  The reception staff were also extremely friendly and efficient.  I stayed in a club room which was very spacious, clean and comfortable.   The buffet breakfast was excellent and good value with lots of choice.   I really enjoyed my stay and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.  I will most definitely be returning very soon.",5,2014,06,15
128,London Holiday,"Our stay at the Montcalm Brewery Hotel was outstanding.  The staff was the most attentive and helpful we have ever experienced.  They were on the spot with suggestions for sightseeing, dinner and entertainment.  All of our requests were promptly addressed.  It was a great stay.

Stan Ludwig
Moorpark, Ca",5,2014,06,15
128,Consistently good over 6 visits,"This is a very comfortable, high standard business hotel that will also satisfy those looking for a high standard for tourist visits too.

I have stayed in all 'medium' level room types including Club. Rooms are good sizes for the London market and very well finished. Rain showers in the bathrooms, several rooms have had a 'window' wall in the bathroom (with a blind too!).

Breakfast is good if you get it included, otherwise it is the standard overpriced London breakfast. The bar next door, The Jugged Hare is good, food is not as good as the price they charged for it however. Good selection of beers and spirits however. I did not try the Dining Rooms. Club breakfast (continental) is good and has enough to keep you going in the morning.

Hotel is in an excellent location to access the Barbican (right next to it), the closest Underground station is Moorgate but still only a ten minute stroll from either Bank (so DLR from City airport) or St Paul's.

The fact I have rebooked for business travel 6 times and will continue to do so tells you all you need to know.",5,2014,06,15
128,Outstanding,"I have never bothered to comment on a hotel before I have too for this one. We are just on our way home from 2 nights here, it is by far one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed at. 

At check in, the staff where informative, friendly and very welcoming. The porter again was the same, on arrival in the room, they had supplied a gift wrapped birthday cake for my husband (I had commented on my booking that it was his birthday) the room was spacious, modern and very clean. 

The hotel had all those little bits that you would expect from a 5* star hotel, even the pillow spray to help me sleep! 

I cannot wait to find another excuse to go back and stay again, and will certainly be recommending it to anyone who will listen! 

",5,2014,06,15
128,Nice fitness centre,"First of all, you will feel lost. Discover the way will be your daily adventure. Maybe someone can teach you a short way... That was my case! The breakfast is too expensive for the things that they offer. They have a fitness centre with the necessary and is opened 24/7! Everybody is pretty gentle with the guests... Nice hotel!",5,2014,06,11
128,Very good hotel!,"Only the noise of a generator or an air conditioner was wrong at night.  The staff, the room and the welcome gifts (water and apples), greats!! An iHome for my iPhone was a great detail also. No doubt for recommend this great hotel, with an underground station very close. ",4,2014,06,10
128,We will be returning......,"We stayed for one night and wished it could have been more, the rooms were very nice and the staff could not have been more helpful. Ideal location, only a 5 minute walk from the Barbican tube station.

You won't be disappointed!",5,2014,06,10
128,Excellant Hotel and Excelllant Staff,"I stayed at Montcalm whilst attending a business trip in the City. 
Wonderful hotel and beautiful room. 
Staff very welcolming and could not do enough to help. 
Food in restaurant excellant and overall a thoroughly enjoyable business trip.",5,2014,06,10
128,Tip-top,"This boutique hotel is lovely. Good, attentive staff and very smart. The standard rooms are not massive and the view out the window is bleak. But it's in a great central location and has a real feel-good feeling about it. On the negative side, as it is an old converted building it is a tortuous route to and from the bedroom, and some coleagues said they got some noise from the busy street outside. My room however - lovely and quiet. All the good features war outweight the bad - highly recommended.",4,2014,06,10
128,Great stay,"Thank you to all at the Montcalm at the brewery london city! We received a wonderful , warm welcome from Giselle at reception , who asked us if we were celebrating , when we told her it was our wedding anniversary she immediately upgraded our room , which was fabulous, if very hot!! Our breakfast was delicious and the staff at the hugged hare were very pleasant & efficient. We would definitely recommend this gem of a hotel!!",5,2014,06,09
128,Super friendly and helpful,"I stayed at the Montcalm London City for 5 nights last week during our Momentum event. The staff at the Montcalm were exceedingly helpful and friendly throughout, ensuring that everything I needed was at my disposal and that I was comfortable. The concierges were especially helpful, as were the front office and reception staff.",5,2014,06,09
128,Great hotel / Great service,"I was at this hotel for the first time the first week of June on a business trip.  The service was AMAZING! Megha Singh the front office manager is one of the best I have ever met!

Great location!",5,2014,06,09

Thank you all....",5,2014,06,08
128,Mont-very-Calm,"Fantastic stay at this lovely hotel where the staff go out of their way to look after and pamper you.
Breakfast at the Jugged hare was sublime and again staff were courteous in the extreme. Ideal position for concerts at the Barbican Centre, I highly commend this hotel to future guests.",5,2014,06,08
128,Nice treat,"We were supposed to stay in one of the rooms across the road, but on arrival were told we had a complimentary upgrade, which was very welcome seeing as it was tipping it down with rain so didn't fancy going outside again! The staff were incredibly polite and showed us up to our room. The bed was one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in, and we weren't disturbed by any outside noise, apart from the fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night for a few seconds, prompting me to jump out of bed and throw a dressing gown and slippers at my partner, before everything went quiet again and we could settle down. Breakfast in the morning was delicious, especially the mini Danish pastries!
We only stayed one night, but it was a very lovely, luxurious stay and we hope to visit again sometime in the future.",5,2014,06,06
128,Good Hotel and excellent location for city,"Have stayed at the Montcalm at Marble Arch and would say that is a better hotel. This is still very good, but is not as easy to navigate being a listed building.
Excellent location for my business trip and extremely efficient for storing and retrieving luggage. Used The Jugged Hare which is part of the building for dinner and breakfast, and found the staff to be extremely accommodating. Special thank you to Yani the Manager.
I would not choose to stay in the city if travelling for pleasure, but that is probably biased from previously living there some years ago.",4,2014,06,06
128,Pure Class with a personal touch.,"Stayed at The Montcalm for a special occasion and what a joy it was. 
The attention to detail was excellent, the room was stylish and fully equipped. 
I have stayed in many high end hotels all over the world but The Montcalm at The Brewery had a uniqueness about it that will ensure I will return. ",5,2014,06,04
128,Great City Hotel,"What a treat! I stay here whenever I'm in the city and love it. Staff are really friendly and can't do enough, rooms are new but all different. Toiletries are Elemis - lovely! For me it's the best city hotel as it's central, individual and has lovely staff. Chiswell dining rooms are great.",5,2014,06,03
128,Outstanding service and a memorable experience,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in for Business or pleasure.  The quality of service was exceptional, as was the attention to detail which made our overnight stay a truly memorable experience. The staff could not do enough to make sure that we were well looked after and provided additional benefits as this was for our wedding anniversary. We will definitely be going back.",5,2014,06,02
128,excellent hotel and great service,"we stayed just the one night as a birthday treat as we were seeing a show in London .
 The montcalm city London was an excellent choice .
 The staff all work very hard to make sure you have a great stay and everyone was helpful and attentive from the minute we arrived until the moment we left.
The room was a good size and bathroom facilities were excellent .Everything you expect from a 5 star hotel, bed was comfy and spotlessly clean with excellent free wifi .
we would highly recommend staying here if your planning to stay in this part of the city.10/10",5,2014,06,02
128,excellent and very modern would stay again !,"very nice lovely rooms and great staff unfortunate to not have any parking but there were sufficient spaces in the barbican theatre car park , lovely modern twist on an old style brewery, lovely friendly staff and good value for money !",5,2014,06,01
128,A reall treasure of hotel in London!,"My friend and I stayed here for two nights, the service was excellent from check in and check out. I I have to say their staffs were extremely helpfull and so service minded. I stay regularly in hotel for work and I have never been well taken care of at any other hotel.
The Montcalm will be my regular hotel for now on!",5,2014,05,30
128,Fantastic Service and Enjoyable Nights Sleep!,"We arrived at the Montcalm to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. We were asked why we were visiting London and as soon as we mentioned we were celebrating a birthday, we were upgraded to a Club Room (without even asking!).

The hotel reception is exceptional and the rooms are some of the highest quality I have seen in London.  The staff are extremely courteous and attentive.  The breakfast is at a price you would expect to pay in a London hotel, however is very good value when you consider the choice and quality of the food on offer.

Could not recommend this hotel anymore!  I have stayed here on four or five occasions and have also stayed in many other London hotels, so I can easily compare.  The Montcalm remains my favourite, without fail.",5,2014,05,28
128,tiny tiny room,"Experience started prior to arrival when I emailed the hotel to ensure that they had added my Montcalm membership number to the booking.  I also explained that I usually stayed at another hotel in London whilst away on business, but that I hoped my experience would lead me to change to Montcalm, given it was so near my place of work.  Despite 2 emails, no response.  Upon arrival, I was met by the lovely concierge.  Extremely personable, and definitely a wow factor, as this person took my case, directed me to reception, waited whilst I checked in and then took me to my room (although he did get lost a few times- it is a rabbit warren of corridors).  Not the ideal check in as they did not have my membership number recorded, so I got none of the perks offered.  Also, my reservation was with breakfast included, but they had no record of this and wanted to charge me the £19 extra- luckily I had my confirmation and showed her this.  When I arrived at my room I felt like I was walking in to a cupboard.  In an attempt to make it look bigger, the wall between the bedroom and bathroom was glass, so the bath was less than a meter from the bed!!  I did not like this at all.  It was so cramped, having to squeeze around the furniture.  The window was very small, and curtains shut when I arrived- I do know why, because when I looked out it was dark and dismall, with a view of... offices no more than 10 foot away- I could see them working away- no day light at all.  I then got a call asking me to bring my proof of breakfast being included to reception, so they could update my booking to ensure I actually got breakfast.  This is certainly not what I expect from a 3 star, let alone a 5 star. I know there are significantly better rooms in the hotel, which may make it the 5 star, but not based on my cupboard.  I won't be staying again as I could not settle at all in my room, as itI felt claustrophobic",2,2014,05,28
128,Beautiful hotel and fabulous service,"We really enjoyed our stay the Montcalm, the staff did everything they could to make us feel welcome and looked after, this is the most important part of any hotel stay and as long as they can keep that service up they can do no wrong.
The hotel itself is beautiful, although its a bit of a maze because its a grade 2 listed building, so a staff member kindly escorted us to our room on arrival. 
We stayed in a club room which was amazing, very comfortable and really specious for London! Well worth the money. The little extras really made it, like the iphone docking station, fragrance diffuser, nespresso machine, glass wall in the bathroom, and rain shower. If you are a light sleeper ask for a room away from the main road, but it wasn't an issue for me.
The location is good, a few mins walk to Barbican station, we had no problems finding it.
Overall we had a fantastic experience and I'm already booking again for our next stay.",5,2014,05,27
128,Great spot!,"This was a wonderful hotel. The staff were extremely helpful, friendly, and professional - they are genuinely interested in making sure their guests are well taken care of. The room was extremely clean and comfortable with great amenities such as complementary Wi-Fi. Although we had to move our room part way through our stay the staff was most helpful in doing so. The location of the hotel is fabulous - just around the corner from the Barbican Centre and only a couple of blocks from the tube - it also is attached to a great pub. The area is worth exploring - good restaurants, historical sights, and shopping. We will definitely go back to this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2014,05,26
128,Wonderful hotel,I stayed at The Mountcalm Hotel in London and loved every minute of it.  I felt totally looked after and special.  I was due to attend a dinner in the evening but i had to force myself out as I did not wan to leave my room!  I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2014,05,26
128,Absolutely fantastic!,"I was sceptical when I booked because I think compared to other 5 star hotels in London the Montcalm Brewery seems a little cheap, but I have to say it's one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in - which makes it incredible value for money!
Staff are absolutely fantastic, couldn't do anymore for you, and the hotel itself is just lovely. It was my boyfriends birthday and they even sent us a complimentary bottle of wine to the room which was a lovely touch.
I wish I could of stayed longer!",5,2014,05,26
128,Fantastic Experience,"Fantastic experience, with outstanding service. I could not fault my stay. The location was perfect for the City. Nothing was too much trouble. Free wifi. Fantastic dining and drinking experience. I will definitely return.",5,2014,05,26
128,Great hotel!,"I stayed at the Montcalm for 2 nights while attending a conference. The conference venue was at walking distance which was a big plus. Hotel staff is very professional and friendly. Everything was done to ensure we had a pleasant stay.

Throughout the hotel there is free Wifi, which is an important element for business travelers. Signal strength and bandwidth are definitely one of the best I ever experienced at a hotel. A big plus!

The Club Room was really nice and had lots of fancy details: indirect lightning, floor heating, rain shower, DND electronic sign, EU plug etc. etc. The room itself was not too big but I assume this is according to the standards in London. Unfortunately the DND sign stayed on during the day (even after switching it off for sure) and as a result the room did not get cleaned. 

The room was located on the street side and there was quite some noise from the street late in the evenings and early in the morning - the windows and glass are simply not isolating enough. I'm guessing this is due to the historic nature of the building and the fact they want to keep things genuine. For me it didn't really matter as I needed to get out of bed early anyway - but something to take into account when booking at the hotel.

Breakfast in the Jugged Hare is not cheap but definitely worthwhile. The buffet offers a wide variety of products and everything I had was just excellent. Great coffee and juice(s) too!

Overall a great experience. Highly recommended!",5,2014,05,24
128,Very good staff,Great place to eat and the staff were very attentive. Prices good for London and easy to find and also the Dining Rooms and The Brewery venue was brilliant. Will come back again next year. All in all a great experience.,5,2014,05,23
128,"Fabulous service, comfy rooms, ideal for business trip or romantic getaway","Echoing many other raving reviews, this is a wonderful property with a caring, professional staff! We stayed a total of 6 nights and I was sad to leave - miss the staff and the pampering. My hubby needed to be in the financial district for business a couple of days, but we also were hoping to stay someplace nice to celebrate our 10th anniversary in style and spend the remainder of our time on vacation and do some site seeing. The Montcalm at the Brewery fit the bill perfectly, and Megha Sing, the front office manager, and the amazing staff wowed us over and over again with exceptional service, attention to detail, and a romantic surprise for our anniversary. 

This is an interesting historical property so the entrances are all cobblestone, the ceilings are high, and there's some quirky short flights of stairs leading to the club room where afternoon tea, evening wine/beer and continental breakfast are available (for club room packages). The fitness room is adequate and clean, equipment was in good working order, and there's even a sauna and a separate steam room. 

The hotel decor is tastefullly done, with fresh flowers in public areas, and public restrooms, comfortable and handsome leather furniture and a soothing water fountain in the lobby, and gorgeous chandeliers. I peaked in on the event rooms and they seemed well-appointed. The guest rooms are modern yet conservative, and the bed was heavenly - great pillows, fluffy comforter. The room had nice amenities like scent choice, comfy slippers and robes, a good-sized flat screen t.v., real china and a hot water pot for tea/instant coffee, a small refrigerator (maybe only in Club room??), and the color scheme that was serene yet masculine/neutral. Also, we needed a wheelchair accessible bathroom/room - ours was quite nice with a toilet that included a bidet feature (!) and a really nice shower wand, flip down wall seat, and separate rain shower head. The only downside is there's no wheelchair access to the Club Room, but the manager took care of us and provided in-room breakfast instead since the main reservations person didn't tell us the limitations in advance. Again, Megha and the rest of team were so very accomodating in every way possible so this didn't spoil our stay. The property is also one of the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in.

Location is convenient to bus stops, Moorsgate and Barbican tube stations (fyi - NO wheelchair access), and a short walk to St. Paul's Cathedral, across from which is a nice mall on New Change. The cab ride to/from other sites was reasonable at around 12 to 18 pounds (we needed the wheelchair ramp so didn't take the bus). On a good weather day, I even walked all the way to Borough Market, a longer walk with decent site-seeing along the way. There's another cool market maybe a little closer - Spitalfields Market. We also enjoyed a long walk to the artsy, 'real London' neighborhood of Shoreditch for dinner at Dashoom (Bombay Indian cafe). Wonderfully yummy and good service.

We dined in a few times - amazing English breakfast via room service, with Illy coffee! Evening desserts and in-room dining had very limited choices but tasted fine. We celebrated our anniversary at the elegant but not stuffy Chiswell Street Dining Room which is located at one end of the hotel.The front of the restaurant also has a popular pub area where business professionals/ locals seem to enjoy for happy hour and pre-theatre libations, but not too noisy in the dining room. Food was good with decent portions and lovely presentation. Staff was great. 

The hotel location was also so convenient to a phone store for a SIM card, a Boote's pharmacy, casual dining at Wagamama (gluten free options/ tasty Asian food) and a large cafe/bar with a diverse menu, All Bar One. We did not try the pub on-site, The Jugged Hare, because it didn't seem very wheelchair friendly, but it often had people there as we walked by. Also, I didn't realize how yummy Pret a Manger (take away deli/coffee) was when staying at MBLC, but there's one near the hotel so don't bother going to a Starbuck's; this chain is much better. 

All and all, if you are able to book a room at the Montcalm at the Brewery London City for your time in London, you will not regret staying there!",5,2014,05,22
128,Very good stay would recommend!!,"Stayed here for a friends wedding, very good service from arrival. A 5min taxi ride to hotel from Liverpool St, quick check in and upgraded to a club room as first weekend away from our child. We had breakfast the next morning very good and much needed! Would happily book this hotel next time in London ",5,2014,05,22
128,Central London Gem!,"Stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery for 6 nights and just loved it.  Describing the staff as attentive is an understatement.  They were always friendly with a smile, a hello and you were never looking for assistance as there was always someone on hand.

Rooms in London are typically small and The Montcalm wasn't much of an exception, but the rooms we had were stellar nonetheless.  Well appointed and very quiet.  The only downside, from a room standpoint, that I can recall was figuring out what light switch controlled what lights.  Honestly, I would have believed they even changed over time.  

Beds were comfortable and towels/linens were excellent.  

I liked the push button security feature that put a signal outside for do not disturb and housekeeping.  Not having to worry about putting a flyer on the door was nice.

At the end of the rather long days (especially suffering from jet lag), it was really nice to enter the room in the evening with the tv tuned to classical music, some fresh fruit placed out and hotel slippers placed out should I want them (I didn't really, but it was a nice touch).

Wifi was complementary and gave me no issues.  Didn't even require passcodes, which is easiest of all.  (Maybe that's a bad thing?)

Room service was timely and the food was decent.  But why do that when London has so many great restaurants to discover?  The nearest tube station was Moorsgate, only a few blocks away.  

Can't wait to stay there again next year.",5,2014,05,20
128,Overnight stay,"We stayed at The Montcalm as we were attending a function at The Brewery.
The staff were extremely helpful and courteous ,We had a club room which was excellent although a little dark.We only had breakfast which was good. Would highly recommend this hotel",5,2014,05,20
128,excellent wedding,"one of the best hotel i have stayed in excellent services it is truly 5* i attended a wedding with my family there was 9 of us and nothing was to much trouble.
i would recommend this hotel it was luxurious.",5,2014,05,20
128,Wedding weekend,"Our families has an amazing stay at The Montcalm. We were greeted warmly and made to feel very welcome. The service was impeccable and the rooms most comfortable. Breakfast was served in The Jugged Hare and was quality- a varied choice of hot and cold food.
I would most definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,05,19
128,Week long stay at the Montcalm,The Montcalm is an excellent property in the center of the financial district.  The hotel is well appointed and the service impeccable. The staff brings to mind an age of service and tradition that you do not experience in more common properties.  The amenities rival any hotel from the perspective of a business or casual traveler.  Loved the stay!,5,2014,05,19
128,Superior Rooms & Excellent Service,"This is the third time I've stayed at this location and it is truly a special place.  Located very close in proximity to the tech center and our London offices, this is a home away from home for me while traveling on business.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating for whatever needs you may have during your stay.  I was thoroughly impressed with their attention and it was a pleasure to meet some of the managers of the hotel in the lounge.

The rooms are quiet, comfortable, and the details impeccable for what you would expect out of a luxury hotel.  I really can't express this enough -- top notch on all accounts.  I'm looking forward to staying here regularly on future visits.",5,2014,05,19
128,Delightful accommodation & great city location with a nice personal touch.,"I recently stayed at the Montcalm Brewery for the Jean Paul Gaultier exhibition at the Barbican - which is literally across the road from the hotel.  The hotel is instantly impressive from the exterior let alone the delicious surrounds of the interior in the reception area.

Adding a really nice personal touch, each guest is escorted to their charming room by one of the many professional staff while receiving an informative overview of the hotel's facilities and amenities.  This is something most hotels fail on.

I had the good fortune of meeting the Front Office Manager Megha who was an absolute delight to converse with and based on her hospitality & charisma alone will stay at this property again when I am next in need of somewhere to pamper myself in London.

As well as its great location to the Barbican, Old Street and Moorgate the hotel is a 3 minute walk to wonderful Whitecross Street with its many great ""food trucks"" and cafes.  Or simply grab a bite and something to drink in their cosy bar & restaurant.

Well done Montcalm Brewery - you've won me over!",5,2014,05,19
128,Great London hotel with character and charm,"After years of alternating between 3-4 regular London hotels for regular business trips, I tried the Montcalm at the Brewery London City (not to be confused with the Montcalm @ Marble Arch). It's in an old brewery, so there is a lot of character to the place, though the rooms are quite comfortable and modern. Not all rooms have great windows given the layout of the building, but the amenities are comfortable and I've stayed a couple of times in different parts of the hotel and not been let down. The historic building has a lot of levels so there is a bit of a journey to get from the lobby to most of the bedrooms but it's part of the charm. Great pub that also serves breakfast, and quite good food in the restaurant. Staff are very attentive and helpful. Neat part of the city, and a pretty easy cab ride most places.",4,2014,05,18
128,What A Great Hotel!,"From the moment we set foot into the hotel it looked amazing!!! We were really happy with our room which was right on the end of the west wing (255), this was given to us especially since it was our first wedding anniversary! 
The hotel is closest to Barbican tube station so has easy access to all of the main attractions. St Paul's cathedral is just a short walk away! 

We would definitely recommend this hotel and it's lovely staff who could not do enough for us and were so helpful! 

Tip: For anyone going to watch the lion king there is a bus going straight from outside to hotel to the theatre (bus 67) make sure you get off at Aldwych though otherwise you could end up in Waterloo! 
",5,2014,05,18
128,"Excellent ,but to much walking ","The hotel and amenities are great , the only thing negative is to much walking to get to your room , have to take 2 separate lifts , but other than that . O and £24 for a cooked breakfast  ??? Didn't have as I'm not poor just I think it's just cheeky charging that! Especially for a buffet type breakfast ! Thankyou ",4,2014,05,18
128,Incredible boutique hotel - the best!!!,We have stayed in big corporate 5 star hotels all over the world and this was genuinely the best hotel we have ever stayed in. It was my girlfriends 30th birthday and I couldn't have chosen a better hotel to celebrate a weekend in London. The attention to detail was incredible from check-in to check-out. I paid extra for club lounge which was so worth it as we arrived early and after a fantastic introduction to the hotel they allowed us to relax in the club lounge while our room was being prepared. When we eventually got the keys they upgraded us to an amazing room which made our stay even better. To top it off they also sent a birthday card and cake which was a great touch. Breakfast is also included in the club lounge which was great. We will definitely be back. Thank you once again!,5,2014,05,16
128,"Fantastic hotel, staff and location","This hotel has a great central location but manages to be incredibly quiet at the same time. 

The decor in this listed hotel is beautiful and manages to combine modern technology and a fresh feel with traditional features and oozes quality. 

The staff were incredibly helpful, instantaneous in their responses and very knowledgeable on both the history of the building and local area. Nothing was too much trouble. 

I would definitely stay there again for business or pleasure and would highly recommend it. ",5,2014,05,16
128,"Fantastic service, beautiful hotel","This is a beautiful hotel in an amazing building. The staff cannot do enough to help. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated, quite small but sufficient with a lovely bathroom. Quiet hotel so you can sleep well. The breakfast was fantastic.",5,2014,05,16
128,Wedding night,"We stayed in this hotel for our wedding night after our reception in the Barbican, we were upgraded to the WOW suite which was stunning, the hotel was perfect, service was perfect and we enjoyed our stay. We missed breakfast as we got up late which is our only gripe- otherwise was a perfect stay.",5,2014,05,16
128,Great hotel....shame about the beds,"Stayed there a couple of times recently and it is my hotel of choice in the area.  Great value if you can access a good corporate or discount rate.  Bit quirky inside.....as can often be the case with hotels converted from buildings that had a former use.  Only downside is bed......far too soft to the extent that if you lie one one side of the double you fell like a rolling off.  Stayed there twice with same experience.  I'm not petite so wondered if something to do with my size, but colleague had same experience.  If you are sting there be sure to lie in the middles of the double bed!",4,2014,05,15
128,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel in a really interesting period building. Very helpful and friendly staff and excellent quality rooms which were clean, spacious and quiet. Located at the Barbican also made it easy to have as a base for exploring London. Breakfast was great as well. Thank you",5,2014,05,15
128,Great place,"Having stayed here several times I've found it a good place to stay, if not a little pricey. Navigating to room can be difficult but staff are on hand to walk you to your room. Not the best view from toons but inside they have everything you could need. Will stay again. ",4,2014,05,13
128,the best hotel,"totally spoilt from the moment we entered reception,not one downside. the staff were brilliant and polite throughout,will recommend to everyone.the only downside was the fact that we only stayed one night,and the jugged hare was also a very nice place to enjoy the ambience of this hotel set in the old whitbread brewery",5,2014,05,13
128,An amazing hotel,"We had an incredible stay at The Montcalm and would recommend it to anyone who wants a special, highly functional and gorgeous looking hotel for any occasion. It was my partner's birthday and for that alone we got upgraded to a suite. The staff were absolutely charming from the man who took our bags from the taxi, to the receptionist who spoke to us about our plans with interest and suggestions, to the concierge and room service delivery man - everyone was so friendly, polite and professional. The hotel is fitted out to an incredible standard, the Jugged Hare restaurant next door serves outstanding food and it was the smoothest hotel stay we've ever had. I cannot wait to go back and will be doing so every few months just for a break away in style.",5,2014,05,13
128,Great spot near the City,"Very nice boutique style hotel. High quality renovation of an old brewery. Rooms are a good size, with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. Easy walk to the financial district, connections to the tube (Liverpool Street Station), Brick Lane, etc",4,2014,05,13
128,Comfortable and good location,"A nice hotel set in an old brewery. The entrance is very nice and you are welcomed by a 'butler'. The staff are very friendly and polite. Luxury feeling with Hermes shampoo and soap, pillow spray every night, good quality hair dryer etc. 24 hour hours roomservice available. Comfortable beds.. And we had a good price because I found a deal on Hotels.com.",4,2014,05,13
128,Fantastic!,"We stayed one night at the The Montcalm at The Brewery London City for a special treat for my husband’s birthday and Babymoon. From start to finish the service was amazing. 

On arrival we were offered hot serviettes to wash our hands and informed that we had been upgraded to a Club room,. Friendly concierge helped us with our bags to our room and explained the history of the hotel to us. We also received special amenities for the room - a lovely chocolate cake with a Birthday wish card and complementary continental breakfast. 

The room was luxurious, clean and everything was in working condition - everything was very high quality, lovely thick towels, bathrobes, slippers, a fantastic hairdryer and a bed you can melt away in!! 

The Montcalm has two restaurants, The Jugged Hare (a gastro-pub) and Chiswell Street, Dining Rooms. However, we were informed that on the weekend The Jugged Hare was the only one available - on initial preference we were hoping for a romantic evening in Chiswell Street, Dining Rooms, but we were far from disappointed!!! As a resident of the hotel you received an complementary flight of wine which unfortunately I could not try, but on personal recommendation from my husband, the wines were lovely! Portion sizes were great and the choice of food was abundant. You do need to book early as people were still coming into the restaurant at 10.30pm (with every table occupied) and as a result the service was a little slow, however we received a complementary pudding – bonus. 
 
I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough, the staff were attentive, the experience was unforgettable and from walking through the front door until departure you are made to feel important and nothing was too much for the amazing staff.

128,Relaxing,"Just returned from a weekend in London with my partner. Well what can I say The Montcalm was lovely. A beautiful hotel set in an old brewery. The staff are very friendly and seemed to genuinely care that I had a nice stay. Were very polite and friendly. The rooms are very stylish, well cleaned  and in a great location. Loved the elemis products, especially the pillow spray .. Nice little touch. Only fault is price of the mini bar but the two nights of pure relaxation in one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in more than made up for that :D ",5,2014,05,12
128,Excellent stay,"We recently stayed at the Montcalm brewery and were blown away with the service. After a long overnight flight we were very happy to that the hotel was able to check us in to our room at noon so we could rest, we had minor issue with the showerhead and the hotel sent offered to change our room which I did not want to do so they sent us some chocolates and a bottle of wine for the inconvenience of dealing with a crappy shower head for couple of days. 

Thank you Montcalm team",5,2014,05,12
128,5 star comfort and fantastic breakfast,I stayed here for one night and found the hotel both characterful with modern facilities. The staff were both friendly and helpful too. I welcomed the help of the staff in guiding me around the large hotel.  The bed was very sumptuous but a little soft for my taste but nevertheless it was a very good overnight stay.  The breakfast was included in the Jugged Hare next door to the Montcalm.  This pub restaurant was a lovely place and the service was excellent.  I was offered something from the a la carte menu and the egg florentine was delicious. The buffet menu of cooked and continental was also inclusive and this made for an excellent breakfast. A very good start to the day!,5,2014,05,12
128,Great hotel,"We stayed at the Montecalm London Suites.  Room was lovely, staff really helpful and lots of nice little touches to make it a great place to stay.  The location is great - and we ate in the Jugged Hare which was also fabulous.  Would highly recommend hotel and pub.",4,2014,05,12
128,A new luxury hotel in the beautiful brewery buildings,The hotel is in an excellent location next to the Barbican Arts Center. I have stayed on several occasions and always found the service and accomodation to be of a very high standard. The staff are always very welcoming.,4,2014,05,11
128,"Great hotel, everything you need.","Great hotel. Modern clean rooms. Rooms on the small side but perfect for a weekend stay in London. Very nice bar attached to the hotel as well. 
Staff couldn't do enough to help.
Will use the hotel again for future trips. ",5,2014,05,11
128,Amazing hotel with great customer service,My favorite hotel in London! The service and rooms are great! Thanks to everyone who makes my stay as comfortable as possible. The restaurant and club room are very nice as well. Looking forward to my next stay!,5,2014,05,11
128,Every little detail thought of,"Competitively priced, well located, friendly staff, a true 5* service. We booked this hotel for an anniversary weekend and it lived up to every expectation. The staff couldn't do enough to help, the rooms are great and the complementary services are brilliant. Great hotel, will return. ",5,2014,05,11
128,Fantastic!!,"Extremly good service, nice price and a fantastic room. Exellent English breakfast, a very good bed and a good location just near Moorgate tube-station. I will for shure book a room here on my next stay in London. Highly recommended!!!",5,2014,05,10
128,Very nice accommodations in the heart of the city,"The hotel is located in London City, which gets a little slow on the weekends b/c its a business district, but if you don't mind walking a bit there is plenty within reach and great access to the Tube.  This is one of the only buildings to survive in the area from WWII and while it has not always been a hotel, which gives it an odd layout, the staff and accommodations were fantastic.  From checkin to recommendations to general questions.  Even though was upgraded to a better room, they were still a bit on the small side, but solo i had plenty of room.  

If you're coming in from paddington station, take the tube as a cab ride very expensive (didn't make that mistake on my way out)",5,2014,05,10
128,"What ""Hospitality"" means","I was truly amazed by the service of everyone I met during my stay, from the front office staff to the portier. 

Everything was made to make us feel comfortable. The room was perfectly clean, the bed comfy, the little attentions we found on our pillows on our second night were adorable. 

Some of the ofther comments you can read are true : yes the shower is a bit odd, with lots of different buttons to turn, but there is a helpful guide. The beds are really high, but really comfortable (but a bit small). It was also hot in my room when I arrivied, but the AC worked perfectly. 
Also, the hotel corridors are a real maze ! I even saw customers handling ""hotel maps"" ! But this is what makes the charm of the hotel, and honestly I never saw any hotel like that in my life and I was delighted.

I could easily walk to Bank, Moorgate and Old Street stations from the hotel, and it is also a short walk from the Thames river sides which is perfect for sightseeing. 

The area is really calm (especially on week-end : its desert), but you have good restaurant options at the pubs around the hotel. 

I'll definitely stay there again, especially if I have business meetings in the City. 

Thanks to all the staff !",5,2014,05,09
128,Wonderful weekend,"Having been recommended highly to us we decided to give the Montcalm a go instead of the usual hotel that we use for our regular weekend theatre breaks in the capital.
As soon as we pulled up outside the hotel our experience began, we were welcomed by a very helpful doorman who did everything to make us welcome and guided us to the check in desk where we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had been upgraded to a suite.
The accommodation was faultless, the bed large and comfortable, the bathroom modern and well equipped, the TV had every channel we could have wanted and the standard of the drinks making facilities very impressive.
Shortly after arrival in our room a complementary bottle of wine arrived.
We had use of the Club Lounge which was very good, continental breakfast in the morning and from 5.30 to 7.30 snacks and complimentary drinks which was great before setting off to the theatre.
Attached to the hotel is the Jugged Hare public house and restaurant which we found very good with very pleasant helpful staff.
We have now got a new first choice hotel for our London stays and will be highly recommending the Montcalm at the Brewery to all of our friends in future",5,2014,05,09
128,helpful staff,"The room was very clean and comfy but a tad tight for 2 adults and a child. I found this city hotel to be more geared towards adults than children. The staff were great! In particular, Vlad at the concierge was exemplary in sorting out a mail delivery mishap...without his help i would never have been reunited with my guitar delivery! Thank you!",4,2014,05,08
128,Amazing!,"My partner and I stay in many hotels for both business and pleasure and this was by far one of the best places we have ever had the pleasure of staying! From checking in to checking out, the service, the staff and the hotel itself (rooms, facilities, cleanliness and ameneties) were above and beyond our expectations. This was an anniversary gift for my girlfriend and the staff and hotel made our stay one of the most enjoyable to date. Cannot reccomend the hotel enough. Amazing.",5,2014,05,07
128,Wow wow and wow,"This was a last minute booking for my partners birthday and from start to finish was amazing , not only is the accommodation so luxurious but the staff are the best part of this from our arrival to end they could not do more for us and accommodated drinks and a birthday cake surprise on arrival was very special trip would recommend to all and the breakfast was fabulous too what an amazing hotel location and food was top as well thanks to everyone we will be back soon xx",5,2014,05,06
128,Our Return Visit,"We first visited the Montcalm at the Brewery about three years ago and jumped at the chance to re-visit. Our expectations were high and we were not disappointed. Without exception the staff were courteous and helpful and did everything possible to make our stay interesting and comfortable and our room was furnished, equipped and serviced to a very high standard. We enjoyed the dining and bar facilities and the hotel location was ideal for our purposes. We will visit again at the first opportunity.",5,2014,05,06
128,Very pleasant hotel,"The staff at the Montcalm are very helpful and friendly.  Lovely toiletries in the room and super bed linen and towels. The breakfast at the Jugged Hare was very good.

My only criticism would be that it was rather difficult to find one's way through the maze of corridors.The sign posting in the corridors could be better.",4,2014,05,06
128,Wow!,"Don't actually need to say anything else apart from wow. What an amazing stay! Can't fault this hotel in the slightest. From first walking through the door the staff couldn't have been any nicer and went out of their was to make us feel really welcome . The visit was for an anniversary and they upgraded our room, which made our weekend that extra bit special. The rooms are super nice with everything you could need and the beds are so comfortable! I literally could go on and on about how amazing this place is. Defo recommend it and hopefully one day ill be back to enjoy the five star experience! ",5,2014,05,05
128,Superb - Yet again!,"This has quickly become the number one place for us to stay in London. We discovered it in December and have been back several times since. Staff are exceptionally professional and friendly. I also think it is very good value for money. A first class hotel which I will be booking next time I am in London.

128,Highly recommended !,"Everything from the welcoming staff to the beautiful rooms is pleasant at the Montcalm.
Experience an impeccable service, very good food and good sized room. Hermes toiletries + all mod cons. Highly recommended !",5,2014,05,05
128,magnificent montcalm,"Our stay here for the, first time was a great choice the staff are so helpful and knowledgeable, nothing was too much bother for them, the rooms were well proportioned with some nice touches of fresh fruit and little mints placed on your pillow in the evening. What a fantastic hotel in which I will be staying next time I am in London.",5,2014,05,05
128,Stunning,"Really cannot fault this hotel, everything from checking in, to being taken to our room and being shown how everything worked! Shame you can't award more stars! Little touches like apples in the room, to having the bed turned down with sweets on your pillow! And slippers put by the bed. Felt like a queen. I will definitely recommend this hotel and will be back.",5,2014,05,04
128,Great weekend made special by Montcalm,"Stayed in London for my wife's birthday. Off to the west end to see a show and so overall experience for the weekend was key. There isn't parking but it is next to barbican centre and parking for 24hrs is reasonable but surprisingly close to hotel. 

From the porter who saw us arrive to relieve us of our baggage, then upgrade room with a wrapped present of a birthday cake for my wife, all added to lovely touches. Even returning from show the porter welcomed us by name making us feel a little special. 

Though close to tube stations, because of the weather we walked everywhere, to covent gardens, Westminster, by the river and back, location is spot on!

Room is very nice, amenities outstanding and shame we couldn't stay longer. Would we go again? .... Absolutely! 
",5,2014,05,04
128,Birthday weekend in London,We chose the Montcalm to stay in whilst  celebrating my husbands birthday weekend in London and what a good choice it was. Everything was perfect from start to finish and we were made very welcome from the minute that we arrived. As it was my husbands birthday they upgraded our room and delivered a chocolate cake to our room for us. The rooms are immaculate and the bed very comfortable - well needed after a long day in London. Very easy to walk to from Liverpool Street station - nothing is to much trouble for the staff and they are all really friendly - it starts from the moment the doorman opens the door for you to welcome you in. No qualms will definitely be staying again 10 out of 10 Montcalm. Tina and Andy Cottrell,5,2014,05,03
128,Great !! Super hotel!!,"English :
Location is close to Barbican center since we came for a concert there
Hotel is very complex structure but they put indications everywhere!
Staff is very nice and professional and the room is fully and well equipped
Wifi is working very very well (up to 10 mbits)
We did not found how to switch off for the night all the lights in the room since they are plenty of lights but the place is very quiet and the breakfast inthe LOUNGE was a peaceful moment we appreciated so much.
If you have planned any event in this london district this Hotel is THE choice .
Francais:
Venu pour un concert au Barbican center cet hotel est extremement bien placé à 150 metres près!
Ancienne brasserie plus que renovée .les couloirs et escaliers sont nombreux mais tout est bien panneauté
Belle chambre club tres bien equipée avec un wifi du tonnerre et un petit dejeuner au Lounge ( belle piece tres british) ...un moment de paix que nous avons adoré
Le personnel est aux petits soins avec nous ce qui rend le sejour très agreable
En conclusion si vous avez a faire dans le quartier Barbican cet hotel est LE choix",5,2014,05,01
128,Fantastic hotel. I highly recommend for a business stay,"A great hotel with impeccable service. Great service, brilliant food and good sized room for London at a great price. I stayed at other Montcalm's and the difference was notable. This one was great value and a rare gem for London at the price I paid.",4,2014,04,30
128,very pleasant stay,"historical setting, high quality interior, extremely friendly and helpful staff. Spent only one night but felt almost at home. Very nice surprise: a good bottle of Cote du Rhone as a birthday present. Will come again! :)",5,2014,04,30
128,A great place to stay!,"I stay here on a very regular basis and this review is long overdue. Although my trips are business related it is a great place to come back to at the end of a long day. It is a luxurious looking hotel with an incredibly friendly, helpful and professional team.  Even if and when I've had the odd problem or special request (as you would expect having spent a few months there over the past two years) the response is always swift and as accommodating and  helpful as it can possibly be. I can single out several of the friendly folks that work here but this would just not be fair as the whole team, is such a pleasure to be around.

My favourite part of the hotel is the cosy Club Lounge, a great place to meet and greet clients and business partners or to meet friends. You always feel welcome!

All the rumours about getting lost in the hotel; you will get lost in the maze trying to find your room at some point, don't panic, enjoy it, it is part of the experience and fun of visiting the ""Montcalm at the Brewery"".

I can be harsh in my view on hotels as I often live in them and are probably not very easily pleased but the ""Montcalm at the Brewery"" is my favourite hotel and it is a great place to come back to! 

An excellent location, great hotel and a wonderful team.",5,2014,04,29
128,RELAXED AMBIENCE,I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights.  All hotel staff from arrival were very attentive and helpful. Beautifully decorated rooms and the most comfortable of beds and pillows.  The Hermes products in the bathroom were a treat - and the rainfall shower was amazing.  Perfect location for Barbican Centre and overall a very good price for central London.  Just a short walk from tube stations Barbican and Moorgate and the area itself has lots to offer,5,2014,04,29
128,Perfect Night Out in the City,"The Montcalm hotel website does not do this hotel justice! On arrival it was such a surprise to find a hotel that was not overselling itself, by a long shot. Everything was fantastic and the price was exceptional for such a great location. On check in we was asked if this was for a special occasion, which it was and within 15 minutes of being in the room a birthday cake & card arrived at our door from the hotel and receptionist. 
This is a gem of a hotel, the staff and facilities are 1st rate. Don't miss out!",5,2014,04,28
128,The best hotel in London,"I stay at the Montcalm every time I am in London. I have a very good relationship with them and everything is always dealt with in a very personal manner. From the very moment you enter the doors you are greeted with a gentlemen in top hat and tails who takes care of everything.

Due to the personal nature of the hotel I decided to put my Mother there for her birthday while I was in LA. I made one phone call to the hotel and the manager did everything else. To say I was impressed is an understatement. My parents were given the best two story suite in the hotel and she even had a birthday cake delivered! None of this was arranged by myself, the wonderful staff at the Montcalm took it upon themselves to make my Mother's birthday one to remember. 

As a result I am extremely grateful for everything they have done and I will continue to stay there every time I am in London.",5,2014,04,28
128,Excellent Hotel well placed for the city,"We stayed here for 2 nights whilst attending a wedding nearby.  The hotel's location was perfect for us but being in the city most things nearby are shut on Sundays. It is located in the old Whitbread Brewery which has been sympathetically converted into a beautiful characterful hotel.  The rooms were very comfortable.  It did not seem like some of the rather faceless modern purpose built boxes that you tend to find.  It has its own restaurant and separate pub, the Jugged Hare which have access straight from Chiswell Street.  Both have a nice atmosphere again not too stuffy although the Hare was extremely busy on the Friday night and service consequently very poor.  We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant both of which were very good.  Easy walk to Barbican or Moorgate tube stations.  Any criticisms?  The windows in our bedroom had been sealed so we could not open them.  This was probably because of potential noise problems from aircon units but we do like to have our windows open at night.  Also the view was a blank wall but we were not really there for the view. To be fair there was air conditioning in the room which once we got used to it meant we could control the temperature properly.  The pillows were also a bit hard.  We should have asked for a change but did not do so.  Also found the bath/shower controls very difficult (despite instructions) resulting in me spraying my clothes with water!  Would certainly stay there again if we needed a spot in the city.",4,2014,04,28
128,Great Stay!!!,"My stay was truly memorable.  The hotel has a great location and the price was very reasonable considering the fantastic quality of the hotel.  The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  The room was lovely and well equipped.  I would definitely recommend this hotel, as I know I will be returning very soon.",5,2014,04,28
128,Great hotel and location,"Great hotel and location with friendly staff. Surprised my girlfriend for her birthday with a free cake and bottle of wine.

The location of the hotel is also perfect for sightseeing and nightlife. Some great bars, restaurants and nigh clubs all within walking distance.",5,2014,04,28
128,Just great!,"Had an excellent business trip at the Montcalm. Everything from the door man to the breakfast was just great. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was a highlight with ""window wall"" between the bath- and bedroom.",5,2014,04,28
128,return visit - you just wont beat it!!,"Our second visit to The Montcalm and just as good as the first. The staff can not be beaten from first impressions of the doorman to receptionists, waitresses and cleaners - all 5*

The location is great and a 2 minute covered walk to the tube.

We have recommended this hotel to family members (always a nervy thing to do) but I have with confidence and haven't been let down.

The pub The Jugged Hare attached to the hotel is fab and staff in here again are excellent.

In short we are very jealous of the people we have told to stay here as they get to go before us ! We will be back again for sure and after previously always searching for ages on various websites for best rates and hotels etc, I don't anymore - we go to The Montcalm - no question !

Megha and your co-workers - keep doing what you are doing - its the best !!!",5,2014,04,27
128,excellent hotel,"recently visited london last week and stayed in the montcalm. it is a beautiful hotel, the staff couldn't be nicer and any more helpful. room was lovely, shower was amazing. can't comment on the food as we never ate there but they do have a pub across the road which was nice to have a drink before/after going out. it is only a 5-10min walk from the barbican underground so no need to get taxis everywhere. can't fault the hotel at all. highly recommended would def stay here again ",5,2014,04,26
128,Excellent stay on a business trip,"The hotel is very good, and the location ideal for this particular trip, at the edge of the City. It is well connected, 5 min away from the Barbican tube station and the Barbican centre and estate are probably as good as Brutalism gets.
Hotel furnishings and staff are excellent, and breakfast at the corner (hotel) pub a nice way to start your day - although crossing the road to get there may be challenging for people used to right-hand traffic.
Value for money was very good at the rates I found, especially considering the impossibly expensive London scene.",5,2014,04,26
128,Montcalm in the city,"Montcalm - good hotel, excellent location and the weekend room rate was very palatable but the best thing was the staff who were super helpful. 

I can highly recommend this hotel. 

We arrived from Liverpool St station and it was only a short walk to the hotel so  even with suitcases it was no bother. We also walked to the city, Tate modern, south bank, London eye Spittlefields and Shorditch. we therefore saved a lot of money on taxis and tube fares 

brian",5,2014,04,25
128,My second home,"I stay here on a regular basis and not once have I had a bad experience. This time round I took my children and parents with me. Both Manik & Mandeep in the reservations team are helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to choosing a room to suit. The rooms are always clean, the staff go out of their way to help and I really don't think they could do anymore. The club lounge is a great added bonus and Mega the manager is so friendly and always appreciative. The breakfast is amazing (better than the Mayfair hotel) and I really could not shout about this hotel enough. It deserves the five stars it has, as do the rooms & staff x",5,2014,04,24
128,Simply wonderful,"The Montcalm is a spendid hotel. My wife and I stayed for one night and we really enjoyed it. From the moment we stepped through the doors we were made to feel very welcome by the staff. In particular Monia on reception and Adrian the concierge were excellent.
After receiving a free upgrade the room itself was perfect, tastefully decorated, well furnished, with an extremely comfortable bed. The en suite was also first class, with a good shower, luxury toiletries, and a non mist make up/shaving mirror and likewise large mirror, which I always really like. Although we couldn't make the aroma box function and no-one mentioned it, so perhaps it didn't.
The pub on the corner of Chiswell St, the Jugged Hare, is part of the hotel and where the dining area is, also. Breakfast was delicious, with a self service option or an ordered one, so you could please yourself how much you ate. I wasn 't too keen on the stuffed animals/birds behind the bar or hanging in the window next to our breakfast table, but I'm splitting hairs really, or should that be hares ?
What made the Montcalm stand out, I think, was their attention to detail and willingness to go the extra mile, or two, for their guests.
Overall an extremely impressive hotel who's staff put the guests first with their politeness and respect, creating a warm relaxing atmosphere. We will return, I hope.",5,2014,04,22
128,Comfort and excellence,"The building itself is wonderful - it's refurbished and modern yet it retains a strong sense of history. Everything was of the finest quality. The room was very clean and comfortable and I slept soundly every night I was there. 
The service was first class through and through - for instance, I told the staff that I needed an adapter for my laptop, then I left for a bit, and when I returned, there was an adapter, as well as a complimentary bottle of wine. 
The location is also key - you're in the centre of things. I'd love to stay there again.",5,2014,04,22
128,London mini break,"Booked wine tasting at Vinopolis, Borough Market, so we wanted to stay more towards city, tends to be quieter at weekends. The Montcalm is about a 5-7 minute walk from Moorgate Tube station. Ideally located for the Barbican.
Welcoming reception & doorman. There are many rooms and as it's in a former brewery, the building is different, so you may get lost getting back to your room. Good job reception give you a map.
We stayed in a Deluxe double room. It was great, modern, clean. The bed was lovely. Slept really well.
Bathrooms are small but only to be expected in London, all Elemis products....fab and a nice touch of Elemis pillow spray.
Didn't eat in hotel but had nightcap drinks in the Jugged Hare pub...which was surprisingly busy for an area that is quiet on weekends.
Only gripe we had was we ordered a Sunday newspaper to be delivered to room. It never arrived before we checked out at 11:45am.",4,2014,04,22
128,Nice 5 star hotel near the Barbican in London,"I stayed at this hotel for one night just before flying home after a 10 day trip to the UK. It's a little out of the way, which makes it quiet, which I appreciated. The service is excellent and the staff very helpful and professional.  The breakfast in the restaurant was a little disappointing:  very good quality but not a huge selection and much of it was cold.  That said, the chef made me an excellent omelette, whcih was piping hot.",4,2014,04,22
128,"Excellent staff, great rooms and service","Spent one night at The Montcalm and it was an all round great experience. Booked into one of the Montcalm Club Rooms on a great last minute rate through their website. The rooms are tastefully furnished and the bed one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The Hermes toiletries and room atomiser were nice treats and the bathroom was very stylish, with a great rain shower, though this was angled incorrectly and sprayed water outside the bath, but housekeeping promised to fix it. The room service menu was good, with food of a high standard and delivered promptly by friendly staff. I also had a couple of requests from housekeeping and again, these were dealt with efficiently. The Club lounge breakfast was lovely, with a decent spread of meats, cheese, fruits and pastries and a great selection of nespresso coffee. The location is great for the Barbican and close to numerous tube stations, and with a few supermarkets and shops on the doorstep. The Reception and Concierge staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Montcalm again - thanks for a great experience.",5,2014,04,21
128,Perfect London break,"Stayed in a Montcalm club room which included access to their club lounge and complimentory drinks and continental breakfast.

Service was first class and the staff couldn't do enough during our stay. The room was furnished beautifully and has a glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom with an automatic screen for privacy allowing for TV to be watched from the bath/shower should you so desire.

We loved the fact the hotel that although being thoroughly modern inside was in a grade II listed building of an old Brewery and has plenty of charm and character.

Hotel is 3-5 minutes walk from the Barbican tube station although a cab ride from Covent Garden was only £10.",5,2014,04,21
128,Family break to see the sites.,"Stayed 3 nights over easter and would reccomend this hotel to all. Staff were polite and helpful, Service was excellant, rooms well presented and tidy , nothing appeared too much. 
For value for money compared to many other places to stay this must take some beating. 
A short walk to two underground stations means all locations are within easy access.",5,2014,04,21
128,Best in london,"Fantastic staff, excellent attention to detail and great service has made this my favourite hotel in London by far.  I travel to London a lot and this is certainly the best hotel I've stayed in.  It surpasses all the other 4 and 5 star hotels I've been in but without being pretentious. I will certainly return 
",5,2014,04,21
128,An amazing experience,"Weekend away turned into a dream. One of the best hotels I have ever experienced. The room was gorgeous and very clean. Packed full of useful things, all complimentary. It really had that wow factor. The staff truly understand service and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,04,20
128,"Very nice hotel, good service, location is a little out the way of main attraction areas.","The hotel is very nice, the room was very clean and well equipped. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities so couldn't comment on them, neither did we eat the food, only because London has some fantastic restaurants. The location is a bit out the way but a 20 minutes train or bus ride got you to the city centre. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,04,20
128,A complete experience,"Stayed over Easter family with two kids. Staff friendly and we were well taken care of. Rooms are decorated very nicely and the bathrooms are exceptionally nice and clean. Only issue we had since being on the road with children would be, at double comforters never really work.",5,2014,04,20
128,Cool clean and enjoyable,"The staff are first rate ,  very helpful and polite , didn't require much attention from the staff as was out from the hotel for most of the stay but when I did require something like an iron and ironing board they brought it to my room immediately , and there were plenty of nice subtle touches like fresh fruit in the room on the mornings and on evenings a good night note with an elemis pillow spray and a tin of mints on the bed ,  didn't eat at the hotel as had other arrangements but the hotel restaurant looked very good and would of eaten there if other arrangements hadn't been made. Hotel is an excellent place to stay and I would definitely return on my next visit to London, only thing worth mentioning is that it is a little further out of the city centre than where we would normally stay but with the barbican tube station just a few hundreds yards down a straight road getting about wasn't an issue ,  and needed the exercise anyway after an indulgent weekend ",5,2014,04,20
128,Very nice hotel,"The rooms were impeccable and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were always friendly and helpful. It is a bit of a walk within the hotel itself depending on where your room is, but that is probably the only bad thing (if it is one) that I can think of.

I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2014,04,19
128,Very good!! ,"Went for my girlfriends birthday, we were very well looked after and the even have us an upgrade and a bottle of wine and a cake as a present :) 
Girlfriend loved the small touches like the heated floors and free fruit in the rooms!! We would go again ",4,2014,04,19
128,Delightful Stay!,"I had my honeymoon trip Between March2014-April2014. Had 3 nights in london so i did some research on trip advisor for good reviews, and decided to go with Hotel Montclam. Thankfully,i made the right decision. Me and my wife have no complaints about the hotel. 
The staff there were always helpful and cheerful. Location was nearby 2 station barbican and moorgate. Cinema, Tesco Express, Marks&Spencer are all 5mins or less walk. There is also a cosy pub resturants nearby.
Room and bathroom are both kept in top condition, presentable, neat and clean. Bed is also comfortable, able to get good rest after long day.
If ever im back to london, will difinetly stay there again! ",5,2014,04,18
128,A good 3-star,"When a hotel bills itself as 5-star, I hold certain expectations. The Montcalm at the Brewery is in the heart of what Londoners call the City, and although the staff are courteous, friendly, and remember your name, location and attentive staff should not be the only characteristics that make a hotel 5-star.

The minibar held a most paltry selection of candy and beverage items, including one bottle of Coke and one bottle of Diet Coke, one sparkling water and one still, and the usual mini-bottles of spirits and mixers. Do I expect a whole lot more just because I am an American? Fresh fruit was provided at check-in, and there was the usual British teapot in the room and a decent selection of teas, but coffee was instant and tasted that way. Room service was prompt but not generous; my first order for breakfast coffee rendered only a scant two-cup carafe. Language can present unforeseen complexities at the Montcalm; when I asked the next morning for four cups of coffee, I received a larger carafe and four tea cups. This was the same morning that I ordered from the room service menu a stack of blueberry pancakes and maple syrup. What arrived were two johnny cakes sans blueberries and a pot of honey.

The bathroom suffered from too many accoutrements and too little space, starting with the sink, which was huge, tall, and left little counter room for cosmetics and other necessary travel items. The provided soap was Hermès, but it and the rest of the Hermès toiletries were heavily perfumed and therefore without use for someone with an acutely sensitive nose like mine. The Montcalm advertises “aromatic rooms” of different scents, but I had to ask housekeeping not to scent the room. Thank goodness the room’s one narrow window opened so that I could reduce the car-freshener-like smell to a level tolerable for sleep. Of course, as others have noted here, an open window invites the street sounds of late-night drunken revelry into an otherwise quiet room. I know exactly how many times the Jugged Hare dumps glass beer bottles into trash containers nearby. But city sounds only add to my travel experience.

The shower fixtures looked new and came with an instruction card. Even so, it took me several times to figure out how to avoid turning on the overhead rain shower, although my bathrobe dried after a night on the heated towel rack. I could not discover how to turn on only the hand-held shower fixture or only the bathtub water, so both ran all the time, resulting in such low water pressure that showering became a long-term endeavor. The bathtub drain did not open or close easily, but luckily it was removable so the bathtub didn’t fill with water when showering. Towels were not extraordinary and, like many other hotels in the UK, there was not room enough on the towel rack to hang more than two. What to do with the rest?

Several travelers have complemented the Montcalm on the bed and the linens. While the bed was comfortable, the pillows were unforgiving foam rubber, and the sheeted duvet was so plush and heavy that the only relief from overheating came from throwing it off throughout the night. The room’s furnishings and wardrobe were standard but too crammed with incidentals—shoe horns, laundry bags, umbrella, bathrobes, shopping bags, slippers, hair dryer—to be useful. There was no dresser, and the nightstand drawers were too small to hold clothes. I hung shirts and slacks, but a week’s worth would not fit. The rest stayed in my suitcase.

What, you might ask, was right about the Montcalm? First, six mirrors: one on each side of the bed, one over the desk, one over the minibar, one on the inside of the closet door, one in the bathroom. Two: a fabulous hair dryer. The best I have seen in any hotel. Three: an extremely efficient heating and cooling system. Four: the onsite staff. To the person, they were pleasant, accommodating, and responsive. They tried very hard to compensate for deficiencies elsewhere, but it was obvious that they did not have the authority to correct them. When I finished my London business two days earlier than I expected, the General Manager who was called refused a refund for the two prepaid nights that I no longer needed. This review therefore comes with a warning: Do not book online and prepay as they suggest unless you like being held captive. I must assume the GM is bonused on revenue, as there is no other reason to be so unnecessarily inflexible.

I noted that many Trip Advisor reviewers faulted the hotel’s rabbit-warren layout, but I took this as a consequence of renovating a 250-year-old brewery into a hotel, and it charmed me. Even the neglected houseplant on the desk in my room had a certain charm, as though someone tried, really tried, to class up the place. Alas, architectural charm and friendly personnel are not enough reasons to pay this much for this little. Let’s give it 3 stars and be done. I know I am.",3,2014,04,17
128,"The best location and service, very close to 2 subway stations (Barbican is closer)","But the room we stayed in was too small for the price we paid. But manager agreed with me and I have got 20% back even I did not ask for it (just to make me happy as a customer...and It did make me happy:)..). Though, we checked in around 11am (taxi from Kings Cross was 10 pounds and it is only 3 underground stations away) . That really made us happy since we came early just to drop our luggage. Checking out could be extended to 2pm. So convenient!
Rooms are different shape since it is an older building (former brewery- very interesting), so you'd better check first if you like the room Our friends from States were staying on first floor and the ceiling was really high and bathroom was a size of the whole room! .
You cam make your own tea and will have 1 complimentary bottle of water,also  cookies, apples, bananas complimentary every morning. The hotel has tho dining places on each side, but both were having private parties on that Friday and we did not know about it and had to go to Cote (not sure of spelling) just across the street and the place is not overpriced and dinner was ok (especially at 10 pm). St Paul cathedral is 15 min walking distance, but we already visited it before. So, we decided just look around...and found MUSEUM OF LONDON! That was our luck that we stopped by! Do not miss it! The museum is incredible and we spent there 4 hours! Do not miss it!
Doorman was very helpful and information desk guys were very knowledgeable. There is a mall close to St Paul, go to the sixth floor and you can see London from public terrace (we have been told but never made it!). Although, we looked at London from Shard's 72nd floor and it was spectacular. We waited for sunset but unfortunately clouds covered the sunset .
You can go to restaurant's entrance and see London from 32nd or 33rd floor, but if you want not only drink but eat , you have to make reservation in 2 months if you will be lucky! And we did not think of asking hotel to do it for us:)...
There was not one person on Ground floor who would not say Hello using your own name! That was very unusual because I never can remember people's names:). Personnel is trained very well!
Next day, I had to come back to pick up my friend's left item, and they still remembered my name. So, if you will leave something behind, your item could be shipped to you up to 5 pounds cost for shipping (calculate ahead:).
I really wanted to say that I was impressed by service!",4,2014,04,17
128,Best hotel we have stayed in!,"Have reviews this hotel before and had to share my love for it on this site. Amazing rooms with lovely attentive staff! our room was upgraded and was beautiful! Staff were so friendly and it really is a magical hotel, will be going back ASAP.",5,2014,04,17
128,A Perfect Working Weekend,"We had to be in London for a working weekend, and working weekends can, on occasions, add a little stress to one's life. We chose the Montcalm as it was very close to the Barbican, where we needed to be on Saturday, and no more than a 25-minute walk to the Tate Modern, where we needed to be on Sunday morning. We couldn't have chosen more wisely: from the moment we walked into the reception, we were overwhelmed with attentiveness. The room was a delight, the bed as comfy as you could wish for, and the cost well within our compass. It took the stress out of the weekend immediately. Not only will we come back, we are looking for excuses for our next working weekend.",5,2014,04,17
128,Excellence at the Montcalm London City,"Stayed at the Montcalm London City at The Brewery last weekend with friends.

Quiet location, as the City of London is quiet at the weekends.

Food, rooms and facilities were excellent.

But the main praise must go to the staff - they were terrific - nothing was too much trouble.

In particular, the Duty Manager, Prashant  Marne was excellent and went out of his way to ensure our stay was pleasurable and memorable.",5,2014,04,17
128,Great Service.,"Recently stayed for a weekend. The staff were excellent. Ruben checked us in and was very attentive. We arrived early and left our bags. When we returned Ruben remembered our name and even though we were still early for the normal check in, he gave us tea and coffee until our room was ready. Ten minutes later he took us to the room in person. 

The room was lovely and had some nice extra touches, fruit etc. A nice turndown service. The room was large and have a nice bathroom with nice amenities.

The hotel is a listed building, so theres lots of ups and downs of stairs. It takes a bit of getting used to. The staff are always offering help with luggage and help to find your way.

A nice stay and somewhere i would love to come back to.",5,2014,04,15
128,Luxurious with friendly staff,"The reception area is very opulent, this is probably the snazziest hotel I have stayed in.  The staff were all very attentive and polite, the room was lovely with a massive bed, actually it was 2 singles together and I did keep rolling in the dip in the middle!!  The bathroom was large with a lovely rainfall shower and bathrobes and slippers.  We didn’t eat in the hotel so can’t comment on food.

The only negative was that the room had a connecting door to another room and when the cleaners were in there the next morning they woke me up while hoovering, talking, opening and shutting doors etc. They are only doing their job, but I think if there wasn’t the door, just a solid wall I wouldn’t have heard it. So if you need a lie in ask for a room without a connecting door. 

All in all we enjoyed it and would recommend the hotel.",4,2014,04,15
128,Birthday treat,"The entrance and lobby is stunning. A beautiful hotel, with a welcoming atmosphere.  All staff where very courteous and friendly. Our room was spacious, with a huge comfortable bed. We had use of the Club Lounge offering tea/coffee/snacks etc during the day- a nice additional touch for Club room residents. This is also where we enjoyed a great continental breakfast. Unfortunately, we could only spend one night, and had so much to do in London that we did not have time to eat in either the Jugged Hare (the very stylish pub) or Chiswell St dining rooms (their modern/sophisticated Restaurant). We were told to book in advance for either and I can understand why, when we returned to the hotel late evening both were 'buzzing'! 
We wouldn't hesitate in returning to this wonderful hotel. A memorable treat for my husbands birthday!",5,2014,04,15
128,"Perfectly situated, great customer service","I was here on business and pleased to say that the staff were excellent from start to finish.  Apart from getting lost a few times, I managed to navigate successfully to reception and club lounge.  Whatever part of the hotel I was in, all the staff did their utmost to ensure that I was taken care of.",5,2014,04,14
128,Great customer service,"Very sympathetically restored old brewery with lots of character. All the staff were really friendly and helpful and both the room & public spaces were immaculate. The only reason it gets a 4 star rather than a 5 star is that our room was quite dark and there was insufficient lighting. I can't fault the decor and the lovely bathroom however and would certainly recommend the hotel. The pub/restaurant ""The Jugged Hare"" which is attached to the hotel has a nice atmosphere and is worth visiting.",4,2014,04,13
128,Would definitely recommend this wondeful hotel,"This hotel apart from being very pretty sets itselfs above by being extremely helpful and gracious. They pay attention to detail and seem to take pride in their hotel. We were two couples, one with a 18 month old, and we had a comfortable, fun,  wonderful stay. :-)",5,2014,04,13
128,So helpful,"I found The Montcalm on late rooms.com. Having never used this service I was quite concerned that when we got to the hotel we wouldn't be booked in so I went direct though the hotel and I am glad I did. Nearly £50 cheaper than late rooms. The room was beyond my partners and I's expectations. The room was clean, tidy the fruit was a wonderful little extra. The screen between the bathroom and the bedroom was a source of for eat amusement for both my partner and I. We are big kids at heart.

When it came to check out in the morning my partner fell ill overnight and was extremely unwell on the way back from the breakfast room. This is where I feel The Montcalm's service went above and beyond. As we were on the floor below our room they moved us from the hallway into the nearest room as quickly as they could, not once did they say we need you out of your room by check in. They actually told me that we had been provided with an extended check out till 6pm. They called a paramedic for my partner and they even went out to the nearest chemist to pick up the medication we were recommended so I could stay with my partner.

Durning this time I was supplied with further complimentary fruit and water as it was getting close to lunchtime. We were not pestered in anyway and we're never Mae to feel like we were causing the hotel a problem occupying 2 rooms effectively for that morning.

Both my partner and I have said that we will return to The Montcalm and we have recommended the hotel to members of both our families simply due to the outstanding service we received.",5,2014,04,12
128,Relaxing Stay,"First time at the Montcalm The Brewery.  Agent had confirmed a king size bed - it wasn't.  Needed this following major operation.  Although the Hotel was very busy, the Reception Team produced an upgrade to a Club Room.

All the staff most courteous, friendly and helpful.  After checkout we had time to kill before our onward journey: we were brought complimentary coffee in the lounge, which was a very nice touch to round off a good experience.",4,2014,04,12
128,Very enjoyable luxury stay,"We recently stayed at the Montcalm London City for 3 nights. I had a few teething problems during my stay in the Autumn of 2013 but this time I have to admit that I was very impressed. 

The hotel kindly provided an upgrade as my wife and son were accompanying me and from the start to finish, everything was first class. The staff are very helpful and attentive and nice touches such as a bottle of Champagne on arrival and being able to use the Club Room. 

The highlight for my young son was finding a Montcalm teddy bear waiting on his sofa bed after a trip into London sightseeing but he also loved having his own TV to watch! 

The hotel is full of character and is very close to either Moorgate or the Barbican tube stations. It certainly deserves the ratings on trip adviser and the breakfast in the Jugged Hare was excellent with smoked salmon and items cooked to order as well as a really good hot and cold choice. 

The final nice touch was prior to leaving for a trip back to the north east where the hotel kindly provided a welcome pot of tea without charge - I would recommend using the hotel for both business and leisure and the club room, upgrade is worth considering. 

Thanks again to the staff and looking forward to coming back.",5,2014,04,10
128,"The Montcalm Hotel, Chiswell Street",Stayed at the 'Montcalm Hotel' for one night recently so we could see a show at Saddlers Wells. The accommodation and staff were terrific and very helpful. Will most certainly go again as soon as we can arrange for the grandparents to look after the children ;-),5,2014,04,09
128,Some of the Staff let the rest Down,"Good Location Rooms are Great but some of the team on the Front desk let down the Quality of Service. Its all about the Front Staff and if they Listen to your Instructions.
On Arrival when you are wanting to get to your room and have a few Questions that you want Answered... If your requests Fail it tants the whole Thing and can spoil the whole Night when you are just there for a few Hours that Matters.",4,2014,04,08
128,Very enjoyable stay,"We were very well looked after from the start of our long weekend to the hotel desk arranging our taxi back to the train station. The rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms very clean. I will be going back when I am next in London.",5,2014,04,08
128,Every last detail thought out. Excellence.,"Another stay here. Exceptional staff hotel clean every last detail seems to have been thought through. The little personal touches made the stay: chocolates mints and night spray put into the room upon our return that evening accompanied by a goodnight card. Highly recommend, in a club room.",5,2014,04,07
128,Amazing hotel experience,"We usually always stay at a Crowne Plaza or Hotel Indigo in London, but when our usual hotels were all fully booked we came across The Montcalm, how lucky were we?!
On our arrival there was a very polite doorman who kindly took our luggage from us, check in was quick and easy and we were also given warm towels which was a nice touch. 
We were escorted to our room (152) by the concierge and were given a lovely talk of the history of the hotel on our way! 
The room was lovely and clean, well stocked mini bar, tea,coffee and biscuits, matching robes with slippers, a plate of fruit and bottles of water which were complementary. 
The service we received from the staff all through our stay was second to none, when we returned in the evening from our night in central London there was a breakfast room service menu with a tray , our bed was made and there was  a towel on either side of the bed on the floor with slippers waiting for us! 
We will definitely be back!!",5,2014,04,07
128,Exceeds expectations,"We had a memorable stay which -to say the least- exceeded our expectations. This hotel goes a long way to make a difference, even compared to much pricier 5-star venues. Our favourite highlights included the complimentary fruit, water & beverages, luxurius bathware and towels, classy decoration which mixes classic and modern, innovative room lighting, good soundproofing and excellent service. We'd have a hard time finding saying anything negative, and we're definitely coming back.",5,2014,04,07
128,Excellent Hotel in an amazing location for a very good price.,"From the minute you walk under the arch into the door way of the hotel you know you have found something special.  I can not fault a single detail of this hotel, the staff are amazing and aim to please with your every need.  From the reception to the lifts they have fresh flowers and wow they smell amazing and the design of the hotel is stunning.  When you get out of the lifts and walk round the hallways it's unlike any other hotel I have stayed in.  Instead of just cream walls and boring carpets they have designed the space so you enjoy walking to your room no matter how far the walk is.  We stayed in a club room and I would say it's smaller then most hotels I have stayed in but still what it lacked in space it made up for in nice designs.  The glass window to the bathroom was a bit different but I guess if you like to watch ( the television ) while in the shower / bath then this is a real treat ( city meets soho )  There wasn't anything I could fault about the room but if you are having dinner in the room or breakfast in bed I would prefer a table and chair tucked in the corner.  I would stay here again without doubt and it's in an excellent location for the Barbican, Shoreditch and Spitalfield are all a short walk.",5,2014,04,07
128,Excellent Customer Service,"My Girlfriend and I stayed at Montcalm Hotel for a Birthday Weekend.

I have stayed in lots of Hotels and was delighted to find out how accommodating this one was with regards to a special occasion. I emailed the Hotel directly to confirm my booking and mentioned it was my Girlfriends birthday. I had a very prompt response confirming that they would do whatever was possible to make the weekend special. This included complimentary upgrade, birthday cake and a bottle of wine. Small touches like this can make all the difference and enhance value. When we arrived the staff were all very receptive to the occasion and courteous. Room was spacious, clean with modern fixtures and fittings. Club lounge recommended for a couple of complimentary beers in the evening!

Thanks for our stay. 

Sam & Karen",5,2014,04,07
128,Amazing hotel,"Great hotel, only stayed for one night as a last minute break, but everything from the professionalism and friendliness of the staff to the room itself was spot on. Highly recommend and will definatly be back! ",5,2014,04,06
128,Unparalleled Customer Service - Wonderful,"I am fortunate enough to have a job where I regularly stay in very good hotels all over the world. This weekend I was visiting London with my wife and so ""spending my own money"" meant it was even more important we had good time. We were not disappointed. I've ever had such fantastic customer service as our stay here this weekend. 

The hotel is in a great location in the heart of the city and the rooms are beautiful, functional and very comfortable. We didn't eat in the restaurant (closed for refurbishment at the time)!or the Jugged Hare - their ""gastropub"" nearby, but there is a huge variety of restaurants in nearby Spitalfields, Shoreditch or the delights of Brick Lane! 

However, it's the politeness and attentiveness of the staff - from Chambermaids to Duty Managers - that makes this hotel stand out. Everyone is ""on-duty"" the whole time. On the way from check-in to our room, absolutely everyone we passed welcomed us and wished us a pleasant stay. Without exception, everyone was genuinely super-polite, without becoming cheesy or ""gushing"". Just perfect. A smile costs nothing, yet makes a huge difference. All the staff here have it spot-on. 

I will absolutely stay here again at the next opportunity and I recommend it to anyone. Many,
many thanks. ",5,2014,04,06
128,The staff were superb and The Wow Room was aptly named.,If you are looking to stay where the staff and standards are excellent then look no further. The room was lovely. Every member of staff was attentive and genuinely cared. Next time we visit London we will look no further than the Montcalm.,5,2014,04,06
128,Great hotel central location and near to tube,"Hotel short walk from barbican tube station. Excellent welcome and friendly staff. Room was a reasonable size for London with all the services and cleanliness you would expect for a hotel with this star rating. Yes the hotel is a bit of a maze but it adds to the character and helps with the boutique feel of the place, didn't cause us any problems at all, even after a few beers on the town :-) fruit and pillow spray etc nice little touches, I would definitely use this hotel again. Offered breakfast at a bit of a discount when we arrived, breakfast was very good, served in adjoining gastro pub. I Recommend breakfast, I'm a Yorkshireman and even I felt like I got value for money!",5,2014,04,06
128,nice stay - great spot to sample east london,"Very welcoming hotel and nice stay on what was an off peak day in a London city hotel. The square mile is very quiet on a Saturday and Sunday and we took advantage of the good rates on offer for a what is a good quality hotel although not a five star on the london scale. Greeted well, and also provided with a cake in the room for my wife's birthday - nice touch which leaves a lasting impression, other hotels take note! We wanted to sample the many restaurants and bars of shoreditch and east london and this is an excellent spot from which to do so - 5 mins by cab. All in all, nice staff, boutique (so don't expect big rooms),but  good experience. 4.5 stars",4,2014,04,06
128,"Exemplary hotel, faultless!","
We have stayed in various '5 Star' Hotels in London and always been disappointed, there seems to be a certain arrogance and snobbery which takes away from the experience. 
The Montcalm was the complete opposite and absolutely blew us away from the first phone call to the last suitcase being carried out of the hotel. 
The staff were all charming and bent over backwards to help us at any time of day or night. We were staying for a special occasion so had booked a club room but on arrival were told we had been upgraded to the duplex suite, the staff seemed genuinely happy and excited to see my reaction it was lovely. A very polite chatty man showed me to the room and on arrival there was a bottle of champagne on ice and a fruit plate waiting for us! The suite was wonderful, well appointed and everything had been thought of from fresh flowers, international plug sockets and iPhone docking station to a Nespresso coffee machine. Downstairs was a comfy lounge area and a luxurious bathroom (where you could watch telly from the bath) then there was a mezzanine level with a very comfy bed and another bathroom with plenty of fluffy towels, dressing gowns and Hermes toiletries.

We went to the club lounge at about 6.30 and had some canapés and finger sandwiches with gin and tonics, and again the staff were helpful and made us feel so at home!

We had a knock on our door for turn down service and a friendly lady gave us some mints, a lovely Elemis pillow spray and the weather for the next day. It's the many little touches like this that really make this a true 5* hotel. There were also beautiful orchids in our room and throughout the hotel, from experience I know this takes a lot of care!

We returned to the club lounge later that evening for a glass of wine and the next morning for a great continental breakfast and were once again impressed by what a lovely retreat it is, extremely civilised and relaxed and a bonus not to have to think of the bill at the end of it!

When we checked out (they had kindly arranged a late check out for us) the Front Office Manager Megha Singh was there and beamed when she realised that we were the people she had helped out with our email requests before, saying she was glad to have met us as she wasn't there when we checked in. It's such a joy to stay in a hotel where the staff take such pride in making people happy and looking after their hotel. We could not fault a single moment of our stay and will return without a doubt.

We went for Sunday lunch in the Jugged Hare, this was delicious and finished our stay off nicely.

Thank you so much for your wonderful warm hospitality and changing our opinion of London Hotels, others could and really should take a leaf out of your book!
",5,2014,04,06
128,Luxury,Everything was amazing about the hotel and staff - the only small downside is that this hotel and location would suit business travellers rather than leisure - the main restaurant is only open Monday to Friday and there is very little around the vicinity of the hotel. That said it is only a 5 minute walk to Barbican Tube station. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel is spotless ,5,2014,04,06
128,Excellent service.,"The staff were very courteous and very helpful. The room was clean and well maintained with plenty of facilities. The hotel in general was clean and well presented. The bed was very comfortable. The food was good and we had plenty of choice at breakfast. 
The only down side was that it was a bit like a maze inside the hotel were you had to take the lift to the first floor and then walk down two corridors to get the lift to the fourth floor, but this is because it is located inside an old brewery.Would still recommend.",5,2014,04,04
128,FANTASTIC hotel in the heart of London city,"We had the loveliest stay at the Montcalm. The service was faultless and our room was extremely spacious and very tastefully decorated. The bathroom was similarly was enormous, very very clean and with lovely little extras like Hermes body lotion! 

We were only there for one night but it was very relaxing and perfectly located for us in the city and right around the corner from work. The continental breakfast in the Club Lounge was a great start to the day and I was very happy to see porridge was available! We also enjoyed the afternoon snacks in the Club Lounge!

We didn't get the chance to eat at either of the restaurants but they both looked excellent. 
Although the Montcalm seems to be able to accommodate quite a few guests it has a very boutique hotel feel and all the staff were very warm and welcoming. It was especially nice to be offered things like ironing boards and fruit etc. 

Don't have anything negative to say about the hotel except maybe it may not be the best option for someone travelling on a tight budget! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to going back!",5,2014,04,04
128,"Very good hotel, excellent service","Stayed 2 nights on a business trip. Booked direct. Pros - Service was excellent from that first phone call. Delighted to have recieved a room upgrade to a WOW suite. Great size room, spacious, pristine and well appointed. Wifi was very good. Iron delived upon request. Pub/Breakfast room excellent food for both breakfast & Dinner. Club lounge had good selection of drinks.  Cons - No shelf to put toiletries & shaving lamp didnt work. I didnt report it as I wasnt shaving but was interested to see if anyone would notice. Also no real reception area as you have to go to the external pub for breakfast/dinner. Verdict, definately recommened. Really good service.Rooms at front can be noisey.",5,2014,04,03
128,Spring Break,We were well-looked after from start to finish - the staff couldn't do enough for us.  The room was as good as described.  the club offer represented very good value for money with excellent snacks and a good range of foods for breakfast.,5,2014,04,03
128,Luxury service!,"Superb service, the staff is attentive and careful all the time. The location is very central. A lot of interesting spots are at walking distance, and when not, it is very easy to move around on the tube, since most attractions are at a few stops. The location itself is not very busy in the evening (take that as a good or a bad thing, your call), but a 5-10 minute walk solves that, or alternatively many night buses take you to different stops close to the hotel. The facilities are also excellent, everything was very clean, although you have to know you're going to London, and rooms tend to be small there when comparing to other places in the world. Altogether, a very advisable place to stay when in London!",5,2014,04,03
128,Great luxury hotel and fantastic service for a great price,"Having now stayed here several times over the last few months, I held off writing a review to see if the high standards remained consistent...and they have.
From the doorman's greeting as you enter, to the reception staff, concierges and staff you pass in corridors, everyone is unfailingly polite, cheerful and determined that you enjoy your stay - this is no act, they genuinely care!
Spotlessly clean throughout, the rooms are very well equipped and comfortable with little touches like bathrobes (pristine and fluffy) that you often don't get at more expensive hotels and that attention to detail extends to things like bowls of apples placed throughout the hotel and the turn down service in the evening.
Each time I have stayed there has been complementary water and fruit in my room in addition to the usual tea/coffee and most recently, a complementary bottle of wine, which was a brilliant surprise.
It really does feel like a home from home and is significantly better than what, in its price range, might be considered peer hotels that I have stayed at. 
This feels like a 5 star hotel but at a 3 star price - highly recommended.",5,2014,04,03
128,Very pleasant stay,"Room very good, if small for the rate. A small niggle was the lack of any sensible drawer storage space to unpack into. Everything either had to be hung up or left in suitcase. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening, but the continental breakfast buffet was absolutely excellent and extremely good value.",4,2014,04,02
128,"Oh, wow!!!!! Great hotel  :-D","Amazing hotel, which I booked as part of a surprise trip to London for my boyfriend. 
The hotel was spotlessly clean, sparkly and welcoming - a hot towel to wipe our hands on arrival, that's service!
The room was a good size for a standard double and the glass between the bedroom and ensuite was a big surprise, but there is a drop down modesty screen for those private moments!
I had advised the hotel upon making the booking that the stay was because it was my boyfriend's birthday and after about 15 minutes of being shown to our room, there was a knock on the door and a surprise birthday cake was delivered for him! What great service and a fabulous gesture. Their kindness also made a huge positive impact on our stay. 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,2014,04,02
128,"Excellent Hotel, Brilliant Service",We are a young couple who stayed at The Montcalm in September 2013. We chose this hotel because of its fantastic reputation and very reasonable price considering the level of service you receive. The concierge who greeted us was brilliant; he was very professional and made us feel very welcome. The location is peaceful and quiet because it is not right in the middle of the busy city but it is not too distant that you can't enjoy the things that London has to offer. We would certainly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning again.,5,2014,04,01
128,Excellent throughout,"What a lovely hotel this is. Stayed for my partners birthday, they assisted with all special requests. Service was excellent at all times, check in process easy and simple. Hotel is opulent and well looked after. We even got upgraded at no extra cost, it's the little things that count! Would & will return.",5,2014,04,01
128,Another Great Experience @ Montcalm at the Brewery London,"I really love this hotel.
It has a great building, full of history. The location in the heart of the Finantial District in London gives you quiet and relax time.
The staff are amazing, and alway present to help. The rooms are beautifull.
It was my secon time in Montcalm and will definatelly stay again when i visit London. My corner suite had an amazing sun light and space.",5,2014,04,01
128,Great Everytime,"Just got back from a wonderful stay at the Montcalm. This was our third stay and we would definitely return. Location (Barbican) is nice and quiet on the weekends and a short tube ride to all major attractions. Staff are brilliant and very attentive and the rooms are very well presented. Great value, service, location and a great time!!",5,2014,03,31
128,Ideally located,"Stayed here recently for a music concert at the O2 and couldn't have asked for more. As above everything was excellent and concierge and guest hospitality was second to none. One small gripe. Gym facilities are very limited but adequate for basic cardio workout and Sauna was not working for duration of stay, was promised an update when it would be fixed whilst there but didn't get one, so for any Gym Fanatics please be aware your needs won't be met. local amenities Tesco Express , Cashpoint etc also with stones throw of front reception.",5,2014,03,31
128,"Excellent Hotel, wonderful stay","I have the pleasure of staying at The Montcalm, Barbican hotel on a regular basis due to work commitments. The location is ideal, and has several superb amenities for eating, drinking, shopping etc. ..
The hotel is beautifully decorated, the staff exemplary, the rooms and amenities excellent.
During my stays, I have noticed that the service provided by all levels of staff is consistent, week on week. I am greeted personally as I walk through the door, my rooms are always immaculate, well sized, quiet, extra fruit and water is regularly left in the room for me, quite frankly the staff cannot do enough.
It is a pleasure be a regular visitor of this hotel, and I use it when I come to London for personal trips too.",5,2014,03,31
128,Superb service - beyond expectations but noisy front facing room!,"We had a weekend stay at the Montcalm to celebrate my Daughter's graduation at The Barbican Centre, which was just around the corner, and my husband's birthday.  They very kindly upgraded us to a Club Room which was spacious, pristinely clean and well appointed.  

The stay was ""almost"" perfect - just marred by the traffic noise we suffered in our front facing Club Room which unfortunately gave us two not very good night's sleep!  I understand they are addressing this problem with double glazing so hopefully this should make these rooms quieter!

We would definitely stay again, but depending on the noise issues, may request a room at the rear of the building.

The weekend itself was fabulous with lovely sunny weather and it was a joy to wander around the City at the weekend when all the banks and offices were closed!

I would recommend this hotel!",4,2014,03,31
128,Excellent,"We had actually booked another 5 star hotel for a weekend but at arrival we were so disappointed that we just left! It was far from up to expectations, so there we were Friday afternoon and no place to stay..... I was there with my grown up son, so a twin room was essential to us, which very well could make the problem worse, as most rooms usually are doubles. By chance and coincidentally we turned up at Montcalm at the Brewery, and what a pleasant surprise. We were offered a Club Room, where bed could be turned into twin beds. Excellent. Thank you. And we very much indeed appreciated the extremely nice, friendly and pleasant staff all over (as should be of course, but some places it does not work so well.....). We definitely would love to come back.",5,2014,03,31
128,"Superb staff, great location","My wife and I stayed for one night and will certainly be back. Every member of staff was without fail friendly, courteous and attentive and it will be this that I remember most. The facilities in the room were well considered and of a high standard; the bed was comfortable; the wifi was strong; the bathroom products were great. Finally, the breakfast (served at the Jugged Hare next door) was the best I've had in a long time.",5,2014,03,31
128,Faultless,My husband surprised me with a weekend away in London for our anniversary. The hotel couldn't have done more to make us feel special. They upgraded our room. We have complimentary wine and fruit. The room itself was a good size for a central London hotel. It was close to 2 Underground stations so access to the centre on London was easy. I would recommend this hotel 100%,5,2014,03,31
128,A gem of a hotel,"Just returned with my daughter from visiting our son in London, who's studying abroad. Couldn't wait to write a review on this hotel. Initially, I selected The Montcalm for the convenient location to our son's university, plus the previous positive reviews I had already read. Well, it didn't disappoint. It exceeded my expectations. From the moment we arrived, to the end of our stay, we were continuously greeted, welcomed, and  asked if we needed anything more to make our stay more pleasant. Even though our son had become quite familiar with London, the staff still treated us as a true guest. They guided us to dining locations, etc. The hotel is deceiving from the outside, but on the inside it has an appeal that is synonymous with 'class'. We were escorted by Zdravko to our room. Since we were from overseas, he went over a map of London to familiarize us. He explained everything about our room thoroughly. He was great!!. So, that was our first great experience with the service.The hotel room sizes are average, but super nice, clean and the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. Seriously! Nice toiletries and plenty of towels. Thank you!!  The hotel is centrally located to transportation, (The Tube, aka train station). Highly recommend this form of transportation. You'll save tons of money vs. taxis. However, if you're traveling to the airport, consider the Heathrow Express train.Takes you right to the terminals. Better than the Tube. Wish we had done the express, because for the sake of 'saving money', we almost missed our flight. That was an adventure to say the least, but everyone at the airport was super helpful to get us on our plane in time.  So, all in all, great hotel choice. I'd stay there again. I also recommend dining at both of their restaurants. Yummy!! In addition, they're were many staff members we encountered, but Zdravko, Vlad, Mega,(the front desk Mng.r)and Vourvounia(housekeeping), were super friendly and accommodating.  In closing, thank you to The Montcalm Hotel for making our visit to London, a wonderful & memorable experience, for us and our son.",5,2014,03,30
128,Friendly luxurious hotel,"We had a short but very enjoyable stay at this hotel. Everything about the hotel is excellent. The bedrooms were comfortable and very nicely appointed. All the amenities of a five-star hotel were there. Television, complimentary tea and coffee, bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, fruit in the room, everything was first class.

We had two small problems which were dealt with speedily and efficiently by housekeeping – the safe battery ran out during our stay and had to be replaced and the electric kettle was not working for some reason. These were minor difficulties and they were dealt with very promptly.

The front of house staff was extremely helpful and we accessed our room before the appointed time with out any compliment.  The front desk manager, Megha, was particularly efficient and pleasant.

The breakfast was superb. It was served in the Jugged Hare pub which is part of the hotel, though slightly down the road. The quality and choice of the food was first class and the service was excellent.

From the moment you step through the door and Georgi, the doorman, tips his hat and opens the door for you, you know that you are in a five-star hotel.

The location is extremely convenient to the city and it is right beside the Barbican Centre – ideal for anyone attending a function there. It seems to be a very safe area. We walked everywhere and the hotel can be easily accessed from two adjacent tube stations - Barbican and Moorgate.

All in all, this was very pleasant stay. I can highly recommend this hotel and I hope to be back again soon.",5,2014,03,30
128,Excellent bed and service/amenities,"I have stayed twice now at the Montcalm while in town for business.  Both times the service was excellent, the beds are very comfortable (I get a really good night's rest) and the in-room amenities are quite nice.  Wireless signal strong and reliable too.

It is true per other reviewers that  there is no view out the window to speak of (at least on lower levels where I've stayed), but then again, the other benefits are more important to me.  I haven't tried the eating options in the hotel yet, but have noticed the Jugged Hare is quite busy and lively until late.",4,2014,03,30
128,Excellent,"Stayed for two nights. Staff were so helpfull and courteous. Our room was excellent, spacious and well equipped. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. Shower was a bit too complicated and water pressure not very good but apart from that I had no complaints.
We had breakfast both mornings at the jugged hare .Both were excellent and was served on Sunday till 11.00 and on Monday till 10.30. Perfect for an enjoyable lazy start to the day.
Location was excellent ",5,2014,03,29
128,Fantastic staff,"I stay at this hotel in a frequent basis while travelling to London. The staff are all polite, helpful, and take care of all of my needs. The food at the Jugged Hare is great and I find their menu and specials diverse and delicious",5,2014,03,29
128,lovely break,"Stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting family, room was smaller than expected but beautifully done. Bathroom large and fully equipped. Service attentive and discreet. Had dinner in attached pub Jugged Hare, really good. Would love to go back.",5,2014,03,29
128,lack of definition,"in view of the good comments, I was looking forward to staying here. Upon arrival, everything looked promissing: nice reception, friendly staff (although I couldn't always understand their english;it's good to have trainees from all over the world but their english should be good too) etc.
i was taken to the room via  stairs, tunnels bridges etc. to what was supposed to be a quiet room.I've rarely been so disappointed: the view was non existant: I looked at a wall and a series of hughe airco fans that made a terrible noise ( so avoid by all means room 141 and the neighbouring ones).
i decided to have dinner in one the restaurants (The .. Hare,): food was OK, but again so much noise.It was actually a simple british pub with drunken man and especially women. The style of this place was clearly not in line with the hotel's ambitions. I fled to the hotel bar but it was the same here: no calm serene atmosphere but loud night club music and a very loud crowd.
back in my room, I quickly figured out that i couldn't sleep there so I asked and got another room: it was tiny and at the price of 320 POUND a rip off.",3,2014,03,28
128,Great stay in,"Finding a decent hotel at a reasonable price can be very difficult in London, but not this time! At Montcalm Brewery we had a great time! We stayed three nights in a deluxe double room in promotion, cozy, spacious, spotless and with everything you need for a comfortable London stay. The quality of the bed allowed us to rest very well after the long tours!
The hotel is 5 minutes from Moorgate Underground and a 12-minute walk from Liverpool street station, the train terminus for London Stansted.
The good breakfast buffet, not exactly cheap, offers a wide choice of both sweet and savory dishes and the waiting staff is always very attentive.
The guys at the reception, especially Juliana, have always been extremely helpful and efficient.
There are good quality restaurants in the area and for a cultural evening the barbican center is around the corner. 
The only flaw, in the bathroom there was no blackout curtain for the window (yes the bathroom is not blind!!!) and a lot of light came in.",5,2024,10,09
128,Great big rooms with delicious breakfast,"Very nice hotel, large rooms, everything super clean. Beds comfortable.
The breakfast was very plentiful and there was something for everyone.
Staff very friendly. The area is very quiet, pleasant after the hustle and bustle of London. The bathroom wall is glazed and can be covered with a blind - I never understand that :)",4,2024,04,18
128,The Montcalm London City - recommended!,"Very friendly welcome upon arrival and check-in at 9am. Of course the room wasn't available at that time, but I was offered to leave my luggage there, which I gladly accepted. The hotel is centrally located in the city, not far from our London office. Nice reception even when I returned around 10 p.m. The room was clean, quiet and pleasant, bed with good mattress and a nice bathroom with rain shower. In the morning there were various breakfast options, especially English Breakfast, but also some bread, sausage and cheese at the buffet. Uncomplicated and quick check-out. I'd love to come back.",5,2024,03,22

128,Ok per visitare Londra,"Ottimo Hotel dove soggiornare per una breve sosta a Londra. 
Quartiere pieno di uffici immerso nella City è collegato benissimo con la metropolitana. Buon rapporto qualità prezzo.
La camera disponeva di un letto comodissimo e di tutto il necessario per una sosta breve.",4,2023,01,18
128,Hotel che deve decisamente migliorare,"Hotel classificato 4 stelle. Ero ospite pertanto non conosco e posso valutare il prezzo pagato ma l'hotel presenta diverse criticità. Primo gli ingressi sono dislocati in varie porte non facilmente comprensibili all'arrivo. Nei corridoi molto disordine, carrelli con biancheria pulita e sporca a tute le ore. Cartello del 2° piano caduto a fianco ascensore. Camera molto piccola. Ero solo ma se viene offerta come doppia in due si farebbe fatica a muoversi. Ad alcuni colleghi la stanza NON è stata rifatta e nessuno si è scusato. Prima colazione veramente scarsa senza neanche la macchinetta automatica per espresso e cappuccino. Buono il Wi-Fi. Nonostante fosse tutto prepagato hanno voluto  carta credito a garanzia eventuali danni alla stanza. Non ci tornerei.  ",2,2022,12,05

Sheila es una gran profesional. 
Os recomendamos este hotel, nosotros volveremos siempre.",5,2022,10,31
128,Soggiorno,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 3 notti. La camera era spaziosa ed elegante. Abbiamo avuto una piccola incomprensione all’inizio del soggiorno ma lo staff è stato molto accogliente e ci ha aiutato a risolvere la situazione. In particolare grazie ad Andrea, una ragazza molto cordiale e disponibile che si è mostrata sempre pronta risolvere ogni tipo di problematica.",5,2022,09,11
128,Si salva  per la posizione,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 6 notti e onestamente ce ne siamo andati con un po’ di amaro in bocca. La posizione dell’hotel è ottima, camminando per soli 5 minuti si possono raggiungere due diverse fermate della metropolitana. L’hotel è inoltre molto vicino alla stazione ferroviaria di St Pancras. La struttura è molto bella e caratteristica e il quartiere è tranquillo e sicuro. Ma veniamo alle dolenti note…la deluxe double room che ci hanno assegnato era molto piccola con un letto matrimoniale alla francese e soprattutto priva di finestra apribile (c’era soltanto una piccola parete di vetro che dava sul retro dell’edificio dove erano posizionati rumorosissimi condizionatori sempre in funzione). Anche il bagno era senza finestra, e questo avrebbe potuto anche starci se ci fosse stata almeno una ventola di aspirazione che però non c’era (come ahimè non c’era lo scopino per il water). Al nostro arrivo in camera la temperatura era glaciale (19 gradi centigradi) e il termostato non dava la possibilità in alcun modo di modificare la temperatura.  Poiché neanche la cassaforte funzionava abbiamo segnalato i due inconvenienti alla reception che ci ha assicurato di provvedere quanto prima a risolvere la questione. Al nostro rientro in camera la sera abbiamo trovato la stessa temperatura che c’era al nostro arrivo e la cassaforte non ancora funzionante. Abbiamo nuovamente fatto richiesta di intervento, ma neanche il giorno seguente era stata messa mano al problema. Al terzo sollecito, questa volta non esattamente gentile quanto i due precedenti, un tecnico è salito in camera e ha cambiato il settaggio della temperatura dell’aria condizionata e riparato la cassaforte (aggiungo soltanto che il giorno della partenza, quando abbiamo riaperto la cassaforte per riprendere i nostri valori, la cassaforte ha iniziato ad emettere un suono continuo davvero insopportabile). Concludo con due ultime chicche: l’allarme antincendio è scattato per ben due volte durante la settimana in piena notte (sebbene fortunatamente non ci fosse nessun incendio in corso) spaventandoci enormemente, ma nessuno le mattine seguenti ha porto le proprie scuse per l’inconveniente o dato notizie in merito a quanto accaduto. Infine, una sera, rientrando in hotel abbiamo trovato la camera parzialmente rifatta (mancavano gli asciugamani per il viso e il tappetino per la doccia e il cestino non era stato svuotato). Inoltre, e ritengo questa la cosa più grave, il cucchiaino con il quale avevo mangiato uno yogurt la sera precedente, era stato riposto nel vano in cui si trovava il set per il thé senza essere stato lavato.
Il giudizio medio è dovuto  alla posizione e al fatto che in hotel siamo stati solamente per dormire e non certo  l’allarme qualità  dei servizi e alla cura del cliente. Il tutto senza dimenticare che si tratta di un hotel a 5 stelle 😳",3,2022,08,21
128,Gute gelegenes Hotel in der City of London,"Nettes Hotel in der City of London, gut gelegen zu Moorgate & Barbican. Zimmer sind dem Standard entsprechen, die etwas kleinen Fenster mit nicht so ""toller"" Aussicht, sind der Umwidmung einer Brauerei geschuldet. Sehr schöner (kleiner) Frühstücksraum, Auswahl könnte größer sein, vor allem wenn man mehr als einmal dort frühstückt.",4,2022,05,18
128,Check in lentissimo,"Gentilissimo il personale. Ma aime non basta.
Molto molto lunghe le pratiche burocratiche. Viene richiesto di compilare un form in cui vengono inserite informazioni personali non necessarie per stare in albergo. Privacy non rispettata.
Le camere sono posizionate in un labirinto di palazzo.
Assurdo il pagamento anticipato a cui si aggiunge una garanzia non mi è chiaro su cosa. Niente fattura per il rimborso. Viene emessa il giorno successivo al pagamento.
I processi di check in sono fuori dai tempi. Ospitare un cliente dimostrando di non avere fiducia fa passare l voglia di tornare ed infatti non tornerò.
Peccato, perché il personale è molto cordiale.",1,2019,11,18
128,Buen hotel,"La habitación era práctica, la cama confortable y el baño un lujo. El personal fue muy amable y servicial. El único inconveniente de esta Habitación interior  era un ruido constante que llegaba desde la ventana (¿el motor de un aire acondicionado?)",4,2019,11,05

Leider konnte man eine zentrales Licht nicht ausschalten, was sehr ärgerlich war, da ich die Schlüsselkarte abziehen musste. Zimmer leider auch laut bedingt durch eine laufende Klimaanlage außerhalb. Frühstück gut, Personal beim Checkout leicht überfordert. ",4,2019,10,24

",5,2019,10,21
128,Esperienza deludente,"L’hotel è situato nella city, in una vecchia birreria, accanto al Barbican centre ed al Museum of London.
Per cominciare, buona parte del personale alla reception è poco preparato ed inesperto: il nostro check-in è stato lungo e difficoltoso perchè non riuscivano a trovare la nostra prenotazione. Fra l’altro, assolutamente inconsueto nella nostra pluridecennale esperienza di viaggiatori e con nostro estremo stupore, ci hanno fatto pagare il costo totale di soggiorno e colazioni contestualmente con il check-in; pensavamo fosse un malinteso ma ci hanno detto che era la policy dell’hotel. Al costo di 311£ per notte, colazione esclusa, ci è stata assegnata una club room. Ci aspettavamo una super stanza, e invece si trattava di una stanza piccola, con soffitto ribassato che dava senso di oppressione, una finestra minuscola non apribile, portasapone inclinato e aria condizionata molto rumorosa. 
In omaggio viene offerto un cesto con 4 frutti e 2 bottigliette di acqua; erano disponibili le ciabattine, la veste da camera, il set per tè e caffè, il ferro e l’asse da stiro, un ombrello.
La pulizia della stanza era mediocre, uno degli asciugamani presentava qualche macchia.
La colazione era assolutamente ordinaria e non consona ad un hotel a 5 stelle: nulla di preparato al momento, scelta modesta di dolce e salato. Il costo della colazione è di 15£ a persona se si prenota prima, altrimenti 22£.
In definitiva, una stanza modesta, un servizio mediocre a fronte di un prezzo che ci è sembrato veramente esagerato e non all’altezza delle presunte 5 stelle.",2,2019,10,16
128,Oasi di pace nel centro di Londra,"Se volete soggiornare nel centro di Londra ma al tempo stesso trovare un’oasi di tranquillità,questo è l’hotel che fa per voi!
Il Montcalm at the Brewery è un eccellente esempio di recupero architettonico di un antico birrificio, situato a pochi passi dalla stazione metro di Barbican è  in un punto strategico per raggiungere ogni punto di interesse della città.
Le camere club sono molto spaziose e nel letto king size i sogni d’oro sono assicurati!
Ma il vero punto di forza del Montcalm sono le persone che ci lavorano: troverete sempre delle persone sorridenti e preparate che sapranno esaudire ogni vostro desiderio. Sempre con il sorriso!

Al nostro arrivo ci è stata offerta una camere con unico letto queen size senza alcuna possibilità di rimediare al loro errore,( premetto che per scrupolo  2 giorni prima della partenza ho inviato una mail al info@montcalm.co.uk  per confermare il nostro arrivo alla quale non è mai seguita alcuna risposta) nonostante il  gentile interessamento della ragazza italiana alla reception il manager irremovibile ci ha obbligato ad un ulteriore versamento di 30 sterline al giorno per avere la camera confacente alla nostra prenotazione.

128,Olin  Deutschland,"Habe in diesem Hotel mit kleineren Unterbrechungen ca 6 Wochen verbracht. 
Es ist sehr schönes Hotel in der Nähe der Liverpool Street Station. Die Zimmer sind immer  sauber aber manche Einrichtung ist schon ein bisschen in die Jahre gekommen, deswegen nur 4 von 5 Punkten. Jeden Tag habe ich auch frisches Obst im Zimmer gehabt. Ich habe mehrere Zimmern bewohnt und in jedem hat immer eine Kleinigkeit nicht funktioniert. 
Einmal war die Klimaanlage zu laut aber ein Zimmerwechsel am nächsten Tag war überhaupt kein Problem. 
Der Hnadtuchtrockner war kalt oder die Fussbodenheizung im Bad hat nicht richtig funktioniert. Hierfür habe ich kein neues Zimmer verlangt, habe zuhause auch keine Fussbodenheizung oder ein Handtuchwärmer im Bad. Wie geschrieben, immer eine Kleinigkeit.  Wenn ich ein Anliegen hatte, wurde es auch immer zur meiner Zufriedenheit erledigt. Besonders Yordan, der mir fasst jeden Abend die Tür öffnette und mich freundlich begrüste hat mir oft geholfen wenn ich Informationen brauchte oder ein Anlegen hatte. Am Sonntag 24.02.2019 um 13 Uhr  habe ich bei Yordan nachgefragt, ob ich irgendwo Fussballticket zum Liga CUP Finale Chelsea vs. Man. City im Wemley Stadion bekommen kann. Nach kurze Absprache mit dem Consierge Alex war auch dies kein Problem und ich sas um 16:30 im Stadion. Hierfür bedanke ich mich sehr.   ... Vielen Dank und Auf Wiedersehen",4,2019,02,26

Per il resto hotel consigliato!",5,2019,01,02
128,Da favola,"Non si può dire molto di questo albergo, se non il consiglio di soggiornarci almeno una notte. 
Noi lo abbiamo scelto per trascorrere le ultime giornate dell'anno durante il capodanno londinese.
La camera molto spaziosa. Il bagno è separato dal resto tramite una vetrata oscurabile.
Tutto è molto curato, sia nell'arredamento, che nella pulizia, i prodotti da bagno e gli accessori. 
Molto comodo il telefono per girare e chiamare liberamente come si fosse a casa.
Fantastica la possibilità di utilizzare la lounge il pomeriggio per un piccolo rinfresco.
Un po' piccola la zona benessere, decisamente meno curata del resto.
Labirintico, ma questo fa parte del suo fascino.
Il personale è, ovviamente, più che cortese.",5,2019,01,02
128,Bene ma non benissimo! I dettagli fanno la differenza,"All’inizio del mese di dicembre, abbiamo fatto un viaggio di coppia (il nostro primo viaggio) e per l’occasione abbiamo deciso di viaggiare durante periodo natalizio e di scegliere un albergo a 5 stelle. Personalmente è stata la mia prima volta in una struttura a 5 stelle, ho frequentato molto le strutture a 4 stelle ma mai a 5. Detto ciò una struttura a 5stelle impone grandi aspettative che purtroppo ha infranto. Partiamo dall’inizio. Arriviamo alla struttura alle ore 13.00 (check-in ore 14.00), ci dicono che la nostra stanza non è ancora pronta motivo per cui nell’attesa facciamo un giro nel quartiere mangiando un boccone per poi tornare poco dopo le 14.00. Al nostro rientro ci confermano che la nostra camera non è ancora pronta! Ma essendo le due ci assegnano un’altra stanza. Il personale cordiale ci accompagna alla stanza che di per sé era pulita e in ordine se non fosse che il bagno era spropositatamente più grande della stanza e lo spazio non era stato in alcun modo utilizzato bene!
La doccia prendeva il lato corto della stanza, bella spaziosa ma non aveva nulla per appoggiare saponi vari. ma ok! arriva il momento di lavarsi i denti su un lavandino, giuro largo 20cm e lungo 30cm, messo in basso quindi scomodo e la cosa peggiore è che gli specchi (ben due) non erano posizionati in alcun modo sopra al lavandino ma uno era spostato a dx di una 30 di cm l’altro era a lato del wc (precisamente non ho ancora capito la sua utilità- anche perché non era nemmeno a figura intera). In più, in questo bagno spazioso, NON CERA TRACCIA DI MOBILE O SOSTEGNO per appoggiare ls nostre cose, non c’era nemmeno lo spazio sul lavandino per un bicchiere e gli spazzolini da riporre! Prima di ricorrere ad una lamentela ci siamo adeguati e il mio compagno ha utilizzato l’asse da stiro come supporto per i nostri oggetti.. il dramma è stato durante la sua barba: era impossibile radersi perché lo specchio non essendo in linea con il lavandino non forniva visuale del viso.

A quel punto ci siamo lamentati e ci hanno cambiato la stanza. (le valigie le abbiamo dovute portare giù noi per poi tornare su con il facchino allo stesso piano a distanza di due porte più in là! (p.s. per un 5 stelle il servizio dovrebbe essere sempre a 360°, ma andiamo avanti).
Controlliamo la stanza ed è ok se non fosse che nel momento in cui andiamo a coricarci sentiamo degli spifferi che provengono dalle finestre. In sintesi, i serramenti avrebbero bisogno di una piccola manutenzione per essere chiusi agilmente dai clienti. La seconda stanza, perfetta nell’arredamento peccava nei piccoli dettagli come le tazze o gli oggetti di cortesia per farsi un the caldo o altro erano lasciati alla rinfusa sopra il minibar. Al rientro del secondo giorno, in hotel verso le 18 troviamo una signora in camera, che esattamente non sappiamo ancora ad oggi cosa ci facesse, sembrava stesse controllando la pulizie ma non si sa! Pulizie che si sono state effettuate, la biancheria in ordine se non fosse che nel riordino si sono dimenticati di ripristinare la bottiglietta d’acqua naturale consumata la sera prima lasciandoci solo quella frizzante. Ora capisco che nulla è dovuto ma se sistemate gli asciugamani e li cambiate ogni 3x2 non capisco perché l’acqua lasciata di cortesia fuori dal mini bar quale non può essere sostituita. Ma andiamo avanti! In serata decidiamo di usufruire del servizio in camera, non l’avessimo mai fatto! Sottolineo che il servizio in camera risulta segnalato attivo 7 giorni su 7 24/24, informazione lasciata anche nel menù in entrambe le camere. chiamiamo verso le ore 23 di sabato sera per chiedere due tortini al cioccolato. Non solo chiamando in reception ci hanno detto che forse non sarebbe stato possibile soddisfare la richiesta ma ci hanno passato direttamente la cucina! Arrivano i nostri dolci… dolci che non hanno avuto nemmeno la decenza di scaldare.. erano freddi da frigo.. ma io boh!
Finiamo con il check out.. situazione secondo me ambigua.. al bancone 3 persone addette ai lavori ma di queste ne lavorava solo una creando un po’ di coda alla reception.. ora non è morto nessuno e sicuramente il personale stava svolgendo altre mansioni ma con più attenzione verso i clienti, i tempi sarebbero stati certamente più brevi. 

Nonostante queste, il posto non male come quartiere e come vicinanza ai mezzi, non abbiamo avuti troppi problemi negli spostamenti, struttura pulita.. ma in generale dire che il prezzo non meritava.. fosse stato un 4 stelle avrei avuto meno pretese.. ma se ti atteggi a 5 ci sta anche che i clienti possano pretendere più attenzioni!",2,2019,01,01
128,"Räume sind klein, sauber und gemütlich - Service ist eine Katastrophe","Gebucht habe ich kurzfristig über Booking.com für 3 Nächte. Als ich am 2 Abend zurück ins Hotel kam, war in unmittelbarer Nähe eine Hochzeit. Die konnte ich lautstark in meinem Zimmer hören. Kurzer Hand wurde beschlossen, dass ich mein Zimmer wechseln sollte. Beim Packen stellte ich fest, dass ein Einkauf (Wert ca 10 Pfund) vom Vortag nicht mehr da war und meine Ohrringe lagen nicht mehr auf dem Tisch sondern auf dem Boden unter dem Tisch.
Die restliche Zeit meines Aufenthalts war davon geprägt, dass ich den Vorfall immer wieder aufs Neue erläutern musste. Bis zum Auschecken zwei Tage später hatte man weder meine Sachen noch eine adäquate Lösung gefunden. 
Als ich nachmittags nochmal ins Hotel kam, wurde mir erklärt dass man mir Rabatt für die Notwendigkeit des Raumwechsels gibt. Wg meiner unauffindbaren Einkäufe wurde mir erklärt, dass man sie nicht gefunden hat, das Housekeeping vertrauensvoll sei und daher nicht vom Verschulden des Hotels ausgeht. Vielmehr glaubt man, dass ich meine Sachen einfach in eine andere Tüte gepackt habe. 
Mir fehlen Worte mit welcher Drastigkeit ich hier abgefertigt wurde. Kann nur abraten von diesem Hotel ",1,2018,10,30
128,Eccellente rapporto qualità/prezzo!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 2 notti, e devo dire che è stata un'esperienza molto più che positiva sotto ogni punto di vista.
L'hotel si trova in un complesso ricavato da un vecchio birrificio, l'esterno e alcune aree interne(soffitti della hall) hanno mantenuto l'aspetto originario e questo ne accresce il valore e la storicità del posto.
Il personale è gentilissimo e sempre disponibile, attento e premuroso, nonostante i nostri problemi con la lingua inglese.
La nostra camera (club room) era molto spaziosa, ben curata, illuminazione perfetta con molti punti luce utili oltre che belli. Il letto era comodissimo. Oltre che il frigo bar è presente anche un profumatore per l'aria, radiosveglia, tv satellitare, bollitore con caffè e tè e riviste inoltre si possono ordinare i quotidiani. Anche il bagno è molto spazioso con vasca e doccia, inoltre sono presenti due accappatoi molto comodi e utili oltre ai vari asciugamani che venivano cambiati quotidianamente. La camera veniva rifatta due volte la prima in mattinata poi nel pomeriggio passavano per risistemarla per la notte. Durante i giorni di pioggia la struttura mette a disposizione ombrelli neri molto eleganti e robusti.

128,particolare la struttura,"La struttura è molto particolare, per cui risultano gradevoli tutti gli ambienti comuni, ma la dislocazione dispersiva delle camere, quasi a mo di labirinto non mi ha soddisfatto, poco da hotel classico. la camera bella e dotata di tutti i confort, ma piccola, troppo.",3,2018,03,18

128,"Non siamo stati bene, non ci ha soddisfatto ","Appena tornati da un soggiorno in questo Hotel...il titolo non potrebbe essere più esaustivo! Siamo una famiglia di quattro persone e di conseguenza ci hanno dato una stanza comunicante. Il letto delle mie figlie era ad una piazza e mezzo quindi scomodo per dormire in due, anche dovuto al fatto che  non sono più “piccole” ma adolescenti. Oltre tutto la loro “stanza” era senza finestra...giuro che non mi era mai capitato!! Tipo sgabuzzino! Senza una lampada o qualcosa che potesse far un minimo di luce durante la sera per leggere un libro. C’era una sorta di led in basso ma che a loro faceva paura (per quanto adolescenti ancora hanno qualche paura di tipo infantile, comprensibile). Quando entravano gli addetti alla reception non hanno mai alzato lo sguardo anche solo per controllare chi entrasse o uscisse e credetemi che ci ho fatto caso ogni singola volta! Quindi mi domando..ma la sicurezza? Dato e considerato che non c’era un codice o qualche sicurezza che potesse far salire ai piani delle camere solo gli ospiti! Mah sono rimasta perplessa! Ah, l’unica nota positiva è la pulizia (per fortuna). 
Non mi è piaciuto per niente! Di sicuro non tornerò mai più qui. P.s questa è la mia primissima recensione negativa che faccio perché penso che si debba lodare e non distruggere ma questo posto non se lo merita. ",1,2018,02,06
128,So lala,"Ich war 2 Nächte im Montcalm. Man öffnet die Zimmertür und dann geht es erstmals einen halbe Stock eine Treppe runter. Irgendwie verschenkter Raum. Die Fenster sind winzig, vermutlich weil es ein historisches Gebäude ist. 
Im Zimmer war es recht laut aufgrund einer in der Wand verbauten Lüftung. Das Personal war geradezu aufdringlich mit mangelndem Fingerspitzengefühl, was nach einem langen Arbeitstag sehr anstrengend sein kann. Der Kühlschrank der Minibar kühlte nicht. Gefallen hat mir die Regendusche im Bad.

Bin regelmässig in der Gegend und denke es gibt in der unmittelbaren Nähe einige bessere Hotels",2,2017,12,15
128,Bello,"Bel Design stiloso ed elegante, receptionist sono stati gentili e accoglienti, la camera e bella e con un letto molto confortevole.

Per il resto tutto ok ",5,2017,11,17
128,Íntimo y de contrastes,"Hotel mas bien boutique en la City, alojado en un edificio muy antiguo, dentro del complejo The Brewery.

Sábanas, batas, toiletries etc de gran calidad. Servicio impecable y muy personal. Buena comida en sus restaurantes.

Buena experiencia, repetiré",4,2017,09,07
128,Hotel con estilo,"Si bien indican 5 estrellas, no lo creo que los sea por su infraestructura no pueden dar un servicio  de esa magnitud (sin pileta, gym, habitaciones pequeñas, etc.) Sin embargo todo los suplen con el estilo y estado de las instalaciones; su personal (conserjería sobre todo), detalles como el Handy (celular con llamadas e internet gratuito), chocolates, café y te de cortesía en el lobby.

Das Hotel liegt im Bankenviertel und hat eine sehr gute Anbindung an die U-Bahn. 

Das Zimmer war nicht groß, aber dafür war alles sehr gepflegt und der Roomservice war ausgezeichnet. Der Concierge war hilfsbereit und aufmerksam und hat jede meiner Fragen schnell und gut beantworten können.

128,"Ordentlich, aber kein 5*-Standard","Wir waren übers Wochenende hier. Als Hotel mitten im Business-Viertel City gab es am Wochenende einen sehr guten Tarif, dafür wirkte das Hotel etwas verwaist (ausser beim Checkout habe ich nie einen anderen Gast gesehen). Wir hatten ohne Frühstück gebucht; das Frühstück hätte glaube ich 30 € Aufpreis gekostet, dann wäre es den Preis nicht mehr wert gewesen. Statt dessen haben wir irgendwo in einem Café für einen Bruchteil sicher netter gefrühstückt.

Das Zimmer war nicht gross, aber absolut ausreichend. Das Bett war ungewöhnlich hoch und für 2 Personen reichlich schmal und auch etwas kurz. Im Zimmer gab es eine merkwürdige Apparatur, die gelegentlich irgendeinen Duftstoff verströmt und dabei ziemlich gebrummt hat. Als wir den Knopf endlich gefunden hatten, haben wir das abgestellt. 

Alles war ordentlich und sehr sauber, aber zum 5*-Standard fehlte für mich das gewisse Etwas. Beispielsweise möchte ich den Concierge mit der Frage, wie man zur Waterloo Station kommt, nicht aus dem Konzept bringen.

Der zum Hotel gehörende Pub Jugged Hare ist sehr lebhaft und bietet gutes Essen an. Gute ÖV-Verbindungen durch die nahe gelegenen Stationen Moorgate oder Barbican.",3,2017,01,16
128,Bellissimo hotel e grande cortesia,"Ho soggiornato presso il Montacalm at the Brewery all'inizio di quest'anno (2017) con un'amica e le nostre figlie adolescenti.
L'hotel si trova nella City in un punto molto tranquillo senza alcun rumore e in un'ottima posizione, 5 minuti a piedi dalla metro Barbican.
Il personale è tutto gentilissimo comprese le due ragazze italiane sempre disponibili per qualunque esigenza e/o informazione. Per un piccolo disguido ci è stata offerta la colazione per tutta la durata del soggiorno. Le camere sono spaziose, provviste di bollitore elettrico, phon, ferro da stiro e di un cellulare che serve sia da navigatore che per le telefonate internazionali. In camera al nostro arrivo abbiamo trovato frutta e cioccolatini. Il bagno è fornito di tutto, accappatoio e pantofole compresi.
La struttura è molto bella ed elegante con illuminazioni spettacolari nelle aree comuni.
All'entrata dell'hotel un concierge che apre la porta ad ogni ora e che fornisce uno o più ombrelli in caso di necessità.
Ottima esperienza certamente da ripetere. Grazie per l'ospitalità!",5,2017,01,11

Pues bien, realice la anulación de la reserva un mes antes de la fecha de llegada y me confirmaron a través de booking la anulación. Cual es mi sorpresa que una vez realizado el viaje me encuentro en mi tarjeta de crédito un cargo de dicho hotel por un importe de 140 eur.
Les escribo un email y ni caso. Reclamo por booking y afortunadamente estos se hacen cargo y me reembolsan el dinero.

128,Servizio e hotel impeccabile,"Siamo stati un weekend in questo hotel a 5 stelle pagando una cifra piccolissima rispetto alla grande qualità offerta dalla struttura e dal personale. Camere spaziose, bagno pulito, moderno e dotato di tutti i comfort e accessori.
Doppi vetri che isolano a livello termico e acustico: anche se la zona è trafficata, la notte non si percepiscono rumori grazie allo spessore delle pareti.
È un hotel ricavato nella vecchia Brewery di Montcalm, la vecchia fabbrica della birra.",5,2016,10,22
128,Für London gut,Spezielle Bauart und etwas verwinkelt machen den Charme des Hotels aus. Saubere kleine Zimmer. Etwas lärmig innerhalb des Hotels durch sehr sparsame Dämmung. Aber für einen kurzen Trip gut da relativ zentral im Bankenviertel gelegen. ,4,2016,10,22
128,Tolles Hotel; teuer wenn man den regulären Preis zahlt,"Wir haben dieses Hotel sehr kurzfristig für ein Wochenende gebucht und deshalb nur 150€ pro Nacht bezahlt. Wir waren sehr positiv überrascht. Sehr sauber, ein tolles Bett, ein schönes Badezimmer. Das Hotel ist etwas verwinkelt, allerdings bringt der Service das Gepäck gerne aufs Zimmer. Wir haben uns rundherum wohl gefühlt und auch ein Late Check Out am Abreisetag war überhaupt kein Problem. Wir kommen gerne wieder.",4,2016,10,11
128,Ottima esperienza!,"La struttura dell'hotel è veramente bella: è un birrificio riadattato ad hotel, fatta molto bene e la hall come le camere sono affascinanti.
Le stanze sono giuste per il soggiorno e il letto è davvero comodo.
In stanza troviamo uno smartphone con chiamate internazionali e internet illimitato in libero uso dentro e fuori l'albergo, davvero ottimo!
Il personale è cortese, disponibilissimo e sempre sorridente! Ci sono anche receptionist italiane per coloro che devono ancora far pratica con la lingua ;)
Il percorso per raggiungere le camere va' un attimo imparato e il doorman ci accompagnerà e spiegherà bene tutti i passi da fare!
Un saluto allo staff e ancora complimenti per il vostro operato! ",5,2016,09,19
128,Sofisticato ,"Sono stato al Montcalm nel 2011, credo avesse aperto da poco. Un hotel davvero bello, frutto di un recupero azzeccato di uno stabilimento dove si produceva birra.

British style",5,2016,09,11
128,Hotel para estar a gusto,"Estuve alojado 4 noches. El hotel está muy bien situado, con una parada de bus en la puerta y unos 500 m del metro. La habitación perfectamente limpia, con una gran cama y un baño cuidado. El servicio exquisito, propio de un hotel de su categoría. Me encantó el detalle del ""handy"", un móvil con 3G y GPS puesto a disposición del huésped durante toda la estancia, que hace tu viaje mucho más sencillo. Conseguí un precio razonable para un hotel de esta categoría y una ciudad como Londrés.",5,2016,09,01
128,Bellino anche se è un labirinto; servizio scarso,"Una birreria adattata ad albergo, ma di buon livello e ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo in zona. Per accedere alla camera ho dovuto prendere due ascensori diversi e attraverso lunghi corridoi passare attraverso due palazzi diversi accostati, un vero labirinto. La stanza era piccola ma funzionale per clientela business che fa toccata e fuga.
Il servizio tuttavia è deficitario, con totale assenza di personale in caso di problemi in camera. Per un allarme partito improvvisamente ho provato a chiamare la reception durante la notte ma per diverse volte non ho ricevuto alcuna risposta. Ho dovuto attendere il ritorno del silenzio senza alcun intervento del personale. Inqualificabile.
Forse è stato un caso e proverò una seconda occasione, ma non è stato proprio un buon inizio.
Lo riproverò solo in caso di prezzi bassi o offerte.",2,2016,08,30
128,Perfetto,"Hotel veramente 5 stelle!!!! Personale e pulizia impeccabile!! Letto comodissimo e bagno spazioso, disponibili 24 su 24 per qualsiasi richiesta! Zona tranquilla ma in un attimo sei ovunque, non si poteva scegliere hotel migliore!!!!! Ci torneremo ",5,2016,08,30

128,"Schön, nett, verwinkelt","Wir waren 3 Nächte in dem dazugehörenden gegenüber liegenden Hotel City Suites, das aber wegen Arbeiten geschlossen wurde, somit wurden wir für die letzten 2 Nächte ins ""Haupthaus"" in ein upgegrades Zimmer umgesiedelt - großer, aber ähnlich nett eingerichtet. Einzig irritierendes ist ziemliche verwinkelte Bauweise der ehemaligen Brauerei - man muss rauf, runter ums Eck und so weiter - ein wenig verwirrend. Es ändert nicht an der Tatsache, dass es ein echt nettes, charmantes Hotel mit wirklich sehr freundlichen Personal ist.",4,2016,08,18
128,Keine 5 Sterne,"Gebucht wurde das Hotel über Booking. Die Buchung wurde in der Währung britische Pfund vorgenommen und mittels Kreditkarte bestätigt. Vor meiner Ankunft belastete das Hotel die Buchung nicht wie vereinbart in britischen Pfund sondern in Euro. Durch einen vom Hotel ausgesprochen kreativ gestalteten Umrechnungskurs verteuerte sich die Buchung somit um ca. 5 %.  Bei einem gebuchten Aufenthalt von 5 Tagen geht es dabei dann nicht mehr um Kleingeld? Bei der Anreise kam es somit zu einer entsprechenden Diskussion mit dem Hotel, welche nach ca. einer Stunde mit einem Upgrate endete. Eine Umbuchung wäre angeblich nicht mehr möglich. (???).    Korrekt geht eigentlich anders. 
Obwohl ich alle Leistungen des Hotel bereits im voraus bezahlt hatte musste ich pro Person und Tag eine Sicherheitsleistung von 50 britischen Pfund hinterlegen. Befremdlich!!!!
Das Zimmer (ein Doppelzimmer zur Alleinutzung) war für ein 5 Sterne Haus relativ klein. Die Zimmerdecke war infolge eines Wasserschadens im Bereich der Klimaanlage stark geschädigt. Der Kleiderschrank kann nur als Witz verstanden werden. Circa 50 cm breit und bereits mit folgendem bestück (Bügelbrett, Bügeleisen, Stockschirm, Holztablett, Föhn, Schuhlöffel, Schuhbeutel, verschiedene Tüten, Schuhputzzeug, Nähzeug, 2 Bademäntel, 2 Paar einmal Hausschuhe).  Der Blick in den Kleiderschrank erinnerte mehr an einen Blick in einen Besenschrank. Für die mitgebrachte Kleidung blieb somit kaum Platz. Für 2 Personen wird es dann unmöglich. Wer beabsichtigt einen mehrtägigen Aufenthalt zu planen dem kann schon aus diesem Grund das Hotel nicht empfohlen werden.  Im Bad fehlt jede Ablagemöglichkeit. Wer hier gerne griffbereit aus dem Vollen schöpft wird enttäuscht sein. Trotz einem kreativen Lichtkonzept des Einrichters ist weder das Zimmer, noch das Bad wirklich hell. Der WLAN Empfang war kostenlos und in Ordnung. Die angebotenen Fernsehprogramme waren reichlich und entsprechen einem internationalen Standard. 
Reisende aus Mitteleuropa, die auf Steckdosen im Zimmer angewiesen sind sollten einen entsprechenden Adapter im Gepäck haben. Das Zimmer verfügt lediglich über eine Steckdose nach mitteleuropäischem Standard. Bei der Anreise stand im Zimmer ein Teller mit drei Teilen Obst. Während der 5 Aufenthaltstage wurde dieser nicht nachgefüllt. Der Wäschewechsel im Bad war großzügig.  Das Bett und die Bettwäsche war ok. Die bereitgestellten Plegeprodukte im Bad  waren in Ordnung aber nicht Premium.  
Der Zimmerservice beschränkte sich auf das notwendige. An einem von 5 Tagen wurde das Zimmer nicht gemacht. 
Das Frühstücksangebot entsprach international Standard, aber auch nicht mehr. Die Kaffeetemperatur erreichte an allen Tagen bestenfalls ein lauwarm Plus. Serviert wurde der Kaffee abwechselnd in der Kaffee- meistens jedoch in einer Teetasse. Eigentlich nicht schlimm, aber bei 5 Sternen?  Wurst, Käse, Lachs usw. wurden ungekühlt angeboten. Nach dem Brexit gelten europäische Hygienestandards offensichtlich nicht mehr. Die Preisgestaltung des Frühstücks, mit einem umgerechneten Preis von ca. 30 Euro pro Person und Tag, hat sich bei diesem Angebot nicht erschlossen. 
An der Rezeption ist nicht ein Mitarbeiter der deutschen Sprache mächtig. Wobei Deutsch nicht wirklich zu den exotischen Sprachen gehört. Auch nicht schlimm, aber bei 5 Sternen? 

Zusammenfassend kann nur gesagt werden die Mängel sind nicht gravierend, aber mit 5 Sternen hat das alles wenig zu tun. Lediglich bei der Preisgestaltung kommt das Haus dem Anspruch der 5 Sterne nahe.",3,2016,08,11
128,Quasi perfetto,"- stanza moderna e funzionale. Letto meraviglioso!!!

128,Favoloso,"L'hotel è ospitato nella cornice suggestiva di una ex fabbrica di birra, nella City. Personale gentilissimo, check-in e check-out scorrevolissimi, pulizia ineccepibile, letto comodissimo, bagno con vasca dotato di set di cortesia completo (dai prodotti per corpo Hermès alle spazzole per scarpe). In camera abbiamo trovato frutta e acqua offerti, ma nella hall sono sempre disponibili acque aromatizzzate, biscottini e mele. Comoda anche la posizione, a 4 minuti a piedi dalla fermata Barbican.

Sin duda, un hotel en Londres muy muy recomendable!",5,2016,06,15
128,"unmoeglich, aber wirklich","Das Hotel ist schoen und gut, aber hier wird ""Ueberbuchung"" praktiziert. Wenn man dann also spaet am Abend ankommt kann es einem passieren, dass es nach (!) dem Check In heisst: ""tja tut uns leid"". Dann wird man in ein Hotel der gleichen Kette verfachtet (das Taxi wird immerhin bezahlt), und man darf dann dort angekommen noch mal einchecken. Das Hotel ist dann deutlich schlechter und liegt in Shoreditch. Ansonsten kann es sehr laut sein, falls man das Glueck hat auch ein Zimmer zu bekommen (fuer das man bezahlt hat und eingecheckt hat).",2,2016,05,26
128,Ottimo per chi viene a Londra per lavoro,"Sono stato diverse volte a Londra ed ho soggiornato in alberghi migliori (uno) e peggiori (diversi). Diciamo che è un hotel che ha un suo fascino in quanto è situato in una ex fabbrica di birra e quindi ha un aspetto molto caratteristico e londinese. Il personale è molto gentile, le camere piccole ma pulite e molto curate. Internet è gratuito e funziona molto bene. La colazione viene servita in un pub poco distante. Al momento sembra un difetto ma in realtà è un pub molto carino, la colazione è abbondante e di buon livello e i camerieri sono gentili. Va benissimi per chi ci viene per lavoro in quanto è nella city, non molto per le famiglie. Cerchiamo degli aspetti negativi: La mia camera era piccola e nell'armadio non c'erano i cassetti per mettere le camice o la biancheria. Il bagno è piccolo, soprattutto nella zona del lavabo dove non c'era spazio per appoggiare le cose. 
Dalla mia camera non c'era praticamente visuale. Il giudizio finale è comunque molto positivo in quanto la media degli alberghi di Londra è molto inferiore rispetto a quello che offre questo hotel. Per me è importante la pulizia e i servizi che vengono offerti, e questo hotel è molto pulito e a livello tecnologico offre il massimo. Dimenticavo, l'hotel mette a disposizione gratuitamente uno smartphone dal quale si può chiamare in Italia e dal quale si puo' tranquillamente navigare in internet praticamente sempre.
Ci tornerò sicuramente.",4,2016,05,24
128,Top class!,"Mix di classe e professionalità in perfetto stile londinese; staff eccezionale...gran parte di questo non a caso from Italy!

128,Un hotel romantico,"Un hotel perfetto Ci Hanno contattati prima Del nostro arrivo X sapere motivo visita , Ci Hanno regalato up great e preparato una bellissima sorpresa in camera, Servizio Ottimo e Massimo disponibilità , centralissimo vicino alla fermata underground Barbican e moorgate! Se andate a Londra scegliere questo hotel ",5,2016,05,11
128,Un posto speciale,"Un albergo molto speciale in un vecchio birrificio , servizio impeccabile anche se le camere sono un po' piccole.La colazione viene servita nel pub Jugged Hare ed è strepitosa! Consiglio un visita al vicino Barbican Center dove troverete bellissime mostre e concerti.",5,2016,05,07
128,Fin de semana sorpresa en todos los sentidos,"Para hacer una sorpresa a mi pareja monte un fin de semana en Londres, donde el hotel elegido fue este, es el día de hoy y me alegro haberlo escogido/descubierto...ya tengo mi lugar en Londres.
La localización encontré muy buena porque cerca tenias la parada de Moorgate con diferentes lineas de metro para descubrir la ciudad y si venias del aeropuerto podías llegarte a la estación de Blackfriars sin tener que desplazarte a Victoria, o mas lejos.
Un hotel fantástico, con el mínimo detalle que te hará sentirte muy reconfortado, una atención sublime y una elegancia inigualable.
Las habitaciones muy completas, han buscado el detalle para sorprender a los clientes, tanto por productos como calidad, la cama nunca había probado una tan cómoda, que pena el fin de semana era corto y no pude aprovechar mas para dormir ;)
Como era una sorpresa estuve hablando con el departamento de clientes para asegurar todo bien, me recomendaron una decoración romántica y algún complemento para elegir (pagando un extra); perfecto! Tanto la decoración como la botella de vino, para cuando llegásemos, ademas de una atención perfecta de la señorita Alice y Gabriele, profesionales.
Escogí un pack con desayuno, donde fue de calidad, muy buena calidad y con una variedad muy satisfactoria.
Ademas elegimos el restaurante The Jugged Hare (ya reservado por mi antes de ir a Londres), un restaurante con mucho encanto, que pena por un trabajador joven con pelo rizado y con volumen (no se como se llamaba) que me disgusto porque nos hecho del restaurante porque querían cerrar.
En resumen, un fin de semana extraordinario, un hotel de mérito y una experiencia MONTCALM.
",5,2016,05,05
128,Buena relación calidad-precio con una anécdota algo absurda,"Situado al lado del Barbican  tiene buena conexión con el resto de la ciudad a través de metro y bus. Reservé en booking.com con una oferta muy interesante. 24 horas antes de llegar te retienen en la tarjeta un cargo por los gastos en caso  de  no show. 
El check in fue rápido (muchos empleados hablan español). En ese momento te retienen 150 libras por posibles gastos extras.  
El hotel ocupa una antigua destilería de cerveza por lo que el espacio es algo intrincado y no hay grandes salones. En ese sentido creo que es algo excesivo venderlo como un cinco estrellas. Las habitaciones son algo pequeñas pero excelentemente equipadas (un armario demasiado pequeño pero todo lo demás perfecto). No buenas vistas pero en Londres uno suele estar poco tiempo en la habitación.
El desayuno en el hotel cuesta 27 libras. Por la zona hay muchos sitios para tomar un buen desayuno por un tercio de esa cantidad. 
La wifi funciona bien y en la habitación hay incluso un smartphone disponible con datos y llamadas locales ilimitadas. 
La anecdota: Tomamos un gintonic y una coca cola en el bar. Como la cuenta ascendió solo a unas 14,75 Libras esterlinas decidimos pagar en efectivo. Cuando el camarero nos trajo el cambio dejó, sin dar ninguna explicación, un plato en la mesa con cerca de medio kilo de monedas pequeñas. (yo sinceramente pensé que se trataba de una broma). Al ver que no ocurría nada, llamé al camarero y le pregunté que cómo nos podía dar un cambio tan absurdo y nos dijo que no tenían otro monedas mayores, que lo sentía y que no sabía qué decir. 
Nos podría haber explicado que tenían ese problema y habernos indicado que era mejor cargarlo a la habitación, o dar cualquier otra solución. Fuimos con el pesado platillo a la recepción y pedimos un cambio más favorable y después de un rato demasiado largo dando explicaciones encontraron un cambio razonable.
Fue una situación algo absurda porque durante el resto de la estancia el servicio fue amable y bastante solícito. 
En cualquier caso se trata de un hotel recomendable con muy buena relación calidad precio, sobre  todo si se toma alguna de las estupendas ofertas que se pueden encontrar en booking.com",4,2016,04,16
128,Tolles Hotel mit Nähe zur U-Bahn!,"Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen und haben ein sehr schönes Zimmer bekommen (ein großes Zimmer und wunderschönes Bad), lediglich die Ablagefläche im Badezimmer war für 2 Damen etwas zu klein ;-)). Als am 2. Tag unser Zimmersafe nicht mehr funktioniert hat, war der Haustechniker nach ca. 5 Minuten da und hat ihn sofort repariert (leere Batterie). Wir haben nicht im Hotel gefrühstückt, daher hier keine Wertung. Beim Auschecken war man dann wieder ebenfalls sehr aufmerksam. Das Hotel liegt in der Nähe von 2 UBahn Stationen (ca. 500m), was für einen Städtetrip sehr angenehm ist. Unser Zimmer war im 3. Stock (die Gänge und Stockwerke sind etwas verwirrend, aber man bekommt einen Plan) und konnte direkt über das Pub im Haus betreten werden. Das war sehr praktisch. Kommen gerne wieder!",5,2016,04,08
128,Verwinkelter Kasten mit Charme,"Seit meinem letzten Besuch in diesem Hotel hat sich einiges getan. Die Preise wurden etwas moderater, dafür wurde im Service nochmals zugelegt. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.

Das Montcalm liegt zwischen den U-Bahn Stationen Moorgate und Barbican in Laufdistanz zu Finsbury Garden.

Das Hotel war ehemals eine Brauerei und ist im Viereck rund um einen Innenhof gebaut. Entsprechend verwinkelt sind die Treppen und Gänge. Dem Gast stehen die üblichen Services wie Fitness-Zentrum, Club-Lounge etc. zur Verfügung. Wer Ruhe sucht in Mitten des Londoner Trubels ist hier richtig.

Jedem Gast steht zudem ein Handy zur Verfügung mit einem unlimitierten Daten- und Telefon-Plan. Man nimmt also einfach das Handy mit, telefoniert, schaut sich Stadtpläne an und hat Zusatzinformationen über Geschäfte etc. immer bei sich.

Die Zimmer sind sehr luxuriös und mit alle was es braucht, inklusive USB Ladestecker und WLan.

Den einzigen Abstrich muss ich beim Frühstück machen. Das ist zwar adrett angerichtet, so echte Stimmung will bei diesen Tiefen Sesseln an den zu hohen Tischen nicht aufkommen. Die Auswahl an Speisen ist OK, kommt aber nicht an den erwarteten Standard heran.",4,2016,04,07
128,Muy bueno,"El personal del hotel es excelente, muy atentos. La decoración muy buena, en la habitación no falta de nada, pero nuestra habitación era un poco pequeña para la categoría del hotel, la relación calidad-precio muy buena para Londres.",4,2016,04,04
128,Luxury Hotel!,"Hotel 5 stelle in zona City ricavato da vecchio birrificio. Struttura imponente, lasciata quasi intatta rispetto al precedente utilizzo di Brewery, davvero particolare. Hall lussuosa con colori caldi, divanetti, parete con cascata di acqua. Servizio di portineria e concierge di livello, reception davvero disponibile e cortese pronta a soddisfare ogni esigenza. Ringraziamo specialmente Giulia per l'attenzione a noi rivolta e per averci aiutato e consigliato in tutto! L'Hotel è dotato di ogni tipo di comfort, stanze pulitissime, molto curate nell'arredamento, a disposizione ampio mini-bar. Bagno ampio, moderno e pulitissimo. A Londra, fino ad ora, il miglior Hotel visitato anche in rapporto al prezzo proposto. Metro Barbican a poco più di 5 minuti a piedi, stazione sulla Circle Line. St. Paul a 15 minuti a piedi, Tate Modern a 20 minuti, Tower of Londan 25 minuti. Comodissimo per vivere la zona passeggiando per le vie di Londra. Consigliatissimo!!!",5,2016,03,29
128,Ottimo albergo in contesto caratteristco,"L'albergo è ricavato in una struttura tipica londinese tutta a mattoni a vista recuperata finemente. 
Nota da non sottovalutare oltre l'eleganza della location la massima disponibilità del personale in particolare la reception composta in parte da personale di origine italiana preparato e gentile. 
La camera ci è stata assegnata con largo anticipo utile per chi arriva la mattina presto e vuole sfruttare subito la giornata.
Comodo per la metro in poco più di dieci minuti si arriva a piede al tower bridge.
La stazione Moorgate della metro l'ho trovata più comoda e veloce da raggiungere c'è pure una scorciatoia in mezzo ai grattacieli che permette di fare prima. Vicini ci sono pub ristoranti e bar.
La linea della metro è la gialla (Circle ) con questa si raggiungono i maggiori siti di interesse. 
Linea autobus 15 comoda per costeggiare il fiume .
Camere con ogni comfort asciugacapelli asse da stiro ferro tv con porta usb hdmi ecc frigo bar ecc ecc . Per lavoro e per vacanza è più chw adatto.
Hall non molto grande.
Consiglio. ",4,2016,03,27
128,Sehr schönes Hotel mit mittelmässigem Service,"Wir waren zum ersten Mal in diesem Hotel und sind auf Grund des Preises darauf aufmerkam worden. Die Lage und das Hotel sind optimal. Auch die Infrastruktur und Sauberkeit sind gepflegt. Uns hat jedoch der Service und die Aufmerksamkeit der Mitarbeiter nicht überzeugt. Es hat an der Freundlichkeit, an der Freude und an der generellen Aufmerksamkeit gefehlt. Zudem muss man sich bewusst sein, dass in den Doppelzimmer die Betten nur 1.50 Meter in der Breite sind. Dies hat uns einen schlechten Schlafkomfort beschehrt, gemäss Mitarbeiter ist das aber Standard.
Wir sind der Meinung, dass man aus diesem Hotel mit aufmerksamen Mitarbeitern viel Potential ausschöpfen könnte.",3,2016,03,23
128,"Esperienza eccellente, vicino alla metro e ottimo servizio clienti","L'albergo si trova all'interno di una ex birreria, quindi è una struttura molto suggestiva.
Sin dall'ingresso si nota la massima attenzione al confort dei clienti. Siamo arrivati in una giornata fredda e alla reception siamo stati ricevuti con tovaglioli caldi per pulire e riscaldare le mani. 
Anche se arrivati con largo anticipo prima del orario del check in, in poco tempo hanno trovato sin da subito una stanza disponibile per noi.
Un ragazzo ci ha accompagnati fino alla stanza e spiegato l'utilizzo di ogni cosa. Da tenere presente, che essendo una struttura antica, ci sono alcuni pezzi da fare a piedi, anche se è facile raggiungere le stanze, visto la presenza degli ascensori.
Le stanze sono di grandezza media con un armadio, letto grande, tavolino e due poltrone. Il nostro bagno aveva la vasca da bagno, ma facilissimo a farsi la doccia, in quanto scendeva anche dal soffitto, ma anche come doccia normale. Bagno dotato di ogni confort e ogni prodotto che uno necessità.
Nella stanza presente anche il ferro da stiro, la tavola da stiro e prodotti per pulire le scarpe.
La posizione dell'albergo è ottima, vicino alla stazione di Liverpool Street, 8 minuti a piedi, per chi deve prendere Stansted Express
E' vicino anche ad altre due fermate di metro: Barbican e Moorgate.
Ovviamente essendo un albergo 5 stelle i prezzi sono da considerare come tali, ma spesso si trovano offerte, di cui noi abbiamo usufruito.
Lo consiglio assolutamente!!!!",5,2016,03,08
128,Un soggiorno meraviglioso,"Tutto davvero perfetto: ambiente elegante e accogliente, personale altamente professionale e cordiale, pulizia eccellente. Non è stato il mio primo viaggio a Londra, ma penso che in futuro sceglierò sempre questo hotel. Consigliatissimo!!!",5,2016,02,09
128,Carino ma migliorabile,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel a cavallo di Capodanno e prima di tutto devo dire che, trovandosi nella City, non c'è molto nei paraggi per chi si trova a Londra per turismo. Le fermate della metro sono comunque a 10 minuti di cammino. La struttura è affascinante perché l'albergo è ricavato da un vecchio birrificio, ma questo putroppo è anche un limite per la funzionalità degli spazi. Le camere Club sono piuttosto piccole e con letto alla francese, il bagno è comodo e ben organizzato; ci sono tutti gli ""accessori"" che ci si aspetta in un 5 stelle, ma la camera é illuminata davvero poco e male ed ha poco spazio per valigie e vestiti.La grande finestra , apribile di soli pochi centimetri, essendo di legno lascia passare molto il freddo. 
Il personale è tutto molto gentile e disponibile, l'albergo e le camere sono molto pulite ma non ci sono spazi comuni ampi e piacevoli mentre la prima colazione viene servita in un bar accanto all'hotel ( un po'scomodo perché è necessario uscire) dove  il personale è abbastanza scortese . 
A mio avviso, a parità di prezzo, si riesce a trovare qualcosa di più centrale e più adatto alle esigenze del turista.
",3,2016,01,06
128,Tolles Hotel mit kleinen Mankos,"Auf Empfehlung war ich auf Geschäftsreise für einen Kurzaufenthalt hier. Das Hotel ist wirklich stilvoll, alles ist neu und hochwertig. Ein Teil der Zimmer ist allerdings auf der anderen Straßenseite, in einem separaten Gebäude. Wenn man morgens kurz zum Frühstück möchte, kann das beim Londoner Wetter etwas lästig sein. Außerdem wollte ich die Klimaanlage abschalten (und habe auch um Rat gefragt, als das Brummen weiterging), das ging aber nicht und die Anlage machte weiter munter Geräusche. Ansonsten war das Zimmer toll: edle Materialien, ein sehr schönes Bad und ein wirklich bequemes Bett. Check-in und check-out waren recht langwierig, aber sonst war der Service nett.",4,2015,12,06
128,Excelente con un punto negativo,"El hotel es magnifico. El edificio es un antigua fábrica de cerveza pero está muy bien remodelado. Tiene bastante encanto. La decoración es fantastica.
El personal es 5 estrellas, muy simpaticos y agradables.
La localización es perfecta en mi opinión. Es una zona de negocios y por la noche es muy tranquila pero tiene varios bares y restaurantes justo al lado. Es cierto que no está en el centro turistico pero  la estación de metro de Moorgate está a 5 minutos andando y a partir de ahi, se puede ir a todas partes.
Internet gratis en todo el hotel y con muy buena conexión en las habitaciones.
Nuestra habitación estaba situada en el al sur, planta baja. Durante el dia, se puede acceder a através del pateo exterior por una puerta lateral pero durante la noche, (entre las 22 y las 6), la puerta se cierra y hay que ir por dentro del hotel. El camino es un poco complicado, hay que subir y volver a bajar y pasar por varios pasillos. No es muy pratico pero tampoco demasiado grave.
Me imagino que habrá varios tipos de tipos de habtiaciones pero la nuestra era algo pequeña aunque muy completa. Nada de negativo a apuntar.

El punto verdaderamente negativo y que considero no ser digno de un hotel de 5 estrellas es que la ventana da para una zona donde pasan los conductos de aire acondicionado que están literalmente pegados a la ventana. Además de ser imposible ver la luz del dia, el ruido es continuo y a nivel estetico deja mucho que desear. Lo intentan disfrazar con plasticos negros cubriendo los conductos y con cristales con espejos pero realmente, es algo que merece una referencia negativa. En las fotos que adjunto, se puede ver las ""no vistas"" de la habitación.

De todos modos, no dudo en recomendar el hotel por su servicio, staff y localización y lo tendré en cuenta en proximas visitas a Londres. Eso si, intentaré quedar en una habitación con otro tipo de vistas....",4,2015,11,23
128,top,"De fin de semana tiene unas ofertas espectaculares, por 144 libras un lujazo de Hotel en el centro del mundo. No le falta nada. Si falta algo lo pides y en 1 minuto lo tienes, habitaciones de lujo y personal muy atento.",5,2015,10,24
128,Normal,"En todo moemento la atencón del personal fue excelente. Uno de los mejores que he visitado sin duda, y no se si el mejor de Londres. La ubicación es normal  pero lo mas impactante es la decoracion del lugar",5,2015,09,30
128,Un excelente hotel con excelentes personas atendiendolo,"En todo momento, el personal desde Fernando (quien atiende el desayuno) hasta Alicia y otras chicas que no recuerdo el nombre (atienden lantecepcion) y elnresto drl personal están a tu disposición. El servicio fue excelente. La calidad del wifi también. YO VUELVO A VENIR",5,2015,09,29
128,Hotel di classe,"Albergo in edificio storico situato nella City. Nel week end la zona è molto tranquilla, si anima dal lunedì mattina. la camera standard non è particolarmente grande ma completa di tutto il necessario per rendere più gradevole il soggiorno (accappatoio, ciabatte, phon professionale, bollitore con tisane caffè cioccolata, prodotti di qualità per il bagno, frutta fresca, set per il cucito). Personale molto gentile e professionale. Non abbiamo fatto colazione in albergo. La camera con vista sull'interno è molto silenziosa.",4,2015,09,18
128,Un poco de todo: ventajas y desventajas,"El hotel está en un sitio perfecto para visitar un Londres no tan típico no tan turístico... El local que ocupa es fantástico: una antigua ""brewery"" recuperada de modo fantástico. Al lado del famoso restaurante The Brewery, donde se celebran bodas los fines de semana: digno de ver.  La verdad es que es un sitio muy recomendable para parejas jóvenes o viajeros sin niños pequeños, pues es una zona que pide a gritos salidas nocturnas. 
Ventajas: Además de estar la Catedral cerca, el Barbican, la muralla romana y, sobre todo, el Museo de Londres al ladito. En la puerta del hotel una parada de autobús; a un breve paseo, el metro de Barbican. Por cierto, que el Barbican es una maravilla. En fin, el hotel. Pequeño (eso no me molesta en absoluto). Las habitaciones un poco más grandes que las del The Montcalm del Marble Arch y con el encanto de los techos de la antigua fábrica. Sin embargo, he de decir que la cama me resultó muy incómoda y las almohadas, fatales. Y se echaba de menos un poco más de limpieza. La wifi de la habitación, muy mala. Por lo demás, el personal de conserjería fue muy amable y de gran ayuda en todo momento. 
Algo que no me gustó nada: la cola para hacer el check out (una mujer se quejó de llevar 20 minutos esperando). Una sugerencia: Los clientes que dejan el hotel pero no tienen prisa, podrían dejar tan solo la llave y el equipaje y no tener que esperar y hacer esperar a los demás.",4,2015,09,08
128,simone,"Ottimo soggiorno, comfortevole sotto ogni punto di vista. Camera standard di alto livello, personale sempre disponibile (anche in lingua italiana, ambienti curatissimi e raffinati, situato nella city (zona da londinesi e non da turisti) e a 5 min dalla metro e 10 da liverpool street station, ogni comodità nelle vicinanze.  Consigliato",5,2015,08,26
128,Classe e cortesia nel cuore della City,"Un albergo da ricordare per le sue particolari caratteristiche: ricavato con sapienza e gusto nei locali di un antico birrificio, si distingue per classe, charme e accoglienza da psrte del personale gentilissimo. Prenotato con Booking è risultato particolarmente conveniente per la tariffa applicata ad agosto, nei giorni in cui la City è parzialmente in vacanza. Delle due stanze prenotate quella dei ragazzi forse un pó troppo piccola, anche se confortevole e iperaccessoriata... Letto molto comodo ma formato Queen: due adulti normopeso e mediamente alti rimangono un pó sacrificati... La camera provvista di un bel bagno con finestra, dotato di ogni confort. Le stanze silenziose e pulitissime. Nella hall splendidi mazzi di fiori ornano un'ambientazione di grande effetto. Il personale si è reso utile simpaticamente e cordialmente per ogni nostra necessità. Davvero un piacevole soggiorno!!!
P.s. Perché nel 2015 in un bagno cosí bello mancano ancora il bidet e lo scopino del wc?!?!?",5,2015,08,16
128,Ottimo hotel nella city,"Ho soggiornato per due notti in questo albergo per un viaggio di lavoro. Camere molto curate (ho dormito in una Club Double Room spaziosa e accogliente), servizio professionale e personale molto cortese. Materasso molto morbido. Davvero consigliato. ",5,2015,08,03
128,Hotel lussuoso ma non turistico,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo per una settimana nel mese di luglio.
Sicuramente il livello del servizio offerto è eccellente, il personale alla reception è gentilissimo e molto disponibile e l'ambiente è molto elegante. Tuttavia per la sua posizione lo ritengo più adatto ad una clientela che viaggia per affari e non turismo Le stazioni della metropolitana  sono a pochi minuti di distanza a piedi, ed è comunque facile raggiungere tutte le zone di Londra, ma nei dintorni dell'albergo ci sono pochi negozi o ristoranti e quindi è sempre necessario spostarsi in zone più turistiche. Noi abbiamo usufruito della formula bed and breakfast e per quanto riguarda la colazione non l'ho trovata a livello di un albero a 5 stelle. Il buffet comprende una scelta di cibi dolci e salati ma la varietà è piuttosto ristretta e non comprende pietanze tipiche come il porridge. La nostra camera (club room) era molto confortevole e ricca di accessori moderni, ma piuttosto piccola e la sola vista dalla finestra era un grattacielo di uffici.
In conclusione credo che considerando quanto costa soggiornare in questo albergo, a chi viaggia per turismo convenga forse scegliere un'altra struttura.",3,2015,08,01
128,Sehr gepflegtes Hotel in historischer Umgebung,"Große Zimmer und für englische Verhältnisse sehr guter Service. Bei den alten Gebäuden ist es etwas schwierig, sich zurechtzufinden, aber es gibt beim einchecken einen guten Lageplan. Nach meiner Erfahrung sehr gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis, besonders für London. Tube Station in Laufentfernung, mehr brauch man in London nicht.",5,2015,07,27
128,Super Stadthotel mit kleinen Schönheitsfehlern,"+ Supernettes, freundliches Personal an der Rezeption und im Restaurant.
+ Zimmer: Größe okay für einen Stadttrip, da man sich eh nur zum schlafen dort aufhält. Sauberkeit gut, sehr gute Betten, sehr gute Bettwäsche und sehr gute Handtücher. Wasserkocher, Tee, Kaffee und leckere Snacks sind vorhanden.
+ Lage: 10 Minuten zur St. Pauls Cathedral, 5 Minuten zur nächsten Underground Station.
+ Pub super!!!
- Leider sind die Fenster nicht zu öffnen.
- Im Bad fehlte eine WC Bürste.
Gehbehinderten Menschen kann das Hotel nicht empfohlen werden, da doch einige Treppen zu nehmen sind.
Gerne beim nächsten London Trip wieder.",4,2015,07,19

Camere (la nostra era una Montcalm Club) ampie e ben accessoriate, con letti confortevoli e bagni moderni e funzionali. Eccellente il buffet della colazione presso il caratteristico pub Jagged Hare, dove abbiamo gustato anche ottime cene. Tutto lo staff è estremamente gentile e preparato. L'hotel è situato in posizione tranquilla, nel cuore della City, a poche centinaia di metri dalla stazione di Liverpool Street.

Das Concierge Team war besonders aufmerksam und hat im Alleingang dafür gesorgt, dass ich höchstwahrscheinlich wiederkommen werde.",4,2015,04,28
128,Eccellente è dir poco,"L'albergo si trova in un quartiere tranquillo ma vicinissimo alla stazione di Liverpool street e a quella di moorgate. Noi siamo arrivati di sera verso mezzanotte con lo stansted express è abbiamo raggiunto l'albergo facilmente a piedi. La struttura è  bellissima un ottimo connubio tra classico e moderno. Il personale è professionale,gentilissimo e pronto a soddisfare ogni richiesta. Un grazie speciale va a Gregorio che non solo parla un ottimo italiano ma con simpatia e dolcezza ci ha accolti appena arrivati. Le stanze sono bellissime dotate di ogni confort, ci si sente costantemente coccolati e soprattutto la pulizia è impeccabile. Non solo consiglio questo hotel ma spero di ritornarci presto ",5,2015,04,27
128,Veramente bellissimo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo che nonostante sia un poco fuori mano ,è veramente bello bello.

In compenso il personale era gentilissimo e molto disponibile (ci ha cambiato due camere, essendo la prima troppo piccola e la seconda rumorosa).

128,Bellissimo!,"Sono stata in questo Hotel diverse volte e mi sono sempre trovata benissimo.. è uno dei miei preferiti in assoluto!
Già dall'ingresso si nota che ci sono degli elementi della struttura mantenuti dall'edificio originale del 17esimo secolo. Si entra subito in un ambiente chic e ben curato, con una fontana a muro, poltrone in stile classico, dipinti di gentlemen inglesi.
Il personale è molto gentile fin dall'ingresso, alla reception sono molto professionali e cortesi, così come gli addetti alle valige.
Le camere sono piccoline, ma ben dotate di ogni comfort, essendo nuove (aperto nel 2011).
Il bagno mi piace molto: piccolo ma molto accogliente, e ci sono tutti i prodotti che per brevi soggiorni si può evitare di portarsi da casa.
In ogni stanza c'è una docking station per iPhone, una TV lcd con possibilità di collegarvi il portatile, frutta fresca, acqua, bollitore con bustine di tè e caffè.
Il phon è disponibile, così come una busta per le scarpe, il lucido monouso, e un kit cucito da riparazione.
