106,Such a welcoming hotel..,"My partner and I went to The Landmark London for his birthday lunch, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. We didn’t have a booking, but that wasn’t an issue at all — the staff were so accommodating and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. 
At the champagne bar, Aarshia greeted us warmly and gave us the best table with a fantastic view. She was incredibly helpful, recommending halal options from the menu, which we happily went with. The drinks were spot-on, and the club sandwich and halloumi wrap were delicious. For dessert, Aarshia suggested the crème brûlée and sticky toffee pudding, which were both amazing.
To make the day even more special, Aarshia surprised us with a personalized birthday cake for my partner. It was such a thoughtful touch and really added to the celebration. Her and Levant checked in on us throughout the meal, making sure we were comfortable and taken care of.
Overall, the beautiful setting, delicious food, and exceptional service made for a truly memorable birthday lunch. We’ll definitely be coming back!",5,2024,10,17
106,"Must stay here, or at least visit for high tea.","Such an amazing hotel.  The rooms are large and luxurious, the food is outstanding, the service is impeccable, and all of the staff are pleasant and helpful. This is an old historic hotel that has been redone to be bright, warm and welcoming. All of this wonderfulness does come at a hefty price, but they helped us out in a time of need, and provided everything we could hope for. The rooms are quiet, we had a large family staying next door and never heard them. This hotel is an experience worth the price.",5,2024,10,16
106,Sunday afternoon tea in London at the Landmark. Perfect,"Due to train delays and cancellations from the Midlands we hoped The Landmark might help us get our day back on track by moving our booking time for afternoon tea.  We stepped out of the station and were so happy to see the hotel was right in front of us and they accommodated us straight away.  First tick in the box for great customer service.  
The venue is stunning and we were awestruck with the splendour of the hotel and where we were seated.  Beautiful ambience created by the pianist who smoothly segue wayed into Happy Birthday every time a pastry with a candle in it was brought out. 
The attention to detail, the unlimited sandwiches, the stunning sweet items, the gorgeous decor were all topped off by Roshans fabulous service.  He was second to none.  Flitting smoothly from table to table and spotting the second anything needed topping up from glass to cup to sandwiches.  Perfect.  
I highly recommend this as a top end afternoon tea in London on a Sunday afternoon with your daughter to make you feel like you have enjoyed a beautiful moment in your lives together.  
We took lots of lovely photos around the hotel and the only 2 criticisms I have to pass on to the Landmark which I am doing to give my honest feedback did not detract from our visit at all but when we compare with the many other afternoon teas we have attended they were notable to us. 
1. We entered from the entrance closest to the train station with no one at the door so we walked in tired and hungry and looking to find where we wanted to go.  It wasn’t easy as the hotel is huge and there are lots of rooms to navigate before you get to the right part.  We did look a little confused at times and multiple members of staff(unsure of their roles) walked past us and offered no smiles or greetings or assistance.  That was disappointing but made up for by the service we got once we arrived at the afternoon tea reception desk.  However we have never experienced such a lack of eye contact and general pleasantry upon entering such a prestigious establishment. 
2.  The glasses that our bottle of champagne were served in were really not a high end experience. Very cheap fizzy wine glasses rather than what you would expect for a £90 bottle of champagne.  But again although a noted criticism it did not take away from the wonderful experience we enjoyed.",5,2024,10,16
106,SENSATIONAL,"Good afternoon, 
 
I would like to express my extreme appreciation. 
 
I attended the Landmark “Winter Garden” experience on Saturday the 2nd October and it was sensational. 
 
Upon arrival I was warmly greeted by the staff members and escorted to my seat. 
I was almost hypnotised by the interior design and the pianist playing. 
 
Not to mention that whilst having an indulgent afternoon tea, me and my friend managed to witness a bride at the venue. 

I met with the manager Zoltan in person and he took me on a private tour around the hotel and I experienced the Champagne bar, he took the time to briefly explain the history of the luxurious venue and its magnitude. 
 
I would also like to make reference to the friendliest waitresses …
 
ROSHAN,

AARSHIA.
 
I look forward to featuring “The Landmark” in the December issue for the Richmond and Barnes magazine 2024. 
I hope to arrange this with Rosina, the Marketing Manager. 
 
Warm regards, Rossana Silva.

106,Unmatched afternoon tea,This is certainly not our first time visiting as the service and food is fantastic every time. This time we were served by Anca who was very welcoming and accommodating for our dietary requirements. Her shift ended during our visit but her handover to Anth was brilliant. Anth’s service and hospitality matched Anca’s. Thank you to both and also thank you to the rest of the team (including those in the kitchen!) for making it yet another lovely experience.,5,2024,10,13
106,Excellent experience!,"It was an amazing experience we loved it.

A quality experience.",5,2024,10,08
106,Service excellent from Anth,"We had Afternoon Tea and our waiter was Anth. He made our experience all the better with his excellent manners, attention to detail and nothing being too much trouble. Exactly what you would expect attending an establishment like The Landmark. The exemplary service provided by Anth means we will be definitely going back to the Landmark.",5,2024,10,07
106,Afternoon tea at the Landmark Hotel,"We had afternoon tea in The Winter Garden and would highly recommend it. The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive. Nothing was too much for them. The sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious. The sandwiches and tea pots were generously replenished. My friends and I have tried a lot of places for afternoon tea, and we rated the Landmark as one of, if not the best. Thank you very much to Roolica, Janet and Dior for looking after us so well.",5,2024,10,06
106,Disappointing Experience ,"My friend and I , visited The Landmark hotel for afternoon tea , and our expectations were quite high , due to the fact that the pastry chefs were Bake Off The Professionals winners .
The staff were polite and courteous  , but seemed a bit disorganised  , and some appeared inexperienced  . 
The afternoon tea did look really nice  , but unfortunately the bread on the sandwiches was a little stale , I suppose I should have complained at the time , but my friend was paying and I didn't want to make a fuss  .
The sandwich fillings were nice .
The desserts and scones were also nice . 
We were offered refills of drinks and sandwiches  . 
The surroundings were nice , and the hotel was clean .
Unfortunately I would not go back there again  .",3,2024,10,06
106,Amazing afternoon tea,Excellent and dedicated service from Roshan and Ahmed during our afternoon tea. Amazing setting and the selection of sandwiches and pastries was elegantly presented and delicious. My favourite was the truffle egg sandwich. Will definitely be coming back.,5,2024,10,06
106,Afternoon Tea,"We had an afternoon tea at the palms and everything was amazing! We booked and forgot to mention we had a dairy tolerance however Mihai our waiter was in charge and took care of us. 
Excellent service and will definitely be back in the furure for other occasions.",5,2024,10,06
106,Fantastic Stay!!!,"Wow what an experience we had at the Landmark!  The room was quant and the bed and pillows were absolutely comfortable.  The bathroom had all the amenities you would want.  We had a number of meals at there and had excellent service along with great tasting meals.  The bar is fun as well!

The location is literally across the back street from the Marlybone station which was nice!!  So easy to use the Tube and I found the Bellman at the back entrance incredibly helpful as well (I am so sad I forgot his name, but a sweetheart).  

Overall when we come back to London we will stay at the Landmark for sure!!!",5,2024,10,06
106,Anniversary stay at The Landmark London,"Absolutely stunning hotel! Great selection of restaurants & the breakfast was fabulous. Every single staff member was helpful & friendly, particularly loved Rupert at front of house! It’s a definite must stay if you’re looking for a hotel in London.",5,2024,10,06
106,Great service and food,"The breakfast buffet here is nothing short of  amazing with it’s atmosphere and food. Every dish was made to perfection, with its fresh ingredients. However apart from that, what truly made it special was the service here. Rodica and Ria were superbly helpful and friendly. Their professionalism truly is the definition of good service and I personally would recommend anyone and everyone to come here for their fantastic breakfast buffet.",5,2024,10,06
106,First class Afternoon tea,The service I got today from Waiters Roshan and Ahmed was exceptional and first class. Myself and my guest were   treated with really good customer service and hospitality.  The afternoon tea  sandwiches and cakes were fresh and delicious. We had an amazing time here today everything was just perfect.,5,2024,10,05
106,Ok but it didn’t have that stand out factor,"We have visited many London Hotels for afternoon tea so we were looking forward to seeing how The Landmark rated.
The ambiance of the hotel was very good and the restaurant was amazing with lots of natural light and a pianist playing.
We were kept waiting at reception while the staff member went to speak to a manager but finally were shown to our seats. We had to hang our coats on the back of the chair which is very poor for a 5* hotel which is expected to offer cloakroom services.
We eventually received our champagne in quite small glasses. But had to wait for sandwiches and tea. The sandwiches were very fresh although the fillings were unexciting. We were offered extra sandwiches but by that time we were well into the freshly baked scones . The cakes looked better than they tasted and my son did receive a beautifully presented birthday treat. We weren’t offered further pots of tea and by the time we finished it was all very stewed. It was a shame that the service was slow as it wasn’t what we expected from that class of hotel where staff are usually attentive.
Would I return ? Probably not as there are hotels in London that offer a far better service for the same price.",3,2024,10,05
106,Afternoon Tea,"Went with a friend as a graduation treat and it was good! The service was impeccable, in particular Eufelia who took such great care of us! The sweet treats could have been better but the sandwiches and teas were great. A bit on the spent side but if you’re in the area and wanting to try it, would recommend. The interior alone is stunning and enough to draw you in.",4,2024,10,05
106,Great staff,"Beautiful hotel and beautiful room.  We stayed for two nights.   We also had afternoon tea here in the winter garden .   It was excellent and so was our server, Roshan, who did a great job, explained everything and was very attentive throughout.  Thank you",5,2024,10,05

This was the fourth time of staying in the hotel and it more than lived up to our expectations.   We dined in the restaurant both nights and Angelo our waiter was excellent.  He was very friendly and attentive, he looked after us extremely well and we couldn't have asked for a nicer person to serve us.  It was a pleasure to meet him and we hope to see him again the next time we stay in the hotel.

We had the Pampering Package again with 2 Aromatherapy massages which were incredible along with the very calming spa.

But the biggest and most magnificent surprise was our upgrade to the most unbelievable suite which blew our minds and were so touched by this beautiful gesture!

We cannot thank you all enough for arranging this for us - it was well beyond our expectations and jaw dropping.

Thank you very much to Malisa Shepherd, Hazel (who I believe checked us in and out!) she was lovely and very courteous!

Also Francis for trying to help us with working the heating controls and the entire staff at the hotel.

Breakfast was just as amazing as last time with lovely staff and service.

We can’t wait to return yet again all being well.

PS - We thought it was important to note that the shower pressure was not very strong (possibly we could not work the shower fully) but thought it was worth raising for your team to check.

All the best to you all.",5,2024,09,29

The setting was absolutely beautiful and we had a perfectly laid out private area just off the bright and airy main atrium. 
The pianist kindly played Happy Birthday on arrival of our guest of honour and then we all sat down to enjoy the spread of visual and culinary treats which appeared one after the other, until the table was brimful with enticing sights: Beautifully presented finger sandwiches, delicate dessert cakes and candied scones accompanied by a variety of toppings, every mouthful an absolute delight.
The staff were extremely considerate helpful and attentive throughout - our teacups were constantly refreshed and never empty. Delicious teas chosen from a wide ranging selection.

106,The Landmark’s service standards have fallen too low for this hotel to be called the Landmark.,"To me the name - Landmark should speak for itself. Landmark used to be my primary destination of choice for both lunch dinners with family and business meetings. Service used to be top notch, but not anymore. My last visit was a total embarrassment and a disaster for the hotel. 

I came to have some tea and coffee with my family, we ordered several teas and cakes, and when I asked for an extra tea cup the waitress in the main restaurant who’s name was “Happy” said that it was the hotel’s policy to not allow guests to have extra cups and share teas. “one tea pot - one cup”.

At that point I requested that the staff actually show me an SOP or any kind of document confirming such a policy, at this stage obviously the restaurant manager completely reversed, said it was Happy’s mistake and they are going to make it up to me by taking off the service charge from my bill.

What an embarrassment to the Landmark and hospitality industry. I paid the bill and insisted they keep the service charge on my bill. I hope one day they will learn that they are in the business of hospitality and that is not how you treat a loyal customer of 20 years and not how you remedy and resolve a customer complaint.

“We have taken off service charge from your bill” - what a joke. Keep it!",1,2024,09,23

Perfect location, 5 mins to Baker Street station on straight main road and Marylebone Station on the doorstep. 
The service was impeccable.
  Pre arrival Ria was so helpful. 
The wonderful Avani checked us in and our Atrium room was ready when we arrived at noon!
The real star was  Rodika who served us at breakfast in the Winter Garden Atrium. The breakfast buffet itself provided so much choice and with it open until 11am you don’t feel rushed.
The room had everything we needed and the hotel generously gave us a celebration bottle of wine and cake. 
Thanks also to Vlad, Eustace and Orlando at the door who always gave us a warm welcome.
If that was one thing that I feel could have been better, it was the service in the Spa.
We did go down Sunday evening for a short swim and I wanted to book a massage for the morning but there was nobody at the reception. I could hear voices in the office behind but even though they were aware that we were waiting, nobody made an effort to come and speak to us.
This in itself will not stop me from staying at this hotel again it is merely some constructive feedback.",5,2024,09,08

106,Three Cheers for Grand Central Pub and Lilly,"Grand Central Pub inside the Landmark Hotel in London has the excellent vibe that takes one back to days of old, and it rightly does so with the rich history and gorgeous wood furnishings that harken back to days gone bye. 
Service was phenomenal with many team members who work and love their job. I have a carrot allergy and the team at Grand Central bent over backwards to meet my needs. 
A server most notably is named Lilly. She was fantastic and served all of our requests. Three cheers for Lilly. Be sure to request  her. You won’t regret her attention to detail.",5,2024,08,24

106,Great family room,"We chose the hotel as its location, right next to Marylebone station, was perfect for getting to see Taylor Swift at Wembley.  The room was great for a family - with 2 twin queen beds and a sitting area -  and much larger than usual London hotel rooms, although the nightly rate was very expensive. The breakfast, in the beautiful Winter Garden, was excellent. Service all round was also excellent; friendly and not stuffy, as often can be the case with 5* hotels.",4,2024,08,24
106,Great location and hotel but service needs to be improved,"We have stayed at the Landmark on 4 separate occasions and spent a week each time there during our stay.  The spacious rooms and bathrooms is what attracts us to keep coming back.  We also had connecting rooms and a family room when travelling with kids. 

The location in Marylebone is also central especially if u want to take the train from Marylebone station to Bicester shopping outlets etc.  A short walk from Baker street with lots of food options and a bit more gets you to Selfridges and Marylebone high street.  The breakfast at the hotel is pretty decent.  Bed is comfortable (a bit soft for some) and if you get the atrium facing rooms the view overlooking the atrium is very nice.  The concierge is excellent and has in many occasions helped us sort out tickets and reservations.  They are very experienced and a joy to chat with. 

The only drawback of the hotel is the service staff at the reception, always cold and not welcoming at all.  Somehow they missed their training day and forgot what good customer service looks like.   I have stayed there so many times and got checked in by the same person but she still looks at me like she’s never seen me in her life nor acknowledged the fact based on my profile that I have stayed there for weeks on end.  

Nevertheless still a good place to stay if you can get a good deal via the hotel website. However if the price hikes during peak season I will much prefer to stay somewhere else.",4,2024,08,24
106,Exceptional ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"We had a spa day at the Landmark

106,I highly recommend the place and we will definitely turn back again.,"We had a great first experience in the Winter Garden, where we celebrated my birthday during weekday evening hours.
The place, the interior architecture is magical, the atmosphere was pleasant and peaceful. It felt like we were on holiday. 
The staff is kind, tactful and attentive, the service is excellent, the dinner menu was enriched with special and delicious flavors, including the appetizer, main course and dessert.

106,Luxury! With a few wrinkles,"My 2nd stay at the landmark and happy to say its still as great as ever. Location is terrific, in the heart of London and walking distance from the usual spots (Oxford St, Marble Arch, ....). 

I love how even the regular rooms are very spacious, especially when compared with other hotels in London! I had the regular room and it was spacious and had a big bathroom. 
Service and staff are phenomenal: friendly, happy to help, quick, knowledgable. 
Breakfast area is beautiful. Huge naturally lit atrium with piano music (sometimes played LIVE by a performer). 

My small negative feedback which i hope they fix in the future: AC was very warm (it was 33 degrees celsius outside and my room was .. warm). Maintenance staff looked it over and apparently that was the max capacity of the AC. Ugh. Other thing was the toilet flush. It was old and would not always efficiently flush the toilet. The Wi-Fi was very erratic, it would sometimes perform well, and a lot of times it would glitch and cut out and/or become really slow. 

All in all, had a comfy and sound stay at the Landmark!",4,2024,08,22
106,The Landmark London….Exceptional,"Exceptional hotel in so many ways, from the beautiful interior to the wonderful service, accommodations, attention to detail, and outstanding food.

The hotel was well situated in the charming marylebone neighborhood, across the street from the underground and blocks away from excellent restaurants and shops. The concierge was knowledgeable and helpful.",5,2024,08,21

The staff were so attentive and kind.  Rupert on the door greats you with a warm welcome, and looked after us thoughtfully throughout our stay.  The hotel accommodation is impeccable. Beautiful room and bathroom.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was stellar.  The restaurants have good options for families and the food was delicious.  The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing London, removed from the busyness of city centre, nestled in St John’s Wood, Marylebone areas.  Trust me your googling and searching is over. We have stayed twice with our family, and will return anytime we are visiting London in the future. Thanks to the Landmark staff for another perfect stay🤩",5,2024,08,20

From the minute we stepped into the building, the kind and welcoming doorman made us smile and laugh. The decor, lighting and ambiance was exquisite. Staff at the front desk were friendly and very helpful, we were seated very quickly. John came and talked through the afternoon tea menu, we were very lucky as there was a women's tea week event going on, great presentation from the staff. Great selection of tea, sandwiches, scones, and delights. John reassured us about the halal menu and gave us some awesome recommendations for teas to try which paired really well with the food. Staff were very attentive and helpful. We took some lovely pictures under the beautiful palm trees, on the staircase and the balcony. The talented pianist played us a birthday song as requested. We received a complementary surprise birthday dessert with a candle which was very thoughtful. Overall we had the best time, would definitely recommend for special occasions.

106,Excellent hotel but watch what room you get,"This was our second time at the Landmark, the hotel is a real premium experience. Excellent breakfast, lovely rooms, friendly stuff, clean and well designed.
The only big issue was that we booked the Marylebone family studio and got instead the cheaper Executive family room.
When I asked the reception about that, she tried to persue me that what I got is the Marylebone studio and that they 'redefined the rooms categories'.
Our first time there was at the family room so I knew exactly what I got this time, it was the same room but for higher price.
The room wasn't the Marylebone studio: no atrium view, one tv and not two, no seperating wall...etc.
Finally the reception agreed with me and suggested we'll stay at the room for a 500£ refund. We preferred that on moving to another room after we already settled down.
We were very disappointed not to get the room we booked, the room we looked forward to stay in. 
Beware!!! The hotel sales to you the Marylebone studio but gives you the keys to the family room. This is a clear scam that shouldn't occur in such a place.
The lady at the reception should have offered the refund straight away and not waste my time trying to explain and lieing that the room is as booked.",3,2024,08,11
106,Afternoon Tea at Landmark hotel ,Everything was fine. Maybe the piano music was a little bit too much. But the sandwich service was excellent and attentive.

I demand a thorough investigation, including a review of security protocols and staff conduct. Any employees involved must be held accountable. I expect full reimbursement for the stolen items and compensation for the distress caused.

It has charm, history, wonderful decor, and excellent service. The rooms and service are first rate. The food and drink in the champagne bar and the Winter Garden excellent. Loves simply spending time there and soaking up the atmosphere. The location is great opposite the Marylebone station at five minutes to the Edgeware Road station at Baker Street station. Really excellent as well if you’re going to Wimbledon or love the Marylebone high Street area to the bus Uber and cab.

The rooms are very well appointed and large. We actually like the interior view of the sitting and eating areas where we still get lots of light. We love the afternoon and evening piano. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",5,2024,07,20
106,The 5 star Palms afternoon tea experience,"My wife and I had the pleasure of taking afternoon tea at the Palms in the Landmark hotel. It was first class, with the food matching the service. 

We had asked for a few food changes( such as plain scones)  which were accommodated and we were presented with some beautiful sandwiches, scones and cakes, all tasted delicious. 

I particularly enjoyed the Landmark hotel blend tea (should have asked to buy some!) copiously provided, and my wife’s fruit tea was equally delicious. Very nice to have accomplished pianists play during the tea as well. I think the service was exceptional and very attentive: they couldn’t do enough to help and provide for us. Lovely touch to provide a cake for our Ruby anniversary. 

Overall:  five stars -  I couldn’t fault anything! Better than the Savoy’s  (and we’ve had tea there in the past) We’ll be back!",5,2024,07,20

For my wife's birthday celebration we stayed at The Landmark. Following our viewing of Phantom of the Opera at His Majesty's Theatre on a Monday evening, we returned to the hotel at 10:50 p.m. — only to find The Mirror Bar closed (while the Winter Garden Restaurant at The Landmark London had closed at 10:30 p.m.)
Happy made a special effort during our birthday celebration, by pouring a glass of champagne for us to celebrate my wife's birthday at the Winter Garden Restaurant — and Happy worked later than usual. I believe such outstanding professional service should be recognized.",5,2024,07,15

106,A Pleasant Stay  (an American’s perspective),"As American parents traveling with three young children (ages 8, 6, and 2), we had a lovely stay at the Landmark London. We booked the studio room, which is one of the largest available at the hotel, and overall, it met our needs quite well.

The Positives:
- Polite Staff: The staff at the Landmark London were exceptionally polite and accommodating. Special kudos to the team during morning breakfasts—waitresses and hostesses were unbelievably friendly and welcoming, particularly to our children (special thank you’s to Elizabeta, Eufelia, Peachy, and Rodica).
- Great Location: The hotel’s location in Marylebone is superb. It's close to everything, including a bus stop, an underground tube station, and it's easily accessible by taxis. This made getting around London very convenient.
- Excellent Pub: The hotel's pub, Grand Central, was absolutely excellent. Despite its adult-oriented decor with wood paneling, it offers a children's menu. The fish and chips were amazing—the adult portion was as long as my arm, and even the children's size was ample for adults. This meal offered great value. Don't miss dining in the pub if you can.

Room Highlights:
- Spacious Room: Our studio room was large by London standards, with two double beds and a separate living area. However, note that the living room doesn't come with a bed; you need to order one at an extra cost (around $70).
  
Areas for Improvement:

- Room Layout: While the room was spacious, it lacked a door between the bedroom and the living room. This could be a concern for light sleepers, as there's no way to block out noise from the bedroom.
- Check-In Issues: We had a frustrating experience at check-in. Despite booking through a service (Leading Hotels) that included breakfast, the hotel had no record of it. This led to a 30-45 minute wait at the front desk while the staff consulted with management. This inefficiency was surprising and would likely be handled much more swiftly in the U.S.
- Family-Friendliness: Although Condé Nast Traveler recommended this hotel as family-friendly, we have mixed feelings. The ambiance is quite adult, and there are no visible children’s activities. While there are packages like a Sherlock Holmes tour available, these are quite pricey.",4,2024,07,14
106,Lovely afternoon tea,"We had a lovely afternoon tea at the landmark. Our servers were very attentive, in particular the manager Helmi was very hospitable. Lovely selection of teas, cakes and sandwiches. The interior was beautiful. We would love to be back some day!",5,2024,07,14
106,Unforgettable experience,At the Winter Garden the standards are like no where else. We were treated with special care from Mihai and Helmi during the dinner service.

106,Winter garden,I booked a table for my husbands birthday. Lovely food and our waiter mihai was very attentive and fantastic. The hotel was very beautiful. The decor was amazing.  as well as the calming music being played. We willdefinetely be back again in the future.,5,2024,07,13
106,Afternoon tea with a touch,We went as a group of eight for afternoon tea for my cousins 40th birthday.  Our host Rodica was very attentive and was able to deal with our group size with ease and a smile.  She made the experience extra special for us all even through our multiple top up requests for sandwiches and tea/coffee.  Nothing was too much an ask!  Helmi was also super helpful and attentive.  All in all a great experience 🤍. We will be back!,5,2024,07,13
106,Best high tea experience,"Helmi, the manager, gave us an absolutely delightful welcome and has definitely made our trip so memorable! Thank you so much for making the great performance happen! The high tea service is also remarkable. Definitely recommend to book an experience here.",5,2024,07,12
106,There is only one way to stay in London properly: The Landmark!,"The Landmark is hands down my favorite hotel - all around the world!
Located in the heart of Marylebone, it represents a reference of style, elegance, class and distinction thanks to the professionalism of the staff; the breath-taking architecture; the 125 years of history and experience; and the utter comfort it dedicates to guests.

Hall and Concierge services are efficient and caring - how best to be welcomed than in the iconic Champagne Bar?
Rooms are unique blend of Victorian tradition and modern facilities - the mansarda experience of the sixth floor is just legendary!

Every morning with my family we enjoyed the luxurious breakfast on the ground floor, cuddled by the stunning tall palm trees stretching just below the glass ceiling.

There's no other stay for us in London - than The Landmark!",5,2024,07,12
106,Terrible hotel practice: Late night earthquake-worthy pounding music from Ballroom,"Our family was there for 3 nights and two rooms.  One room was a 1st floor Marylebone suite, situated unknown to us, over a ballroom.  We checked in to the room and was immediately greeted by loud vibrating sounds (music) that shook the room.  We erroneously thought it was from the building construction site across the street. WRONG. The loud noise was coming from inside/downstairs and went on and off for an hour before we called the front desk for info.  Response - just DJ testing sounds for mood music and won't be that loud later.  Skeptical yet trusting them, we went to dinner and came back later to non-stop booming music which was shaking the room so we called front desk - spoke to an apologetic manager, JiJi , and asked for a move.  NO rooms available till tomorrow.  Reassured us they would ask the ballroom people to lower noise.  Never lowered.  The event ended at around 11PM but we were tired from flying into London so it was a bad way to start.  Next day, they moved us to 4th floor above ballroom but we figured we were safe. No event on Friday so no problem and slept well.  But on Saturday, during the evening we could still feel slight vibrations and hear the music from the ballroom.  Bad news, there were two events and they both were running to 1AM!!!!!  Unbelievably, how can we be on the 4th floor and still hear and feel the music from the grandballroom???  We must be 30 plus feet or 12 meters above the and separated by a few ceilings from the ballroom!!!  JiJi said it was the poor sound insulation which they were working on.  We asked for a discount and they would only give us one night credit which cannot make up for ruining our time in London and marring our special vacation.  The hotel should not in good conscience rent out rooms above the ballroom when events are on.  for a 5 star hotel to charge over 1,000 GBP and mistreat us customers isn't acceptable. The hotel is wrong and unethical to rent out rooms above the hotel when events are on so they don't leave the rooms empty and make some money even if they have to give some credit to unhappy clients!! Shame on you for doing this!!!   Also the fumes from the cleaning chemicals they use to clean the hotel are so strong.  Maybe to mask all cigarette/cigar smells?",2,2024,07,11
106,Great experience !,We had a great time at The Landmark London. The venue was magical and the food was excellent. Mihai was looking after us and made the experience even more enjoyable. We would highly recommend this experience for anyone wanting to celebrate a special occasion.,5,2024,07,11

106,The landmark london,"Visiting london for the AC/DC concert, I’ve been a few times to london but not that many times where I know my way around, found the landsmark london by accident as was only across the road watching the football. Was greeted at the entrance of the hotel by a very polite gentleman (didn’t manage to get his name) he asked us if we had hotel reservations but even though we didn’t he showed us such care and kindness. But my gosh don’t I wish we did have reservations and was staying at the hotel! it’s amazing and stunning my gosh! Felt like the queen even if it was just using the toilets! We had a very amazing waitress who waited on us with such kindness and grace. Her name was Rafaela She was incredible seriously! We never had to wait to be served by her it’s like she had a six sense and she knew what we wanted before we knew ourselves what she wanted, She was like the guru of waiting service! and elle parle bien français aussi! But my gosh the food! It was like an explosion of flavour one mouthful after the next, the only regret I had was to not order 10 mains! And 10 sticky toffee puddings OH MON DIEU! I would definitely go back again in a heartbeat if not for the food and the all the kind staff (Mihai) but just to hear the lovely man playing the piano so beautifully. 40/10! et bravo!",5,2024,07,06

Beautiful setting with attentive service
Staff all faultless and showed enthusiasm for their work place/service and we were very well looked after by Angelo
As we have some dietary requirements, which were fulfilled completely , the service took a little longer than they thought was acceptable and therefore decided to give us another glass of champagne each at no charge
I did put on my booking that it was a special occasion and once the staff had ascertained what the occasion was they  gave my daughter a separate cake that she took away with her in a smart bag
The tea we had (earl grey) was lovely and all aspects of the experience were faultless in my opinion

106,Great Visit to a Great Hotel,"Regularly stay at the landmark, last time was for the Chelsea flower show. 

Stayed for one night only this time 

Apart from a slow check in due to not enough staff and a busy surge. 

The stay was outstanding. The staff were attentive in May but there’s been a step up again. 

In particular the breakfast this morning was incredibly busy.  BUT. the team leader and his crew were sharp and all over it. The new layout of the food was good as well 

The landmark is 5 star in price and layout atrium rooms etc all good. 

But the staff have stepped up to make it even better. 

I particularly josif Elizabeth Suzanus and Jokids 

The room service was again extremely good as in delicious and worth the money 

A super stay 

Thank you",5,2024,06,22
106,One of the Greats!,"As an experienced hotel guest, I am drawn to the best and worst things about each hotel I visit.  By comparison, my wife travels less, and has a different view of things.
But as to the London Landmark, we definitely agree.

It is one of the very best hotels we have visited, anywhere, worldwide!  Having enjoyed many,many 5 star hotels and resorts, we do not come to such a conclusion lightly.

The physical plant of the Landmark is quite obviously extraordinarily beautiful...and spotlessly clean!  Both are important, and yet no hotel we have enjoyed exceeds the perfection of this hotel.

But it is the people at the truly spectacular morning buffets (Eufelia and many others); the willing energy of the concierge team; combined with the polite and willing service of the housekeeping staff, that really make this hotel experience much better than most comparably rated facilities.

Now, to be completely fair and balanced, when things are super busy and too many people are seeking services, sometimes a short wait is required.  But when it is your turn, the staff gives you their undivided time and focus, which explains their inability to attend to big groups and every individual upon demand. 

In short, don't miss this gem!  London is always a preferred venue for our activities...knowing that the Landmark is there, just waiting to make our visit a pleasure at every level.",5,2024,06,22
106,Lovely service at afternoon tea,"Great service!!! We pretty enjoyed afternoon tea in their amazing winter palm room. After we left, I noticed I forgot the doggie bag and went back. Of course the bag was gone but Mr. Helmi helped a lot and organized his best for me to give me my doggie bag.
I would like to thank him for his best service ever!",5,2024,06,21

106,"Great food, slow service","Great food, venue and all round experience but the service was slow at times.  We were in no means in a rush but If you’re giving a wine menu, follow up with an order soon after rather than being chased.  If you’re giving the bill follow up with payment rather than being chased.",4,2024,06,20
106,Beautiful Historic Hotel with Incredible Breakfast and Staff,"My parents stayed at The Landmark London at the end of May, at which time I met them for breakfast and explore the historic hotel. 

The breakfast selection was very good, and the area in which you sit allows for stunning views of the famous Winter Garden, whilst accompanied by live music played on the Grand Piano. 

My parents where taken care of at all times during their stay and I would like to mention the specific effort of one member staff; Zalina, who went out of her way to make their stay as special and carefree as possible.  

The Landmark London encapsulates 19th century glamour with 21st century luxury and was an incredible experience for both my parents and I. 

Thank you.",5,2024,06,18
106,Five Stars Stay,"Amazing stay at the Luxorious hotel right in the center. It’s a great location with close proximity to major luxury shopping area on London.

106,Disappointing,Beautiful setting. I was a bit disappointed with my visit to the landmark. We stopped off for drinks while visiting London. It’s such a beautiful hotel but I didn’t feel the service reflected the space or the prices. The bar was relatively quiet when we were in. Very slow with no follow ups to check that everything is okay. I don’t think I would return or recommend the landmark when there are so many better options available.,2,2024,06,16
106,Shocking,Shocked to discover a young girl sleeping on a sofa in reception at 1.30 am because the secure wedding guest belongings room had allowed their bag to be taken/stolen without a ticket. Staff openly state they let anyone in there. No staff around to help the young couple,1,2024,06,16

106,The Landmark London - a must-stay,"Never having visited London or even England before, I was a little fearful of booking a room at The Landmark London since I wasn't even familiar with its neighborhood of Marylebone.  All my doubts were allayed when I entered the hotel's stately lobby.  Our suite was very comfortable and more beautiful than we imagined.  The hotel is meticulously maintained.

Apart from the beautiful ambiance, we need to highlight the service which was outstanding. We were offered second helpings and refilling of tea whenever we started to run out, we didn’t even have time to ask before a waiter came up helping us! We also need to highlight our server Anth. He was happy to give us his own recommendations for choice of tea (we ordered 4 teapots and they were all FANTASTIC!), always with a smile on his face. He also gave great suggestions for some activities in Stratford where we would spend our evening, resulting in a perfect night with both activities and nice bars for drinks.

106,A Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My wife and I enjoyed Afternoon at the Winter Garden in the Landmark Hotel and all I can say is wow.  
From the doorman through to the welcome from Emma to the service from Helmi, Alainah and Josiah, we were treated impeccably from start to finish. The whole team made us feel so special throughout our hour and a half there.  They catered to our every need and wouldn't let us lift a finger, nothing was too much.

When it came to the food I have not had sandwiches like it!  A delicate menu that tasted amazing, and refillable!  I would have been happy with just those for the afternoon, the egg mayonnaise and truffle particularly.  

The scones were wonderful along with the cream, jam and also pistachio cream.  I couldn't get to the other cakes as I was full from the sandwiches!  But the staff had let us know that we could take boxes home.  So home they came and were a wonderful end to a great day, I can see why the team won Bake Off.  

A decadent venue with plenty to see and a live piano player, it was fun to try and ""name that tune"".  

All in all an incredible afternoon  and although for us at the top end of our budget I would recommend to anyone who wants a taste of luxury.",5,2024,06,05

My beauty therapist, Alex, waited outside the changing rooms and escorted me to the treatment room. The rose facial was very enjoyable. He explained each step, showcased the products used, and ensured my comfort by adjusting the massage bed and room temperature to my liking.

Following the treatment, Alex informed me that I was free to use the other facilities and guided me to the Relaxation room. There, he poured me some tea, provided fresh fruit, and offered a towel to cover my legs, creating a perfect setting to unwind.

I then used the spa facilities, which were absolutely excellent. Everything was clean, well-maintained, and not busy.

106,Absolutely fabulous.,"There's so much to say, and all of it good 😂
My better half and I booked a table using their website, and we were treated with such kindness and professionality from the moment we got there.
Even though we were eager to try a bit of everything, we opted for some tender chicken breast and a house special reccomended by our server (I'll get to the staff later), followed by a ""Baked Alaska"" desert which we shared.
The food was out of this world and we have to compliment the kitchen as well, the aesthetics and presentation of meals (which don't seem as complex ) were 10/10.
Our finest compliments to Anth and Mario, amazing service worth noting.
Thank you for an amazing time.",5,2024,05,05

106,This Location and Hotel is fabulous,"The Landmark Hotel in London is fabulous.  It is walking distance to the tube, as well as good restaurants.  The service is excellent on so many levels.  First the concierge personnel are so very helpful.  Mandar assisted me with my plans and reservations before I arrived in London as well as after my arrival.  His helpful insight to the activities in the city and the special nuances of each activity allowed me to pack in several sites per day since we only had seven nights in the city.  Happy and Anca in the breakfast room brightened our mornings with a smile and excellent service.  We are grateful for all of the time in the spa and pool after a long day or walking and touring.  In case you are looking at this hotel for casual evenings, the hotel is strategically located to several nice neighborhood restaurants",5,2024,04,26
106,Rupert the Doorman is 5* !!,"My husband and I stayed for our anniversary and had a wonderful stay. The staff were attentive and a special treat organized in the room for the occasion.

106,Wonderful,Lovely stay for a birthday.  Staff were very helpful and accommodating.  The spa was a very nice way to spend a couple of hours in the morning. Beautiful hotel in a good location to walk around Regents Park and down to Oxford Street; there are also good public transport links.  The room was beautiful with comfortable beds. Overall everything we hoped it to be.,5,2024,04,19
106,Less than average for a 5 star rated hotel,"My overall stay fell short of average at the landmark having stayed at other leading hotels.  The family room was pretty with a nice view.  The beds however had very hard mattresses which hurt my back having spent two nights at the hotel. On the next day the room was not turned down having left for 4.5hours. It was not nice returning to a room like this.  There is a lack of service due to the hotel being understaffed with lengthy wait times at restaurants and bar.  The hotel doesn’t seem to cope with large bookings and lack accommodating hotel guests over outside bookings.  
Our service at the winter garden was lovely being seen through by Anth on Saturday evening.  However due to the kitchen not being able to cope,  we had to take our desserts to our room.
I would like to suggest The Landmark take some pointers from other sister hotels and hotels within the leading hotels group such as The Anantara Palazzo in Rome. (Having stayed at both in the last 7 days The Landmark fell extremely short).

Hotel itself is pretty but service is far from 5 star.",3,2024,04,14
106,First Class Experience,"This hotel surpassed all expectations, across the board. This was our first trip to London, and I am so happy we chose to stay here. Every aspect of this hotel is first class. The service, especially the doormen, as well as the food were exceptional. My son loved the pool, and the breakfast was amazing. Being directly next to Marylebone station was clutch and it's a very short walk to the Baker Street station as well. I cannot think of one complaint and will absolutely stay here when we return to London.",5,2024,04,11
106,Landmark,"The hotel exceeded my expectation . Very beautiful place, service outstanding no small problem at the arrival or departure.

The tea was excellent, lots of choice and the staff made sure we had plenty to eat. Easy to book on line. A very pleasant afternoon. Highly recommended",5,2024,04,02
106,Perfect In Every Way,"The staff was extremely helpful, pleasant and truly went out of their way to accommodate our needs.  We checked in early and had a later checkout.  One day I hit the do not disturb button and our room was not made up. I asked a housekeeper about it and she said no worries, she would take care of it.  I am quite certain she wanted to leave for the evening but stayed longer to help us. The hotel is pure luxury. It met all of our needs.  I especially loved the executive room which was very large and comfortable and the atrium was inviting and delicious for the breakfast buffet which we enjoyed. Because the tube is across the street, the location was fantastic.",5,2024,04,01
106,Fabulous experience!,"The hotel is stunning!  The staff are all very pleasant and welcoming.  Despite being a 5 star hotel,I found everyone extremely down to earth and friendly and courteous, even the other guests.  Such a lovely atmosphere and buzz about the place, with gentle piano playing most of the time, and live in the evenings.  

Added to that, my partner is a huge Beatles fan, and we didn't realise how close we were to Marylebone Station (literally on its back doorstep) and only a short walk to Baker Street.  
The stay was a huge treat for my partner and I, and a really great experience.",5,2024,03,28

Well.. I was in London and I decided to visit. 
Holy hell. Accosted by security on my way in. 
30 minutes wait to for a cocktail. 
Being told. I had to go down to reception myself and ask the concierge to charge my phone… 
THEN told that the Duty manager was too busy to simply speak to me. 
I won’t be booking this place for my reception. 
I’d not recommend anyone to. 
Terrible",1,2024,03,23
106,My new favourite hotel in London,"We were in London for one night and were looking to book a budget stay but all the budget options were around £280 per night. As I thought this was a lot I looked at the prices for 5* hotels and found an offer for a room at The landmark for £340. As a Bake off fan I thought I’d rather spend the extra and stay there, best decision ever!! It is a stunning hotel, we ended up having drinks in the beautiful garden terrace with amazing pastries and spending time in the hotel that we never intended because it was such a pleasure to be there. The room was faultless, room service delicious and we were so taken with the hotel we had a leisurely 2 hour breakfast instead of getting up early and heading out, This is definitely my new favourite hotel in London. Next time we visit I’m having the afternoon tea!",5,2024,03,20
106,Just fabulous!,"It was my 50th Birthday and I felt like a princess. From the moment I checked in with husband until we walked out of the door on departure day , we were made to feel special. I have never stayed in a 5 * hotel before and was worried I would be disappointed. I was not. We checked in and in the huge deluxe room awaited a very tasty cake and a card saying happy birthday. The size of the room and bathroom was huge.
I loved the way staff greeted you and spoke to you around the hotel. The doorman was very helpful with the area and places to see. I cant comment on breakfast or the restaurant as we had room only. But the cake that was left was divine!
The interior was just amazing! The atrium is just stunning and I would 100% love to come back one day.",5,2024,03,18
106,Best London hotel so far,"Can't fault the breakfast, location, spa and staff.   Expensive but get the full luxury experience.  Just a note to managers that some tiles are falling out of male steam room when washing the bench.  Alot of guests still using phones in the spa and pool side but see a lot of places struggling with this.",5,2024,03,17
106,Best trip ever,"The concierge in this hotel is the best I have experienced in my whole life, they made my life so easy. That’s why I booked the same hotel on my way back home.

The service and every staff member is just wonderful. Cannot wait to go back!,5,2024,03,12
106,Still the One,"This was my most recent visit after 5 years and as you can imagine, I was very much looking forward to it. I was not disappointed: their strive for excellence is there as well as the capacity to positively surprise their guests, the care they put into the little details, the feeling of being at home away from home and the fantastic location. 
It's definitely my favorite hotel in London.

Staff as always makes the difference, I would lñike to give a special mention to Francis, and his colleague, who used his own Uber app to get me and my wife transportation on early Sunday morning. Francis helped solve a huge problem for me and for that I am very grateful.

I will look for any excuse to return as soon as possible!",5,2024,03,11
106,Still beautiful but lost its shine,"Our first visit to the Landmark was seven years ago, we were treated like royalty, nothing was too much trouble and the hotel for first time visitors is aw inspiring.

Rooms still immaculate but missed our friends of the Landmark upgrades we have always enjoyed previously, it was my 65th Birthday celebration and on our bed was two towel swans and a load of rose petals, which would probably say no one had been int he room since Valentine’s Day?

Rooms are some of the best in London mixing olden age luxury with a modern twist.

The atrium is breathtaking for breakfast, service has lost some of its sparkle though and with outsiders having breakfast guests we’re having to wait to be seated. Breakfast bar has moved and doesn’t have the same appeal as previous visits.

The hotel is not in the central area with Oxford street being a thirty minute walk, however, it does have rail and underground across the road literally!

Having stayed on eight occasions, this may be our last.",4,2024,03,11
106,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON! You have to stay here..,"We stayed here in Feb 2024, check in didn’t start off great as room had AC issues with a terrible noise and we had to wait almost an hour to change rooms but the staff were incredibly apologetic which was fine. Anyway from here on This is THE BEST hotel in London. Rooms were huge, with huge TV and sofa area, we had in room dining every night - The food here is stunning as well as the breakfast. The Staff are so lovely and friendly, the atmosphere is just brilliant. The piano in the background is so calming and wonderful, the Palm trees are breathtaking and the view from the room is the best. The doormen were the BEST! Always ready to help and have a chat. Afternoon Tea looks great but we didn’t have a chance this time. The Hotel is huge and it’s just exquisite in the heart of Marylebone. The little added features are  amazing and it’s just so calming and quiet, you don’t know you’re in London. Thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay, we were so sad to leave but hopefully we will be back soon❤️",5,2024,03,09
106,Had a very good time,"Very good service from Angelo and sulfikar. Good food and great environment, you can take many beautiful pictures. They will play piano when you are birthday and give small cake and champagne. 
Love this building and hope can back next time.",5,2024,03,08
106,Great Afternoon tea experience,"I went for Afternoon tea today for a solo birthday treat. Stunning hotel and very beautiful trendy music played by the pianist, she was incredible. The staff were amazing! Very kind and very attentive. They congratulated me with the first introduction. Afterwards they brought me a birthday tartlet and the pianist played happy birthday on the piano, it was honestly such an experience. Angelo and Sulvikar (Apologies if I spelt the name wrong) both served me, and they were great! Overall it was a lovely experience.",5,2024,03,07
106,The best London has to offer for Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea at The Landmark was such an experience!  The staff are so attentive, professional and friendly. The food was amazing, especially the sandwiches!!  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful- such a setting. I’ve had many afternoon teas: Ritz, Shard etc but The Landmark definitely topped the lot!  Will be booking back in for a stay and evening meal!",5,2024,03,07
106,"Must stay hotel in London, professional waitstaff at Winter Garden, very knowledgeable doormen, awesome rooms/bathrooms","Exceptional hotel! Rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Marble bathroom was an absolute delight with a separate (powerful) shower and huge bathtub. Winter Garden restaurant is excellent. Central Pub has an awesome fish & chips. Professional, outstanding waitstaff! Doormen are courteous, funny, knowledgeable and very helpful. Marylebone Tube station is across the street. Great safe neighborhood.

106,Outstanding hotel🌟,"My family and I stayed at this hotel for three nights and loved it 😊 . As you walk into reception the size of the hotel is truly evident and the palm trees in the were stunning. All staff were polite, very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was gorgeous- comfy, clean and warm.We had room service  each night and every meal was fantastic, with  plenty of it. Crème brûlée was gorgeous and the chocolate brownie!Breakfast was a joy in the atrium with a good selection of all types of breakfast that would suit all. We didn’t use the spa as we didn’t have enough time. Hope to be back soon.",5,2024,02,29
106,Best anniversary ever!!!!!,"The whole stay was like a movie from check-in to check-out, we had been made feel super welcomed and everyone was extremely attentive, first of all the room was amazing and was decorated for our anniversary with petals and swans made of towels it was so romantic, we then proceeded to have a very relaxing time enjoying the spa facilities followed by a amazing dinner in the great central pub, we had the chicken skewers with peanut sauce and the cauliflower bites with a aioli which where rich in flavour and the chicken was very juicy and I had the steak for mains which was tender and juicy, my partner had the veggie curry and rice which was rich and creamy, after all of that we could barely move so we finished our wine and retired to our beautiful suite, we made sure to wake up early to enjoy the spa one last time before joining the winter garden for the breakfast buffet filled with all your traditional English breakfast bits fresh selection of bread and the freshest of fruits, it was excellence with divine settings.",5,2024,02,29
106,Landmark Hotel……Superb..,What an outstanding three days we have just had at this excellent hotel. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and professional. The room was first class and a big thumbs up to the team that keeps the rooms superbly immaculate. Will definitely be returning. Keep up the good work.,5,2024,02,28
106,Champagne bar,"Had a lovely service by Emma and Hardik, Venus  everyone was very friendly and the service was great. The atmosphere was really lovely, the food was very tasty and the scones were nice. Recommend for a quick coffee and snacks. Great afternoon spent",5,2024,02,28
106,5 Star brilliance!,"Wow! What a birthday weekend! Immaculate room and service throughout my stay with my family - wife and 2 year old daughter! greeted with kindness at every opportunity and a birthday treat in my room! Fantastic pianist who played a Little Mermaid song when my daughter was there! Big thank you to Richard, Olga, Malisa and all of the staff at The Landmark Hotel who made our stay one to remember!",5,2024,02,27
106,Fantastic night in huge Executive Room but Team Members are this hotel’s biggest asset.,"Was treated to an upgrade with an executive room facing the stunning Atrium!

Checked in and out so smoothly by the professional receptionist team Ana and Matthieu.  They were courteous and professional on what looked like a busy weekend.

Dinner was incredible, I was recommended the newest additions to the menu and they were so tasty. Agnieszka was in charge and looked after us so we’ll with Helmi and their team.  

The upgrade was accompanied by kindhearted amenities Eva brought up after my nap, was kind of the room service to not disturb me and I felt refreshed after visiting the spa where Viki made me feel at home. 

After a night’s sleep on that incredible mattress, I was brought morning coffee by Crina from Room Service who was attentive and asked how I had found my stay and it was all topped off with that fantastic buffet breakfast where Leon, Rodica and Suthamas looked after me. 

Thanks to the amazing members of staff who looked after me - a hotel is just a building unless it has amazing people who look after it and it’s guests. If I could give six or ten stars to all of them, I would!",5,2024,02,26
106,Excellent hotel in great location with easy access to all subway line. Large comfortable room and superb breakfast.,"I stayed at the landmark with my family and we had a great experience. The breakfast is superb, the room is also really very comfortable. Most of the staff is also friendly. It would be great if kids could use the pool at night too. All in, looking forward to my next stay.",5,2024,02,24
106,Super rude and aggressive staff,"Completely unacceptable behaviour by hotel management. I took a couple of pictures in the hotel lobby of my friends (who were in London and staying there for a couple of days) and was told (by a very rude security person) that only iPhone photos were allowed, but cameras were not. 
Even though I explained I was not a professional photographer (I had a simple camera and have never taken any photos for a living). The reasoning made zero sense. Ironically, next to us, were quite clearly a bunch of instagram influencers, changing clothes and shoes between shots, who took about an hour to take photos and videos (with their phones). But that is apparently ok. Whereas 3-4 snaps with a camera that has a lens, is not. And the way they went about it (super rude and aggressive) ruined everyone’s stay and evening. (We were having drinks at the bar). There are much nicer hotels in London, with much friendlier personnel. Not again.",1,2024,02,23
106,Wonderful hotel,"A fantastic stay at the landmark.  It is a really beautiful hotel, we felt really well looked after, we had such a lovely time. Wonderful facilities, great staff, lovely food and in a great location.  Would highly recommend. We hope to return again soon.",5,2024,02,22

I will definitely be back for another landmark experience soon.

106,"Excellent service, very spacious family room","The Landmark felt like home away from home. Very conveniently located with Marylebone and Baker Street stations a few minutes walk away, we were charmed by the old school luxury feel that greeted us as soon as we stepped into the premises. The family rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The children were delighted with breakfast and claimed that the hot chocolate is one of the best they have ever had. Breakfast is always pleasant with top notch service and attention. Rupert the doorman made our stay extra memorable with his morning and evening banter. He greeted us with a smile and such enthusiasm that he made it into our vacation album! Thank you for an excellent stay, we will most probably stay at the Landmark again the next time we come to London.",5,2024,02,21
106,Fab service and super clean!,"The hotel has a great location and is super clean. The team all accomodated for our children really well and the breakfast was fab. The overall service was warm, attentitive but not over bearing and the family hours at the pool were great. We went for a swim after breakfast and before tea and it worked relly well for our schedule. We will be staying again in the summer, thank you for a peaceful break in the city!",5,2024,02,21
106,Wedding Anniversary - Pampering Package!,"It was our first time staying over in the Landmark after coming for afternoon tea for my wife’s birthday last year.

The whole spa package was excellent and typical 5 star treatment throughout the entire hotel!

Thank you for the lovely quiet room overlooking the winter garden, the amazing cake and decorations on the bed! It made it very special for us.

Breakfast was up there with the best we have had and the entire staff and service really was first class so thank you for a very memorable stay!

We were in real need of some relaxation and pampering and we definitely received that.

Full length mirrors in the room would have been useful and changing room cubicles in the spa if we are being picky ;)

We really can’t wait to return!",5,2024,02,18
106,Great Service at Great Central - Md,"I had a wonderful meal at the hotel’s pub, Great Central.  The fish and chips were tasty and were a very generous serving.  But what made it so special was the waiter, Md, was terrific.  He was very friendly and attentive.  Definitely a great place to eat.  We will be back.",5,2024,02,16
106,A 5* experience ,"What a fantastic hotel. Greeted at the door by a wonderful doorman and as I wandered the hotel I found the atrium area which was beautiful. A staff member named Bob pointed me in the direction of the great central pub whilst answering my questions about the history of the hotel.
The pub was welcoming and the service given by Michael was 5*. As was the food! I will be back ",5,2024,02,15
106,Building unforgettable memories,"Having stayed in many hotel in London and all the top ones. I’d say the landmark is one of the best. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are very professional  the service is outstanding, the food is excellent the room we stayed in was beautiful, just a real experience we will never forget. Very very nice can’t fault anything. Just a cut above the rest. Will definitely be coming back",5,2024,02,15
106,What a birthday treat it was !,"I was surprised by my partner for a little trip away from home for my birthday.
She brought me to this hotel and Oh Boy, what a hotel it is !

From the moment you step in, Richard the concierge comes to greet you.
He made sure to releave me of my suitcase and brought us to Ana & Sofia at the check-in counter.
They were courteous, smiling and polite. It's nice to be acknowledged when you approach the desk and too often are people stuck on their screen. Here, none of that, it's refreshing.
Sofi walk us to the lift and explained us all the outlets.

After being told our luggage would follow us up. we made our way to room 355.
First surprise : the room was HUGE ! In most hotels, that room would pass for a junior suite ! We had an executive room but that room was twice the size of any executive room that I experienced so far.
We had a cake and some champagne waiting and the luggage had arrived ahead of us !
The hotel manager had even left a card to my attention. 
Trully impressed there !

Breakfast : They have freakin' Eggs Benedict on Buffet !!! That never cease to amaze me ( and the yolk is running). Radica and Suzana were the sweetest, always with a jar of fresh orange juice in the hand and their breakfast plates are huge.
I had no issues skipping lunch that day !.
The building is beautiful but it's not only about that, their staff is really top notch !

Really remarkable, such a shame I stayed for 1 night only",5,2024,02,13
106,Amazing spa/afternoon tea experience,"I visited the Landmark spa for a treatments & afternoon tea package as a gift, and from start to end the whole experience was wonderful. Lana welcomed me to the spa and was really enthusiastic and helpful. My therapist Tik was lovely and really went out of her way to make my treatments as personalised and relaxing as possible. I was relaxed and glowing went I left. I’d love to go back and would really recommend the “Delight Me” spa experience.",5,2024,02,12
106,Superb Hotel with Wonderful Decor and Great Staff,"We had a wonderful weekend break in this magnificent hotel.  The central concourse is stunning. The hotel is truly five star. The rooms were very spacious - particularly, the family rooms.  The breakfast is excellent. The checkin is super - Matthieu was very helpful. The porters are brilliant - Orlando was really helpful and a great professional. Will definitely be back. The hotel is next door to Marleybone Railway / Tube Station.  Highly recommended!",5,2024,02,11
106,Birthday tea at the Winter Gardens,"Wonderful afternoon at the Winter Gardens in the Landmark Hotel. It was my daughter’s birthday and we celebrated by having afternoon tea. The service was impeccable, with wonderful extra touches like bringing a birthday cake over that we hadn’t asked for. Our server ‘Anth’ could not have been more wonderful. He really made the afternoon very special. Top service, amazing food and the most wonderful location..",5,2024,02,11
106,Thank you Anth,"Visited the landmark for a hotel over night stay. We had dinner in the winter garden. 5 star service from Anth. Many thanks for making our dinner reservation fabulous. He gave us perfect recommendations, very kind and hospitable. All the best.",5,2024,02,09

106,Best afternoon tea in London,"Most definitely the best afternoon tea in London, bar none. Beautiful environment for tea with an atmosphere enhanced by the lovely piano playing. A special shout out to our waiter Sulfiqur who was very attentive and friendly. The food was amazing.",5,2024,02,06
106,Great service and fabulous food,We had supper at the Great Central Pub. Such a lovely setting and great atmosphere.  The service was superb and the food was amazing. We had the Malaysian curry and salmon with risotto.  Thank you Michael for a lovely meal. We really enjoyed our evening.,5,2024,02,05
106,Good experience,"Lovely food, great decor and fantastic service from Sulfikar as our waiter for our meal. The short rib was superb. The piano player added to the calm atmosphere. We ventured to the Mirror Bar which was a lovely location for a night cap. Highly recommended.

106,Phenomenal home away from home,"Unbelievably attentive service. Nothing has been too much trouble; acute attention to detail. Staff remember my name, all requests have been met (extra pillows, particular teabags, extension of my stay, hair salon booking in advance etc). My stay here has made my post surgery recovery so much easier.",5,2024,02,02
106,Best experience!,"Myself and 3 others recently stayed at the Landmark and we had the most amazing time! The staff are all so friendly and helpful and made us feel so welcome. If we needed anything the staff were all very happy to accommodate us, the waiters and waitresses at breakfast and dinner were so attentive, they were also great at offering their recommendations for food and drinks. 
The reception staff and doormen were all super friendly as well and always happy to help with whatever we needed. I would highly recommend this hotel and I would absolutely stay there again. One of the best experiences we've had!!",5,2024,02,01
106,Amazing hotel,"Landmark hotel is outstanding, the experience we had with my partner was amazing, the quality, food and staff are fantastic we will definitely go again. It was my partner’s birthday and they couldn’t do enough. On arrival there was a cake in the bedroom with a card written for my partner. Thank you landmark for making our stay special.",5,2024,02,01
106,The Hotel No,"Stayed here for 3-night weekend. I don’t write bad reviews lightly but feel compelled out of frustration and the complete lack of visible management at the time. 

The good - great location by Baker St and Marylebone stations, wonderful old characterful building with some great doorman and bellboys, really good breakfast coffee (rare even in 5-star hotels) and a very decent if ridiculously overpriced breakfast even by 5-star pricing norms. 

Now unfortunately the bad - this hotel should be renamed The Hotel No. Service is terrible. As I travel for business I have stayed in a lot of 4/5 star hotels all around the World and what distinguishes them is their service and the way in which they deal with the little requests guests have, however, unreasonable. Usually this takes the form of their first answer to a request never being “no” even if they cant do exactly what is being asked. In other words they listen to their guests and suggest solutions. Unfortunately here it would seem the initial reaction to any request is “no” and no alternative solution. Now I couldn’t work out in this case whether that is staff inexperience, absence of management (there didn’t seem to be any all weekend), hotel ethos or a combination of all 3, but it jumps off the page at any regular traveller. To name a few - no we cant move your prepaid breakfast to another day because you have to go to work before breakfast opens, no we cant offer an alternative, no you cant bring a sleeping baby in the bar, no we wont move any chairs for the 4 young ladies who want to sit together we’ll watch them do it instead and the following day we will watch you do the same. No we wont bring your drink until you get up and remind us a second time, but here is the one “Yes”, we will still charge you service for the privilege ! There are more but I wont embarrass my fellow guests by mentioning. Service is terrible and won’t be staying again",2,2024,01,30
106,Delectable lunch.,A Birthday lunch in the most sumptuous of surroundings. Truly enjoyable. Fabulous food with impeccable service.  Memorable lunch for sure. Will be returning. A few more vegetarian options would be much appreciated. A hidden gem in North London.,5,2024,01,30
106,"Outstanding Stay! Perfect Room, Breakfast and Spa and Special Mention to Orlando!",Amazing stay at the Landmark London. Went last year in 2023 for a drink at the champagne bar and knew our next stay to London would need to be here! Stayed in the Executive Family Room (felt like a suite) and was the biggest family room we had ever seen! Breakfast was one of the best we have ever had in a hotel and the choice was amazing not forgetting the lovely surroundings. Spa was perfect and is definitely a good addition to a stay if you want to start your morning off right. Last but definitely not least we have to mention the amazing doorman Orlando! He welcomed us from when we got there to when we left and couldn’t have faulted him at all. He would definitely be one of the reasons why we would return to the Landmark London again! Always interested in what we were getting up to and was genuinely a lovely man. The Marleybone tube/train station is OUTSIDE and is literally a 50 second walk away! Not normally something you can get in London. Perfect stay and we definitely will be returning.,5,2024,01,29
106,Lovely Stay at the Landmark,We had a great stay at the Landmark. For a large hotel the service is fantastic and seems very personal. The room was really comfortable with great views into the atrium. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. We’ll definitely be back!,5,2024,01,28
106,Lovely family stay at The Landmark,"Excellent family stay at the Landmark with our two boys, aged 3 and 7. The family room had plenty of space, even with an additional bed added. The boys loved children’s time at the swimming pool, breakfast was wonderful and the staff fantastic. A true family friendly hotel. We will be back!",5,2024,01,28
106,Our new favourite London hotel,"The staff, service and accommodation at The Landmark is faultless- attention to detail is next level. We had a 2 night stay earlier this week and were blown away by all the hotel offers. The room was spacious, spotless and luxurious. The afternoon tea and breakfast are highly recommended. We stayed to celebrate my husband’s birthday, I lost count of the number of ‘happy birthdays’ he received from the staff and cakes!  and we will be returning for our next London trip.",5,2024,01,27
106,A great place to celebrate an anniversary,"The hotel was great, we went for our anniversary and everyone was very helpful and friendly. Our room was upgraded which meant we had a suite which was amazing, looking over the central section. A lovely hotel that we’d definitely stay at again.",5,2024,01,21
106,THE LONDON LANDMARK HOTEL,"A perfect blend of sophistication, merts flare, meets taste. 

Set in an old English country style,The London landmark hotel offers an arrsy of excellent services. 
Went for a business meeting in the morning, by noon, we moved to one of the many ball rooms for a sumptuous meal. Later, he had a grand gala at yet another grand hall. I loved playing on the piano cos i have no music experience at all. Staff were kind and offered to take pictures for you",5,2024,01,16
106,A Goddess took care of Us🤩,"Bumped into a lady named Venus (lovely name) found out she was named after the tennis player. She asked if we needed help and we mentioned how we were just looking for somewhere to wait in the meantime as four train from Marylebone station was delayed and the station being very cold. She informed us we able to sit in the restaurant above and she walked us upstairs to the terrace area and let us sit down. She also offered us coffee and she took good care of us. My husband and I were very impressed and she took good care of us, we ended up having a quick lunch before we left and it was amazing, the soup was lovely and the service India was indeed 5 star. They were both so funny, professional and very kind. Definitely motivated us to come back , India and venus were so amazing.",4,2024,01,16
106,A hidden gem in the heart of London...,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Landmark
London and had a fantastic experience. The
Winter Garden was a beautiful highlight, creating
a serene atmosphere, one that not many London
hotels have to offer. Emma at the Champagne Bar
provided amazing service, and her friendliness
made the experience memorable, she took a
ton of photos for us too:) Sofiane and Leon from
the Winter Garden were absolute legends, they
both served us impeccably and stopped by to
have many casual conversations, contributing to
the overall ambiance (the fillet steak was to die
for!). A special mention to Olga and Giulia from
Reception, who were helpful and made us feel
at home throughout our stay, thank you both for
the surprise champagne that you left in our room!
Our room was immaculate, spacious and had an
excellent view of the Winter Garden - we felt as
if we were more in an overseas resort than a city
hotel. This place is a hidden gem in the heart of
London and 1recommend it to anyone looking to
dine or stay here, you will not regret it. Overall, a
delightful and welcoming experience, thank you
allmassivelv.",5,2024,01,16
106,Brilliant service throughout from the moment we checked in - exceptional experience,We stayed at The Landmark Hotel twice in December and both times the service was exceptional. Cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff really make the experience brilliant and I will be back very soon.,5,2024,01,15
106,Wonderful from start to finish,"I visited on a Saturday night with my daughter and from the moment we arrived everything was perfect.  I’m aware that it’s difficult to recruit great staff in hospitality at the moment but everyone we encountered was friendly, helpful and very professional.  We had a warm greeting from Vlad on arrival and an efficient and welcoming check in by Moustafa. Our room was beautiful - very comfortable with everything we could possibly need.  We had plenty of fluffy towels and the bathrobes were a good size and very soft (not rough and stiff as in many hotels).  We also really liked the Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom.  

After settling in to our luxurious room we visited the spa.  We were greeted with a big smile by Vicky who took time to show us the spa facilities.  The spa is a real asset to the hotel.  The pool was bigger than I expected and it was possible to have a proper swim.  We were pleasantly surprised to find it very uncrowded - for most of the time we were the only people in the pool.  

Before dinner we had a glass of champagne in the Mirror Bar.  The staff here were amazing - with Ivy and Sini in beautiful teal dresses and Devin in his incredible jacket it was like a scene from a Hollywood movie but cosy at the same time.  We enjoyed the Mirror Bar so much that we called in for a night cap after dinner! 

Dinner in the Wintergarden was a wonderful experience and the food was  excellent.  The waiting staff were outstanding - Ruziel, Helmi, India and Anth.  They were friendly, helpful and attentive without hovering!   The restaurant was busy but not crowded or noisy - a great ambience which can be hard to create in a hotel but perfectly created at the Landmark.  

After a very good  and peaceful night’s sleep (the room was so quiet) we had a delicious hearty breakfast in the Wintergarden.  I had seen reviews saying that breakfast can be very crowded but we were seated straight away and impeccably looked after by Jani and Leon.

We were very sad to leave after a wonderful stay. We were efficiently checked out by Matt with Olga and Jihye  on hand to check that everything had been ok with our stay and to bid us a friendly farewell.  

I’m sure there are other people I should have mentioned but it was hard to take note of all the names.  The Landmark is a beautiful hotel but its people make a great experience extra special.",5,2024,01,11
106,Great gastro bar in the basement,"We ate in the Gastro pub part and the only negative was that they put the football on the tv with sound later in the evening other than that a lovely  meal, drinks, service, facilities and setting. Very handy for Marylebone station and we will return :)",4,2024,01,10
106,Disappointing,"I’d always wanted to stay here and so we saved for our anniversary. The room was a little tired but they did put petals on bed for us. Asked for a quiet table and was seated next to a family with children blowing raspberries, asked if we could have a quiet table and the response was far from warm. Table cloth had a hole in and chipped teapot, minor but not the 5* experience I was looking for. I’ve written some emails but had no response from anyone, surprising as they seem to reply on here.

106,Amazing experience ,"Me and my partner had an amazing experience, massage was fantastic. Tik was so professional, friendly, helpful and had a great energy.  Afternoon tea was amazing , great place and deserved that 5 star. ",5,2023,12,31
106,How Not to have an afternoon tea,"Spa day with  3 friends, and champagne afternoon tea. All paid for ahead of day.Spa treatments and staff lovely. Champagne tea- Felt like we were wearing an invisibility cloak as required multiple attempts to get someone to serve us. Food was good unless you were vegan, do not have the vegan scones. We were then harassed by a waitress as she demanded to see receipt of payment. Manager apologised but 2nd waitress clearly did not get the memo as she came and harassed us again.Nothing like having a bill being demanded to be paid to kill a lovely day.",1,2023,12,28
106,A wonderful stay,"My self my wife and my Son stayed at the Landmark the week before Christmas.
This was all arranged by Malisa Shepherd the hotel Manager,my son had  some hospital appointments that day so staying the night at the hotel was much appreciated,
the staff are so helpful and nothing is too much trouble.
A big thank you to all and for supporting the charity DEBRA.

106,Exceeded Expectations ,"The whole experience was excellent. Beautiful spacious room. The room was done to an extremely high standard. Very good insulation and windows which meant that we could not hear any sound from the outside at all. The breakfast was delicious and the service staff attentive.
I really enjoyed swimming in the pool and spending time I'm the steam room.
The Landmark truly exceeded my expectations.",5,2023,12,24
106,The Amazing Landmark. ,"I celebrated my birthday with friends at the Landmark Hotel restaurant and it was a wonderful experience.  The food was excellent and the staff were friendly and helpful.
I would like to say a special thank you to Rodica for her kindness and for making my birthday a special occasion. 
I recently returned for afternoon tea  and noticed that the restaurant/bar area has been updated, and it looks amazing.

106,Still my favourite London  hotel,"It has become a tradition to stay here just before Christmas ( and at other times if we can) as we love the hotel and the location is ideal for the West End. Everything was good and all the team members we had dealings with are friendly, professional and helpful. The restaurant/bar area has been   updated and it looks very contemporary and fresh. I really do like the uniforms for the hospitality team, very flattering and elegant. The hotel is high end and luxury yet retains a friendly, relaxed feel and is not at all pretentious

We stayed in an executive room and the room size is generous , very comfortable sofa, tables etc. Thank you for the surprise gift of cake and wine - a lovely touch and appreciated. Bathroom is a good size, towels are large, thick and fluffy, everywhere is clean. White Linen products are available (not my favourite, I must admit however a small point).

Restaurant was full on the evening we dined yet it was still a relaxed environment. Food excellent quality.

We look forward to returning.

106,Wonderful Festive Meal ,"My daughter and I went to the Winter Garden for their festive menu and it was a delightful experience from beginning to end. The food was superb, the service first class and the ambience wonderful. I would definitely recommend the festive menu as it's really good value and and a great way to celebrate the Christmas period. We will be back.",5,2023,12,20
106,Luxury stay in Marylebone but could have been better,"Overall a good stay.  

Lovely breakfast.  The restaurant team was very nice.

The doormen/ porters are the best features about this hotel.  Always friendly and helpful.  

Comfortable bed and pillows etc.  Bathroom is great.  One feedback is that the scented bath amenities are too strong.  They should go for a more natural product. The shampoo causes an allergic reaction because it is so strong.

The biggest negative was that there was a smell of smoke in my room and corridor and I had to ask for a change of room.  They didn't change this for free and I had to pay for an upgrade despite the fact that their no smoking promise was not fulfilled. This is a no-smoking hotel and the staff should ensure that guests respect this.",3,2023,12,20
106,Spa at the hotel,The spa was great and relaxing. I had a great time and the products used were high quality and extremely soothing. I saw a change a week after the treatment. The employees at the spa were very friendly and nice especially Tik who did my facial. ,5,2023,12,18
106,The Landmark will always have us as a customer⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"You will always have us as a customer⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My husband and I stayed in The Landmark last night in the Marylebone Suite room 426 last night for our second anniversary. 
This is our 2nd visit to the Landmark and it certainly won’t be the last. 
The attention to detail and service is impeccable, the amenities and room were to a high standard and it looked beautiful with the Christmas decorations. 
Upon check out and getting home I had realised I had left my earrings behind in the bathroom by accident, I phoned the landmark once home and asked if they had been found not expecting them to have been handed in and they promptly gave me a phone call back saying they have been found and they’ll be posted out to me on Monday! 
The relief I felt especially as I know how hard times are for people at the moment, they could have easily been misplaced but the integrity of the Landmark housekeeping team have restored my faith in humanity and for that I thank you and will always be a returning customer to the Landmark. 
Thank you to each and every member of staff who makes our stay incredible, no task is too small. 

Merry Christmas to all of the team, see you next year!",5,2023,12,16
106,"Shocking, disgusting  and very unprofessional service. Avoid. ","The service was an absolute nightmare! Despite booking two rooms a year in advance for our wedding at Old Marylebone Town Hall, things took a turn for the worse. The hotel initially suggested a photo session, but the nightmare began when they bombarded us with ridiculous rules.

They insisted we book much more expensive rooms if we wanted photos, and the photographer couldn't use any equipment. Plus, they demanded that no one be in the background, which is practically impossible in a massive hotel. As if that weren't enough, they threatened security action if we even dared to take pictures on our phones! It was beyond shocking and disgusting.

But wait, there's more. When we considered upgrading to more expensive rooms to comply with their absurd rules, the hotel informed us that we could only take pictures between 12:00 and 16:00. I explained that our wedding was at 9 am, and we weren't going to sit around until noon just to take pictures. Their response? They had another wedding in the morning, so they prioritized accommodating all photographers with designated time slots.

This nonsensical prioritization made sense if we were staying for a week, but we were there for just one night and had to travel back hundreds of miles. They didn't even attempt to compromise or offer an apology. I strongly recommend steering clear of this hotel and opting for one where the staff genuinely strives to make your stay comfortable, without insisting on unnecessary expenses.",1,2023,12,15
106,Afternoon tea ,The venue was amazing to look at and the service from all the staff was second to none! Want to give a special thanks to our waiter Anth who went above and beyond for me and my family. Will definitely be coming back soon,5,2023,12,14

106,Awesome experience,"This place is a brilliant place to stay in London. Although it’s pricey, it’s definitely worth the money! The swimming pool is somewhat cold and slippy, but there’s no chlorine so don’t take a piss in the pool (save it for showers) and shower before using. The Marylebone station is a short walk away so use it if you’re coming here. The food was alright, but come here if you have the money to!",4,2023,12,10
106,Average ,"Both my husband and I were in London for work and decided to stay at The Landmark as the event I was attending was being held there. A few days beforehand, having pre paid, I received an email asking me to check in on the Euro app and appearing to say I could choose a better room for an additional fee. We decided to do this and had confirmation of a city view room with the actual room number (not guaranteed). On check in we were told we had a completely different room and when I asked what the fee I’d paid was for, the lady on reception eventually told me it was a tip for housekeeping. I asked for a refund given I’d had no experience of house keeping at that point. (Refund was done promptly). The room was nice, very clean and with a very comfortable bed. My husband ordered a croque Monsieur with chips for his lunch on room service, on arrival it was just a ham and cheese toastie and the chips were cold, because he was in a rush he didn’t have time to to send it back, but given this is a five star hotel, I’d expect them to know what a croquet monsieur is and to serve food hot.
Overall it was a handy place to stay, beautifully decorated for Christmas, but they need to work on a couple of fundamentals, I doubt we would return.

106,Great hotel in great location,"I usually stay at the Charlotte St Hotel but after my wonderful stay at the Landmark, I’ll be coming back. I booked a basic room and it was spacious and comfortable, with a sofa and table perfect for doing evening work calls when I didn’t feel like sitting at the desk. My back sometimes hurts after sleeping in hotel beds, but this bed was great — I slept well every night. Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. And of course, the hotel is beautiful and close to Regents Park for a morning walk. Can’t find a single flaw. Highly recommended.",5,2023,12,08
106,A wonderful experience for both business and pleasure.,"The Landmark hotel offers a wonderful service, both on a  business and personal level.  We had approx. 40 rooms for one evening in November and each guest individual needs were met with the upmost professionalism and care.

I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel, be that for business or personal reasons.",5,2023,12,07

106,London's best hotel by a mile...,"I have recently stayed at The Landmark for both business and pleasure. This is the best hotel in London.
This is a hotel that creates the sort of ambiance only a true 5 start hotel can create.
The hotel is very warm and welcoming and is almost picturesque to look at yet it is somehow inviting and friendly.
The staff are amazing from check in to check out. Concierge are true professionals. The management are always around and are both approachable and friendly.

The rooms are huge (especially Vs the competition) and very comfortable. Very very clean and well serviced with superb in room products.

The SPA and pool are a real bonus for a central hotel. The restaurant, pub and bar are a great place to mingle.",5,2023,12,01

106,Avoid! Becareful They took 2500 pounds off my card !,"Hi
I just would like to make sure you becareful which card you give. It never happened before to me but i opened the water of their bathtub for a relax bath time and adter few minutes the water floaded into the room. It was written that the bath did not have overflow  but how this hotel bath tubs  dont have overflow!! 
When i did my check out they gave me an invoice of 2500 pounds from a carpet company saying that the carpet is wet and cannot be dried and the room cannot be rented. They did not want to hear anything, manager etc. A wet carpet because of their archaic system and they used my money to repair their whole carpet! It will cost less to replace their bathtub but its so easy to charge a customer 
 Without approval. I am suspefied and would never return there and make sure my friends and the company will not go back there as well. 

Ps the manager did not want to hear anything obviously or were not feeling sorry at all. It looks normal for them asking customers to leave a fee of 2500 pounds!",1,2023,11,22

106,Lovely hotel but breakfast and food is poor and overpriced. ,"Great hotel, very unique with plenty of helpful staff and the rooms are spacious. 

Perfect for business and pleasure and ideally located next to Marylebone station if travelling in by train, be sure to walk into the back of the hotel from the station.

Massages in the SPA are particularly good.

Only drawback, which was disappointing was the food, especially the breakfast. It’s not good value for money and a very basic buffet breakfast for £43 a person. They also add a 12.5% service charge which says discretionary but isn’t, to everything + a charitable donation which appeared on our bill + an extra room charge just for a room ontop of paying for the room? Seems like they are taking advantage of guests by charging such high food prices as well as additional charges and with all the additional charges which when queried aren’t actually discretionary as they initially suggest. 

Would probably stay again but the breakfast and cost of food would make me consider other options. ",4,2023,11,19
106,Awful,"Awful customer service. On arrival I couldn’t check into my room as it wasn’t ready. Was told I would be rung when my room was ready. Waited over 45 minutes and no call. I had to quickly change in my friends room as I needed to leave for a wedding and leave my belongings in their room.

Orlando even helped me with a recommendation on where to watch the formula 1 race since I was away from home!

106,Good hotel,"This is a good hotel.

We stayed in a family room and it was very spacious.

Good points if booking a family room:

Very spacious and with two double beds.

Loads of room and huge bathroom. Separate toilet and wardrobe.

Toiletries are white company.

Concierge staff are all excellent.

Morning and evening Cleanjng/turndown.

NB if you don’t book the family package specifically, you won’t get the tent and teddy in the room… we were disappointed on arrival but the hotel did agree to then put the tent in our room which was very much appreciated.  We hadn’t realised there was a family package on offer.

Things to note:  we accidentally clicked on the do not disturb button one day….. it meant that our room wasn’t cleaned.  After some effort, we did eventually get the room cleaned…. But it took some asking ….

Things that I think could do with being improved.  These are based on the fact this is a 5 star hotel and the room cost is pretty high:

Robes, bedding. Pillows need replacing. They are no longer of high quality.  The mattresses are also pretty hard…. Guessing they are getting old.  For the price, I would expect better quality. The robes were very hard and the pillows were very flat.

The biscuits in the room are cheap.  The sugar, milk etc is also poor quality….. not to a five star hotel standard.

The room lacked anything other than the basics. No fruit or anything at all in the room except on arrival.  
…. Just some plastic water bottles…. It was a little underwhelming for the price.

Reception staff need some training on customer services…. We had a few issues and struggled to get them resolved quickly. A few staff seemed out of their depth. 

Overall, this was a good hotel but probably lacks value for money at the min….",4,2023,10,29
106,Terrible value for money,"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are well-equipped. However, I expected an overall better and more professional service.

I paid room and breakfast and was very disappointed with the choice for breakfast. It was very basic, there was no break selection and it appeared to be aimed mainly for their Middle Eastern guest. Any hot dishes, including plain eggs were charged extra even though the breakfast was paid for. 

The air conditioning was overpowered and it felt like we were sitting in a fridge for breakfast, even the noise of the air conditioning was louder than our conversation. 

The waiters at breakfast were clearly untrained, forgetting orders, and overall did not provide the service I would have expected from a prestige establishment.

The concierge staff was friendly and helpful, but I was surprised to find no concierge available in the early evening, leaving another guest to open the door for us. I learned that the hotel's concierge service was limited from 10 am to 6 pm due to staff shortages.

All in all, considering the high price I paid for my stay, I wouldn't choose this hotel again. The value for the price isn't up to par.",3,2023,10,26
106,A must stay!,"Excellent service and could not do enough for you. The family suite was perfect, plenty of space and all the amenities that you need;  my 6 year old Grandaughter loved sleeping in the little tent and the cookies and milk went down a treat.

106,"Gorgeous Afternoon Tea in The Palm, Court","We came here for am Afternoon Tea and had a lovely time. The atmosphere is beautiful with the high glass ceiling and palm tree's and the elegant, very  talented pianist.

The service was really nice, very professional yet also friendly. The sandwiches were really nice and you had an unlimited amount. We loved that there was a traditional scone and a non traditional scone too, candied apricot and marzipan, delicious and the chocolate hazelnut ganache was the perfect accompaniment. All the cakes were imaginative and beautiful.

We loved it and thought it stood up well to other luxury cream teas we have tried, it's our treat to ourselves.

Definitely worth the cost.",5,2023,10,24

106,A mixed bag ,"We spent two nights at The Landmark, and had some poor experiences and some good.  

We were welcomed and greeted very well, but checking  in was very poor.  We had booked two rooms, one for our daughter who was getting married the following day.  The receptionist seemed very confused and told us she had already checked in; she hadn’t.  He told us our room number and I was taken to the room, while my husband went to park our car.  I was certain we had been given our daughter’s room as it was an upgrade and there were petals on the bed.  When my husband returned, we went back to reception where a lady checked and agreed we had been given the wrong room.  We went back to wait for our belongings to be moved, and used the bathroom.  We asked the porter to let housekeeping know that the bathroom needed to be refreshed.  He didn’t.

On Friday evening, a group of eight of us had dinner in the Great Central pub.  The food was very reasonably priced and delicious.  The service was good.

Our room was comfortable, but we wondered why the fridge was locked, why there were those awful plastic pots of UHT milk, why the complimentary water was in plastic bottles.  Not really 5* standard.  Room service was poor;  on Saturday morning we asked for fresh milk - it was delivered to the wrong room.  Another time, it took two phone calls before the milk was delivered.

When we returned to our room on Saturday night, housekeeping had not replenished the water bottles, and my used glass and almost empty bottle were still on the bedside .  

Breakfast on Sunday was outstanding.  The service was excellent and the choice of food marvellous.  It was easily one of the best breakfast experiences we’ve had.  

The porters, the concierge, the doormen were all exceptional which highlighted the poor standard of the receptionist, housekeeping and room service.

Their incredible refurbishment has brought a timely classic into the modern age with a unique and stylish history. From the doorman who welcomes to the friendly bar staff in the mirror bar, you are sure to be looked after to the highest standard. Thank you to Deven for his brilliant chats and recommendations and for a surprise birthday cocktail. Thank you to all the team making us have such a special night.",5,2023,09,23
106,True 5 Star Hotel with Outstanding Cuisine and Pub,"Four years ago, in the pre-pandemic years, my wife, her best friend and her husband, and I stayed at the Landmark Hotel, London for just two nights. We were so impressed with the accommodations, the staff's professionalism, the quality of the cuisine, and the majesty of the building that we promised ourselves we'd return.  We did just that during the past two weeks. 

We cannot begin to adequately describe the incredibly wonderful time spent in this classic hotel that despite the modern upgrades of wi-fi, flat screen HDTV, and full functioning spa, still exudes the luxury of another, more gentile time.  Every member of the hotel staff is a consummate professional.  There is no stone they fail to turn over in attempts to satisfy their guests. And the cuisine is exquisite. 

This year we discovered a pub style restaurant, the Great Central, on the basement floor of this grand hotel. We dined there four evenings and must tell you that it is a "" gem"". I  enjoyed their tradition fish and chips, and was particularly impressed by their take on BBQ pork ribs. In the US I am a certified master bbq judge for the Kansas City BBQ Society and suggest you try the ribs whenever you visit London. While their sauce is not quite as sweet as the competition ribs in the States, the Great Central chefs have achieved perfection in the ribs' tenderness. They release at the bite without falling off the bone, providing the diner with the proper and satiating chew. The ribs are an absolute pleasure to experience. 

I recommend the London Landmark Hotel and the Central Pub to all.",5,2023,09,16
106,Sumptuous treat,"Spa day with afternoon tea in the Palm tea room was an amazing experience. 
The spa was tranquil and staff efficient and welcoming. Our day included a back scrub, massage and facial. My therapist was wonderful skilled and attentive. 
We continued on to the tea, which was excellent. Sandwiches fresh tasty and plentiful followed by scones and patisserie. We treated ourselves to a glass of champagne. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2023,09,10
106,A very special hotel,"My husband, our teenage daughters and I stayed at the Landmark London last weekend and we absolutely loved it. 
We were greeted at the door by Orlando who couldn't have been more helpful, he was friendly and chatted with us for a while while we waited for our luggage to be taken upstairs, he really made us feel welcome.
As I was unpacking I realised I'd forgotten to pack a charger, I contacted reception and within minutes a lovely gentleman named Ronaldo knocked on our door with a charger! He went out of his way to help and we were so grateful.
In the evening we went down to the mirror bar and had a few drinks served by Devon who was very professional, we had a lovely time.
All the staff were very helpful and the ladies looked lovely in their dresses.
We'll be back to visit in the future, I'd recommend everyone stay at the Landmark London at least once in your life.
Thanks everyone for a lovely stay",5,2023,09,07

106,Wonderful hotel,"The landmark was one of the best hotels I stayed at! London is very expensive for long stays with family but The Landmark went above and beyond to accommodate us! We even extended our stay midway ! And loved it!  From the doormen to the waiters, to the front receptionist Delancy , all the way up to the housekeeping! Everyone is lovely and amazing! I loved our stay there! Absolutely am grateful and I left a tip with front desk when we checked out so I hope it was shared with the doormen and restaurant staff. I would've tipped more from the USA but they said I couldn't from the USA and I only had a limited pounds the last day because you can only exchange little at a time ! I teach my kids respect and thank everyone so I thank you all!  It was my kids first time to London and you all made it lovely! The only thing I'd change or recommend for future , please adjust swimming hours to be longer for kids . They loved the pool, and please offer more vegetarian options on the room service for adults and kids like vegetable protein and maybe offer promegranate and dragon fruit as room service fruit offerings!

106,"Old world charm, nice sized rooms, great location, and OUTSTANDING service. Will return.","LOVE the LANDMARK for several reasons. One is that I really appreciate the old world charm of the hotel. Second, in crowded London, it's nice to come home to a relatively large sized hotel room. Third is the convenient location of the hotel. You can walk to Marylebone, a charming neighborhood next to the hotel, for food and shopping. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly is the outstanding service. When I arrived for check in around noon, the lobby was quite busy. I was given a corner room in the back, which is understandable as the hotel was handling a huge wedding that weekend and perhaps my original room wasn't clean yet. I had just flown in from America, so was happy to get a clean available room. Next day I spotted a familiar face at the Concierge Desk, and asked for help as I much preferred a room with more windows and a bit larger. Well, Jakub just couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. He remembered me from my last pre-covid visit. He was able to rearrange my room, which my wife and I thoroughly appreciated. Turns out Jakub has been at the Landmark for 15 years. That shows a LOT about the management of a hotel, when staff stay for years. Bravo Landmark. And thank you Jakub. See you again soon.",5,2023,08,21
106,Simply beautiful. Highly recommend.,"I was exceptionally lucky to win a  competition to have an Afternoon Tea at 'The Champagne Bar' at 'The Landmark'. What an incredible experience it was!

My husband and I are just so incredibly grateful to you all. THANK YOU.",5,2023,08,20
106,Champagne Bar and Afternoon Tea at the Winter Garden ,"My friend and I went for afternoon tea at the Winter Garden.  We went to the Champagne Bar to kickstart our treat and what an amazing experience this was, beautiful ambience and all. We were attended to by Venus who was extremely attentive and polite. She walked us through the cocktails menu and we thoroughly enjoyed our choice of cocktails. Not only did she care for our needs, she frequently checked in on us throughout ensuring we were fine, excellent customer service from beginning to the end. We then proceeded to the Winter Garden for our tea, ambience is lovely with the palm trees and the live pianist made it extra special. Again an impeccable service by the staff. Great selection of teas and cakes for the afternoon tea. Sandwiches were fresh, scones warm and cakes varied. Our sandwiches and tea was refreshed regularly and the service was attentive overall. Thoroughly enjoyable and would highly recommend. ",5,2023,08,19
106,The Champagne Bar,"I went to the Landmark and had lunchtime drinks at the Champagne Bar. The service was fantastic and memorable, most especially due to Venus’ attention and hospitality. She recommended an excellent cocktail and made it to the T. I’ve recommended the Champagne bar to others and they too have had an amazing experience! 10/10 service!",5,2023,08,15
106,Drinks at the Landmark’s Champagne bar,"I had a lovely time at the newly opened champagne bar. The service was great and the ambiance was cool. I was brilliantly advised by Venus who was very patient, knowledgeable and helpful. I will certainly return!",5,2023,08,14
106,Champagne bar,I had an amazing experience at the champagne bar! The server I had Venus was pleasant and professional. The space was comfortable. I look forward to coming there again. Thank you for such a nice experience! ,5,2023,08,14
106,"The best service from every member of staff we spoke to, but the beds were too small","When we walked into our hotel room I was blown away to find a tent with a new snakes and ladders game and two teddies in tiny bathrobes, as well as head torches. The kids thought it was brilliant! And any parent knows that if you’ve got happy kids then it makes life better.

The kids were also super happy to find that they each had a little bath robe and size appropriate slippers.

The only complaint about the room is the beds, they’re too small for two adults to sleep comfortably (for the price of the hotel room), it’s a standard double, and the bedding doesn’t seem very breathable. All four of us have woken up in the night sweaty and both my son and daughter have thought the bed was “wet” because they’ve been so warm.

However Aaron at the Mirror Bar made our stay very memorable with his impeccable service - he bought up cocktails to our room one evening and made sure to knock rather than ring the doorbell because our kids were asleep, and then when we visited the Mirror Bar for drinks one evening he listened to all of our feedback about cocktails we like and gave great recommendations and even played around with a few flavours for their autumn/winter menu. I adore the contrast between the five star hotel setting and Aaron’s tattoos and typical barman appearance - it made the visit very memorable and I would 100% recommend visiting for his cocktails!",4,2023,08,11
106,Frustrating experience with inexperience,"The initial impact of the inside of the building is very impressive. The décor and grandeur of the building lend itself to exceptional service. Sadly the service level fell well short of even the most basic 4 star hotel, not to mention 5 star. The inexperienced staff were like rabbits staring into headlights. This is not their fault as such, but reflects poorly on the management to put them in this position.
We had a series of issues which were related to the staff lack of knowledge, training and experience at the restaurant, bar and reception. We also had a basic issue with heating in our bedroom which seemed ridiculous for a premium room.
I sent the management an email during our stay outlining the issues and we got no reply. We did get a heater brought to our room. This was one of 5 issues we had highlighted.
We usually stay in London three times per year and have stayed predominantly in the Mayfair area. From our experience (even post Pandemic) we never experience this poor level of service in any of the hotels in Mayfair.
There was a massive skills and experience gap between a few who knew and many who didn't.
There was one, almost, saving grace in the outstanding doorman Rupert at the door adjacent to the Marlybone train station. He was fantastic, but sadly we only came across him on our final day.
We will be returning to Mayfair for our next visit.",2,2023,08,11
106,Exceptional Hotel,"What a fabulous hotel and the service is truly exceptional. We stayed in the Atrium Suite which was exceptional, as was the service from Josh, Karis and Alessandro. The cigar terrace offers a unique space and Aaron makes the best cocktails! We can’t wait to return.",5,2023,08,08
106,Wonderful!,"Thank you so much for your hospitality and warm welcome, Malisa and your fabulous team, Alessandro and Karis. Also need to mention Aaron at the Mirror Bar who made us some wonderful cocktails, and Eufelia who made our breakfast experience really enjoyable.",5,2023,08,07
106,ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT,"ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!

We were supposed to stay from 31 July until 11 August 2023 but we decided to move to another hotel on August 6. 

We opted to stay in a so called family suite which has 2 queen bed. Upon entry we see old condition room with a lot of room for much needed improvement. 

FIRST, Not enough wardrobe or cabinet to keep clothes. You need to use your own luggage to keep almost everything you have.
 
SECOND, air conditioning system is old and not working properly. There was loud squeaking noise coming out of machine all night when cooling system restart. 

THIRD, TV channel is very limited with many Arabic language channels and the rest not working well. 

FOURTH and most important is the Land Mark lacks proper security measure to protect guest privacy. We have received prank and mysterious call from other guest around 22:00 pm. Our daughter was frightened so we have call and reported this concern to Night Shift manager by the name of Olga. Not only did she not express or share our concern about this privacy violation act but simply told us nothing can be done and the call can not be traced back to original caller (even though it was a call from other room within the hotel). She also gave me lame excuse that the phone system has just been updated so this tracing feature is not functional.

If the hotel is serious about guest privacy and safety violation. THEY must take the matter more seriously and perhaps check CCTV camera and investigate who follow us or has unusual activity near our room or see us enter room. Imagine if you are a female guest or your female daughter is being stalked by an evil person in disguise as another paying guest yo do harmful things!!

Olga was speaking on behalf of the hotel so this means the hotel team doesn’t care about your business or perhaps they may know who did this prank to us but decided not to do anything , because these particular ethnic guest who flock London in summer to enjoy cool weather, may be The Land Mark’s majority guest. 

Gross discrimination, unsafe to stay (especially if you are female or has young daughter), disgraceful act and totally ignorance unprofessional senior staff who lacks common sense to response or address guest concern properly.

106,Must try harder,"We were welcomed by the doormen and staff into opulent surroundings just opposite the train station. Our room was ready and we went into a clean and well appointed room. I had advised we were staying for my wife's birthday prior to arrival and during dinner reservations but nothing was said. We did later receive a small cake but no real personal touch. We opted for dinner at the winter garden restaurant which was nice for the surroundings only. The service was poor in terms of timings and we had to ask for the dessert menu 3 times and the incorrect menu was provided. It was quiet and service was slow, we didn't mind as the location is nice however there is a limit and we felt ignored, food was ok. We didn't stay for afternoon tea as a result of this failing and spent our money elsewhere. I don't think I would be in a hurry to return based on cost versus service. I have eaten in many fine dining establishments and stayed in fine accommodation that do everything better than the Landmark. 3 star is fair based on my stay.",3,2023,08,01

Their manners and kindness, attention to details and way they welcome you as if you were at home it is second to none! And a special thanks to Adrien, Alessandro and the chef Mauro! See you soon the next time ;)",5,2023,07,21
106,"Great building, service would disgrace a Travelodge.","The Landmark’s building is stunning, and our first impressions were great. Really friendly, chatty, helpful doorman. Then we got to reception where only one couple were in front of us. Twenty minutes later still no sign of getting checked in, and apparently nobody available to help the one astonishingly slow lady on the desk. They did have someone to intercept a bored guest vaping within seconds though (no complaints there, but…)

We got our keys, and the room was fine. Quite spacious, view into the stunning atrium, bed very firm but comfortable, decent shower with stable temperature. 

A breakfast buffet was good, although again the breakfast reception staff were weirdly distant at arrival. Not unfriendly exactly, but no interest in talking, even when it would help the interaction. She wandered off, should we follow? No, apparently not, she’s just looking for tables. 

Last, after a long day and late night we planned a slow start to the day. Housekeeping rang the bell and came in at 08:25. Asked them to go away, but now we were up. After breakfast, at 10:50, they came into the room again, this time no bell. “We thought you might have just left the ‘do not disturb’ light on”. No, we didn’t want to be disturbed!

So yes, lovely building, some of the staff were very nice, nobody was rude, but 100% would not stay here again.",3,2023,07,13
106,Overnight stay ,Me and my partner had an amazing stay at the Landmark. It was my partners birthday and the staff couldn’t have made it more unforgettable!

All the staff here are very pleasant & helpful where nothing is too much trouble for them. 
The champagne bar was a new addition & a great experience. 

We used the pool this time which was lovely & the lady in the spa suggested a treatment while we were there which we took up. After a  relaxing massage we both left chilled & relaxed ready for dinner that evening. 

We enjoyed ourselves so much that we are returning for my husband’s birthday very soon.",5,2023,06,30

106,Avoid if you looking for a calm stay,"Booked the landmark me and my daughter to celebrate her end of exams and seek some nice time and tranquility together, unfortunately this isn’t the right destination for this.
The night of Saturday was true nightmare, my daughter and i couldn’t sleep due to a wedding downstairs, we were staying in the first floor room 120 that cost a significant amount of 700£ per night, the music was so loud in the room that the walls and floor were shaking.

This could be heard also in the video i recorded.

The night manager came only to apologise and say that there is nothing he could do. 
Around 11 pm we went to sit in the champagne bar upstairs and the manager came to say that he will let us sit there “exceptionally” because of the noise in our room,  ( as if he was doing us a favour) he stated that the hotel was fully booked otherwise would offer is another room.

15 minutes later after his departure we got kicked from the place because someone came to tell us that they has to clean the place.
This started at 6 and lasted until 1 am, as a troubled sleeper already i am still suffering from headache from that night.

We were never offered any kind of compensation or even an apology open checkout, i have travelled the world and stayed in many hotels but this was by far the worst stay  of my life.

This hotel want to have customers in the first floor but they don’t want to invest in insulation in order to make those rooms noise free, it is simply selfish and disgusting, i had a chat with the guys in the room opposite and they were also complaining from the horrible music background noise.

I am willing to file an official complaint to the relevant department.

If you want to stay in this hotel avoid the first and second floor at any cost because the hotel is more of venue destination rather than a hotel SPA place.",2,2023,06,27
106,Luxurious and comfortable hotel ,"Remarkable hotel! Its one of the most beautifully decorated hotels ive been to. Spacious halls and corridors, huge establishment, large rooms.

106,A few steps from a station and you enter another world,"The hotel was originally the railway hotel for the Great Central Line. Getting off a Chiltern Railways  diesel at Marylebone station lacks the glamour of arriving by steam engine.

A short walk across the road and your are welcomed by a doorman complete with top hat and the experience begins.

We had checked in by app, our room was not ready so we left our case and went out. 
On our return straight to reception and then upto the room, case to follow. To my surprise we had been upgraded to a suute.

Opening the door , the entrance  leads to the sitting room with a great view of the atrium. A bottle of Champagne and strawberries on the table.

Open the double doors and into the dressing area and bedroom.A very large and incredibly comfortable bed. The pillows are probably the best I have ever had . The feel of the sheets was likewise an experience.Beyond the dressing area a bathroom with bath, shower and closet.

The most dramatic feature is the atrium, unusual in a hotel of this age. The restraunt occupies this space. It is an impressive space. Service is disceet and efficient. The menu offers a good range of dishes for dinner.  One slight surprise was a modest wine cellar , but what we had was excellent. Breakfast at the weekend is a buffet and during the week continental is a buffet.

The spa is on the lower ground. It is an oasis of calm. A goid sized pool , gym and steam rooms. There is also treatments available.

This was an amazing 3 days and I am most grateful to the hotel and the staff.",5,2023,06,20

106,George is the best representative of the hotel experience Thank you!,"The Landmark is an exceptionally lovely hotel with all the amenities one would expect in lodging of this caliber. The location is so convenient to many of the areas in central London that are easy to get to by foot or taxi. There is one employee that stood out among the rest. I would like to give kudos to GEORGE, the first employee to welcome me when I arrived, and he continued to provide a sincere level of service throughout my visit. George is authentic and truly loves to be the first point of contact upon arrival. His smile and eyes radiate the joy he has in performing his duties for the benefit of the client as well as being a superb representative of the hotel. Throughout my stay, each time I saw George, I felt that he remembered me graciously and was so helpful. It's much more than a job for George, it's a passion! I wish the employees in the dining area had more of this passion. The dining experiences were good, the food excellent, but the attentiveness of the table waiters was a bit lax. The room was outstanding, clean, and comfortable. I would stay there again....a business traveler from AZ, over the Pond, USA",5,2023,06,01

Rooms are quite large and they make you feel at home. Housekeeping did not work well. Each morning prior to having Breakfast, I requested my suite to be cleaned. They failed twice in a row.
Shower head in the bathroom was entirely rusty. 
Breakfast in the gorgeous, large atrium was plentiful and had lot’s of different food options. The ordered food items 
such as a la carte eggs took the second morning forever. They came after about 30 minutes! 
The Spa area wasn’t such a great experience. The gym is outdated, it looks badly designed with old equipment, just all cramped in. For a decent gym, they would need at least twice the space they currently have.
The steam room didn’t have a very clean appearance, the odor was awful. In a upscale steam room of a five star hotel you would at least expect a automated scent dispenser. Paint on the ceiling is coming off everywhere.
Beside some misgivings, the stay was quite a good experience.",4,2023,05,30

My Uber dropped me at the rear of the hotel which is opposite the entrance of Marylebone train station and I received a lovely welcome from the doorman who directed me to the reception and took my luggage which was delivered to my room after I had checked in. The smell in the main reception was divine  (they do their own candle for purchase). Again the reception staff were friendly despite the computer systems being down and them reverting to paper !
The 3 days at the hotel were lovely we had a lovely room at the front of the hotel with a huge comfortable bed and lovely White Company toiletries in the bathroom.
We ate room service breakfasts which were delicious and served in a hot plate box type thing so was lovely and hot.
We ate lunches and dinners at the hotel and all the meals were delicious my favourite being Mushroom Welllington which was just amazing. At each meal my Mother was presented with a birthday cake with a candle which made her happy. We had a tea party where my Mother had additional friends and everybody commented how lovely the Afternoon Tea was the staff were lovely in ensuring that this went well which it did, again with lovely food.
Thank you for The Landmark for ensuring this special celebration went without a hitch which was enjoyed by all.
I will return for another visit.",5,2023,05,19
106,Robbed by hotel staff,"The hotel staff entered our room while we were out on a tour with a large group. A staff member went through our luggage and removed a Diamond pendant necklace , and $550 in cash. The hotel would not take responsibility because we did not put the valuables in the room safe. They recorded 7 entries into our room by checking the electronic lock on the door the day we were out on tours. 
The valuables were several layers deep in our suitcase. They made a strong effort to dig through the zippered pockets and compartments of the suitcase to hunt for the items. We made a police report, which was dismissed by the London police 15 minutes later because there were “no new leads”, 
We simply got robbed by the hotel staff at the Landmark London Hotel. It completely ruined our vacation,

106,Landmark London Hotel Stay,"Fantastic hotel in a great location for some of London's most iconic attractions for tourists. Special thanks to Dowson the Duty Manager who was very helpful and extremely polite, he was not only friendly and cordial, but he anticipated my every need, he made my stay Perfect. My stay was truly wonderful and fulfilling, an amazing trip and I had recommend The Landmark London Hotel to about anyone. I will definitely be returning to this hotel when I come back to London. I will take with me memories that will last a lifetime! ",5,2023,05,04
106,Fabulous Hotel in London,"We stayed in a family room. The room was spacious for four people. The hotel is beautiful. The breakfast was amazing - lots of very delicious options. The hotel sent a car to pick us up from the airport, which was also greatly appreciated. I would definitely stay here again. The service was outstanding. ",5,2023,05,03
106,Best Hotel Experience EVER!,"Celebrated my Mum's 80th birthday at the hotel and the stay was fabulous. The staff were amazing at every touchpoint from the doorman to the executive management especially Sarah who ensured everything went smoothly. 

We had afternoon tea for 17 people many elderly and the staff were kind, professional and patience and the food was absolutely wonderful. 

The Landmark made my Mother's 80th birthday an incredible, special memory for her and the family. We ate at many of the different restaurants and bars. The spa was also amazing and the gym and pool were both great as well.

I highly recommend this hotel. It is an incredibly special place.",5,2023,05,03
106,Beautiful hotel but probably not worth the price,"Pros:
- Great location, absolutely stunning lobby and bar
- Breakfast was incredible and service outstanding 
- Rooms were large, clean and quiet 
- The pool is warm and clean
- great little touches for children

A few things that would prevent me from booking again:
- very hard beds
- bathroom in family suite needs updating, there was peeling paint and the tub was just not very nice. For the price, I would expect a very nice stand alone tub in each room 
- as others have said the family suite is huge, and the beds could be larger
- our espresso was not restocked and when we asked for it they only left decaf",4,2023,05,01
106,Great place to bring your wife,"Great hotel and great facilities. An impressive first impression and overwhelmingly luxurious. Bring your wife here, she’ll love it. The pastries are excellent and so is the breakfast. Love the fact there are so many working here, you always find help.",5,2023,04,26
106,A truly delightful Afternoon Tea in an oasis of calm & elegance in the heart of London,"I remember years ago coming across a picture of the Landmark's grand Victorian glass atrium and very few places in the world still can match the enchanting experience of stepping into an oasis of palm trees and elegance in the heart of such a busy and vibrant town. 

The service is always impeccable, discreet with a great attention to detail from the refined cutlery and tea set to the dainty and delicate selection of pastries, my favourite being the Yorkshire Rhubarb Bakewell Tart served with either Orange Earl Grey or Mango tea.

May I please suggest that the talented Pasty Chef's name should be mentioned on the menu as the food delivery is truly consistently superb. 

Thank you for making each of my visits to the Landmark such an enjoyable and memorable experience !",5,2023,04,21
106,Always the best,"This is our fourth time at the landmark london and they never cease to amaze us. My husband and I absolutely love everything about this place. The room was spacious and clean with wonderful amenities. The best part is making memories with our 3 year old. He always has a great time staying here and loves the swimming pool. I love the fact the hotel has pool toys and accessories that make it so much easier for a toddler in a pool. The breakfast was amazing as always with a wide range of foods to choose from. I definitely recommend staying here, especially on special occasions, they always make your day.

P.S Thank you to the landmark team for the little birthday surprise. U made my day.",5,2023,04,20

106,Glad to be back after many years! Superb service.,I have visited the Landmark London many times over the years. The excellent service and fine finishes never fail to impress. On this visit I patronised the hotel’s Great Central Pub where Milan’s service to me and my guests was superb and made our evening. Shoutout also to Dawson at reception for his kind service.,5,2023,04,14
106,Absolutely great stay!,"This is probably one of the best hotels
I have ever stayed in.

The rooms were large, comfortable, clean and luxurious..

Breakfast was amazing and the staff everywhere was really attentive and helpful.

I just didn’t want to leave the hotel…

I also tried the pub on the lower ground floor and the food was great too!

I will

106,"Amazing luxury hotel with great rooms, fantastic staff and amazing food and drink","My wife and were both celebrating our 50th Birthdays and we had always wanted to stay at The Landmark. It was Total luxury with fantastic friendly staff, we arrived early where our room was upgraded and ready . Waiting in our room was a Birthday cake each. A visit to the spa is worth it before evening meal at the palm restaurant where Zoltan our server along with all the staff made us feel so welcome and the food was amazing and finally a drink in the Mirror bar was fantastic , well done Landmark we will defiantly be back",5,2023,04,10
106,Family treat,"We’ve tried various other 5 * hotels in London but I have to say this one is our favourite, fabulous rooms, excellent swimming pool which our granddaughter enjoy very much  .The service was excellent from everyone and the food was excellent it’s just a shame there is no more Sunday brunch",5,2023,04,10
106,Perfect stay,This is a stunning hotel with beautiful comfortable rooms in a great location central for everything in London. The staff are friendly welcoming and very professional. The public areas are comfortable and the restaurant was great for breakfast. A perfect stay.,5,2023,04,09
106,Great London Hotel,"Great Hotel with good amenities! Dowson the duty manager was incredibly polite and made our stay a memorable one!
Would definitly recommend this hotel, the location is also another good reason to stay at the Landmark!",5,2023,04,08

106,Memorable birthday weekend,"My friends and I had a great time at the Landmark London. We were celebrating my birthday and I had a good time. The hotel was clean, beautiful and we experienced good hospitality. We had dinner at Great Central Pub and Igor was wonderful. He took good care of us and the steak was delicious! We’re definitely looking forward to staying there again. ",5,2023,04,07
106,Excellent Hotel cnat wait to book again *****,"We have stayed here 4 times now and would not stay anywhere else in London.  Perfect hotel, all staff are amazing from the breakfast staff to the door men you can see they all love working at The Landmark.

The rooms/suites are outstanding so clean and beautifully kept our stay was very relaxing.  We had lovely cocktails in The Mirror Bar the Barman was excellent at making cocktails i had a Mariposa which was out of this world!!

Will definitely be re booking soon, we signed up to become ""Friends"" of the Landmark and look forward to returning very soon.

Don't change a thing its perfect!",5,2023,04,03
106,Amazing hotel,"Beautiful hotel, spas really nice, staff were all so nice and the breakfast was amazing. Rooms are so clean, just a really good hotel and will definitely return. Perfect for any occasion with family, friends or couples",5,2023,04,02
106,Poor customer service. Best avoid,"Very disappointed with our stay here. There are some positives, room was clean and the pub attached to the hotel was pleasant. The negatives are that the bed was very hard, the TV reverts to French(as was the same in our daughters room) 
The biggest problem we had was that we booked two rooms separately, when we booked the second room we were assured that it would be on the save rate as the first ie breakfast included. However we had to pay £42 extra for breakfast in the morning. At checkout the staff refused point blank to resolve the issue. The quality of the breakfast in question was very bad. Compared to a Langham or Cafe Royale breakfast it was dreadful and those are at similar price. In the name of customer service a £42 refund on a thousand pound bill (2 rooms one night dinner for two and a ghastly breakfast) would have been the best option. 

There’s a lot of much better hotels in London with better service at this price. Avoid",2,2023,04,02
106,Best 5 Star Hotel In London,"The Landmark Hotel is a fabulous hotel for a few days or longer stop over.  All the staff are helpful, well trained and motivated. 

The hotel facilities all work and offer that extra bit of luxury.

If stopping in London and not on a too bit a budget, make the Landmark your hotel of choice.  
",5,2023,03,31
106,Our 20th Wedding anniversary getaway,"Wow.. What a stunning Hotel.
From the moment me and my wife were greeted by the concierge to the moment we left it was amazing.
The staff are very pleasant and make you feel special and at ease, nothing is too much trouble for the people that make The Landmark what it is.. A truly 5* experience.
Thank you all, we will be back again. ",5,2023,03,31
106,Excellent but with some flaws,"Having stayed at the Landmark previously I knew to expect an amazing 5 star experience as far as service and comfort is concerned. This stay was just a little less special than in the past as the bed was way too firm to be comfortable. In addition, breakfast was not quite as good as it has been in the past with fewer selections. The coffee was not great and the tea not as special as it was in the past.
Overall these are minor quibbles but should be addressed for the hotel to continue to deserve it’s 5 star rating.",4,2023,03,29
106,A truly luxury hotel,"We booked a Marylebone Suite for 2 nights for a special occasion. Our room was not available for check in on time so we were offered another room of equal status and given a complimentary bottle of champagne. Very nice! The room was comfortable, spacious and very quiet despite being located right in the centre of London. All the staff we encountered were friendly, relaxed and keen to help. The Great Central bar downstairs is a great place to relax with an excellent selection of cocktails. We will be staying again in the not too distant future",5,2023,03,25
106,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I went to London for the weekend and stayed at The Landmark Hotel in Marylebone.
What a fantastic hotel.
We were upgraded to a suite and the stay just got better and better.
The staff were amazing, service impeccable with only one minor blip, which has become an amusing anecdote.
We decided to have high tea in the Winter Garden, a beautiful setting with a pianist accompaniment. When I asked for a table for two the front of house asked me if I knew it was £65.00 each…I wasn’t dressed particularly well but thought I looked like I could afford the tea. The high tea was lovely, my wife particularly enjoyed the salmon sandwiches.
Breakfast was very good and once again the service was faultless.
I would highly recommend The Landmark.",5,2023,03,24
106,Great experience ,"We had a great experience! Laura from Front Office was super nice and really helpful. We instantly felt very welcomed. On the other hand however, Rodica who worked at the breakfast area was not really nice and more like annoyed when we asked for coffee or juice. This should not be! 
Everything else was great, the spa area was lovely!",5,2023,03,22
106,Underwhelming,"The Landmark is one of London’s most iconic and prestigious hotels (you would think), but our experience was underwhelming. Check in was ok but at 3.30 pm there was apparently nowhere to obtain food and neither could we dine later on as the Winter Garden was fully booked and another venue was closed. I do understand that it would be wise to book in advance but this was an impromptu stay and therefore we were assuming there would be some means of eating. In the event we had to go out looking for somewhere. Anyway we then proceeded to the very beautiful and impressive Winter Garden for a drink, whereupon we were seated and then studiously ignored for a full 30 minutes. After about 20 minutes I went and enquired as to whether we could be served and the maitre’d looked me up and down snootily and said she would send someone over. But nobody came. After another 10 minutes we gave up. As we were leaving the Winter Garden I saw the maitre’d again and told her we had ‘given up’. At this point she just shrugged and said ‘OK’ as though we were in some fast food joint, not one of the most lavish and iconic hotels in the world. 

The hotel itself is lovely, including our room with a huge comfy bed, plenty of space, and peaceful sleep. But these are things you can only expect when paying hundreds of pounds for one night. We decided not to pay the requisite £72 for a fried egg and a couple of rashers of bacon in the morning. But if we had we would probably still be sitting there waiting to be served! 

In fairness when we complained to the reception about the appalling service in the Winter Garden, they were very apologetic and ended up giving us a complimentary bottle of wine, but by then the damage was done. Giving a free bottle of wine (the cheapest bottle on the menu) sadly does not alter the fact that within 30 minutes of walking into the building, we had received the very clear message that we were ‘nobody’ and that our business was unimportant to them. 

This is where The Savoy gets it right every time and in my experience is incomparable - every single guest who walks through their door is treated like royalty, even if they turn up on a bicycle taxi with only a rucksack, as I once did. I was still treated like a film star and it is a special experience and one you don’t forget. Sorry Landmark, you don’t even come close. I will always remember my first stay at the Savoy but I won’t retain any special memories of the Landmark and I’ll be going back to the Strand next time.",3,2023,03,20
106,Will always return-perfect service,"Second stay and truly first class service again. Only downside was the pool and sauna were offline. Doormen and concierge staff are some of the best assets the hotel has-knowledgeable, kind and often with a quick wit and humor that makes it a pleasant stay.",5,2023,03,18
106,There's no other place like The Landmark,"We had the most amazing stay! Comfortable large beds, spacious room and lovely view, we were looking right into the Winter Garden. Special thank you to Giulia who made our stay truly memorable. There's no other place like The Landmark hotel. ",5,2023,03,16
106,Beautiful Stay at the Landmark Hotel,"What a fantastic trip to London! The Landmark hotel itself was beautiful and generous including all services they offer. I’d definitely come back and strongly recommend it to my family and friends. Hailey at the front desk was kind, helpful and knowledgeable about restaurants and other places to visit. Still remember her smile:)) ",5,2023,03,16
106,Recommended - will come again,"Rooms spacious and well appointed. Mine below par in terms of view (Marylebone road, 1st floor), others should be better. Mattress and pillows ok but not great. Amenities fine.

Common spaces are Landmark’s strong point. Lobby wonderful any time of the day or evening. Easy to spend hours enjoying the light and sense of space.

Personnel highly effective and professional. No complaints there.

Check in experience not great. Had asked for earlier check in, eventually was notified half an hour after the 3 pm policy!

Overall a very good hotel. Definitely worth returning.",4,2023,03,14
106,Great food and venue and attentive staff,Classy hotel and restaurant with attentive staff and great food. I had the artichokes and my wife the beetroot and goats cheese. For mains we had the most tender beef imaginable. Quality red wine by the glass For dessert I had a good plate of cheese and my wife a slightly too sweet dessert.  Seeing that she had hardly touched it the waitress on her volition enquired and then the manageress came over and offered an adjustment to the bill which was much appreciated as all done without us making a big fuss,5,2023,03,12
106,What a fantastic hotel!,"Although travelled a lot, we have not met such a great hotel experience elsewhere. Our teenage children were absolutely thrilled about the room, facilities, location, and friendliness of staff. Receptionists, porters, and concierge - everybody so professional and smiling. Working myself in hospitality business, I know how hard it is to achieve - clients these days tend to find negative things more easily that positive ones. We had a short stay this time, but had time to visit the spa/gym because of the early opening hours, and it was an excellent experience.  It is not hard to see, why The Landmark is no 1 choice in London for so many guests staying in London. Nowadays hotels are lacking personal approach for customers, everything is automatic - but not in Landmark. This is why this hotel stands out and is an absolute pearl in busy city as London. We will come back and stay longer next time.",5,2023,03,11
106,Not helpful Concierge.,"Surprised my comment was deleted. I will repeat it. 

I was in hotel in January and  was going for a run. I was asking for directions where to go for a run and while I was at concierge desk the person was peering at me. He was looking at me from my shoes to my hair and I felt discomfort. The person was peering at me. Looked at me from the ends of my hair to my shoes. I felt uncomfortable and his intrusive glaring at me made me afraid.  I was asking for a map and was refused, they told, they don't have map. 
I asked also to buy me a tickets to Paris and concierge told me that there are no tickets available at the time when I was planning to go. I looked after and saw tickets online. Purchased and never again approached concierge desk. 
Very unprofessional staff. 
Don't know why my comment was deleted, but this time I am not saying who was the person. Maybe this is the reason? This hotel really needs to improve concierge knowledge and I will never again stay here.",1,2023,03,07
106,Excellent stay and spacious rooms,The hotel location is perfect and accessible from Marylebone Station and walking distance from Oxford Street and Regent’s park. The room is very very spacious and designed. Cloths closet and bathroom are clean and spacious as well. The facilities are nice including winter garden. Everything was fabulous though I still the hotel is pricey. ,4,2023,03,06
106,Special Thanks,Had an amazing stay here. I want to give a special thanks to Mo and Keith the concierge team who made my stay extra special by organising lots of my social plans. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back! ,5,2023,03,04
106,"Slice of paradise, with amazing service",Staying at the Landmark was an exceptional experience. The staff were amazing and professional. Ana checked us in and was extremely professional and polite. Josh blew us away with his hospitality and kindness. The high tea was the best we've had in London (having been to many of the best rated ones already) and the hotel facilities were top-notch. I'd highly recommend this little slice of paradise. ,5,2023,03,04
106,Wedding party,The dinner service on the first night in the Winter Gardens was poor. Hotel should add tv information in rooms & more lift signs!  Kamal Vlad and Jorge were utterly outstanding as our wedding staff.  ,4,2023,03,04
106,Truly 5*,"The Landmark London is simply the best hotel I have stayed in. It has that special feeling of a home away from home. Luxury, service and you can tell it has been maintained to a very high standard. 

Thank you, to all the staff that made our stay memorable!",5,2023,02,28
106,The landmark hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel twice and high quality of service and attention to details remains.The staffs are helpful and professional ,rooms are immaculate and comfortable.
I believe this hotel and rooms being maintained to high quality.
I would highly recommend this place and I will definitely go back there again .",5,2023,02,28
106,Poorly Organized,"The hotel seems to be confused about my booking. We booked a room with breakfast included as we always do. At check-in, the reception mentioned breakfast wasn’t included. When we asked to verify, he checked his computer again and said sorry, breakfast IS included. 

When we went for breakfast, a bill was presented and we were requested to pay. When we showed our booking confirmation which clearly stated breakfast is included, the ladies argued back that it wasn’t and to check with reception. All in all, very odd and in poor taste. 

Furthermore, Winter Garden is closed so breakfast was at the cafe/pub below which is very cramped. 

",4,2023,02,28
106,Pure luxury,"My wife myself and some friends were lucky enough to stay here over the weekend. You are made to feel so welcome from the moment you are greeted at the door. The Landmark is classic luxury in every way. Rooms are extremely spacious and have everything you need. I don’t think I have ever had such an incredible breakfast. Absolute quality with something for everyone. The winter garden where you sit for breakfast is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of central London. 

I would like to say a particular thank you to Malisa who helped arrange our rooms. 

I personally prefer to always try different things and places to stay however it will be hard to stay anywhere else when visiting London. 

Thank you 

Jamie",5,2023,02,27
106,Amazing staff,"Amazing experience as always. Staff, room, food, service, facilities - everything top class. Malisa Shepherd in the management team went above and beyond for us, handled our requests with a genuine care, a true credit to the hotel.",5,2023,02,27
106,"Very good, not quite perfect","It's an absolutely GRAND hotel. All the pomp and circumstance you could want. The winter garden is a spectacular sight, airy and massive. The breakfast is world class and the dinner is actually priced better than I expected (there's a 3-course set menu for £55 and  a few possibilities in that range from the à la carte menu). The personel is incredibly attentive and remembered us and our room number, even though we stayed for just one night, very, very high end service. 

The couple of things they didn't do so well are: 

-Pool: the pool was not clean, there were clumps of hair in several places and generally more than water in the pool. Bit of a bummer, really. 

-Scent: this is a Grand Dame hotel, with carpets everywhere, and these are clean (though they do hold stains), but on the floors, the smell was one of carpet, I would have expected a hotel of this stature and price to have nice fragrance dispersed across the floors & lightly in the rooms.

-Taxi: the old school doorman is certainly part of the experience, but at 8.00AM on a Wednesday, I wish he had had a number to call or an app to use to get us a taxi in less than 10mins—in the end, I had to call my own with FreeNow.",4,2023,02,23
106,Historical hotel with excellent service,"This hotel’s architecture, design and historical connection to the railway makes it unique. The facilities and quality of the room was excellent. We didn’t dine In the hotel so we can’t comment on the food. The Mirror Bar was a nice place to spend the evening. The service from all the staff was superb, they were kind and welcoming towards children.",5,2023,02,22
106,Best hotel in London,"I was the organiser and host for a 400-person function in the Grand Ballroom and from start to finish, every single member of staff at the hotel was nothing less than exemplary in their service, experience and friendliness.
On the day, we were treated like royalty and nothing was too much problem, from check-in, Jakob the concierge and every member of the hospitality staff went out of their way to make sure our event went off smoothly.
I cannot praise the Landmark highly enough.",5,2023,02,21
106,Lovely 2nd visit!,"Lovely one night stay in a beautiful and spacious room. Our room was very quiet, backing on to Marylebone Station. We were treated wonderfully on our previous stay and this time around was even better. Breakfast here is one of my favourites!",5,2023,02,19
106,"Looking for an amazing experience in London? Search no more, go to the Landmark Hotel","Of the numerous hotels in London, I would highly recommend the Landmark Hotel (Marylebone) where I stayed for a night with breakfast included in an executive room. 

The hotel:
The first thing that you notice about the hotel is how beautiful the building itself is, and you find yourself taking a beat before entering  the hotel, just to take it all in. 
The main entrance with the steps leading to the Winter Garden is breathtaking, and once you've reached the atrium you can see how spectacular it is. It's quite a sight honestly and it's not common to see an atrium this size. 

The room
I stayed in an executive room with my partner and was blown away by the size of it. It had a big living-room, leading on to a massive bed, a big bathroom,  and was extremely comfortable and well-decorated. 
If you book the room, make sure that it overlooks the atrium for an added ""wow factor"".

The Spa
Great amenities, decent-sized pool, ideal to relax after the jacuzzi. We got lucky as there was not a lot of people but would imagine it can get a bit crowded at times. 

The breakfast
We went for breakfast which is composed of a continental buffet with everything you can dream of, from French toast and pancakes, all the way to eggs Benedict, grilled aubergines and hummus.  The breakfast caters for everyone and every taste. It's hard not to get up for seconds. Or thirds. 

The staff
Lovely and helpful staff from start to finish with the perfect amount of discretion and helpfulness.  The reception ladies were lovely and smiling, the Spa staff was very nice, while the breakfast staff was really helpful, smiling, and would bring you what you need / want in under a second.

TL/DR: great stay at the Landmark ! 

",5,2023,02,17
106,Valentine/birthday stay,"This hotel is grand. Rich in history, from the doormen to the reception staffs to housekeepers. 100%. This is an hotel that’s catered to royals and famous people and they truly understand hospitality. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. It’s not cheap but worth every penny.",5,2023,02,16
106,Perfect on many levels,"As you walk into this wonderful hotel you cannot fail to be impressed by the decor & splendid feel of the reception & beyond. That splendour continued with our stunning large room. Well furnished, light & oozing the relaxed comfort that rightly comes with 5 stars. Just one night for us followed by an awesome breakfast in the truly beautiful surroundings of the Winter Gardens. Really couldn’t fault anything, We will definitely return. 
Also an excellent location with direct access to London Tube or a nice stroll into the West End",5,2023,02,10
106,Friendly environment at the Landmark!,"I stayed at the Landmark for a prolonged period of time between September 2022- December 2022 and I am back now again starting February 2023. The Landmark Hotel is my home away from home I guess you could say. I love the location and I especially love the staff there! Shoutout to my favorite doorman Orlando Hamilton who always says hello with a big smile on his face and listens while I chat away as I am so far away from family. I would highly recommend the Landmark for a luxury stay in the city that still has that quaint and friendly environment. Great for families, solo travelers and those on medical leave. Will be staying here again!",5,2023,02,10
106,Excellence as always!,"My partner and I celebrated our anniversary at the Landmark and as usual everything was just perfect. The deluxe room we booked was lovely and grand and very comfortable. The hotel staff provided a few surprises for us to help us celebrate and that was a fantastic gesture, which we really appreciate. We had our anniversary dinner in the Winter Garden restaurant, which is such a beautiful setting and as expected the food and service were 5 star. Overall this is an excellent hotel and such an amazing place to stay!",5,2023,02,03
106,Lovely service,"I've been in the garden terrace today and I've been welcoming by the lovely Maria. She has been extremely helpful about our allergens. 
She raccomend the poke bowl salad and it was delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and spotless.
We will definitely come back.",5,2023,02,02
106,THE BEST IN LONDON!,"We live just outside of London but we like to come and stay in town every now and then. We absolutely love it here at the Landmark!

I’ve stayed a few times and would never choose anywhere else - it’s perfect. 

We actually stayed this time as I got married on the 2nd February and couldn’t think of a better place to be. The hotel were amazing and surprised us at every meal, also left champagne and chocolate strawberries in our room on arrival. 

Orlando who works on the door completely made this trip for us. He took time to get to know us and we were always greeted with a big smile! Cannot wait to come back and see his smiling face again soon. 

Food - amazing. 
Staff - amazing. 
Hotel - amazing. 

Thank you Landmark for making this super special day even more magical!",5,2023,02,02
106,A beautiful oasis experience in the heart of London,"I stayed with my friend (Mrs Truslove) for her birthday and it was lovely, we had an executive room, which was clean and spacious with views over looking the beautiful winter garden. The staff were lovely from the moment we arrived and never too far away to assist with any requirements. Orlando on the door is lovely to have a chat with and find out where to go and local things to do. The only slight downfall (and this is personal preference) the mattresses were quite hard.",5,2023,01,31
106,Lovely family get away!,"Myself and my two children (9&7) spent our weekend at the landmark on their family getaway. The room was spacious and included a tent, teddies, cookies and head torches for the kids!  
The swimming pool was perfect after a day out and about and again in the morning before we left. 
Breakfast was beyond amazing!
I’d recommend this for a special night away, the staff were all lovely and the extra touches made it all so special!",5,2023,01,29
106,World Class Service,"After months of searching and comparing, I settled on The Landmark for our first trip to London three years ago.  Their rate was far less than other five star hotels and the rooms were much larger.  During our first trip, one of the things that impressed me the most was that when we left London to go to Scotland for a week, concierge let us leave our excess luggage with them since we'd be returning to the Landmark afterward.  The room service was so good that we had that every night instead of going to a restaurant.  There were also little things like mailing our postcards for us and bringing me a fan so I could sleep.  If you know, you know!

The first person we met upon our arrival three years ago was a doorman named Rupert.  He was so kind, incredibly friendly, and very knowledgable about the city.  He made us feel welcome from the very first moment we spoke!  We saw Rupert every day as we were leaving to go explore and he always asked us our plans and made recommendations if we asked him for any.  When we started  to plan our December 2022 trip, we knew immediately that we'd be staying at The Landmark simply because of Rupert!  It has become our favorite London hotel thanks to him,  Every single person we encountered has always been incredibly friendly and helpful.  We always feel welcome here.

If you like a nightcap before bed, do yourself a favor and have a drink at the Mirror Bar.  There's nothing like a craft cocktail made by someone who really knows what they're doing.  The breakfasts as well as the Afternoon Tea as the Winter Garden are incredible as well.  If you want to go out to eat, there are restaurants and pubs in walking distance.  The Landmark gives you everything you need, at a very good rate, and they treat you like you belong.",5,2023,01,28
106,A wonderful experience,"One of the nicest hotels, in which we have stayed. Two nights in London for a short post Christmas break, and this was the perfect place.

The staff could not be faulted and the service here is top class.

The Winter Garden restaurant is the main feature with the rooms positioned round this central area.  Very beautiful and tranquil with a piano playing at times. We had a coffee and snacks in this area during the stay.

The Deluxe Room was fantastic and the bathroom well laid out with separate shower and bath. Comfortable and stylish. There was no awkward flip top bin in the bathroom either, with is something I hate. 

I never got to grips with the TV and found the system fiddly and utterly failed to remove the subtitles from the screen. In the end I gave up and didn't bother. There were many channels however to chose from.

All in all, I can't think of anything other than that to irritate, the place is gorgeous, the staff terrific and we booked another stay before leaving.

Fantastic.",5,2023,01,27
106,One of the best hotels for sure.,"I have tried most of 5* hotels in London, and Landmark is my favourite. Price/quality is the best in London. All staff are very professional and courteous. The best breakfast out of all 5* hotels I've been to. A real 5* experience that many other hotels are missing. I have been there a few times on my own and with a family once. Always satisfied with my stay. Will be coming back soon.",5,2023,01,26
106,My favourite hotel in London!,"Such a wonderful and friendly 5* hotel. Staff couldn't do enough to help and assist me. Took the children for Afternoon Tea which we all absolutely loved.  The scones and cakes just kept coming, as a the champagne! Spacious and beautiful rooms, what a hotel! Across the road from Marylebone Station, it even has a canopy to stop you getting wet from the station! I will be back!",5,2023,01,23
106,Incredible stay at a beautiful and luxurious hotel,"We spent one night at The Landmark London for our 10-year anniversary. It was an absolutely incredible experience, with lots of special touches that made it unforgettable. 

The hotel itself is spectacular - its history is fascinating (I recommend googling it!) and its architecture and decor are opulent and breathtaking. So many unique photo opportunities (the indoor palm trees, the gilded staircases!) 

Our room was beautiful (especially the bathroom!) and the hotel had left us a little treat for our anniversary for us on our arrival. 

We had dinner in the Winter Garden with a pianist creating a really lovely atmosphere. I had salmon, my husband had steak - it was delicious. 

We had a drink at the hotel bar which was a real highlight - highly recommended! I had the best Whisky Sour I've ever tasted, and sat up at the bar - we had a really entertaining view of the mixologist making some really fancy cocktails. 

We spent time in the Spa, which was tranquil (not too busy, spotlessly clean, and relaxing). And my husband used the gym, which was pleasantly surprisingly well-resourced for a hotel gym. 

The staff at all turns were friendly and let their personalities shine through (which we really appreciate as we love having a chat!). They couldn't have been more helpful and attentive.  

We would love to return - after an unforgettable experience.",5,2023,01,22
106,The Landmark is MAGICAL & AMAZING!!!,"My experience at the Landmark Hotel was INCREDIBLE!.

The friendly professional was 10/10 and the entire stay magical. The room service is quick  and the maids helpful and friendly, they really go above and beyond. 

Dinner and lunch were absolutely delicious. My Ceasar salad was the freshest I have had in a long time and the shrimps were fresh and perfectly seasoned and cooked. 

Thank you Landmark for making a special occasion even more amazing!
",5,2023,01,22
106,No regrets whatsoever,"The room, the environment, the staff and most definitely the breakfast are all amazing. Would defiantly love to go back to it again next time visiting London.  My only one critique if I must would be no space to put your bags in the room.",5,2023,01,18
106,Birthday celebration,"2 night visit for birthday celebration. Beautiful hotel and the room was amazing. They brought me a delicious birthday cake which was a lovely surprise. Spa facilities were great, very clean and relaxing. The staff were very attentive and eager to please, especially the doormen. Big shout out to Rupert who was so very friendly and helpful! We are already planning our return visit.",5,2023,01,18
106,Great place at good location,"We stayed at The Landmark for a family weekend in London with two small children (3 and 4). All went really well. When arriving at the hotel (easy accessible by the tube) at 9:10 in the morning we were informed our room was already available. 
The rooms are spacious and comfortable and have a stylish English feeling. Especially the fact that the rooms are spacious helps when travelling with a family as it allows for the children playing in the room (building a hot wheels track definitely works).

We went for drinks when the kids were sleeping in the mirror bar and had good cocktails in proper hotel bar. The breakfast is exactly what you wish for with sufficient choice, good seating and very friendly staff. We have also had dinner in the winter garden (without children) which was also good food with friendly service. 

The pool is of good size, good temperature and there are fixed children ours. 

The location is convenient with the Marylebone tube station opposite of the north entrance and many attractions nearby.

All staff has been very friendly, welcoming and providing good service.

We have stayed at The Landmark 10 years ago and have stayed at other hotels in London since as we felt it could do better, but The Landmark has put it self back on the list so we will return for sure.
",5,2023,01,17
106,Birthday treat,"My partner arranged a weekend here at the Landmark for my birthday.
A little birthday cake was left in our room upon arrival. Really nice touch but card was addressed to my partner not me.
Upon check in he was addressed incorrectly, although both of our names were on our booking.
Attention to detail matters and should be the norm in hotels of this calibre.
We had a Deluxe room which was massive and had 2 beautiful huge windows.
Bed was enormous and comfy. Pillows plentiful but some flat - needed replacing. Linens pristine.
However the decor & bathroom in particular were very tired and in need of refurbishment. Shower sluggish with difficult to adjust dial.
The hairdryer didn’t work, so we needed to request another. No body wash included with White Company toiletries. Rang to request from Housekeeping, but more shampoo and body lotion brought to the room again instead.
Staff were all great & doing their absolute best. 
We had breakfast one morning.
This was superb, but no bubbles included, which at Landmark prices we’d have expected.
Jacklyn was an amazing beauty therapist who gave me a fabulous facial and body treatment. Expensive but worth it.
Pool and jacuzzi really nice.
Really disappointed that the steam room was out of order.
Pub offered good quality food. Ploughman’s and hand cooked chips delicious. Music far too loud though, especially late afternoon.",4,2023,01,10
106,Not the five star experience we expected,"The check in was one of the worst we ever experienced - not a smile, not a welcome to the hotel, just a handover of the key. We had to ask where the room was and how to get there, where and what time was breakfast. Then we asked if the pub was open only to be told that they weren't sure. Well, maybe they could find out for us? Even that seemed too difficult. It's hard to get over a first impression like that.

The room on the sixth floor (an upgrade to a deluxe room for us as we are LHW members) was very cute with little windows overlooking the rooftops. It was spacious and nicely decorated but freezing cold. The windows let in a draught the whole time and the heating couldn't really keep up. The windows had wooden shutters which let through both light and cold at night. Curtains or blinds would make a huge difference. The bathroom was also spacious but there was no towel rail for the bath towels which should be a pretty standard item really. There was an empty mini bar fridge in the room which seemed odd. Either fill it (even with the complimentary bottles of water) or remove it. We were welcomed in the room with a plate of fruit and some delicious Christmas decorated macarons.

We went down to the spa where we got a nice tour and told that the steam room was in the changing room and that we would find everything we needed in the lockers. So it was a disappointment to go into the changing room and find the steam room was out of order (and they had no idea what was wrong with it or how long it would be out of order) and the lockers mostly empty of towels, robes and flip flops. The jacuzzi and pool were very nice though.

Breakfast was randomly in either the lovely atrium or a large conference room, not quite sure why it wasn't in the atrium every morning which would have been much nicer. When it was in the atrium, even though there were huge numbers of staff around and lots of empty tables, a queue formed every morning (maybe a couple of staff on the welcome desk rather than just one?). On our first morning we were seated but nobody offered an explanation of how the breakfast worked. When we asked, the waiter said we could order a la carte if we wanted, however there was no menu so we weren't really sure how that worked.

We ate at the atrium restaurant one night and the food was very good and offered good value for money, even though only a three course set menu was offered that night. The pianist was fantastic and created a lovely atmosphere. We ate at the pub one night which was a bit chaotic and not quite as good food (very bland 'spicy' cauliflower tempura). The mirror bar was lovely and had friendly staff and great cocktails.

Turn down service was cursory and not even a chocolate was offered.

The friendliest staff were the doormen who always offered a smile and cheery comment when we entered or exited.

The location is good, right opposite Marylebone station and lots of places to eat and drink within walking distance. Selfridges was within walking distance too.

Check out was not much better than check in and I wasn't even asked how my stay was.

All in all we wouldn't stay here again.",3,2023,01,10
106,"A beautiful, grand hotel/resort with excellent service","We stayed at the hotel for a whole week for the holidays. It is our second time at The Landmark and it was lovely as we remembered. The hotel was very busy and as i understood fully booked, yet service was still quick and efficient. The hotel itself is magnificent with the winter garden in the center of it with palm trees and a glass ceiling which give a real special ambiance. The hotel is ""old-school"" style which we prefer over the ""modern"" looking ones as it doesn't look like a plain ""business"" hotel.  We stayed at a Marylebone Suite which was very spacious and well equipped. One point the should be improved these days is additional power/USB sockets near the bedsides. Bathroom was spacious with walk-in shower and a bath. Cleanliness was spot on. Breakfast was excellent with a nice selection. They have a ""continental"" one which is mainly a cold buffet and a ""full English"" one that adds warm plates such as eggs and more. We believe that eggs should be part of the continental one (English one is charged extra). Also, since we stayed for a whole week, we noted that even if there was a nice selection, it was the same every day, we would expect a little more diversity. The staff is efficient and welcoming which we appreciated. Room service was also quick and served day and night. There is a nice indoor pool which is great for the cold weather and a Spa for people looking for treatments (although we just used the pool). The Gym is very nice and well equipped. The hotel is not exactly in the center (15min walk from Oxford street) but is opposite to the Marylebone train station which has no noise effect in the rooms but provide and easy and efficient connection to whole of London and outside as well. Great hotel, will love to come back again.",5,2023,01,08
106,Fabulous Afternoon Tea on New Year’s Day,We had Afternoon Tea in the beautiful Winter Gardens Atrium (High Palms). The food was exquisite and included freshly prepared gluten free for our teenagers. Both sandwiches and desserts were delicious and we wished this down with LP Rose (well it was New Year’s Day). The Chinese lady playing the piano was concert standard. We were looked after by the Maitre d and all in all it was a lovely experience and my good lady tells me this was the best Afternoon Tea with The Ritz at number Two; I think they were equal but definitely both are worth doing so you can make your own judgement !!,5,2023,01,05
106,Amazing five star London Hotel,I have stayed at The Landmark a few times now. It truly is a lovely London hotel. The rooms are very spacious. The breakfast in the splendid Wintergarden is excellent with a wide variety of food. The service is professional and friendly - you really feel looked after. The hotel is only a few tube stops away from the West End and is well located for travel to airports etc. Highly recommend.,5,2023,01,02
106,Very rude staff,"I am very sorry that I don't speak English so I will use google translate. I stayed at this hotel with my friend and after waiting for our bags for at least 30 minutes they brought them to us. A young man just threw them on the floor and said nothing. I kindly asked him to put the bags on the bench by the bed and I thought he was angry about it. I thanked him for that, but he didn't say a word. I felt very uncomfortable and waited for my friend to come back from the reception because one of our keys didn't work. The young man did not leave the room for long and I thanked him again for bringing the bags and he stayed in the room after that as well. After about 10 minutes my friend came back and only then he left. I asked what the young man's name was and he rudely replied Mohab. my experience was not the most pleasant, because this person did not smile and did not consider it necessary to greet me when he entered the room and when he left.
Booking was under my friends name.",1,2023,01,01
106,A City Gem with Great Location,"A fantastic gem in the centre of London. A hop and a skip away from Marylebone Train Station (with its own entrance to it).

The restaurant was fantastic for breakfast in the morning - I would recommend getting down for food earlier in the morning to avoid a brief wait / queue. 

The rooms were clean and safe and well decorated with a lovely view of the indoor entertainment area (also where breakfast is held).

Overall, the staff were fantastic and attentive and we will definitely be staying again.",5,2022,12,31
106,Choose another hotel if thinking off stopping here,"This is not an adult only hotel but restrictions on children using the pool , was given 3 different times in two days.  So your in London sight seeing etc, but have to work your days out so you can take your children swimming. When I question the staff they said it’s the hotels rules, this doesn’t make it right. I didn’t receive an  email prior to my stay to inform me of this. 
They were dirty plates and food left consistently in the hall way going to our room. 
The check in is 3pm, but most people being told there room was not ready this was at 3:30 some people being told it would be 45 minutes before their room was ready. 
They were big queues for breakfast 10 to 15 people waiting to be seated. 
I’m sure for this kind of money things should be a lot better. 
I would not recommend and will be looking for somewhere different next time. 
When I complained the response was I will pass your feedback on, sure you will doesn’t help my stay! Maybe a manager should have been coming to discuss my issues.",1,2022,12,29
106,Outstanding Christmas memories made!,Our stay at The Landmark London was OUTSTANDING!  We have stayed several times before a this experience even outshined those lovely holidays.  Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and helpful and the special touches they arranged were so appreciated.  I highly recommend The Landmark London!  ,5,2022,12,28
106,Terrible experience,"I was here for our family event and upon arrival nobody was able to take our staff to the room. I asked man at the door if I can take trolley and do it myself. He agreed. I put all my items on trolley and wanted to move it, but couldn't. There was two empty tyres.

Changed to another and same problem. Trolley with empty tyre. I was pushing this trolley to my room and it took me good 25 minutes. Trolley wasnt heavy, just some flowers.

Terrible experience that there are no enough people who would help me and than this problem with trolley.",1,2022,12,27
106,Wonderful stay away..⭐️,"What a delightful stay myself and my family have recently had at The landmark Hotel.
Truly outstanding in every way,
From being greeted through the door to receiving a very personal welcome card which awaited in our room for us,
As they say , it’s the small details that matter most.

Thank you so much to everyone that made our stay so rememberable,
We will see you again ….😊😊
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Warmest regards,

Mr Stuart Heather .",5,2022,12,20
106,Awful survive and aftercare  - Terrible especially during Christmas time.,Logged  a complaint about the service received when we came to stay with you and the recent “aftercare” with the hotel; the hotel has serious issues with communication and guest relations. The service does not represent the hotel brand and this includes senior members of staff who simply do not care about reputation.,1,2022,12,15
106,A touch of class.,"Was lucky enough to stay here back in August for a nights and was blown away.
The level of service, cleanliness and facility are faultless. All this coupled with a beautiful building with history,  furniture and a great Heath club you could do an awful lot worse. If you fancy a treat do it, you won’t regret it.",5,2022,12,12
106,Perfection.....perfection.....perfection!,"My Mother and I recently stayed at The Landmark London for a University of Kentucky Men's Basketball game at the 02 Arena.  The Landmark was true perfection, from start to finish. The staff was incredibly friendly, the rooms were clean and well-appointed. Each meal was prepared with love and care.  The High Tea was our favorite, and well worth the money. The desserts were beautifully decorated, and we loved sitting by the Christmas tree, while enjoying the music of the very-skilled pianists.  Thank you to all for such a lovely stay.  Have a Merry Christmas!!!!",5,2022,12,12
106,Lovely holiday stay at The Landmark,"The staff at this hotel is outstanding.  I especially warmed to Rupert at the front entrance who asked me about our trip each morning as we were departing for the day.  The room we had was spacious, luxurious & comfortable.  Each time we encountered an issue, which was only twice, the response from staff was speedy & friendly.  The spa was lovely, one of the best massages I've ever had performed by Mario.  Wonderful location & I highly recommend this property!",5,2022,12,09
106,Hostel level treatment in a beautiful historic building,"This doesn’t come near what a five star experience should be. 

The rooms look like a slightly glorified version of an airport Marriott, the service is slightly above that of a hostel and not personalized nor often avaliable. There wil be strange conferences going on through paper thin walls and the minibars in the room are crappy little empty fridges. It’s 3 star service in a beautiful building.

Come for tea. Maybe the spa. 
But if you are expecting a five star hotel there’s a myriad of other options. This experience was a laugh.",1,2022,12,07
106,Amazing experience!,"We went to celebrate mum's birthday with all family to Great Central pub in Landmark hotel. Absolutely amazing experience! Very cozy environment, great food and incredible service!Special thank you goes to Igor, Michael, chef Stuart and Agata. Will recommend to anyone who wants to have a great evening ",5,2022,12,06
106,Fabulous Festive Afternoon Tea,"First visit here for us but hopefully the first of many. The Winter Garden is a beautiful setting for afternoon tea, extremely relaxing, but spacious with a lovely atmosphere. Very attentive staff & happy to suggest alternatives - for example, we didn't want the champagne included with the tea so were offered mocktails, which we declined but nice to be asked. The tea was super hot, the scones stayed warm despite us eating them last & each little cake & sandwich was fresh & delicious.
Being Christmas the decorations made the visit extra special, particularly the large gorgeous tree & the delightful pianist playing subtle Christmas tunes.  Final point is we enjoyed experiencing such luxury without having to go into the bustle of the West End of London & loved that we could easily park in nearby Dorset Square. Even without a car, it's so close to underground & mainline networks. We'll be back",5,2022,12,05
106,Landmark Quality,"The Landmark Hotel is pure quality.  The staff is very warm and welcoming, the accommodations are superb, and the meals are delicious.  Being across the street from Marylebone Station is a plus.

If you want a real treat, stay at the Landmark. ",5,2022,12,02
106,Afternoon Tea,"Wow, what a amazing experience we had, not only was the Service fantastic, the Selection of Tea's the Sandwiches, Scones with jams and Cakes, were some of the best we have ever had, we will definitely be going back for than Afternoon Tea next time. ",5,2022,12,01
106,Afternoon tea,"Went to have afternoon tea with the family. Beautiful hotel and surroundings. All staff from doorman to all waiting staff were excellent, very polite, friendly and professional. Great sandwiches and cakes. Tea was being constantly being topped up as so we're the sandwiches. This is my 2nd time at this hotel and standards are always very high.",5,2022,12,01
106,Poor experience.,"Generally forgotten about...  Slow service, cold, salty and dry food for my children (on multiple occasions)... 

But what grates me the most is that we were promised a callback to address these issues.    No one called, so we called the hotel.  Again promised a callback after they look into the issues - no one called back.

Relayed my frustration to colleagues who furnished me with emails of the manager and executives.  Emailed them, no reply.

Either everyone is extremely busy on something far more important, or I have recently become invisible...

Either way, a once favourite hotel is crossed off my list never to be visited or recommended again.  Maybe another casualty of rising costs where service levels pay the price.

",2,2022,12,01
106,Pure luxury and a home away from home!,"The most memorable stay of all times! A home away from home and an oasis in the heart of London. The staff is absolutely exceptional, nothing is too much trouble and everyone goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. At the Landmark London you can expect hospitality that comes straight from the heart. We did not want to leave and will hopefully be able to return soon. If in doubt of which hotel to choose in London, look no further than The Landmark, you will not be disappointed. Thank you to everyone! ",5,2022,11,30
106,Afternoon tea in The Winter Garden,"We had the most wonderful time for afternoon tea.
My 2 friends and I go every year and this was one of our favourites. The food was great. They come around with more sandwiches more than once. Tea is continually topped up and renewed. The cakes and scones were delicious. We ordered a bottle of champagne and my friend spilt her glass. They moved us to a clean table and got another bottle of champagne to refill the spilt one and topped the other two up. The staff were attentive but not in your face. We had a fab time",5,2022,11,27
106,A perfect hotel in London ,"We have stayed at the Landmark for one week. The traditional building with huge Atrium is beautiful. We have appreciated the good food, the friendly staff, the Molton Brown products in the  bathroom and just everything. Thank you very much!",5,2022,11,21
106,Beyond Expectations,"A fantastic hotel and experience from the moment you walk through the doors.

The lobby /atrium areas of the hotel really are something special and unique. Having breakfast or coffee in the centre of the hotel is well worth it.

As you would expect, the rooms and service are top end and the staff throughout the hotel were exceptional. A special shout out to Michael Blin - what a great host and ambassador for the hotel",5,2022,11,18
106,Great pub at The Landmark by Marylebone station - perfect relaxed evening,"Well had a great family reunion at Grand Central Pub last night, great food, roaring fires, well priced everything - met Matt Fletcher the chef patron - top guy passionate about food. Great place to meet when you are on the Chiltern line - lovely night before popping over the road to get the train home! We will be back!",5,2022,11,03
106,Horrible experience as a regular of the hotel,"I’ve been a regular at the landmark hotel for many years but its been my first year back since covid, i booked the same room i always stay at (family size) and upon arrival the room was much smaller than expected. I was sharing the room with 2 other friends and the room had no space at all (keep in mind we informed them that there would be 3 guests in the room prior) no extra bed was added. We went to the reception to speak them and the gentleman didnt believe me at first when i told him the room was definitely smaller than what i was used to until he pulled up my reservation history, to which he admitted the rooms i would stay at were larger. He called over the manager Magdi to help resolve the issue and this is where it all went downhill, Magdi started off the exchange being very condescending and trying to get rid of me apposed to helping us reach a happy medium, his only solution was “if you need to fit an extra bed we can always add one next to the bathroom” im not exactly sure what type of 5 star hotel would mind having its guests sleep next to the bathroom door. I asked him why their website said the room fit 4 adults when clearly it doesnt fit 3, he claimed that wasnt true (you can check the website, it says it big enough for 4 adults) from this point forward he started yelling, holding up the whole reception to create an embarrassing fiasco explaining to us how “things are done in England” the crowd of people waiting were clearly disgusted by his behavior so i decided to ask him if he was happy with this resolution (which was no resolution) and if he was happy with unsatisfied guests he yelled back that he was, extremely poor customer service.. a resolution doesnt always have to be reached but speaking with some decency and class is the bare minimum . I should have known the landmarks standards had dropped when as soon as we were waiting at the reception 2 complaints had happened with no resolution also, and the hotel constantly smelled of wet dog. Only positive thing i can say was the door man Orlando was always a joy to speak to and get restaurant suggestions from.",1,2022,11,02
106,Perfection,"An oasis in the middle of London to enjoy a truly five star experience with relaxing atmosphere and pleasant, attentive staff. Dinner in the Winter Garden was exceptional as was the selection of breakfast choices. The bedrooms are bigger than your average London hotel. The spa area has a serene feel with non chlorinated pool water and lowered temperature steam room. The location is very convenient but less noisy compared to the Hyde Park area. Would definitely like to stay again.",5,2022,10,30
106,Outstanding Service,"I had the most amazing experience at The Landmark over the last 4 days. 
The premises exude luxury, food is to highest standard.  The hotel have fantastic room sizes. The staff treated us like royalty  specially Euphelia at the winter garden and the reception team. 
I would definitely recommend staying at The Landmark, consistent quality.",5,2022,10,26
106,Beautiful Afternoon Tea,"The wonderful team at The Landmark ensured that my post wedding afternoon tea was the most wonderful and memorable experience. The food was exquisite and the staff led by Zoltan were extremely professional and looked after our guests so well. This is a beautiful hotel and setting, the staff are such a credit to The Landmark Hotel. It really is a very special place and we look forward to returning soon.",5,2022,10,24
106,Underwhelmed and a poor nights sleep,"Booked this hotel based on it appearing in several “top 10” family hotels in london articles with a picture showing a teepee and teddy bear set up in in a large room, and I naively pictured a cosy, welcoming family experience, especially for the extortionate prices charged… instead this is a VERY average “five star” hotel along the lines of a Hilton or a Marriot type or five star rather than what I would consider a five star experience. I had the two worst nights sleep of my life on a mattress made of concrete and the set up of the family room means that two adults need to share a tiny bed so we were clinging to the edges of the minuscule concrete mattress for two nights in this five star hotel cursing every penny being frittered away on the overall generic and very uncomfortable experience. The family room is certainly very large but what it is is simply two double beds in a massive room, and that’s it. There are no other touches that make it a “family room”. I’ve stayed in other 5 star hotels that provided teddies or child sized robes and slippers or even just a step for kids to reach the sink… absolutely nothing. Not even robes for the adults. We also made the mistake (through booking.com) of not picking the bed and breakfast option which reception then rather unhelpfully refused to change at check in. So, to have breakfast it was an eye watering £36 each for very average food and definitely the most woeful coffee I’ve ever had in a hotel, and so the next day we just didn’t have any food in the hotel out of principle. All in all a wholly underwhelming experience versus the cost especially given the extremely uncomfortable sleeping arrangements which is fundamentally what you are paying for in a hotel.",3,2022,10,23
106,In love with The Historical Landmark Hotel London,"So happy to return to my favourite hotel 6 months after previous stay, was warmly welcomed by lovely Guilia, who has been promoted to Reception Manager, a very well deserved promotion. She was still a university student and worked her way up from receptionist when I first met her. She is always super helpful and efficient with impressive customer service 

Delighted to be greeted by Kamel, Manager at The Winter Garden Restaurant. He is one of the treasures of The Landmark family.  He has been working at The Landmark for many years and so dedicated to his work with the best client care, treats customers like friends and family, everyone knows him and he knows everyone. Not only doing the manager job to supervise a great team, but Kamel very often does the ordinary work like setting up and cleaning up tables, serving food and seating guests.  On a few stays when Kamel was on leave, the restaurant was not the same without him. He easily lifted up the team spirit.  I also wants to thank Roolica and supervisor Maria for their fantastic services.  They all know my dietary and make me feel easy and well looked after 

The most important person who made my regular stays easy and hustle free is Sarah Baptiste, Director of Sales and Marketing. Another loyal employee of the Landmark Family and marketing guru, an expert in her field and super well connected with corporates, travel trade and HNWs , very knowledgeable about corporate travelers’ expectations, no hesitation to organise amazing hospitality and sometimes little surprises which would be the secret to build customer loyalty and retention . Jo Wood is another star member of the sales team to ensure the guest journey is smooth and seamless 

Thank you Sarah and team and every member of different teams (F&B, reception, concierge, housekeeping, spa) to make my stay unique and special 

This is such a fabulous hotel with second to none hospitality, excellent business and leisure facilities and  Michelin standard food,  great location with easy transportations in London Marylebone, walking distance to the famous Sherlock Museum and Madam Tussauds .

I am glad to become part of The Landmark family, where I always enjoy to stay, a HOME FROM HOME . Highly recommend for both business and leisure transfers",5,2022,10,17
106,Beautiful Hotel,"This is our second visit to the Landmark and again is just perfect.  Beautiful setting , great service from everyone in the hotel , the rooms are amazing we stayed in a deluxe room with an outward facing view worth every penny.  Breakfast is great although I could see them struggling for space and waiting times at peak periods.",5,2022,10,17
106,Fabulous hotel with delicious food,"I absolutely love this hotel - probably my favourite London hotel.  Although on this occasion I only attended for a birthday dinner, I have stayed at the hotel a few times and have never been disappointed.

* It’s a great central location just adjacent to Marylebone station. 
* All staff are extremely friendly - this ranges from doormen (shout out to Orlando who assisted with our taxi last night - such an asset to the hotel),  check in staff and restaurant staff.
* Rooms are beautifully decorated with a great range of toiletries.  I loved our room overlooking the winter garden.
* I have experienced the evening set menu on a few occasions now (including the Christmas set menu last year - I’ll be booking again for this Christmas!). I would highly recommend the set menu to anyone - such great value for money with delicious food. Last night we were celebrating a birthday and the staff were kind enough to organise a birthday cupcake - very thoughtful of them. All waiters/waitresses in the Winter Garden were so professional and contributed to making our evening so enjoyable. 

Overall a wonderful experience and I am so looking forward to my next trip to The Landmark London.",5,2022,10,09
106,Landmark  - a truly LUXURIOUS HOTEL,"Landmark  - a LUXURIOUS HOTEL  
This is our fourth stay with family in this outstanding facility. It’s our first return since Covid and we were happy to see - it kept it’s uniqueness as a one of a kind hotel.
The Landmark team has an exceptional combination of a highly professional and very attentive service combined with an exceptional friendly attitude. Service is embedded in every aspect and with every team member .
We booked family and executive rooms . An absolute delight .
The greatest experience in the Landmark is its BREAKFAST at the amazing Winter Garden .
A choice of food - best of its kind and a team which makes your day start with a phenomenal service and friendliness.
The amazing breakfast team starting with Mr. Kamel and Mr. Orton and their truly AMAZING TEAM : Mr. Zoltan, Ms. Elisabeta , Ms. Rodica and their colleagues.
For a long week we had the most amazing start of the day with these magnificent people who made our day start so special. 

I used the SPA once after overstretching my muscles . -Jacquelin the Masseuse at the SPA made miracles “putting me together” and enabling me to walk again the following day . 
This was and remains a one of a kind hotel . 
Rating is 11 out of 10 ! …",5,2022,10,08
106,My choice again and again,"This is my hotel of choice when I’m in London for pleasure. The interior is exquisite, the rooms are a great size for London, the service is superior. Food while expensive can’t really be faulted. I have been staying here for a few years now whenever I’m in London and have just booked my birthday trip because that’s where I want to spend it :) 
If you want comfort in a fancy English setting this is it!",5,2022,10,02
106,5 star service at its best,"Everything about this hotel was lovely.  Perfect location for central London, fabulous building, well maintained and large rooms. The best part was the staff. Attentive, polite and always friendly.  This is how 5 star service should be. Highly recommended.",5,2022,09,30
106,Visited spa - excellent all round,Had a fantastic visit to the spa. Treatment with Jaqueline was great. A highly relaxing all round experience. Would definitely recommend a visit here - previous dining experiences have also been top notch.,5,2022,09,25
106,Highly recommended,Stunning hotel. Cannot fault it and the breakfast was a stunning choice of everything you could wish for. Beautifully clean. Beds very comfy. Spa staff were really lovely too. This is a proper 5* hotel that knows what it’s doing and not pretending.,5,2022,09,25
106,Seven stars for service,"Had a wonderful two night stay here.
The room was very comfortable & looked into the atrium which was a beautiful sight.

We had drinks in The Grand central bar where Jack & Aboli were really pleasant & helpful in finding a VAT receipt for us.

We dined in the restaurant both nights, where Agnieszka looked after us well. The food was excellent, both on the Al a carte @ fixed menus. We had a lovely table in the corner both nights, which the gentleman who greeted us secured, only spoiled by noisy guests on their own speaking loudly into devices.

Breakfast had some really unusual & delicious offerings as I guess a lot of the guests come from far away. We had to try some.

We found the staff in all departments to be really helpful & efficient. Nothing was too much trouble for them whether they were on reception, bar, or restaurant. We will certainly be staying here again.",5,2022,09,21
106,nice hotel /but those public loo doors?,this hotel is splendid and extravagant - great location etc etc etc but whoever put the slatted toilet doors in the ladies wasn't a lady. no woman would put those doors on a toilet particularly if they are public. we like to feel private and those dont permit that as you can see through and hear everything! men are used to peeing in front of other men - women dont do that - think on!,3,2022,09,20
106,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"Traditional Afternoon Tea in a beautiful setting, with a live pianist playing - most enjoyable.  We had pre-ordered some special sandwiches, and those were prepared by the kitchen team exactly as we had requested, followed by an excellent selection of scones, jams and cake, accompanied by a choice from a wide selection of teas.  The serving team were friendly, polite and attentive, without being intrusive, and our Anniversary was marked by the provision of a lovely ""Happy Anniversary"" plate and cake, along some complimentary champagne - thanks.  Highly recommended!",5,2022,09,13
106,Perfect Stay,"This was another one of many visits to the Landmark. It’s perfect! Comfortable rooms, great air conditioning, superb breakfast, attentive service. Conveniently located across the street from Marylebone tube station and an M&S convenience store and Marylebone High Street - an experience in itself.",5,2022,09,12
106,Great experience at afternoon tea,"Popped in for afternoon tea and was pleasantly surprised. Service was great - staff very attentive and the food was very enjoyable. Live piano was a nice touch. 

We were taken care of by very attentive and friendly blonde server - I think her name was Agnieszka?",5,2022,09,12
106,George Allison’s review of the Landmark Hotel in London,"We had a very upsetting experience at the hotel .  We checked in on late morning of Saturday August 20th at the Landmark Hotel.  The woman who checked us in acknowledged that our travel agent had booked us in a room for 2 nights and then the subsequent night was booked through Regent Seven Seas.  She informed us that the room we were booked into was more expensive than the room booked by Regent and that if we didn’t want to move to the less expensive room that it would cost us an additional 50 pounds.  We agreed to the charge.  Monday afternoon we returned to the Landmark Hotel and upon trying to enter the room we found a cleaning crew there.  The supervisor came by and informed us that they had packed up all our belongings and our packed suitcases had been removed to downstairs.  What followed was a heated discussion (by me) as to the fact that they were in extreme error and no right to touch and pack our belongings.    They finally admitted their mistake and led us to another much better room and had our luggage brought to us.  Of course now we had to unpack everything again.  They further made an effort to make amends by canceling a small charge for some food at the bar on a previous night.    It was nevertheless a very unpleasant experience, and in all our many travels around the world staying at top rated hotels, this never happened before.   On another note., the bathroom sink design in both rooms afford almost no room to put medicines or toiletries.  There are no medicine cabinets or shelves or drawers adjacent to the sinks to accommodate these items.   In the first room we used the windowsill adjacent to the sink.  A very strange design error for such a class of hotel.",2,2022,09,07
106,A handy pitstop,"Stayed overnight with the kids, so we could walk to Camden Market the next day, for a first time visit. The building itself, doorman and reception staff, lovely, but we were unfortunately greeted with an intense and overwhelming smell of perfume as we tried to check in. At one point I had to go outside for a breath of fresh air. The atrium was beautiful and had a pianist for an added touch of elegance. The room was nice and a good size for 3 people, although nothing in the minibar. More signs could be added in the coridoors, as you could be walking round in circles. The pool area was ok, the changing rooms were lovely and clean and staff very helpful. The gym is over 16's. Room sevice steak was delicious, but the cheeses could have been fresher. Nice quiet glass of champers and mocktails for the kids in the Great Central bar. Overall, a pretty expensive but pleasant 24hours.",4,2022,09,05
106,Room for improvement but otherwise enjoyable,"Came here with family to celebrate my hen party. Whilst we enjoyed our trip and the setting is absolutely stunning, there is room for improvement. Having experienced similar standards of afternoon teas in the capital, I can conclude The Palms leaves  much to be desired. The sandwiches were tasty and there was a good selection of teas and jams which came with the scones. I also enjoyed the cakes and was grateful for the waiters for letting us take some of them home. Where it fell down was the service which wasn’t as attentive as I would hope it could be. Once you got their attention, they were friendly and helpful. What made things even slower was not being able to pour our own teas. I don’t know if this is a health and safety thing, but it is a little unusual. Also we had to ask someone for more sandwiches - it would have been nice to be offered this. It wasn’t overly busy and I think little changes to the service would make the world of difference.",3,2022,08,24
106,Rupert at the Landmark London Hotel,"Rooms and service were excellent.
Rupert the doorman was amazing and always so helpful each day.  Treated us like family.  Couldn’t be happier with the service we received from him and all the staff.  A great location to get around the city and close cab rides to the Westend for shows.",5,2022,08,21
106,"""Luxury"" - Hotel, rooms, staff and breakfast -  Beautiful!","Fantastic!
Our resent stay at the Landmark Hotel was exceptional.
 Friendly service, smiling faces, nothing too much trouble. The rooms are beautiful, with the most powerful shower you will find anywhere!  Location, so easy to move around central London.
Breakfast had everything, all fresh, great selection. I measure the breakfast buffet by the eggs, beautiful rich dark yolk and very fresh, loved it.

For luxury in London, Im going back.",5,2022,08,17
106,Afternoon Tea for two at the landmark,"Afternoon Tea at the Landmark was a fantastic experience with a high standard of service and top quality food. 

No joking - the jam was amazing! 

When we were arrived, we had rushed to get there for our timeslot, but this was not an issue for the service and we were seated straight away. 

The setting of the table and the whole venue was classy and elegant. The guy playing the piano was amazing. Setting the right mood for a relaxing and indulgent experience. 

The menu is a set one and it really made a difference that it was halal so I could enjoy the coronation chicken rather than the veggie options. 

The cakes were just unbelievably good. 

Well worth the trip visit.",5,2022,08,07
106,NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL!,"We stayed at this hotel while visiting UK. The hotel is conveniently located near a tube and the interior of the hotel is beautifully designed. However, the service is not at par with a 5 Star hotel. When we checked in we were not asked whether the credit card charge was to be in USD or GBP. We were charged in USD which is 18% higher than GBP?! While I was waiting to check out, I clearly saw the front desk guy ask an Australian couple the same question? This rate exchange BS is not a common practice at high end hotels, restaurants and stores. I wonder why this hotel tries to rip off its customers? My email to the hotel asking for an adjustment went unanswered. I ended up disputing the charge with my CC company. On our last day, we had to call 3 times and wait for an hour to get some utensils. The courtyard food was OK but not fit for a 5 Star hotel.",3,2022,08,06
106,Wow Amazing breakfast,"What a beautiful hotel with exceptional staff
We absolutely adored our stay at the landmark. The breakfast!!! Oh my gosh such a treat on the Sunday we came down at 10 so dine for breakfast and we’re full for the entire day. My daughter had her hair blow dried at the hairdresser such lovely people and the afternoon tea with the piano made us feel like true Edwardian ladies taking tea. The hotel is extremely clean immaculate and the bedrooms very comfortable. I have nothing negative to say with the exception of the payment. I had a preauthorise on my card and then had to pay the bill . It took two weeks for my money to be returned.",5,2022,07,31
106,Birthday at The Landmark!,"Was treated to dinner and a night at The Landmark London for my birthday.

Checking in was easy and smooth with Darika at reception and Front Office staff That and Federica made my stay in the Atrium Suite so special with a birthday cake and fruits waiting for us in the room.  The Atrium Suite has the most amazing view into Winter Garden.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed dinner in the Winter Garden where Youness served us. Lovely ambience with a pianist too. 

The morning we left Maria brought me another birthday cupcake during breakfast and Hiu at reception was very helpful and friendly checking us out.

Such an amazing hotel to spend my birthday at, but what really made it special was the friendly and attentive staff.  I love that the same polite doorman Vlad was there on our arrival and the next day when we left, really closed our stay off so well!

I would recommend this beautiful hotel to all and hope to be treated to a birthday there again!",5,2022,07,29
106,Drinks in The Winter Garden,We dropped in  for drinks in the Landmark's winter garden yesterday afternoon. We had a lovely time sipping our cocktails listening to the piano and our whole experience was made even more special by Orton. He took the time to talk us through the list of drinks and made us all feel very welcome. Will definitely return the next time we are in London,5,2022,07,25
106,Decent place; spotty service; dates rooms,"Spotty service here and there and some rude people when we called down. The people answering the phones didn’t speak English from time so what we asked for, didn’t come. 

Otherwise the property is decent. The food and restaurant staff were the only bright spot in our experience. It feels like a 4 star at best: certainly better places.

We had booked 3 rooms (1 standard, the other were larger family suites). No one treated us that well, almost no one was friendly. 

They say “luxury” but only the beds are luxurious. Otherwise their rooms have been poorly set up: only instant coffee, you have to plug in the kettle and move it; not enough toiletries for a family; no stationary; not enough plugs next to bed; no laundry bags/service; chaotic taxi/Uber area with people shouting etc. 

They need to redo some of the aspects of the rooms to keep up with truly luxurious hotels. 

In summary: there are better places to stay.",3,2022,07,24
106,Extremely disappointing.,"Disappointed is an understatement! This should be the pinnacle of London hotels. Instead the rooms are woefully out dated. No USB or plugs near the bed for phone charging. The Hotel does not remove littler, empty bottles, cups and children’s drinks cartons left about the hotel (this speaks to the guests as much as anything).

The amount they charge you expect something in incredible. Instead you get an over priced premier inn. I’ll stay at the Ned next time.",1,2022,07,24
106,Absolutely outstanding,"I recently visited with friends for the afternoon tea. I was blown away with how attentive, welcoming and accommodating the staff were. This is on top on the outstanding food. I have already booked to come back for my dads birthday. I can’t wait to visit again.
Thank you so much. 
Highly recommend, don’t think twice.",5,2022,07,23
106,A sanctuary amidst the bustle,"The Landmark superior staff makes it a wonderful place to stay. After a day of adventurous exploration, the hotel was a bright spot in which to end the day. Nearby currency exchange, restaurants, and public transit are pluses.",5,2022,07,18
106,Wonderful stay for our Wedding,"We had our wedding ceremony at the Marylebone Old Town Hall, reception Afternoon Tea at the Landmark Hotel Winter Gardens restaurant (High Palms High Tea - which was amazing - we have done a separate review for the Winter Gardens restaurant), and stayed over afterwards in one of the executive suites. We had a wonderful time and really could not have wished for anything better. All the staff we interacted with were professional, respectful, relaxed and friendly. The room was beautiful, clean and with lovely little touches of elegance - rose petals and a swan / heart shaped arrangement of sheets. We were over the moon with the whole experience. Thank you to all involved, it helped to make our special day something we will always remember!",5,2022,07,06
106,Excellent hospitality,"Great stay . Thk you to Joshua Flynn n Leung at front desk - amazing staff . Thk u to Richard n Jacob at concierge all wonderfully helpful !!!! Wld recommend the landmark !!!
Great people great food . Great stay",5,2022,06,30
106,Terrible weekend,"I was in this hotel with my friends and had nice time. However, this weekend was disaster. We were trying to get taxi around 07:00pm and couldn't get because there was some 7 or 8 cars driving around hotel with some smoke and signalling for 30 minutes. Noise was so loud that this woke up my other friends and smoke what was there... These cars was speeding around hotel and experience was terrible. What was that? 
My experience was ruined. All good impression gone in a second. No security around in lobby, no managers, nothing. All these people in cars were just driving around hotel nonstop making noise and lobby was full with smoke. 

Will never again come back to Landmark.",1,2022,06,20
106,A friendly embrace,"This hotel is conveniently located especially as it backs on the Marylebone station, which is on the Bakerloo line. The rooms are well appointed and of generous size and common areas are very grand and luxurious. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would revisit in a heart beat, subject to my bank managers approval.",5,2022,06,17
106,The Land Mark is heaven on earth,"The Land Mark is the world class leader in hospitality.  In no other location will one be treated and cared for as one is in the Land mark.  The exceptional thing about this hotel is the people who work here.  They are a very special group of people and they enable their guests to feel special.  Every member of staff to a person is attentive, kind and caring. They really know how to look after people. 

Everybody must stay in this hotel at least once in their lifetime to experience the luxury paradise and unparalleled service.   I can’t speak more highly of the land mark.  I would recommend this hotel to anybody, everybody is welcomed here, and everybody is made to feel special.  The highest standards of excellence are maintained consistently.  The Land Mark is heaven on earth.",5,2022,06,14
106,Wonderful Stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Landmark.   The property is beautiful and pristine, but the friendly service truly was our favorite part.  We were warmly greeted by Joshua in reception, who is outstanding at his job.    Zoltan was a wonderful server we looked forward to seeing at the breakfast each day.    Rupert greeted us at the door after our adventures each day, making us feel like family.  The breakfast buffet was perfect, full of a variety of options.  Our bedroom suite was spacious and clean.  We enjoyed the view into the courtyard and restaurant.   The piano player added to the overall ambiance.  This hotel is a gem!",5,2022,06,13
106,Agha Abbas,"My girlfriend and I had such an amazing time that we didn't want to leave. All the staff, were super helpful and accommodating. The whole vibe at The Landmark Winter garden was priceless.

We will definitely be coming back again and again.",5,2022,06,08
106,"Can't fault, stunning hotel",Can't fault! Staff were so friendly and the secret garden hotel was fantastic! The spa was very relaxing and you don't need to book you can attend whenever you like. The room was spotless and loved the decor very traditional. Would stay again!,5,2022,06,07
106,DO NOT STAY (PLEASE READ),"This has got to be the worst hotel myself and my husband have ever stayed in.
Upon arriving, there is no valet parking. We did not want to park a Lamborghini Huracan anywhere and when instructed by the doorman, he directed us to a NCP Secure Parking on Marylebone Road. When we read reviews, cars get broke into this car park every single week. There was absolutely no chance, we would park the car there which forced us to drive 30 minutes away to make sure our car was secure (ridiculous).

We stayed in the Marylebone Studio Suite for 2 nights, suite was very simple, not worth the money at all. Breakfast is £30 pp, once again, for a £60 breakfast, you expect it all. It was once again a basic buffet restaurant. I would of been more satisfied going to a cafe. Just to top it off, the whole reason we picked the Landmark was for the spa.
When arriving at the spa, the jacuzzi was not working, the steam rooms are separated for men and females (not a big deal) BUT the sauna are not hot, they're cold. Workers in the Landmark are extremely stuck up, not nice and have a rude facial impression (maybe because I am mixed-race). They should treat everyone the same, as most people staying at the Landmark have spent a lot of money just for 1 night. We have never experienced service like it. There is a restaurant opposite the spa which looks like a pub yet charges top prices for the food. You are better off going to a resturant outside the hotel.

Lifts barely work and you have to press the button 10 times for it to work. I apperciate it is a old hotel but for the price, all these minor issues should be sorted. There is absolutely no way, myself and my husband would ever stay at the Landmark again.
This hotel charges a lot of money for service that is no where near the price. I got fooled by a lot of reviews on The Landmark and thought it would be a amazing hotel. Guys, save your money and go elsewhere. I would not want anyone to be treated how myself and my husband was treated.",1,2022,06,04
106,"Exceeded Expectations, Hotel and Staff 5 🌟 That atrium is stunning beautiful 😍","Recently stayed with family at The Landmark Hotel, my personal first time in London. From the moment I stepped into the hotel and was greeted by the staff, I knew I was in for a delightful stay.
The concierge and team gave the warmest welcome, our room was impeccable and our dining experiences from the Winter Garden Restaurant and the Great Central Bar were delicious. We had a lengthy stay and enjoyed getting to know the staff. Rupert was one that set the bar for hospitality at our first meeting! The entire team was just as warm and knowledgeable. 
I also recommend the high tea at Winter Garden Restaurant and the tea that is especially blended for their brand. 
Thank you for such a memorable time in London, I look forward to a return visit soon!",5,2022,06,04
106,Luxury in a great location,"I have now found my London Hotel 
The Landmark is a mere 10 minutes from Euston
Check in was quick and efficient.
I booked an Executive Room which is large with a couch a beautiful bathroom,with a separate toilet.
If one was being picky the windows could have been bigger.Then the view of the beautiful atrium would have been clearer.A real first world problem!
The spa is excellent and massage I had with Mihaela was excellent.Very relaxing and enjoyable.
The swimming pool is brilliant,with all the accompaniments sauna, jacuzzi etc
The gym although it has good equipment it needs a recline bike as my body cannot do an upright bike.
I enjoyed the Mirror Bar,where the drinks were excellent and champagne came in a chilled glass automatically as it should.
I had dinner on my first night in the beautiful Winter Gardens.The service was brilliant, warm and friendly.
The food was of a good standard.
The 3 stars of the hotel though was Margaret in laundry for whom nothing was too much trouble.Richard and Mo were magnificent as Concierge whether it was liaising with another hotel to pick up a very important envelope,and arranging a driver to collect them 
They were superb at sorting my transport to Twickenham.Hussain was punctual on both pick ups and a very good safe driver.
Amma checked me out.
It was a brilliant stay
Thank you",5,2022,06,01
106,Birthday celebrations,"Great hotel and brilliantly located hotel for us to enjoy a London weekend. We were upgraded to an executive room with a lovely view over the Palm Court Atrium. Room was spacious and a great place to relax, and the bed was so so comfortable. Reception team were very welcoming and a special shout out to Josh and Amma. Very impressed that Josh remembered my name the following day which is no mean feat with everything reception have to deal with. Breakfast was fab, with a great range of food suitable for all. Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2022,05,31
106,Truly Amazing Stay,"Wow a truly amazing 5* experience

Was surprised with a trip to London as part of my birthday celebrations and stayed at The Landmark. The suite we were given was incredibly spacious, spotlessly clean and surpassed all my expectations from soft fluffy robes and slippers to luxurious toiletries, quality towels and linen. The suite overlooked the stunning Winter Garden restaurant so was very quiet with no outside traffic noise. Lovely additional touches were catered for on our arrival and it honestly just added to the whole fantastic experience. 

During our stay we managed to make use of the fantastic pool and spa facilities which were all impeccably clean with plenty of towels provided. Also enjoyed a few late night drinks in The Mirror Bar where given how busy the hotel was with functions that evening it didn’t affect the level of service at all and can only be described as exemplary. Breakfast, served in the Winter Garden was beautifully presented and plentiful with very attentive staff. Overall an amazing stay at a truly 5* hotel. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,05,30
106,Same old excellence we have grown to expect,"Visited for our 43rd wedding anniversary on quite possibly the busiest weekend of the year, football play off, rugby cup final and the run up to the Queens Platinum Jubilee plus a school closure week.

Train to London was insanely busy setting the scene for both London and the hotel.

As always we were spoilt with a fantastic upgraded room, champagne and cakes thank you for this.

Having been to the hotel on many occasions this was the busiest we have witnessed, queues for breakfast are not the norm it’s normally very relaxed so if that affected your visit stay away from spring bank holiday.

Staff were amazing as always especially Jerrol at breakfast who went the extra mile to ensure we had a wonderful time.

The hotel is a walk to the sites but the underground is twenty yards away and the walk to Oxford Street is flat and takes 15 minutes.

Thank you again for a fantastic visit.",5,2022,05,30
106,5 star visit,We stayed for my partners birthday and had an absolutely wonderful time.  The hotel upgraded our suite which was so kind.  Special thanks to Joshua at the front desk who went above and beyond for us throughout our stay.,5,2022,05,28
106,Superb experience at The Landmark,Just completed my first stay at the Landmark London. I have stayed  in several 5*hotels in London but this is definitely a cut above. Stunningly beautiful place. Excellent accommodation & excellent service from well trained staff in all areas.,5,2022,05,28
106,Disappointing,"Out stay here was disappointing from before we arrived. The hotel has a bizarre booking process where after entering your card details to pay online, you are later entered a payment link to use an antiquated system to enter card details again - it feels like you're paying twice and have to manually type in how much to pay. Then we received a text offering us the opportunity to check-in online, and pay an extra £23 for the privilege. The building is impressive and the rooms look nice. Only having instant coffee in the room is a let down in a 5* luxury hotel - hotels half the price manage to provide a coffee machine. The queue for breakfast was so long that we left and got breakfast elsewhere. Would not stay again, would not recommend. Not good enough for the cost.",3,2022,05,26
106,"Very nice hotel, close to LBS","I stayed at the landmark for my business trip with London Business School. The hotel was perfect and would’ve given it 5/5 but i only dropped it to 4 because the rooms are a bit outdated 

Hotel staff were exceptionally nice and helpful… SPECIAL THANKS to Agata from hotel bar (Great Central). Amazing manager.. she made me feel welcome and special. Not only what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, a lot more.",4,2022,05,24
106,Amazing!,Amazing stay! Experienced & kind staff! Excellent location! Quality furniture! The spa is a must! Totally recommend it to single travellers or couples! It’s the best way to experience a trip to London! The highlight was the piano every afternoon!,5,2022,05,22
106,Just perfect,"Have stayed many times over the years, alongside other beautiful hotels in the city. However Iv never taken a moment to write a review. So here it is!
We came back yesterday after just a flying visit to london in the landamark. The rooms were spacious and plush,  super clean and an excellent walk in power shower and large bathroom,  with white company products and beautiful quality finishes throughout. 
We had room service which was super quick and deliciously fresh. The hotel staff were attentive & friendly whilst being completely professional. Afternoon tea as exquisite and our waiter Hamil was wonderful and catered for us perfectly. A wonderful buffet breakfast with some waiter service for drinks and special requests - the buffet lacked nothing. All in all a wonderful stay. I feel confident in recommending the Lamdmark as the standard of stay is consistently superb. 

I have never had anything but a 5 star experience and if I’m honest it’s probably my favourite place to stay without being ridiculous in price.",5,2022,05,22
106,Amazing Weekend,Wow! What a fabulous place to stay. The hotel was amazing. The room we had was incredible. The decor and furnishings were first class. From when we arrived we were made to feel most welcome.Every member of staff we came across were polite and couldn’t do enough for us .There were to many names to remember but Rupert on the door was an absolute gem. Breakfast each morning was a joy. All in all an amazing experience.Thank you all for such a lovely time .We haven’t stopped talking about it since we arrived home.,5,2022,05,18
106,Fantastic grand Landmark London surpasses expectations once again for us,"Our wedding celebrations were held at this fantastic venue three years ago with 120 guests in the Empire Room. We returned for another stay on our anniversary with a get together with some of our guests.
Francesca was so helpful on front desk as the reservation got cancelled twice due to the pandemic closure and it got a little confusing. However, everything went very well,  the Landmark suite is absolutely fabulous. The Landmark has grand rooms and the scale of the hotel is second to none. The courtyard is a splendid and special place to entertain. Thank you once again Landmark London. ",5,2022,05,18
106,Beautiful Hotel,"I recently stayed at the Landmark for a 5 night stay with my mum. I selected the hotel on its close location to Harley Street and hospitals as I was travelling to London for medical reasons.

The hotel is beautiful, a hidden gem as it’s not a location I’d usually stay in London. Gorgeous communal areas with the palm court at the centre.

I stayed in a deluxe room for 2 nights then moved to a family room the remaining 3 . The family room wasn’t available for my entire stay on booking. I must say I did not find the reservations team particularly helpful on booking - my enquiry appeared to confuse them . After much frustration - - I ended up making 2 separate bookings online myself. Usually 5 star hotels reservations staff are very helpful and go out of their way to accommodate  guests . This was not my experience of the Landmark.

All other staff where great, from the doormen , to breakfast service , housekeeping , room service and maintenance- all very helpful and friendly.

Breakfast was really lovely and the standard of the food was exceptional . Room service was also very good. 

During my stay I used the hair salon and spa. The hotel is really handy for the tube station and the rooms are lovely and well equipped .

Overall we enjoyed our stay and will return.",4,2022,05,18
106,fabulous weekend trip,"What an amazing hotel with fab staff, I had a great family catch up in London in their spacious rooms which have to be some of the biggest in the capital. All the staff we met were great but I'd like to give a special mention to Kamel who was managing the breakfast service, he was so effortless and charming and couldn't have done more to help.

We enjoyed some great cocktails in the Mirror bar in the evening which has to be one of best value 5 star hotel bars in London. 

Well done all I just wish we could have stayed longer",5,2022,05,15
106,Areas of disappointment for an expensive first stay,"Booked as an anniversary treat and whilst the Atrium suite was nice would not  class it as luxurious and air con doesn’t reach bedroom and non existent in bathroom,  so suite could be airless and stuffy. 
Seating areas are non existent as the lovely mezzanine area is constantly closed to guests as it’s reserved for private events or corporate . Didn’t get to use it once during our four day break 6-10 May 2022, resulting in family and ourselves sitting in our suite most of the time . By last day we were glad to be leaving felt like a business trip as suited business people took over the hotel and felt guests not a priority.

Booked an airport transfer to hotel on our arrival to find at airport we were unable to initially locate our driver and when we did found him to be surly and bordering on unfriendly/rude. In a nutshell we felt corporate and private vents are definitely the hotels priority and not their guests welfare.",3,2022,05,10
106,Made a birthday trip that little bit better,Joshua and his team ensured all the little details of our stay went without a hitch. The hotel is immaculate. The staff friendly and helpful. And the location is perfect. We will be back to visit again I'm sure.,5,2022,05,09
106,Pleasant Return Visit,"Irritatingly, I had a number of reviews for staying at The Landmark but they were all erased recently by the hotel. It's the same hotel! Why Tripadvisor allowed them to remove historical reviews I don't know. Anyway, my wife and I stayed again this weekend for my birthday and apart from new electronic door keys and decor changes, it most definitely is the same hotel that we've always fondly enjoyed staying at.

As returning guests we were upgraded to a Marylebone Suite which was lovely and included a lounge and separate bedroom. We've actually stayed in these rooms before but they've obviously had a name change. Either way, they're beautiful sanctuaries in the heart of London. Sumptuous décor with plenty of those extras you expect and a few you don't. A huge marble bathroom with separate shower, bath tub and toilet which is very practical. The bed is super comfy and these rooms are possibly the quietest to stay in, anywhere in the world. You simply won't hear a thing.

Our room was on B&B basis so we also had breakfast included in our rate, although it's now buffet and I'm just not a fan. I loved the old à la carte system and with Covid I hoped it would be back, but no. Also, if I'm being honest, it isn't a good buffet breakfast either. The bacon was awful, as was the black pudding and it isn't hot enough. For £35 a head, they need to try much harder.

Reception were diligent and the concierge and doormen are all very friendly and helpful, though my final niggle would be about receiving a text 24 hours before our visit asking for me to pre check-in using the Aero Guest app. This is apparently to make check-in seamless and remove the need to visit the front desk in these Covid times. I therefore dutifully checked in and paid my room charge, where-upon the app also told me it would be my room key once the room was available.

Actually, it never worked and I ended up having to go to reception anyway because they needed to swipe my credit card for incidentals and give me a key card! What was the point of the app then? The key never worked on the app either so it was an all round pointless exercise and something 5 Star hotels should not be doing! 

We enjoyed our stay very much but these issues detracted from a perfect score.",4,2022,05,08
106,Family vacation with sour taste,Staff was less than courteous. Amenities limited with food and drink. Have stayed at other Landmark properties did not feel welcome with may family of four at this hotel. Needless to say many other options in this fantastic city. Old stuffy time for a change,2,2022,05,04
106,Great dinner and fantastic service,"Amazing night in The Winter Garden Restaurant last night. Lovely to eat in the atrium area. The pianist playing whilst eating. The food was amazing and so was the service. 

100% recommend a visit to this gem just outside central London. Great job guys!!",5,2022,05,02
106,A Grand British Icon,"The Landmark London is a Grade II listed timeless luxury iconic hotel in Marylebone, London, dating from 1899 (formerly known as Grand Central Hotel) and blending classic with contemporary style thanks to its glass-roofed 8-story atrium with towering palm trees, Winter Garden restaurant, spa and indoor 50 ft chlorine-free pool. I took a Deluxe Double room there with my partner for 1 night at 554€. Concierge service was excellent and offered us help with an expected parcel delivery to the hotel for us. Curiosity: The Landmark London was awarded a Highly Commended certificate at the Afternoon Tea Awards 2019 in recognition of its high quality Afternoon Tea service. A 10/10 for your luxury London experience.",5,2022,05,01
106,Stunning and luxurious to another level,"A beautiful historical hotel. Our suit was just amazing, plenty of room, amazing super kind size bed which was so comfortable. Complimentary slippers and robes for extra comfort. The bathroom was spacious and ample toiletries supplied. Spotlessly clean.
A grand piano to listen to during the afternoon or while sitting for food and drinks. Check in and check out was professional and easy, staff were exceptional and polite at every opportunity.  Our room over looked the internal lobby which was just lovely to people watch.  The spa facilities were clean and well maintained. We enjoyed  a lovely swim, sauna and steam before leaving…worth waking a little early to enjoy the peacefulness of it…if you can remove yourselves from comfortable bed. A perfect night away!",5,2022,04,29
106,The best massage experience ever.,"I've been in many hotels around the world, but had one of the best massage at the Landmark Hotel.

My husband surprised me for my birthday with a spa experience and booked for me a ""full refurbishment"" day. :-D 

I've been lucky to end of in the best hands of an excellent therapist, Mihaela.  She is such a kind person and offers a range of different types of massage suitable for everyone young or old, because each massage is tailored to what you need/want.
The room is comfortable and quiet , provides a very relaxing environment. 

I will return back soon.",5,2022,04,28
106,Awesome experience,"I had the greatest experience ever. 
The room was amazing, so comfy and clean. 
My favorite moment was breakfast cause the food was excellent! 
Last but not least thanks to Giulia, who was kind and thoughtful, it has been a pleasure. 
I absolutely recommend booking a room while in London.",5,2022,04,27
106,Magical from start to finish,"I wanted to write this review to express how incredible my stay was with my boyfriend on Sunday night. The staff are absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond to create an unforgettable stay. We were delighted to find that our room had been upgraded upon arrival to an executive room. We walked in and were absolutely speechless! Absolutely stunning, thank you so much for this. I would like to also express our gratitude for the early check in we received and late check out as we quite frankly didn’t want to leave! A huge thank you to concierge for looking after us and making our stay extra special. The staff in the mirror bar served us literally as they were about to close and gave us olives and almonds to enjoy with our wine which was lovely. The staff always went above and beyond, opening the taxi door for example when you arrived after a long day of shopping. My boyfriend and I have been incredibly lucky to stay at multiple 5 star hotels in London but agreed that this was the winner! Beautiful room service, complimentary Chardonnay was exquisite. The spa was gorgeous, finally I have found a spa that is the perfect temperature in terms of jacuzzi, sauna and pool. Thank you all so much for making this experience one in which we’ll never forget x",5,2022,04,26
106,Breakfast at Landmark,"What a breakfast at Landmark Hotel. Fantastic and so tasty with a very friendly team like Rosario, Charmene and Assaita. Highly recommended. We are coming back in a couple of weeks for sure. Family Saint-Avit",5,2022,04,24
106,Landmark London,"Right by the train station which is handy, the welcome you get entering the hotel from the doorman is impressive. I'd say concierge are more helpful than the reception team so just ask them any questions. 

Walking through the Winter Garden in the evening is pretty cool with the lighting and music is chilled, pianist is really good. Had the standard double room, room is something out of this world, special when you walk in.

I paid just over £5 for a bottle of water which is thought is unnecessary, expect it to be far less than that!! I went out to eat but the hotel sorted me two portions of chunky trips which were good. Didn't have room service so can't comment on that. Buffet breakfast though is as good as it gets.",5,2022,04,22
106,Luxury at it's best,"Finally got back to our favourite Champagne Brunch after 2years of Covid restrictions and have to say we have missed this so much - The price has gone up but with Laurent Perrier Champagne aplenty and the amount of food this is so worth it. The service from the staff is excellent they are so attentive and you will find your champagne glass never goes beyond the 1/2 way mark! My partner does not like champagne so they offered him unlimited beer instead (nice touch)
I highly recommend this experience 😀",5,2022,04,21
106,Beautiful hotel with attentive staff and first class customer care,"Online booking via the website direct. Received confirmation from Aarti in reservations who then helped with further questions I had and preferences I made. Aarti was incredibly helpful and prompt in reservations. Also the team in the restaurant who helped with the restaurant reservations again promptly and answered all my questions. Particularly Agnieszka in restaurant reservations pre arrival. The hotel has two entrances, one on the main road at the front, and the rear where you get dropped off by taxi and where there is always taxis as it is linked to the Marylebone Train Station. A warm greeting on the door and assistance with cases. Reception were incredibly friendly and helpful. We always found if we needed any assistance someone was always there on front desk to help. Our room was a beautiful immaculate clean and fresh family stuio. This has two large double beds and a separate seating area. Everything in room was immaculate, the bedding, the furniture, the cleaning standards absolutely perfect. Furniture all in pristine condition and a beautiful large italian marble bathroom. Plenty of space in the wardrobe with plentiful coat hangers. Iron/Ironing board etc. A stunning internal courtyard view. The room has a great heating/aircon system. It's incredibly quiet and we had the most amazing sleeps in the sumptous beds. The breakfast was outstanding with an incredible selection suiting all taste buds and dietry requirements. The restaurant is just so beautiful with the palm trees and the service for afternoon tea outstanding. Concierge is just so helpful, and  thanks to George whose assistance and knowledge was truly appreciated. We have been to many luxury hotels in London but have to say this is my favourite now. It's beautiful, has a lovely relaxed atmospher with a very succinct customer service experience. They all know when they are needed. So much better than people constantly in your space. That's luxury when they just know. Have to say all team members are doing an outstanding job, the rooms are kept to a high standard, if you need anything it's a quickly responded phone call away. Thank you to everyone you should all be so proud of what you offer, provide and give. We have such wonderful memories in your beautiful hotel.",5,2022,04,19
106,Very very happy with this choice,"We traveled to London with our 2 young children, and I chose this hotel because it was the best rated, reasonably priced, charming, hotel with a family room with two queen beds not a sofa bed situation. They also have a pool. I gave myself a big pat on the back, I chose correctly!! This is a very fancy hotel so aside from feeling perpetually underdressed, we felt right at home. Everyone was so nice, and a big big thank you to housekeeping. Wow. They can clean a room!!!! I will stay here again, that is a certainty.",5,2022,04,15
106,Faded glory,"The staff were lovely, and food in the main restaurant was excellent. However, the hotel generally just feels like it’s lacking investment, and is quite tired and worn. The chairs in the restaurant are in awful condition, there were paint splatters on the furniture in our room, and the spa area is dingy and dirty. They are small issues, but the provision of only instant coffee and UHT milk sachets is laughable these days in top hotels; there was apparently no turn down service; and housekeeping failed on both days to provide 4 towels even though they must have known a family of four were staying. We had a nice stay overall, but the hotel is far behind the standard of other 5 star hotels, and I don’t think warranted the room rate of £600pn",3,2022,04,10
106,lindaw,"I received a Spa & Afternoon Tea package as a gift for my 60th birthday at The Landmark Hotel.  The whole day was an absolute treat and I cannot praise the staff highly enough for their outstanding care and commitment.  The Spa environment was lovely, peaceful and relaxing.  Sandra greeted me warmly and showed me around the high quality facilities.  After enjoying the solarium, jacuzzi and swimming pool, Jacqueline, the highly professional masseuse, gave me a wonderful facial and back massage which left me feeling totally destressed.  In the airy Winter Garden Restaurant, the ambiance was delightful and the afternoon tea superb.  Charlie, the talented pianist, played songs from the musicals at my request, and Helmi, my attentive waiter, presented me with a birthday cake and took photos which completed a fabulous day.  As a single woman, I left feeling completely pampered, and am very happy to recommend this impressive hotel and staff.  I very much hope to return again in the future.",5,2022,04,10
106,Something Special,"We treated ourselves to stay at the Landmark London for our Wedding Anniversary as we were in lockdown for our 10th wedding anniversary. 
I worked at this hotel over 20 years ago and come back to see the standards are the same and the staff are so nice and welcoming was an added treat. 
We were upgraded which was a lovely treat and had a room over looking the Winter Garden which was very special. 
We had afternoon in the Winter Garden on the Saturday which again was stunning. 

We will return next year again! I would recommend anyone to experience this hotel if you are looking for something special. 

Thank you again to everyone.",5,2022,04,10
106,"Amazing stay in Landmark, recommended to anyone that wants to have an authentic hospitality experience in London.","We were looking for a hotel to spend our  anniversary night and we couldn’t have chosen better! This hotel is extremely romantic..The room was stunning, clean and comfortable. The staff was really kind and professional and helped us with all the enquiries we had. Definitely recommend it to anyone coming to london.",5,2022,04,09
106,My first trip to the spa,"The amenities were a very good standard. l particularly appreciated the fact that the spa wasn't crowded. Also the atmosphere was good and enhanced by the choice of music. It was a pleasure to meet Viktoria in person, a very friendly member of staff whom l had spoken to on the telephone when booking. The massage was of excellent quality, ad Sanju masseuse was a gem. Throughout the massage, her manner was very warm and curteous, and so l am looking forward to returning.",5,2022,04,08
106,Amazing Night Away,"Just returned from an amazing night away celebrating my best friend's 50th birthday.  From the moment we walked through the doors, we had such a lovely welcome from the doorman which then carried right through to the Front Desk where we had a very smooth check-in.
The bedroom was very spacious and we were very spoilt with a wonderful birthday cupcake and bottle of champagne.  We dined in the Winter Garden restaurant and the food was delicious and the service was excellent, and nothing was too much trouble. 
Would highly recommend staying at The Landmark and already planning my next trip.",5,2022,04,08
106,A quality hotel with inconsistent service,"We stayed in a family suite for two nights. 

The hotel is stunning with spotlessly clean rooms. We had a family room with two queen sized beds (2 adults and 2 children).

The pool and spa were great with dedicated hours for children (9am-11am and 3pm-5pm). The hotel was not great at ensuring guests stuck to the rules with children using the jacuzzi and jumping in to the pool (both against the rules). It made it difficult to keep telling our children to stick to the rules.

For the price we paid, we didn't feel the service we received felt very personal. We had to ask for the right number of towels and gowns / slippers. We didn't feel staff went out of their way to get to know our family, which is something the best hotels around the world do seamlessly.

Overall a quality hotel but could improve its service levels significantly.",3,2022,04,06
106,Sporadic service standards in otherwise amazing hotel,"This is a beautiful 5 star hotel. The amenities and ambience are truly spectacular, unfortunately the service was slightly sporadic. Reception promised us a call when our room was ready to check in, yet we’re still waiting now for our it.  Room service replaced towels that were hanging up to be reused (in this day and age of trying to be environmentally friendly I find this surprising) but failed to replenish certain provisions like vanity packs and water. The service at dinner was also inconsistent, two people came in quick succession to take food orders we weren’t ready to place but then there was an inordinate delay in finally coming to take our order.  Small points like us having to refill our own glasses were also noted, however none of this detracted from the amazing food we were served. Having a live pianist is also a lovely touch. 

We had a room overlooking the atrium, which was beautifully appointed. The rooms aren’t sound proof so you do hear the pianist from your room (certainly on the 2nd floor in any event) and we could also hear the children in the room next door to us - a 630am wake up call we weren’t expecting on a Sunday morning! 

As it was our anniversary weekend, the receptionist did try to upgrade us on arrival but the hotel was busy. We did, however, have a lovely message and cupcake left in our room to help celebrate the occasion with we thought was a lovely touch.  Along with The White Company toiletries, fluffy towels, the provision of robes and slippers, complimentary water and sky tv on a huge flat screen tv, the room exceeded our expectations.  

We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel or use the Spa facilities, so I can’t comment on these. However I would highly recommend the champagne mojito cocktail served in The Mirror Bar!",4,2022,04,04
106,Return visit back to its traditional glory,"Enjoyed a quiet executive corner room 112. Extremely spacious and spotlessly clean. Fresh fruit and fresh flowers which were delightful. We have previously had many stays overlooking the atrium and this room was much quieter which is nice to compare. Room service is luxurious as expected. Staff to hand for everything and we used dry cleaning. The room had a steam iron and board, umbrella, clothes brush amongst the usual helpful suspects. We noticed a huge difference in the staff from the front door throughout cleaning and reception. They combined welcoming professional and friendly with a dash of personality. Breakfast usual glorious affair. Even fellow guests were so friendly. Enormous thanks to the hotel team.  ",5,2022,03,28
106,Such poor customer service,"This was our first visit to London with a toddler and from reading blogs and reviews, the Landmark offered fantastic rooms with little extras for our little girl. We booked a suite package and requested early check in.
No on-site parking, but a NCP just a short walk away. 

Check in was where the problems started. We requested early check in but knew this wasn’t guaranteed. We arrived at 14:30 and unfortunately our room wasn’t ready. This wouldn’t have been a problem if we’d been directed to where we could have a drink / sit down while we waited until 15:00. We found our way around, sat down and no service. Concierge were not at the desk for most of the visit and weren’t helpful when they were.

Making our way to the suite, rooms were being cleaned and there was an incredibly strong smell of cigarettes even thought it’s a non smoking hotel. When we arrived at the suite it was spotless, smelt great and we were incredibly impressed with the space. A little dated but immaculately kept. At check in, the lady confirmed that we were travelling with a toddler. 
However, no cot was in the room, nor was the welcome drinks, milk and cookies promised as part of the package we’d paid for. 

Called reception and they assured everything would be with us by the time we got back from our spa treatment. 
When we got back around an hour and half later there was nothing. 
Eventually after a call, drinks were brought. After another call, an Easter egg turned up. After 3 calls, the cot finally arrived. There was not an apology given, nothing offered just told that the hotel was busy.

Breakfast offering was good if you were quick at the buffet. My husband didn’t manage to get much hot food as it had all gone and not replenished at 08:30. 

Upon check out (with the same lady who checked us in) there was absolutely no customer service, no ask even how our stay was. We asked concierge to hold our bags which they kindly did, although we had to move the car round the block to the front of the hotel as they wouldn’t bring them to the rear when we were leaving London (14:00).

Beautiful building, great rooms and good location. Let down by the staff and management.

Overall, for a hotel which cost £650 for the night I have stayed in far better 5 star hotels in London, maybe in a smaller room but with fantastic, unrivalled customer service.",2,2022,03,28
106,Excellent Champagne Brunch,"So good to have the Champagne Brunch available again at The Landmark - the ambience of the special setting on the Garden Terrace, with pianist and singer, and the quality and selection of food was excellent, as always - with a seemingly endless supply of champagne! Thank you, Landmark, for a special afternoon!",5,2022,03,28
106,Top Notch !,"Federica, Federica, Federica ! at Reception was so warm and accommodating . . . And very helpful & knowledgeable. 

The hotel deserves the 5 Stars and there are tons of staff throughout the hotel to wait on you hand and foot. 

Of course the room is top notch, and a lot of them face inward with a view of the atrium /lobby/cafe that has a huge skylight  atop.

Also there are two entrances, one is literally across the street from a major railway & “Tube” station",5,2022,03,28
106,Beautiful and relaxing stay,I booked landmark hotel as it was close to our train station but when I arrived to the doorman and walked in to the hotel I felt I was on holiday. The staff were all great the place was relaxing and wonderful. I booked 1 night but wished I booked more and when next in London this would be the place I would come again and again. Photos below need no words as you see the beauty in this hotel.,5,2022,03,28
106,Great  family stay at the Landmark .,"We often stay in London for weekend breaks and this was the first time at the landmark . We stayed in a family room.  

The room was spacious and beautifully decorated.

 The little extras such as a kids bathrobe and slippers , tent and cookies and milk in the room were great , my son also had his own double bed which was great as most rooms in London offer camp beds for children although still paying a premium price. 

The breakfast was delicious and the head chef  out on the floor was really kind to my son he was wonderful  . The ladies serving were amazing. 

Rupert on the door was lovely . So kind and genuine always helpful when needing a taxi.  

A wonderful stay will definatly be back.",5,2022,03,25
106,Back again,"Always enjoy staying at the Landmark. For those not in the know, it's an unexpected oasis in the middle of London -check out the numerous photos of the winter Garden + the rooms are not ""hotel like"" but more homely.

Enjoyed relaxing in the pool/spa and the buffet breakfast is always a treat in the setting of the Winter Garden",5,2022,03,22
106,So Shic,"I stayed there for 3 nights for a business trip and enjoyed every moment of it.  The 1st thing which admires me was the quality of personnel and the way they treat you. They spoil you. Check in and out was very fast, breakfast was one of a kind. Bar at downstairs was very sincere and friendly. Room , bed and bathroom were very clean and big enough. If you want to stay in a perfectly located stylish and classic hotel, this hotel is the one. ",5,2022,03,22
106,Wish I could stay longer,"Amazing 5 star hotel in London! I’ve stayed at Langham before, but Landmark is soooo much better! I love the palm trees in the Winter Garden, immediately feeling holiday vibe. There are many spots in the Hotel where you can take pretty pictures for social media. Staff are very friendly and genuine, service is superb! My friend and I stayed in the family room with a nice view of winter garden. It’s spacious and clean! The breakfast was brilliant! Fresh made latte and perfect pouch eggs, plus lots of continental choices. The swimming pool and Spa also looked very nice. Sadly we didn’t have time to enjoy. I can’t fault anything about our stay! I’ll definitely come back another time and stay longer.",5,2022,03,21
106,Excellent Experience,A wonderful afternoon having Afternoon tea for a birthday celebration.  From the time of booking and at the hotel the service was excellent and the food exceptional. The hotel is just beautiful and highly recommend.,5,2022,03,21
106,"very, very close to perfection","the accommodations, the location, the staff, the silence and the superb breakfast lead me to choose my new hotel when in London.
to a perfect ten, you have to look very carefully.
but i missed an espresso machine in the room.
and, since the hotel has two entrances, if you arrive, after a long journey, at the back entrance( in front of the Marylebone Station) as most of the cabs prefer, you will be a little disoriented until you find the front desk.",5,2022,03,18
106,"Amazing hotel, with unreal views","The landmark did not disappoint, and it is just that, a landmark. We had an atrium view and i would not choose any other view on my next stay. The hotel, room, and facilities were exquisite. I would return again.",5,2022,03,15
106,Afternoon tea,"The Landmark is a wonderful hotel. From the entrance then going up the stairs to The Palm it’s truly beautiful. 
The lady at the check in counter was very polite and then took us to our table. 
The lady serving us was called Rita, she was very pleasant and helped us if we had any issues. 
We had the champagne afternoon tea. 
The sandwiches tasted nice, the scones were lovely and warm and you could choose from 5 different jams/ marmalades to have. We chose the strawberry and raspberry ones. My favourite was the raspberry. 
The cakes after all were lovely and so delicate. 
Our cups were never empty. They were always filled for us. 

We had a lovely time and would recommend the tea here. 

Thank you for a lovely time.",5,2022,03,09
106,Amazing hotel. Highly recommend,"I had a pleasure to stay at Landmark London in January for almost a week and I could not say a bad word about this hotel. Highly recommend. I would like to thank every single member of staff for making my stay so pleasant. I was honestly amazed by the level of the customer service. I came across a lot of staff members from reception, concierge, breakfast, dinner, spa, rooms service (and I apologise if I didn't mention every department) but all these people are the reason why I will definitely come back to this hotel on my next trip to London :)
Other than amazing staff memebrs.. The rooms are big size with very comfortable big beds. Its very well located in central London with great transport links.
Another thing I must mention is the spa. I had couple of treatments like facial and massage and I can stay it was definitely the best facial I've ever had. (I'm not sure If I remember correctly but the lady who was doing my facial was Mihelia, so thank you very much).
So if you're staying at Landmark I would recommend to book at least one of the spa treatments.",5,2022,03,09
106,Business Trip,A fantastic hotel in a great location for getting in and out of London. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly with every request being met with a smile. The Hotel has lots of spots to sit and work and hold meetings and being central is perfect for exploring London. I am looking forward to visiting the hotel with my wife over a long weekend soon as keep telling her how great it is. I also didnt get chance to enjoy the spa facilities so need to return for that!!,5,2022,03,07
106,Buffet breakfast,"I wanted to take the time to express my great satisfaction after having breakfast buffet at Winter Garden .

We (along with my brother and my mum) have enjoyed the breakfast very much because the choice of food offered was top and staff has been incredibly warmful,  very professional and trying their best to deliver a perfect service.  Special mention to Rosario and Rijo who have been very friendly and accomodating and professional. 

Hence a great experience in your hotel. 

Not only it is an absolute beautifully place to visit for a meal or breakfast but it is managed by a great staff and believe me we used to visit many great hotels like Parisian palaces (Royal Monceau or Hyatt Paris Vendôme).

Many thanks.  Rest assured we will come back and I recommend you and spread the word round me.

Kind regards

106,Great meeting at The Landmark hotel.,"Excellent visit to The Landmark for a business meeting yesterday. We sat in the recently re-opened Winter Garden which has great spots for one on one meetings, drinks and snacks. The food menu is delicious and generous and the customer service was outstanding. Even a request for an extension cable for our laptops was not too much trouble. Really impressed with the whole place and the team make it very special with attentive yet discreet service. High recommend!",5,2022,03,05
106,My favorite hotel in London,One of the most beautiful hotels to stay in London. It has an excellent location and the entrance is wonderful( A perfect spot for your IG pictures! ). The breakfast? I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the food and the variety. The entire staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and unforgettable. Thank you for making this day so special! I would highly recommend this hotel! The piano music just makes the experience more luxurious.,5,2022,02,28
106,Great hotel and service,"We stayed in a family suite for 3 nights and really enjoyed the hotel.  Room was spacious and functional and beds were comfortable.

Breakfast was excellent both in terms of selection and quality but the wait was too long for a table (was during Covid times though so hopefully this has improved).

 The pool area is very nice although slightly annoying that family swim times are so limited.

Would return.",4,2022,02,28
106,Recommended,"Good Hotel, very pleasant staff across all areas, good location & facilities, pool & leisure facilities great for central London, breakfast can be rather congested with quite a wait time, however it is worth it, good selection and attentive staff. 

Recommend this Hotel.",4,2022,02,25
106,"Amazing hotel, breakfast, staff, spa ! Everything was perfect!","Amazing experience. The Spa, the breakfast and the room are perfect! The staff was friendly and present.

I especially recommend the breakfast, very copious and fresh products.

We were also upgraded, the suite was incredible. 

I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2022,02,25
106,Landmark is on the mark,Superb stay here. We got upgraded to a suite as there was a mix up with our room which was fabulous. We also had another room next door. We overlooked the inner courtyard which was fantastic. Room was spotless and immaculate. This is probably one of our favourite hotels and we will definitely be staying again when we can afford it!,4,2022,02,19
106,Top over the TOP!!,"We booked for the Spa and after we went to the restaurant, without booking. We decided to have a quick lunch at the restaurant, the receptionist said that they are fully booked, but she manage to accommodate us.(she was quiet rude the way she approached us and I recommend she should smile a bit more). 
Big thanks to Kamel, Marta and Jose which made our day special, In a professional way and outstanding service. 
Thank you once again. We will be back soon!",5,2022,02,14
106,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday and our 20th anniversary. The hotel were so accommodating- they helped us out with an early check in, upgraded our room and delivered cakes to us in recognition of our celebrations! The room was so spacious and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was huge and had everything we needed. We really loved the spa which was so clean and quiet. 
Everything about this hotel is amazing- we will recommend it to our friends and can’t wait to come and stay again soon! Thank you to all the staff!",5,2022,02,13
106,Great experience,"We absolutely loved our stay. Upon arrival, an amazing lady called Ausra helped us with our reservation and made sure the process goes fast and smoothly. 

We had a fabulous time there and definitely will return back when we go to London again. 

Thank you Ausra and thank you The Landmark Hotel for an exceptional hospitality.",5,2022,02,04
106,Fanstastic afternoon tea,"We had a great afternoon tea experience, fantastic food and teas, the team was great and attentive. Thank you for the little congratulations cake! We had a friendly chat with Rita, very kind. The pianist was great too, playing tasteful classical and jazz pieces.",5,2022,02,04
106,Wonderful time and high quality,"Stayed at the LM hotel with my friend and our little daughters as a girls day out/pj party evening.
What a wonderful experience that was...for both the grown ups and the little ones.
The room and bathroom absolutely spotless.
The spa is amazing and the customer care is just something you wish to encounter on daily basis for services.
Starting with Charina at reception and through our staying there, many thanks Nika, Jose and Kamel...you guys are excellent and made us consider repeating the experience and recommended LM hotel to our friends as well.",5,2022,02,01
106,"5 star hotel, absolute luxury and lovely afternoon tea","We stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary and so glad we did. We upgraded to a suite and the room was beautiful. The most comfortable beds, lovely fittings and finishes throughout the rooms. Bathroom was huge and the room looked inwards towards the Palm Court. We also had afternoon tea here which I would highly recommend. The Palm Court dining is really beautiful. The service both at reception, the doormen and in the restaurant was perfect. Staff all very helpful and polite. I would definitely return here for another stay.",5,2022,01,25
106,Anniversary getaway,"Visited the lovely The Landmark London hotel for our 5th Wedding anniversary and had an amazing time.

106,Most beautiful hotel in London worth its 5 stars 🌟,Perfect in every way.  We stayed 2 nights for my daughters birthday and the hotel went above and beyond to help me plan special treats for her.  Thank you so so much.  We have stayed several times before and your hotel and its beauty never fails us.  We will be back in April and this time for longer.,5,2022,01,19
106,Great hotel uncomfortable beds,"This was our second visit. Hotel absolutely amazing staff professional and very friendly. Breakfast delicious. Location good .
The only bad thing is the beds, they are so hard. Couldn’t sleep at all. Pillows amazing but mattress so uncomfortable. Because of this with regret, I don’t think I can return.",4,2022,01,18
106,Great Location - Wonderful Room,"We stayed here one night after our cruise and before going home.  We chose this for the convenience to Marylebone Train Station. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our deluxe room was very nice, quiet and comfortable.  Some of the TV stations did not work, but that didn't matter. The WiFi was good and worked for our needs. We checked out almost a week ago and I still have yet to receive my statement for the night.",5,2022,01,18
106,Another exceptional stay,"Last time we came to The Landmark, spa facilities were limited and we couldn’t have a drink without a substantial meal, this time we decided to make the most of it.

Yet again we were blown away by the beauty of the building and the exceptional service. The mirror bar was excellent, I enjoyed a saffron cognac sour of some sort which I have to say was up there with the best cocktails I’ve ever had. Dinner was delightful once again and the spa was beautiful though the pool and especially jacuzzi were a little small, but hey, it’s London.

The location is also perfect for a trip to Bicester village as there are regular trains that take under an hour from Marylebone station right outside.

We will absolutely be staying at The Landmark again.",5,2022,01,06
106,Perfect start of the new year!,"We stayed at The Landmark for a few days and it was such a wonderful experience! The hotel is gorgeous and  the people that work there made it so special…
Thank you to Richard and the whole Concierge team for arranging our transportation and Maria at Reception for being always so smiley and helpful. Also Sanju and the staff in the SPA was always so welcoming. 
A big thank you to Nikka, Justina, Kamel and Nawal in the Winter Garden restaurant as well! 
We will definitely be back and we couldn’t recommend this hotel more!",5,2022,01,06
106,Great Central at the Landmark Hotel,"Always a amazing experience at Great Central in the Landmark Hotel, we come here once in a while, Agata and Janice are both really great always smiling and attentive to our needs, they definitely go above and beyond their duties.

Thank you again to Agata and Janice for making everytime we come.a amazing experience.",5,2021,12,30
106,The most Wonderful time of the year at the Landmark!,"We had a wonderful trip with our grandchildren to the Landmark for a pre Christmas shopping trip and trip to the Panto. The preparation and presentation of the room was stunning and our Grandchildren loved their teddy bears, stockings and robes. We also loved the Christmas hamper. 
Breakfast was wonderful, the choice was exceptional. The only slight negative point was the the temperature of the swimming pool. 

Rupert the doorman was a real hit with the girls, he was helpful and welcoming. He was also helpful getting taxis which helped with our trip as we didn’t want to use the underground. 

Thank you for making our London trip such a success and a Christmas to remember!",5,2021,12,27
106,Excellent from start do finish,"This hotel has beautiful spacious rooms. The hygiene level was very high, social distancing was respected., and we felt very safe in spite of Covid.The staff are friendly and helpful without being familiar. The decor is fabulous throughout and the spa and swimming pool a treat. Delicious food in the restaurant. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. Brilliantly done The Landmark. Thank you.",5,2021,12,23
106,Amazing Christmas Dinner,We had such an amazing evening at the Landmark Hotel festive Christmas Dinner.  The food and service was excellent.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The atmosphere was very festive and it was a good evening had by all.  We have no hesitation in returning next year for more happy celebrations.  Thank you to all the staff and Ania who helped in organising  the function.,5,2021,12,15
106,Afternoon Tea,"What a great Christmas treat. 
From the moment you walk in you cant help to be impressed. The staff, the hotel and the food were all fabulous. We had the champagne afternoon tea and drinks in the mirror bar - well worth a visit.
There was so much food we couldn't eat it all and was offered a doggy bag for the  left over cakes. The staff were attentive but not overly so. Its not the closest to central London (the touristy bit) but more than worth the ride out.",5,2021,12,14
106,Highly recommended,"From the minute you walk through the doors here you are made to feel welcome!
I went with my daughter and granddaughter (8mths). 
In the room was the cot I’d preordered. The room was spacious & clean.
The breakfast had a vast variety for all dietary requirements and there was no issue as getting us a high hair. The waitress even offered us a cushion for the baby’s back. 
There is a bus stop outside the hotel and Oxford Street is about 20mins walk away as is Madam Tussaud’s. We used a secure car park about 10minutes walk away. 
The doorman, Rupert was very accommodating at getting us a Black cab as we couldn’t use an Uber. 
The one TINY issue I had was there was only 2 English’s breakfast teabags for the 2 of us so I just bought another box from a local shop. 
Highly recommended!",5,2021,12,12
106,Fantastic Afternoon Tea!,"I booked the Festive Afternoon Tea after seeing it reviewed by Vogue, as one of London's best. We weren't disappointed. The hotel looked fantastic, The Winter Garden restaurant, with the palm trees and pianist playing made it very special. The tea was beautifully presented and delicious! Jose was very informative, and enthusiastic! Me and my sister had a fantastic afternoon. Definitely recommend as my favourite afternoon tea venue in London.",5,2021,12,10
106,Excellent experience ,"Works Christmas meal.  9 of us in total.  Very impressed as always.
Food amazing,  service great and the Christmas decorations outstanding 
Hope to be back soon
Took some great pictures , for great memories the pianist was a special touch too.  ..",5,2021,12,08
106,The best luxury hotel in London,"This is such an amazing historical hotel with first class services, facilities and fantastic food and beverage, plus central location in the heart of London.

I am a frequent traveler and have stayed in The Landmark for many years. All members of staff are so friendly and professional, make me feel very welcome at all times !

I particularly want to thank:
Sarah Baptiste, Director of Sales and Marketing. A marketing expert with in-depth understanding of events , corporate travelers’ needs and expectations, always respond promptly with the best solutions to provide the best hospitality exceeds my expectations 
Jo Wood, Sales Manager. Super efficient in responding bookings even though sometimes with short notice 
Guilia (Italian lady at the Reception, hope I spell the name correctly)
Super helpful with excellent customer service and always very polite and smiley. So nice to see her when I check in every time 

The Winter Garden Restaurant 
Such beautiful enchanting settings and love the Christmas decorations 
I would like to thank:
Kamel, Manager and his team: 
Maria, Marta, Roolica, Sergiu, the chef Omar and the hostess Yustina

Thank you again",5,2021,12,07
106,A lovely mini break,"A super relaxing break. Lovey food, an amazing breakfast spread, super spa and rooms, great and friendly  staff especially Maria in the Winter Garden. Perfect early start to Christmas celebrations. Thank uou.",4,2021,11,29
106,A fantastic stay,"Booked this for my boyfriends birthday, we had an amazing arrival experience from Richard and Malisa. Beautiful, luxurious room with an amazing bathroom. Spotlessly clean with a lovely view of the hotel winter garden. An added personal touch from the hotel as it was a celebration which was a wonderful surprise. Breakfast buffet had an amazing selection and Rosaria was really helpful when pointing out what was a must try which was a fantastic touch. Will definitely be returning to The Landmark London after what was a truly spectacular weekend.",5,2021,11,27
106,Comfort and luxury,"The hotel is beautiful, the room was large and luxurious, and the bed was very comfortable.  All staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  My only critisim would be that the check-in process was a bit frustrating, long queues and our room wasn't ready at the stated time.",5,2021,11,22
106,"Great Stay, great staff","Despite its size and grandeur, this hotel is friendly and personal. Rupert on the door, Jakob at the concierge desk, the staff in the Mirror Bar and the breakfast staff all deserve a special mention.  Well worth trying, especially for anyone staying in this part of London. Keep up the great work and let's hope there are no more lockdowns.",5,2021,11,22
106,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is beautiful, we stayed for one night in a family room and it was very spacious and luxurious. The staff were all lovely and the check-in and check out process was seamless. I visited the spa, not my favourite, and not in the same league as the rest of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for a special occasion or treat it is worth the money.",5,2021,11,18
106,Another wonderful two night stay,"Once again we return to this well located hotel.  Another relaxing stay and well needed . Although a large hotel each employee is friendly and helpful: you feel an individual. It was good to see a number of the staff remain from our last visits. 
Room was clean, quality bed linen, comfortable bed, good furniture. The spa pool is pleasantly warm and not too bad a size for a city location. Lockers available with towels , robes and slippers. Small seating area too with some magazines and flavoured waters and fruit. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Particular thanks to the staff member who patiently helped with unlocking the keypad lock!

Set evening meal is good value and excellent.",5,2021,11,14
106,Wonderful stay!!,"Great location, very friendly receptionist, lovely and spacious room and a large bathroom made our stay a wonderful experience. Very helpful staff at the spa as well, unfortunately there were no availabilities for a treatment during our three day stay so it’s probably a good idea to book ahead of arrival. Would love to come back!!",5,2021,11,14
106,First class stay and Rupert is a star!,"Amazing hotel, great location and the best service I’ve received in a long time. Hotel is beautiful, every one of the employees cares about whether you are having a good time (which is rare) and the facilities are brilliant. Rupert on the door is a fountain of all knowledge, he is funny, helpful and just an absolute star. We will be back and would recommend to anyone/everyone. First class.",5,2021,11,14
106,Fabulous,"Nothing but great things this to say about this place . So relaxing and tranquil , all staff were extremely efficient and professional without being stiff . I’d stay again and many thanks to all the staff who made my stay so restful",5,2021,11,14
106,A perfect Restaurant in every way!,"We booked the Landmark as a venue for 12 friends celebrating our 50th Anniversary of meeting at University, We all cannot find enough superlatives to describe the event which was enhanced by such a wonderful location . 
From the moment we arrived the very friendly Doorman made us feel welcome. The Winter Gardens are a hidden secret - the decor is exceptional. The 
staff were very professional, attentive, friendly and discreet. 
The food  and wines were extremely good and everyone was very happy with their choices. One of our party was in a wheelchair and was accommodated easily and felt looked after with easy movement to and from the restaurant.
We particularly wish to mention Ania the  Restaurant Reservations Co-ordinator. From the moment we booked she was exceptional in the care and attention she paid to our group and even came to make  sure all was well on the day. 
This is really the service you hope to get and she didn't disappoint. It's the personal touch that makes the difference - an extremely high standard of Customer Care. Would certainly recommend the Restaurant.
An additional feature is location. Many of our friends travelled from around the country and as the Landmark is next to Marylebone Mainline Station and Underground  Station found it easy to access.",5,2021,11,12
106,"Landmark Hotel,A Fabulous Two Night Stay 😉","Stayed at the Landmark hotel Marylebone London, had an amazing stay at this hotel ,great room looking over the central dining area with 
palm trees 🌴 fantastic breakfast,with staff that are attentive & even mix the tea of your choice. Other staff that go out of the way to help you out,Rupert Crosbie for one as one of the doormen smartly dressed looking the part,the hats 🎩 always make it in a smart hotel, but he went out of his way helping and telling us about the hotels history which he has written a piece on the Landmark website.and just across the road to Marylebone station where the Beatles filmed the station Seen A Hard Days Night..Great Stay, will definitely be back..",5,2021,11,09
106,Superb weekend thanks to The Landmark,"We have just had such a lovely weekend, Deluxe double room on 6th floor was so spacious and very very comfortable  White Company complimentary toiletries, all very nice touches. Our only negative was there was no bottled water provided in the room, but think it was just an oversight, nothing major.

The pool and spa area was lovely, so relaxing. The Winter Garden restaurant served the best breakfast we've ever had in a hotel in the UK and the afternoon tea was pretty impressive too! The Mirror Bar is lovely for a pre dinner cocktail, really enjoyed that.

Above everything, all the staff without exception are really helpful,  professional and tend to your every need with ease, they are kind and friendly and very ""on it"" - they know just what to do, what to say and we enjoyed chatting to many of them.

We will be back - this is a gem right by Marylebone where our train comes into London - perfect!",5,2021,11,07
106,Perfect for a special occasion,"I stayed here for two nights with my husband and young children for my 40th birthday and our 10 year wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to a family studio which overlooked the atrium and it was fabulous. Plenty of space for the 4 of us, 2 TVs, a play tent and head torches for the kids and very comfortable beds. 
Breakfast was amazing - lots of choice, excellent service and high quality food. The staff were brilliant with our young children, helping them with their selections etc. 
It’s not cheap - but it’s v special and we will remember our stay for a long time. 
Only negative was the bar is closed Sunday and Monday! We wanted a glass of champagne in the bar on Sunday night but were disappointed that this wasn’t possible.",5,2021,11,01
106,Bad service,Just stayed at the Landmark hotel who I am a friend member with.  I booked a room on their website bed and breakfast. When I checked out they said it was room only and charged £70 extra for breakfast.  I thought that was a bit excessive and ask if they could help me out with the breakfast cost. There was no joy as the manager was young and like a robot.  The service has gone down hill so will have to review where we stay in London in the future. Shame.,1,2021,10,31
106,Fantastic,Had an absolutely fantastic stay here. The room was beautiful and allowed me to relax and find some peace.  Definitely one of London's best. Special thanks to Olga Terzaki and Kamel Jilani making my stay extra special. Cannot wait to come back!,5,2021,10,25
106,DO NOT STAY HERE Semen stained bed sheets and disgusting service,"Myself and my partner booked the landmark hotel as a get away from our busy lives up north. We treated ourselves to a junior suite with views of the beautiful indoor courtyard (or so it showed on booking.com) 
As soon as  we arrived (9pm at night tired) the entrance was completely bare no one on reception / security at all we had to roam around to find a staff member to then be told we had entered from the back of the building as that is weds taxis drop off but no staff work there !! We then walked through the hotel to the other side to the real reception, already I found this very unsafe as anyone could just walk into the hotel through the night and staff would be unaware! 

We then got checked in and went up to our “junior suite” to utter disappointment, a very dated, bad smelling room and our view was a wall of the opposite building !! 

But the worst of all was the Bed sheets which had white stains and hairs all over, absolutely disgusting ! 

We contacted the duty manager who told us there was simply nothing she could do about the situation and we would still be expected to pay the £1000 room fee for the 2 nights !! We simply refused to stay in the hotel and checked out immediate the hygiene, smell and service is a disgrace it is no wonder london has increasing levels of the virus ! 

We were left to find s new hotel in the evening after travelling 4 hours to what we thought was a high standard beautiful hotel and had chosen a junior suite.",1,2021,10,24
106,60th birthday celebrations,"Superb hotel - family break to celebrate my wife’s special birthday - quick check in - pleasant staff - we booked a suite, which was great, nice size - separate sitting room - large bathroom with shower / separate shower - thank you to the hotel for the birthday cake !! Nice “mirror” bar with attentive staff - great concierge ! 
What a hotel ! Fantastic courtyard - Magnificent building and central / 
I would highly recommend this hotel and a BIG thank you to all the staff !",5,2021,10,24
106,Extremely helpful and was a great stay,After dropping my wife’s family to the airport 3 in the morning Federica at reception was extremely helpful and understanding by giving me an wife a late checkout so we can catch some sleep. Everything in the hotel felt so calm and relaxing. Look forward to out stay again.,5,2021,10,20
106,Just amazing,"Beautiful hotel with amazing attentive staff.
Absolutely 10/10 from check in to check out for cleanliness, food, service and amenities. The spa is fantastic.
On our first night we spent the evening just exploring the hotel, it's enormous. Amazing.",5,2021,10,19
106,"Delicious afternoon tea, a beautiful hotel","Been a lot for drinks in the mirror bar, tea and scones, but went for afternoon tea yesterday. So so wonderful. Delicious. Lovely service, friendly and welcoming. 

I’d booked for a friend and I, for our upcoming birthdays. She was over from the USA for the first time for ages (thank you covid) so it was a special occasion. I’d forgotten I’d mentioned our birthdays and so when we heard the piano playing Happy Birthday it didn’t twig, then two happy birthday cakes were brought over! We were both surprised!!!! 

The choice of tea was broad, I tried the Landmark blend, and my friend a Rose Grey. Both very good. I’ve tried Iron Goddess of Mercy before (!) The Landmark Blend had a long bourbon vanilla finish and went well with the afternoon tea. The sandwiches were really excellent, coronation chicken on walnut bread was my fav, but also egg Mayo with cress, cucumber, and lapsang souchong smoked Scottish salmon. Yum!!!! The scones were so good with a choice of two preserves and clotted cream, and a selection of delicious pastries. See photos. 

The surroundings in the Winter Garden are just so pleasing, relaxing and really beautiful. I pop in just for tea sometimes to unwind. All the staff are very friendly - efficient and professional. The door man on the way out offered to call us a cab and one lovely gent in the atrium on our way out gave us some Landmark  bags for our leftovers in nice boxes, and a bag I’d been carrying that was a little full. So thoughtful. Our main waiter was Rosario (I hope that is right) and he was very nice and offered to take some pictures of us. Just so professional and good at what they do. 

Sandwiches and tea are refilled. 

Sadly the Mirror Bar wasn’t open. I’d say it is the best bar in London. With possible exception of the Lanesborough. Very well trained and experienced bar staff, really sophisticated atmosphere, expensive but the bar snacks are excellent and filling, and the drinks really are good. Death in the Afternoon is one of their specials - Hemingway’s fav tipple - he’d have five in a day; absinthe and champagne. One is enough for me!! 

The hallways around the hotel have really interesting art and the toilets are always spotless. I mean SPOTLESS. I’ve never seen a single thing out of place and have never seen staff in them!! 

The whole building is really beautiful. Right on Marylebone toad in front of the train station and just down from Baker Street station (which is in front of Regents Park) so for tourists a perfectly central place to stay. 

Highly recommend the afternoon tea, bar and the hotel - although I’ve never stayed-  as it’s staff are such a good advert for the hotel.",5,2021,10,17
106,Out of this world!,"I have stayed at the Landmark twice. The first time was a couple of years ago - had a pleasant stay so wanted to return again. My second stay was out of this world. We were given a room with view of the atrium, it was stunning. The room as a whole was perfect - decor and bathroom were great. 

Sitting in the winter garden was really enjoyable, the atmosphere is lovely! We went for afternoon tea on our first day, the scones were delicious, we woke up craving them the next morning and opted to have a cream tea. Arab gentleman working at the hotel (can’t remember his name, sorry) was so accommodating and offered to get us some extra scones. 

This hotel is really worth the money and I can’t wait to book my next stay.",5,2021,10,15
106,Absolutely amazing,"Absolutely amazing stay! Amazing building, staff, room, food, drinks and atmosphere. Honestly couldn’t have asked for a better time at the Landmark. From arrival until check out we really did have an incredible experience. The afternoon tea was amazing, the dinner was the best 3 courses I’ve ever eaten and the cocktail bar was brilliant. We also enjoyed the spa facilities, pool, jacuzzi and sauna which was lovely! Would love to come back one day",5,2021,10,10
106,The Worst 5 Star Hotel In London - Stay Away!,"When booking the hotel direct, I received two confirmation emails with completely different confirmation numbers on them. Both emails were formatted completely differently. I'd entered my card details at checkout and assumed it was an upfront card payment - this is how you pay in advance with any other hotel. One day later, an individual named Olga emails, saying I have to now click a link to pay. Confusing?! To make matters worse she had typed in the balance incorrectly and it just looked like a fraud email. Apparently this is how they have people pay in advance. Very strange - never experienced this with the Ritz Carlton or 4 Seasons.
 
I received a text the day before check-in wanting me to check-in in advance. Unfortunately, I couldn't as no one had bothered to fix the incorrect price that had been entered so it said I still owed money. 

We arrived at the hotel and had to talk through a maze to find the reception. The doormen didn't explain where it was. You have to walk through past ballrooms and an large area that looks like Orlando International Airport before you find the front desk. 

We got to the check-in desk eventually and was told we were getting an ""upgrade"" for a room. 

At 9pm the first night the disaster began. Our ""upgraded"" room was interconnecting with a suite. That the front desk new had a wedding party in. They were loud an obnoxious. The hotel was taking alcohol to their room which clearly didn't help. They were shouting, swearing, singing etc. Clearly not a suite to want to be interconnected to. We called front desk and they said they'd call security. That didn't help. So we called again and the night manager came. This just made the situation worse. The wedding party got annoyed and were stood outside our door shouting. They continued being noisy for hours. We felt very intimidated and not safe. - Why the front desk didn't just switch us to a different room is beyond me?? Oh and the man who checked us in was also the man who told us it was the wedding party?! Disgusting that we were placed in the room. It generally wasn't an upgrade but the worst downgrade we could have been given. 

The second night at 11:30pm there is a booming noise of music coming from the ballroom. This lasted until just after 1. We were told it on the phone would stop before that. After 1, the next lot of drunk guest started shouting in the interconnecting suite. We heard things you'd never want to hear. At 3 am we were still awake. The next morning we spoke to the front desk manager who claimed ""we didn't think the noise would pass the first floor"". Common sense would be to go and see for yourself - as you clearly knew there would be noise. 

We were offered only 35% refund on the room. When I think about it that refund is RIDICULOUS. That means they think 65% of the stay with them was satisfactory; it definitely wasn't. The service from the moment we booked on the website was dire. We were knowingly put in that room and not once were we offered an alternative room - the staff simply couldn't care. We got only a few hours of sleep due to this, making us tired and unable to enjoy our trip. The rooms are spacious but dated and the mattresses and pillows are horrible. The bathroom again spacious but dirty grout and tiles. 

I wouldn't pay anyone to stay in this hotel and I feel sorry for anyone with an up and coming visit. If you haven't paid in advance, I'd recommend staying at a proper 5 star elsewhere. 

Thank you Landmark Hotel for RUINING our trip to London, we WON'T be returning.",1,2021,10,08
106,It was OK,"First stay here, a beautiful looking hotel inside and out.  The reception staff are very friendly and efficient.  We had a snack in the bar, sadly our order was taken incorrectly and the whole service was odd.

The room we had was spacious but dated.  The bathroom is in need of an update.  In a 5 star hotel I really expect a good shower or bath.",3,2021,10,06
106,Somewhat disappointing,"Having had an excellent stay at this hotel a number of years ago I chose to book this hotel for a recent trip. Sadly, standards seem to have slipped.

Positives:
Great location
Fantastic door staff
Possibly the best afternoon tea in London
Rooms are large by city standards
Plenty of lifts

Cons:
Strange aromas in some parts of the hotel (dusty/foisty)
Front desk staff were not attentive
Lacking attention to detail- room was not completely clean, bedside clock showing the wrong time,  bathroom door lock broken, hair dryer missing accessories.
Mini bar was empty although a significant deposit per night was required for incidentals?
Some of the corridors were shabby and carpets looking tired in places.
Graffiti etched into the staining above the waterline on swimming pool walls

A visit for afternoon tea is most definitely worthwhile, but the hotel itself needs improvement to get back to its previous high standard. There are currently better hotels at this price point in my opinion.",4,2021,10,05
106,Disgusting,You don’t expect when you pay  £418 for a night to pull find this when you pull your bed back for a nap ... obviously never had to bed changed from the last vister absolutely disgusting & hotel will not do nothing about it ! 5 star London hotel I think NOT!!!!,1,2021,10,04
106,Large evening event,"What a wonderful team of people keeping an amazing building beautiful and welcoming.  From the welcome at the doorway from Rupert and all the team, the reception staff, the concierges the waiting staff, the team behind the scenes keeping the rooms clean and fresh and the chefs doing the superb and delicious cooking! We had an amazing experience from start to finish.  The waiting staff worked so hard to make our evening special and memorable and the food was amazing.  The croissants at breakfast were as delicious as the fresh fruits and perfectly cooked scrambled eggs.  The room was amazing.  One of the best experiences, I would definitely recommend.  I only wish I had made time to try the pool and spa facilities.  Hopefully we can go back one day.  Thank you team Landmark London for working so hard and making our stay absolutely amazing ♥️",5,2021,10,03
106,Our third stay and counting........,"Returned yesterday from a lovely weekend spent with The Landmark and her fabulous staff. This is our third stay with each being as pleasant as the other.

From the doormen, the wonderful aroma at reception, the immaculate cleanliness throughout to the super breakfast and its staff and the relaxed atmosphere of the Great Central Bar and The Mirror Bar, everything was exactly as it should be. 

We used to stay at The Langham but The Landmark has become our mainstay now.

Will be booking and bringing the children with us at the beginning of December to see the lights and already looking forward to it.

Thanks again to all staff for a lovely weekend.",5,2021,09,27
106,"Was 5 star, isn't now !","We have stayed here many times over the years and as such, you would think, given that we are regulars, that we would receive a decent service. Sadly, we have not.

We asked for a quiet room. We were placed on the first floor above a conference room. As we walked from the lifts to the room, there was pulsating, high volume music coming from below which could be heard in the corridors - and in the room - this at 3pm. God knows what 9pm would have sounded like.

Next morning: breakfast arrived in our room without any cutlery.
That evening: dinner arrived in our room with someone else's drinks.

Next day: we arrived back at the hotel at 3pm to find that the room had not been cleaned, the bed made or any cleaning carried out - we had to vacate the room whilst this was done.

We had to leave at 5am - we pre-ordered a taxi the night before to avoid any delays. The taxi arrived late - reason: it was only requested a few minutes before 5am, not the night before as requested. We were told by the front desk that, as an panic measure,  someone had been despatched to find a taxi by Marylebone taxi rank but this was patently untrue.

It is now clear that, as with other hotels we have stayed at, priority, or at least more attention is given to weddings and other functions over individual paying guests. There is no doubt lots of profit in functions. Basically, gusts such as ourselves are treated with complacency. The management are not managing.

We are transferring our allegiance to another 5 star hotel which truly deserves the badge - the Landmark has lost it for us and is arguably only a 4 star tourist hotel now.

A great shame.",3,2021,09,26
106,Excellent Large Corporate Event,"I recently booked the Landmark hotel for a 180 person charity corporate ball. The evening was a complete success. Which is in large part due to the efforts of the hotel's events team. 

A big thank you to Maria Gallardo for all her support in planning the event. And also to Juan for his assistance on the night. The hotel's events team are first class. I would recommend the Landmark to anyone looking to host a similar function. It's a great space, and you're in safe hands with Maria! 

Will",5,2021,09,06
106,Thank you George from Concierge,"My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous weekend stay at The Landmark Hotel whilst we celebrated our 22nd Wedding Anniversary. The hotel room, lunch, dinner and the overall service was exceptional. We commend all staff for their warm welcome, however, one person who stood out in particular was George from Concierge. He was most welcoming and on two separate occasions stopped to ask how we were and if there was anything we needed. He was a pleasure to talk to and we thank him for making us feel so welcomed.

We look forward to returning to the hotel in the near future together with our children.",5,2021,09,05
106,Recent stay,"We have stayed in this Hotel a few times before, but not for a few years.
Overall we had a Good stay this time.  The Hotel is lovely.  Our room was good, very quiet. It was very clean, apart from what looks like a permanent stain on the bathroom floor, ? something could be done about that.
Covid precautions were pretty poor.  Very few staff wore masks. Tables very close together during breakfast.  
Breakfast overall very disappointing. Hot buffet food barely warm and very limited choice.  We ended up only eating the pastries.  We have had better breakfasts in other Hotels recently for half the price.
We did enjoy a room service meal, which arrived hot and cooked well.
We would stay again , just hope the breakfast experience was an off day.",4,2021,09,05
106,Great dinner for 2.,"A wonderful meal in the winter garden restaurant. This was our first visit for dinner here and it was perfect from start to finish. Great food, we went for prawn cocktail followed by fillet steak. We thought we had our best prawn cocktail at ‘the crown at bray’ but this was exquisite! Great service and a beautiful restaurant.

Will visit again very soon.",5,2021,09,04
106,Excellent,Although the room was not ready on arrival this was soon resolved. Overall the standards are excellent with staff who can’t do enough for me. The mirror bar was the perfect place to end the day and a brilliant selection at breakfast. We will be back again.,5,2021,08,30
106,Beautiful hotel. Cannot fault it! ,"What a beautiful hotel! This was our first time staying at the Landmark, and it won't be our last. Our family room was vast, and so comfortable. The shower was amazing (you can tell a lot about a hotel by the pressure of the shower, haha). All the toiletries were White Company and very lovely. The restaurant staff at both breakfast and dinner were so friendly, and great with our 6 year old and 4 year old. Speaking of which, the breakfast was absolutely 5 star (thought the breakfast at the Langham Hotel was unbeatable, but this may have just pipped it!)... and the set menu at dinner was yummy too. Can recommend the beef short rib. In conclusion, a beautiful spacious hotel and brill location directly opposite the entrance to Marylebone Station. We will be back!! ",5,2021,08,29
106,Mother & daughter trip,"Had a wonderful stay. The staff are super and so lovely. They couldn’t do enough for us. The staff seem very happy and that’s great to see - enjoying work! 

Food was great, rooms were just fabulous and looking forward to coming back very soon!",5,2021,08,27
106,A fabulous stay!,"Wow - what a fabulous stay we had at the hotel this week! The staff were all super friendly and helpful and my boys loved to be welcomed and called gentlemen whenever we came and went from the lobby by the doorman. (He even posed for a pic and let the boys try on his top hat!) Our family friendly room was very spacious and a lovely touch with the tent, teddies and head torches for the boys. (The cookies went down a treat too!) The breakfast was amazing, so much choice even for my fussy eaters and the waiting staff were so friendly both mornings we were there. Very conviently located with easy access to the underground right opposite. We had such a lovely stay here and would def recommend if you like a bit of luxury whilst staying in London.",5,2021,08,26
106,Perfect Hotel for a Family London Staycation,"Just returned from a 5 night staycation at this hotel, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel extremely welcome.  The staff (particularly in the restaurant) are amazing, they go above and beyond to ensure everything is perfect and  are true assets to the hotel.

Our family room was spacious, my only criticism would be to change the double beds for king size to enhance the rooms.",5,2021,08,22
106,Cocktails in the bar,"Been here twice in the last month, just for cocktails in the lounge bar. Whether coming by foot or by taxi, the staff treat you great, lovely Old fashioned and Negroni, nice foc snacks too as an accompaniment. Olives and nuts. Great knowledge shown by bar staff and very welcoming. A lovely drop in experience, will have to try more in future.",5,2021,08,19
106,Still awaiting refund as charged twice,"The hotel is beautiful and the people are extremely polite, especially in the Spa.
The other side of this is that I have been charged twice foe my stay which isn’t a small amount of money .

I have called and spoken to the reception on Saturday and highlighted my concern, I then received an email on Monday morning saying funds will be back in my account…. Roll on three days, two emails still no payment returned to my account. No one has taken the time to call, or acknowledge my correspondence, which quite frankly I am shocked about with the hotel being a 5 star … 

Twitter will be next… surely if I haven’t approved this payment it’s theft ???",1,2021,08,19
106,Beautiful stay,"Just spent Friday night at the Landmark with my partner and had to write a review.  From the moment you walk in you are presented with a spectacular atrium, lined each side with huge palm trees. A member of staff named Dovile checked us in and was so clear and polite with her explanation of the facilities and how to find our room it set a great start to the weekend. The room was beautifully laid out and spacious it felt more like home than a hotel. The food & service in the Winter garden restaurant was refreshing, along with the overall setting in the atrium.  We had a few drinks in the mirror bar before returning to our room. I regret not booking a 2nd night but will do next time. Thank you Landmark for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,08,17
106,Couples stay in superior room for 3 nights,"We booked a superior room with a nice view of the internal courtyard. 

Pros
Great friendly doormen & concierge 
Nice spa (pool, jacuzzi and sauna)
Robes provided
Very comfortable beds
Great location
Mirror bar was lovely and the lady that works in their gave the best service
Lovely cocktails (but expect to pay £40/£50 for 2)
Spacious quiet rooms 

Cons
Would have liked a fridge so I didn’t have to call room service all the time for fresh milk
Didn’t warn us our door keys would stop working so that led to some stress
No secure WiFi provided for guests so I could not work from there and had to go into the office
No snack menu available (not a big deal but sometimes nice to grab a quick light bite in your hotel)
No one explained to us about the other exit & taxis - would have liked to have known earlier",4,2021,08,14
106,40th birthday surprise,"I planned a surprise overnight stay and afternoon tea. Had the most amazing stay. Staff very attentive, a lovely lady name Olga  saw to our every need. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, you will NOT be disappointed :)",5,2021,08,11
106,Delicious afternoon tea ,"My daughter bought us afternoon tea for my birthday and wow..the best ever. Sandwiches ultra fresh and delicious, scones obviously made by the chefs, fab. Varied home made jams to choose from, clotted cream as much as you need, and cakes/desserts gorgeous. They said we could have as many sandwiches as we liked! (Unheard of elsewhere). So we did 😃. As much tea and choices of same as we liked. 😃.   a glass of Laurent Perrier Champagne was delish. The service was second to none by ALL staff that assisted us. We were there from 12 to 5.30 and could have stayed longer. Fantastic ambience in the glass ceilinged restaurant along with amazing architecture.  Highly recommend.. and I am fussy!  ",5,2021,08,07
106,Pleasant enough!,"Pleasant enough but not as luxurious as I would expect. Very friendly staff but wouldn't give it top rating, had to wait more than 15 minutes to check in, which is a lot with exhausted young kids. Not up to par concierge service. Extra unexpected charges on room service breakfast for options available for free when you go down to breakfast. Have had better in similar rated establishments in ""3rd world countries""",4,2021,08,06
106,Would not recommend.,"Unfortunately, I didn’t have the stay I was expecting at the London Landmark hotel and I won’t be back. 

 But I’ll start with the positives:
(+) Early check in.
(+) Clean room.
(+) Access to all Sky channels.
(+) Friendly staff around the hotel offering to open doors and carry heavy luggage.
(+) Short distance to Underground and Marylebone station.  
(+) Great concierge staff. Friendly and willing to go above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. 

(-) Shower head not correctly fitted causing water to spray over the shower door and cause puddles on the ground. 
(-) Bathroom door didn’t close properly - minimal privacy. 
(-) Room was not regularly cleaned. Left without toilet roll and a bath robe which was needed to use the spa. 
(-) Left with a broken hairdryer in the room. 

My spa experience was the most disappointing. I had booked to use the spa between 9am - 10am. When we arrived there were 7 screaming children in the pool including 2 adults leaving no space for myself and my partner to swim. Guests used mobile phones pool side regardless of the ‘Spa Policy.’ Guests were not challenged by a member of staff who simply walked straight past them on multiple occasions.  There were no clean towels left in the spa which then had to be requested. It’s safe to say I was far from relaxed after I left! 

Unfortunately, I would not recommend this hotel and would not rate it 5 stars nor pay the money we did to stay here. For a 5 star hotel I expect ALOT more.",3,2021,08,02
106,Lovely stay,"Went for a night stay for anniversary, was lovely hotel very clean and very friendly staff. Lovely breakfast was really impressed with the dinner set was royal crown Darby and the pattern on the dinner set matches the rails in the hotel very nice touch I thought . Would definitely stay again.",5,2021,08,01
106,The service from the booking department was incredible.,"After having a nightmare with a third party booking service trying to book a stay here Spencer and Richard in the booking department went above and beyond to rectify the problem and make sure our stay was as special as planned and expected. 
I felt like they really cared and wanted to help and in turn our surprise stay for my husbands birthday was amazing, the hotel, the room,  was beautiful, staff were helpful and happy and we really enjoyed our stay. 
Can’t thank them enough. We will return for sure.",5,2021,07,30
106,Afternoon Tea in Heaven,"My friend and I visited the Hotel , The Winter Gardens Restaurant for my Birthday Afternoon Tea. The surroundings were soothing and tranquil. The service was excellent, attentive and friendly. We are both vegetarian and were catered for well , my only suggestion afterwards was that all the pastries were fruit based and I don't like fruit. Was given a special little birthday cake and the staff were so genuine in their warm wishes. We had champagne and don't usually like champagne but this was lovely. I got the impression that the place was very ' covid ' safe , it was certainly spotlessly clean. Our train pulls in to Marylebone so the travel was effortless.",5,2021,07,26
106,Birthday afternoon tea,"Excellent excellent excellent!
Althought this review is overdue it is well deserved!
Came here for my birthday back in october for afternoon tea and was not disappointed at all.
The service was excellent and warm, the tea was an aquired taste but nontheless tasty and the range of UNLIMITED sandwiches and scones were amazing too.
Desserts were also exquisite.

Could not fault and will 100% return!",5,2021,07,25
106,"Fabulous, very luxurious, great way to celebrate a special birthday","Wonderful stay at the Landmark hotel. Large, clean, well appointed rooms in the Marleybone suite with very comfortable furniture and bed. Excellent powerful shower with plenty of hot water. Gently serenaded by the piano playing beneath our window during the day, very quiet at night.
All staff very friendly and attentive. Fabulous gluten free afternoon tea with delicious sandwiches, scones and pastries. Excellent evening meal. Had a Happy birthday platter of fruit with each meal as well as Happy birthday being played discretely on the piano to accompany them!
An oasis of calm and luxury, will love to visit again",5,2021,07,25
106,Return to a fabulous hotel,"It was with great pleasure that we were finally able to return to this amazing hotel.  They like everyone else have had a challenging year.  Watching the video of them turning the lights out, due to them having to close because of lockdown.  However the lights are now shining brightly again.  It felt great to walk back through the main doors, after being greeted by the friendly doorman.  Every member of staff we came into contact with were so friendly and helpful. They may have been wearing masks at the time but their smiles were shining through.

Our room was just perfect.  Breakfast certainly set us up for the day.  Service impeccable. Staff efficient, friendly and helpful.

If you decide to stay here you will not be disappointed.   I hope I can return again soon.",5,2021,07,24
106,Finest Hotel in London,"We have just stayed at the Landmark after getting married in Marylebone. This is such a unique hotel to London and the grandness of the place really added to the occasion of our wedding and to our guests. Lots of places market themselves as 5 star but honestly, the Landmark excels in every area to be above 5 star. Every aspect was first class - especially all the staff. So glad to see the place back open and I cannot imagine how anyone could be disappointed staying here. Thanks to everyone at the Landmark who made us so welcome.",5,2021,07,20
106,Superb Service,"We recently stayed at the Landmark for a wedding and had 4 rooms for our family including my elderly parents who had never experienced a 5 star hotel before.
Everything was superb. The greeting, check in, the rooms and the breakfast which I believe is the best in London.
ALL the staff are friendly, efficient and incredibly professional. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2021,07,19
106,A brilliant hotel,"Stayed at the Landmark recently for a family wedding happening nearby. 

The stay was wonderful and nothing was too much trouble for the hotel. They helped with printing some speeches, bringing facilities to the room for wedding attire to be ironed and accommodated a request for an early breakfast. 

A beautiful setting and the fantastic staff made our stay a joy.",5,2021,07,19
106,Absolutely Brilliant,"Service in this hotel is amazing. Visiting the spa twice for three treatments done by Nina and they vastly exceeded what I expected. I spoke with Nina (the therapist) about some back problems I had from an injury and she was able to fix the majority of them and put me back in good shape. Sanju at the Spa Front Desk was also very helpful.

The hotel was nicely decorated and I have no complaints whatsoever. The breakfast was great aswell.",5,2021,07,13
106,Review,I came to visit the hotel and there was a staff member called  Dovile who dealt with my situation. She was the most kindest and understanding person I have come across. She was very kind and welcoming.,5,2021,07,11
106,Utterly AMAZING!,"Stunning hotel both inside and out, but it is the staff who make this place even more magical and special! I contacted The Landmark for a surprise proposal and the service received from start to finish was impeccable. Giulia who took my initial phone call was super helpful and polite. She did not go the extra yard but the EXTRA MILE to make it the most memorable day! We were upgraded and had complimentary champagne and strawberries sent to the room. She allowed for me to get the room key from 10am so I can arrange the décor etc. with the vendors at no extra charge and was there for me every step of the way. So, from both of us, a massive thank you for everything Giula! 😊 I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is beautifully detailed and designed, having dinner at the Winter Garden restaurant was a really nice experience (it did not feel like the UK) with the live piano playing in the background. Waking up in the morning with the atrium view was unreal! Everything about this hotel was perfect and better than what I expected. We will certainly be back soon and for years to come as it has become our special place for so many reasons!",5,2021,07,06
106,Afternoon Tea-the best in London,"Outstanding service and level to details at the Landmark, I have probably been to all London hotels and venues to try out Afternoon Tea and The Landmark is amazing, hands down the best! 

A special thanks to Agnieszka Lorek, Andrei and Rita who really looked after us so well. 

Thank you for everything, we will be back soon.",5,2021,07,05
106,Theatre and weekend visit to London,"We stayed at The Landmark Hotel at the weekend to twin with our theatre tickets. The Landmark was just incredible and was a delight to be back staying at hotels after so long.

The cleanliness and 5 star touches around the hotel, delivered by all staff was a joy to be part of and I look forward to returning soon.",5,2021,07,05
106,Overnight stay at the hotel,"I was lucky to stay at this beautiful hotel last weekend and all  i can say is WOW. Once we arrived we felt transportered to somewhere exotic , which with all the travel restrictions was so needed for our stay cation break. 

The hotel is just so special as were all the staff we came in contact with. It was reassuring to see they have all the COVID measures in place and the hotel is spotless and made us feel very safe. It was great to see the attention to cleaning which we regularly witnessed housekeeping doing throughout our stay in the public areas and our room.

And when we walked into our room how fantastic bright and one of the biggest rooms i have seen for London. Again in the room everything was spotlessly clean with fluffy towels and robes for us to enjoy.

We enjoyed cocktails in the trendy Mirror bar , i would highly recommend a visit. The staff we met were all so helpful, friendly and most of all happy to take care of us.

The hospitality industry has been hit hard by COVID  but if all hotels were to be as great as the Landmark is i am sure the industry will come flooding back.

Thank you to all the hard working staff at The Landmark keep it up your all doing a super job and we cannot wait to return .",5,2021,06,27
106,A perfect weekend getaway,"Stayed at Landmark for a weekend getaway. The hotel is amazing and the winter garden in particular is a very unique feature of the hotel. 

The service all round was first class and we were certainly spoilt for choice for breakfast. 

I would recommend anyone to stay here!",5,2021,06,22
106,A perfect post-lockdown treat!,"I wanted to give my 83-year-old mum a luxurious and safe treat after what has been a very difficult time and The Landmark hotel was the perfect place for a fantastic experience. All the staff provided an absolutely excellent, friendly and welcoming service and gave extra time and thoughtfulness for my mum helping her to be comfortable by providing additional cushions for her chair when we went for dinner and breakfast in the beautiful Winter Garden restaurant. The Landmark hotel website has very comprehensive information about it's Covid-secure measures which was very reassuring. The central atrium of the Landmark is light, airy and spacious, and must surely be a unique feature for a hotel in central London. It was fantastic to have two rooms with windows overlooking the atrium which is a haven of peace away from the business of London's streets. Our two Executive rooms provided us with the highest level of luxury and were so spacious. The spotlessly clean, bedroom and bathroom (with separate bath and shower) were an absolute delight to spend time in. As the weather was quite rainy, we spent more time in our rooms than planned and enjoyed every minute there watching TV! Room service even brought us fresh milk for making tea in our rooms within a couple of minutes of us calling them. The dinner and breakfast were delicious and of really top quality. I loved the relaxing atmosphere in the Winter Garden and all the staff gave us such welcoming smiles and were so helpful giving an exceptional service. I also visited the hotel spa early in the morning and had the whole swimming pool to myself - it was such a relaxing experience! I would recommend The Landmark to anyone who wants to experience beautiful surroundings combined with fantastic food and excellent customer service.",5,2021,06,21
106,Brilliant party,"We organised a small kid's birthday treat at Landmark. We booked their English Afternoon Tea,  one table for 3 adults and 2 kids. While booking the event, their staff Jose and Eufelia, found out that it was for our child's birthday, scaled down due to lockdown restrictions.  Out of their own initiative, they organised a birthday theme around the party. On the day itself, their in-house pianist greeted us with Disney songs, the table was decorated with birthday themed confetti, they brought out a special cupcake with candles, decorated with name and all (have no idea how they managed to write so beautifully so much on a cupcake, nice job!!).  The pianist even played a birthday song to accompany the birthday cupcake. They made a small tea party such a wonderful special event for us all. It was really above and beyond. We appreciated it so much. They have the most amazing staff in such a beautiful hotel. Totally recommend special events to be celebrated there.",5,2021,06,20
106,Incredibly luxurious hotel,"We stayed at The Landmark to celebrate our engagement & they absolutely made our stay super special. 

We got an upgrade to an executive room, which was huge and incredibly luxurious- they also provided us with a bottle of champagne and delicious chocolate covered strawberries. 

The bed was so comfortable & the room service breakfast in the morning is something myself & my fiancée will remember for a long time.",5,2021,06,16
106,"Fine dining at his best, again !!","A dear friend was in London and I wanted them to experience one of the finest dining in the city! 
What better place than the winter garden!
Thank you to Justyna and Andrei, always so professional, and to our waitress Theresa who as always was impeccabile on her customer service skills! 
All three were constantly looking after us making sure we were comfortable and happy with everything!
Can not praise enough the chefs who have designed an amazing menu!
You have to try the house champagne! Light and complimentary to your special occasion! 

I would recommend to anybody to pay a visit! 
You will not be disappointed! 

Thank you all for making an evening meal such a success! 
10/10!!",5,2021,06,16
106,Perfection,"Wow what a fantastic place this fabulous hotel is.  A quiet oasis of tranquility in the heart of London.  I cannot imagine one thing that would improve my stay.  The service was friendly and impeccable, the restaurant out of this world (both venue and food) and my exec room spacious, spotless, classy, elegant, comfortable and just well... perfect. 
All the staff were very friendly kind and helpful and not (as some hotels in London) 'condescending & superior'.
It was my birthday and the little extras they laid on .... were such a nice touch I really appreciated it.  
Stay here.... you will most definitely NOT regret it.",5,2021,06,15
106,Ladies Celebration Lunch,"We had a lovely lunch celebrating three of us reaching milestone birthdays. Hotel is stunning and the Winter Garden beautiful. We had the Set Menu.  Excellent food choices, tasty fresh food and a lovely refreshing glass of Prosecco. Service was excellent, discreet and friendly. We had a super afternoon and highly recommend.",5,2021,06,12
106,Great Half Term Break ,"We stayed at the Land mark hotel for 4 nights over the May Half Term . The Hotel was immaculate with Covid restrictions on place which made us feel very safe . We booked a family room which had ample space for my 2 children to move around and play . There was a tent and torch in the room which was lovely for the kids to play with . 

Breakfast was nice and fresh however I would have really wished there was more of a variety . There was literally the same options every single day. Iv stayed at many 5* hotels and never actually got bored of breakfast which I felt I did here . 
Also breakfast time always felt a little chaotic in terms of service , though I could see staff were trying their best and were always very friendly. 

If you want to use the pool or jacuzzi or even the gym facilities ensure to book that in advance . I would suggest to do this soon as you have booked your hotel as the spaces get filled up really fast . We were only able to use to the pool once . 

Great location - easy to get around places with the tube station directly outside the hotel . Regent’s Park is also walking distance as was madam Tussaud’s.

We found halal food options easily available around the hotel if not there’s always Uber eats if you are too tired to venture out. ",4,2021,06,09
106,Not the 5 * experience we had expected!,"I am sad to be writing this review because I was so looking forward to our trip to the Landmark & wanted to gush over how amazing it had been however, it just missed the mark for several reasons.

I will however, start with the good…

COVID protocols were in place 

Our suite itself was beautiful, tasteful, stylish & classic;
we stayed in The Marleybone Suite, impeccably clean.

Slept well, room was feather free as requested 

Food & beverage facilities & staff excellent; we ate in Wintergarden for dinner and went to the mirror bar for a drink. We had in room breakfast which was included on our room rate & was frankly the best in room breakfast in terms of the food & accuracy of the order.

We used the jacuzzi & sauna in the spa this facility was also excellent 

Now for the reasons I am not giving this luxury 5 star hotel 5/5 on this platform:

The week before we arrived I contacted the hotel to book a table for dinner & use of spa facilities, thank goodness I did and didn’t wait for their email that arrived 2 days before availability was incredibly limited for both these things, being advised to book in advance would have been beneficial if we had have tried when we got there or two days before when the hotel emailed we would have been scuppered.

I had advised the hotel we would be arriving at between 12-1 check in as at 3pm, our car pulled up at the back of the hotel & we tried to enter (note no door man present) a member of staff stopped us from going in & abruptly told us we had to walk round to enter, which is fair enough but at least greet us and explain, perhaps offer to take our luggage so first impressions were not good. We then walked to the entrance (no doormen here either) an employee came out proceeded to talk to my partner about the reservation & ignore me (Note to hotel women make reservations too!) he took our temperature and told us to go in didn’t even offer to get the door. Went to reception, not much of a greeting or welcome there either (no thanks for your loyalty either I am a member of the Leaders Club) I was told the room wasn’t ready they would call me when it was I had been put on the ‘priority list’ for check in. Our luggage was taken somewhere between the two interactions & I was told it would be put in the room as soon as it was ready.

We then popped out for a walk whilst we waited for the call to say the room was ready we got back to the hotel by 3pm (official check in time) no phone call materialised by this point loads of people were checking in, so we rejoined the queue spoke to someone else on reception circa 3.10pm she said the room still wasn’t ready tried fo phone housekeeping apparently couldn’t reach them so sent us to the Wintergarden for a complimentary tea and assured me she would personally collect us when it was ready.

At 3.45pm I got a notification on my phone that the room was ready, I went back to reception where I queued AGAIN with everyone else checking in to get the room keys finally, at this point I requested late checkout because I can ask for that as part of the leaders club  & they were late at checking us in- I was  then told that was fine but what time until  it was like they didn’t really want to & I was an inconvenience, then I got a sarcastic thank you for your loyalty.

Finally got to the room to find two things:
1. No luggage 
2. My room rate included champagne on arrival & that was nowhere to be seen 

So then I rang reception to get a half hearted apology a further 15 mins later our luggage arrived and then finally after 30 mins our champagne arrived except it was 2 bottles so at which point we thought that’s a nice gesture from the hotel another bottle because of all the problems. Or so we thought an hour later a card arrives at the room separately which is from a friend- turns out one of the bottles of champagne was from her not that we would have known if we hadn’t have received the card!

The room also only had paper cups there were no mugs or cups for tea and coffee; which I had to phone to get and was told it’s because of Covid well in which case why were the tv remotes not in plastic wrap to be Covid safe?!

Whilst the bathroom was impressive in terms of size there were a couple of let downs here too (sigh!)
1. The toiletries are advertised as Molton Brown but we got white company 
2. When we went to use the bath the plug was broken, so couldn’t use it we only discovered this the day of checkout because why would you the guest check that!

When we checked out I explained all the issues and was given a generic apology and a partial blame Covid excuse & then was given a business card in case we come back to arrange our stay via the person who checked us out.

I am sorry to say we won’t be going back anytime soon, we stayed at another 5* hotel this weekend & had a far superior experience to the Landmark.

So disappointing, this is not the standard we have experienced at other Leading Hotels of the World Properties we have stayed in or any other 5* for that matter!",3,2021,06,06
106,Perfect stay,"Stated for 2 nights and had an absolutely fabulous stay. Staff are very professional and attentive, breakfast is delicious and the rooms are to a high standard. Had a last minute spa treatment which was one of the best treatments I’ve ever had. 

The kids had a great time and we are all looking forward to a return trip!",5,2021,06,06
106,One of the best stays in London!,"On arrival we were greeted by the fun and cheery Mr Rupert. He immediately welcomed our five year old and made the whole experience especially for her. She was giggly and laughing and couldn’t have asked for a better welcome. 

We were given our room and headed up ourselves I’m
Assuming because of covid things have changed on this side massively. Our room was throughly cleaned and very airy. 
At breakfast two people stood out for us massively and it was Maria and Jolita. Both woman very fast on their feet and so happy and accommodating. They spent extra time allowing my daughter to choose what she wanted and spoke and spent time with her despite them being even busier with covid restrictions. 

A massive shoutout to all the staff at the amazing Landmark Hotel. The manager she was so kind and accommodating to my daughter.",5,2021,06,05
106,there is a reason why we come back,"As always a lovely treat after working through the pandemic. As a Nurse who came out of retirement to work on the wards again, we were looking for a post Covid treat which she so deserved and the Landmark did not let us down. Service was as always excellent, rooms spacious and comfortable and the food was excellent. Saving for our next treat!",5,2021,06,05
106,Amazing wedding night,"We spent our wedding night at the Landmark recently.  What an amazing experience in beautiful surroundings.

Although we got to the hotel late at night, Arnaud in reception could not have been more helpful. 

The room was beautiful, which the staff decorated with rose petals, cake and towel swans on the bed. 

We have already reserved a room for our first anniversary. 

Thank you everyone at the Landmark for making our evening extra special.  ",5,2021,06,05
106,Anniversary stay,"Love this hotel and it was a treat to stay two nights this time which really made a difference to the break: much more relaxing.
Our room was superb, everything one would expect and the bottle of champagne (unexpected) awaiting us was perfect. Thank you.
Breakfast is good, bento boxes are great. Dinner was excellent and a small error was well handled by staff. 
All team members we met are professional and friendly. Particular mention to Helmi in the restaurant who remembered us from a previous stay. Good memory!
Look forward to a return trip.. Hopefully NO more lockdowns.",5,2021,06,02
106,Lovely hotel- perfect distance for London zoo,"Beautiful hotel, impeccable service and the family studio rooms were to a 5 star standard. It was also priced reasonably so we will definitely return.

We spent the evening drinking cocktails in the restaurants area followed by a very good dinner which was enjoyed by everyone. 

Breakfast was great but not quite sure adults were included in the bed and breakfast rate and children were charged at £15 each especially when our 2 will pick at a few waffles or pancakes with a glass of juice.

The hotel is only a mile away from London zoo where we went in the day so a great hotel to relax in following a full day of walking.",5,2021,05,31
106,Best hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"Thank you Landmark for the impeccable customer service. I love the architecture and al the details of this hotel. But most of all I am amazed at the customer service. Special thanks to Richard who has helped take my worries away when I needed my 2nd room as an early check in. Also many thanks to Maria, Alexandra and Eufelia for being very attentive and friendly.  Definitely will keep going back to this hotel. I can’t fault it. I love Landmark London.",5,2021,05,30
106,Perfect work and after work spot,"The landmark is fantastic for many reasons, the staff in the Winter Garden are so friendly and helpful, they helped me find a quiet spot with plug sockets so I was able to charge my Mac and make some calls.
They gave service with a smile and also have an EXCELLENT cocktail menu! Beautiful surrounding and great environment 10/10",5,2021,05,27
106,What a wonderful experience,"We’ve been there with family, for a quiet breakfast, the day was quite busy, but despite everything we had a wonderful experience, MARIA was wonderful, despite all our requests she was able to meet us and satisfy our every desire. I was delighted with the venue, and the food is very good, albeit a bit late. Thanks MARIA for your smile and your competence, you have certainly brightened our day. Highly recommended.",5,2021,05,25
106,Weekend celebration,"Stayed here last-minute family celebration for the weekend. From the moment when we enter the building, it's just got great.

We had a table reserved at the Winter Garden on Saturday evening. It was 6 of us. The ambience great, the pianist superb, and the staff who worked there just can't praise them enough. Noting was too much trouble to them.  The whole service was top notch and done with such finesse.
The next day we had breakfast in the restaurant- looks like we come down on peak time, nevertheless again everyone was so positive and nothing was too much for them. 

Working myself in the customer-focused industry I know how important is to make flawless service during a busy time- and you have nailed it.  !!!",5,2021,05,23
106,Beautiful Hotel,"This is my favourite hotel in London. It’s just gorgeous and the service is fab. I stayed with my daughter and grandchildren last November and the family rooms are very big and they even put a little pop-up tent in the room for the children, they loved it.

It’s without a doubt a 5 star+ hotel but not snobby and were very welcoming to the children, some hotels aren’t .

Whatever you’re staying in London for business, pleasure family or friends this hotel caters for everyone, I
would highly recommend.",5,2021,05,23
106,First class service ,"I have stayed in a lot of nice hotels, all over The world due to the nature of my work. The service at the Landmark Hotel is absolutely first class, and is right up there in my top three hotels. It is Customer Service that makes the biggest difference in personalising an experience and making a hotel really stand out and there is nothing they won’t do at The Landmark to make your stay as enjoyable and as stress free as possible. I would particularly like to mention Richard on the Concierge desk, who was a real Ambassador in this respect. Thank you, Richard. ",5,2021,05,19
106,Fanstastic hotel for young families,"We stayed here at the end of September during COVID.  We were a bit hesitant but once there we realised the level of hygiene and precautions meant we felt very safe.

The winter garden is spectacular and on arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was fantastic.
We went for the package with the tent and teddy bears in the room which my 2 boys (4 & 7) loved.

The only miss was that I called beforehand to ask if halal beef was available and I was told by the kitchen it was.  However when we sat in the restaurant to eat it turns out you have to order 7 days in advance.  
However I've still given it 5 stars as both dinner and the breakfasts were fanstastic.",5,2021,03,13
106,Boujee but beautiful ,We went as a group of 6 for dinner and drinks and everything was spectacular. The decor transported us to a tropical island and the music was so elegant. The three course meal and a Prosecco for £50 was definitley worth the money and I will definitley be returning here. Thank you ,5,2021,03,11
106,Excellent family night away at The Landmark,"Beautiful hotel and excellent service from the reception team, room service and the welcoming porters.

There was a gorgeous xmas tree and decorations in the atrium where we got some lovely family pictures.

The family room was brilliant, so much room the kids loved it. There was also a play tent and head torches that kept the kids entertained along with the large tv :)

Extra things we requested were brought straight away which shows great service, not like other hotels where you request an extra pillow and 45 minutes later its there, at The Landmark our requests were dealt with in under 5 minutes!

Wonderful breakfast and dinner brought to our room in a heater trolley, again these little touches make the difference, food was great and kids portions huge!

My only downside on the room was the beds, in such a large room they could easily have been king size, but still very comfy!

Excellent stay, looking to stay again for the wife's birthday in February if Covid allows!!",5,2020,12,29
106,Ross,"I cannot praise the culinary staff enough for the amazing afternoon tea experienced last week, they went above and beyond to serve my daughter who has a gluten, dairy and nut allergy and myself a fish allergy. The tea was delicious and looked and tasted similar to the normal tea served. I once asked The Goring of this and they felt it was too complicated so very impressed that this was overcome so easily and professionally, very talented kitchen. Overall the staff were excellent and gracious",5,2020,12,16
106,"Beautiful, joy-filled, memorable day","My husband and I came here for afternoon tea to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were given a very special day, with exceptional service and attention to detail. Special thanks to Helmi who was warm and friendly, attentive yet not overbearing. Great choice of champagne and selection of teas. We enjoyed the Christmassy flavours of the scones, jams, pastries and cakes. The pianist played a delightful and wide selection of music. Decorations were tastefully festive. All in all, a beautiful, joy-filled, memorable day.",5,2020,12,14
106,Such a lovely treat!!,"My partner and I were celebrating 13 years together so booked here as a treat quite last minute (due to Covid) and it was such a lovely stay! The hotel was absolutely beautiful in every corner, the Christmas decorations were stunning and the service all around was excellent. We received a lovely plate congratulating us in our room which was lovely also! Lovely pool/jacuzzi too. Breakfast was 100%! Will definitely be recommending this place. ",5,2020,12,08
106,They go above and beyond .. absolutely amazing,"Stayed here before and decided to come back , the Marylebone studio is so big and such a lovely size If your staying with family , the cleanliness is top notch I can normally find at least one negative but not here it’s perfect  .. the staff can’t do enough for you , the breakfast was divine . When we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed by a play tent with stockings for the children which was brilliant , it was my birthday also and I was welcomed with champagne and a personalised cake Thankyou , so thoughtful . It’s the little things with this hotel that make the whole experience so enjoyable . Thanks again we will be back .",5,2020,12,07
106,Perfect birthday break,I celebrated my 30th birthday at the Landmark. We were given a complimentary upgrade from an executive room to the Marylebone Studio which was absolutely huge! It had a separate lounge area and fabulous views over the winter garden. There was even a cake which was a wonderful surprise. Both the room and hotel was beautiful and the staff were friendly and welcoming. The location was also really handy for wandering around Marylebone and Oxford street was only a short taxi ride away. It really was a special stay and I would definitely stay here again.,5,2020,11,11
106,Sub standard,"We experienced a hugely disappointing stay at the Landmark. The family room was dirty, drab, shabby, and smelling of stale smoke. The furniture was sparse which was a blessing giving it appears they found it in the basement the night before. We requested bedside tables but nothing materialised. We swept up a pile of rubbish from underneath a table. It felt more like we were staying in a room above a pub. But for £500 a night this was completely unacceptable. On check out we were not asked if we enjoyed our stay. Bitterly disappointed we spent so much money for a much needed holiday at the Landmark  - the state of the room put a cloud over the whole trip.",1,2020,11,07
106,Perfect 1st Wedding Anniversary Stay,"First of all a massive thank you to all of the staff who were extremely accommodating. Also a special thank you to Roberta for the additional touches. 

From the moment my wife and I arrived we were mesmerised by the aesthetics. It really is a beautiful establishment, reception greeted us warmly and the whole check-in process was smooth. The room was something out of a designer's dream - luxurious from top to bottom. The general manager kindly left us a warm anniversary message, concierges were diligent and room service was swift. 

During our stay we used the pool/jacuzzi facilities which were very relaxing and set the tone for the rest of the weekend. The breakfast selection was decently varied and the waiting staff explained everything very clearly. On the day of our anniversary the hotel kindly allowed our photographer to take our pictures around the interior. Check-out was just as smooth as the check-in process and they allowed us to store our bags so we could continue exploring the city.

We loved every moment. Hopefully we'll be back next year",5,2020,11,04
106,Fabulous!,"A beautiful hotel steeped in history with a peaceful atmosphere. It smells amazing! The The staff are absolutely amazing, helpful and kind. Even with the restrictions in place staff are attentive and on hand 24/7.

The doormen are a credit to the hotel, they greet you will kindness and are always on hand with luggage help  and have great conversations. Rupert and Vlad thank you both.

Our rooms were amazing, clean and the boys loved the tent- what a wonderful touch. 

Thank you so much for a beautiful breakfast and the staff at this time of the day are so kind. 

Overall you made our stay special and we will definitely return! Thank you xx",5,2020,10,28
106,60th Birthday Treat,"Dependant on our fortunes we have visited the Landmark since we used it as our base for our Civil Partnership in 2008....and though we would not have thought it the hotel and staff surpassed itself. 4 days of a beautiful suite, kind and thoughtfull attention to detail, excellent customer service and adherence to Covid 19 practices which restrict some things but never compromise safety or experience. Thankyou for making this 60 year old a Princess for my special birthday",5,2020,10,28
106,Thank you x,"We stayed recently at this amazing hotel at the weekend and the experience was truly marvellous I have to say we were made to feel so special and safe. The hotel was so clean, the rooms so spacious and the location was perfect. 

On departure my daughter left her charger for her Nintendo Game I assumed lost. 

I emailed the hotel and within an hour Sandor Varga called me to say he had located this and posted it out ! Now that’s true customer service. 

Thank you also to Dawn McCormack Paulina Terpinska team work that makes your hotel a true success see you all soon we hope xx",4,2020,10,27
106,Weekend visit went very well ,"We have stayed here before but not with the kids. The hotel looked after us really well. They have had to strip back a few things for Covid and introduce a one way system. The staff and services are more or less as normal. Good food, room, sky , spa. Good value for what you receive. I would recommend for a bit of luxury in London ",5,2020,10,26
106,Amazing stay at an amazing hotel!,"First stay in this amazing hotel and can’t speak highly enough about it. From the moment you walk through the door you are greeted by such lovely staff who couldn’t do enough for you! We stayed in the Marylebone suite which was just incredible so spacious and clean we could not fault it! The food and service was second to none and is what sets your hotel above the rest in London! 

I really do recommend anyone who is thinking about staying in London to stay here because you will not be dissapointed! 

We stayed during the covid 19 pandemic and felt extremely safe as all guidelines were clear and the hotel has done an amazing job at implementing the rules, whilst still giving you that great experience! 

The staff are a credit to the management and we can’t thank everyone in the hotel enough for making our stay so special we will definitely be returning! 

P.S we absolutely loved the winter garden and the palm trees it really does make you feel like you are on holiday! 

Thanks again 

Jacky and Danielle Murphy",5,2020,10,25
106,Special half-term treat,"My little girl and I had a lovely overnight stay at The Landmark for October half term. Our family room was good size and had a wonderfully large bathroom. It had a very exciting tent and headlamp for exploring and although we had to call room service to get child sized robe and slippers, they came quickly and with sincere apologies for forgetting them. Room service supper and breakfast was a special treat; the food was very good and came promptly. Robust COVID measures could be seen throughout the property; hand sanitising stations everywhere, masks on all staff (and indeed guests walking about) etc. Would thoroughly recommend for a relaxing london break. If my daughter has anything to say about it, we’ll certainly be back. ",5,2020,10,25
106,My new favourite hotel in London,"This hotel is truly special from check in to departure. It's the architecture, history, staff, ambiance. It just oozes calm and personality. It must be a special place as I rarely write such things. It ticked all my boxes and I can't wait to return! (Check out the sample menus on display plus the short history of the hotel). 
The interior is beautifully designed and co-ordinated. Lots of attention to detail. Robbie at check in was professional and friendly. Jose at breakfast was very cheery. The breakfast bento box is fabulous and a fabulous way to ensure all covid safe in these sad time. Excellent quality of food and a good mixed selection. Cooked breakfast available also of course.
Our executive room overlooking the atrium was perfect. The pre-ordered champagne already on ice plus an unexpected gift of snacks. The bed and linen so comfortable. The furnishings and furniture all excellent quality. 
The only slight negative was cardboard cups on the hospitality tray. This however seems the ""covid usual"" in hotels currently so I guess that's just the way it has to be.
Highly recommended and rated.",5,2020,10,25
106,Fantastic but expected a little more ,"We had planned a London trip to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary. Due to covid we had to change our plans slightly and turned this in to a family celebration with our children. 

We had booked the family room and upon arrival e were greeted by the friendly and welcoming staff at check-in. The concerige were extremely helpful and went out of their way to help us with our bags. 

As soon as we arrived in our rooms we were delighted by the decor and happy to see how spacious the rooms were. However we looked in the mini bar and we were surprised to see it was empty bar a few bottles of water. This was somewhat problematic as we were due to have lunch in one hour. The kids were starving and we didn't bother to pick up snacks on the way as we assumed a hotel of such a high standard will be well equipped. 

I was also disappointed with the coffee making facilities in the room. A disposable plastic coffee cup and no spoon! Again I expected more from a hotel of this standard. 

We had dinner at the winter garden restaurant which was delightful. The ambience was magnificent, the staff were polite and the food was of good quality. The staff had given our children a coloring book but they had run out of crayons so they couldn't be used. (Not a big deal but I think its wise to make sure all the crafts are available beforehand so young children are not disappointed). 

Overall this is a lovely hotel with great staff but not sure we will return again. For the price and reputation maybe my expectations were too high. 

",3,2020,10,25
106,A last minute night away ,"An oasis of luxury truly in the heart of London. It was several months since being inside looking up the atrium in The Landmark and it was great to return for the, quite literally, last minute night away. 

I made my reservation the morning of arrival through the delightful Malisa, short and easy. Couldn’t have been any better. 

A check in experience like no other, done by the delightful Myriam. Her energy created a lasting welcome throughout the stay. Her knowledge of the hotel was super. 

A welcomed dinner in the stunning atrium surrounded by the fantastic Palm Trees. You could not ask for a better atmosphere to dine in. Our table was served by Blaze and Agata, both excellent. The food was superb, we both had the seafood linguini. The Chefs certainly know how to impress. There is something for everyone on the menu. 

Desert was followed in the room and the experience is on par with dining in the Winter Garden. Mery took the order and Clive served - I have never had such great room service in any hotel across the World. 

With the trip being so last minute, the toothbrush may have been forgotten. Luckily, Elsa was so kind enough to bring one to the room. Thank you being so helpful! 

Finally, the eyes closed and the sleep was great. The room could not have been any better.

Checkout was done by Giulia - who has the warmest smile and puts you in such a great mood. It’s definitely what you need before any day ahead. 

The final farewell was completed by Gary who was the icing on the cake to complete the trip - another outstanding asset to the hotel. 

It’s so rare in London to come across a hotel with fantastic staff.  I find it’s the people in hotel which make your stay memorable. The Landmark seems to have them in all their departments. They all go out of their way for you - it’s truly a 5 red star hotel. Incredible. 

The measurements in place for COVID-19 seem to be perfect - you feel safe from the moment you walk through the door.

If you have not been yet, I could not recommend it enough! See you again The Landmark London.",5,2020,10,22
106,Birthday Celebration,"After having to cancel my birthday celebrations due to COVID restrictions my husband booked a suite at The Landmark.
What a wonderful experience! We were upgraded to a larger suite and there was a bottle of chilled champagne and small cake waiting for us.  We were able to check in early which allowed us to visit the spa.
The staff really went the extra mile to make our visit a special one.  We dined in the Winter Garden restaurant, although a slightly limited menu, the food was delicious.  The lovely staff even bought out another little cake!
All in all, I cannot recommend this hotel and its staff highly enough and will definitely be visiting again.",5,2020,10,21
106,Covid master class,"My wife and I have just returned after having spent two days at the Landmark as a birthday treat for her birthday. I have stayed at the The Landmark before so knew it was good but I had forgotten just how good. From the moment we approached the door and had our temperature taken to the friendly farewell this morning we had an amazing stay and felt safe at all times. The spa was great, the Winter Garden food and staff were excellent, they even put a cake in our room for my wife.  It is hard for hotels at present but even under these Covid conditions luxury, kindness and great service just kept coming.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,10,20
106,Recent stay,"We recently stayed at the Landmark hotel in Marylebone. The hotel was just amazing
Steeped in history and so beautiful. The atrium is incredible. I have rarely had dinner in such a spectacular setting. 
The staff were friendly, efficient and eager to make you as comfortable as possible. I think the staff can make or break your hotel stay and in this case they made it. Full marks to them.
The food there is wonderful and what you would expect from a 5* hotel. 
We stayed in the Atrium suite which had amazing views into the atrium. The room was perfect. 
The hotel was everything we had expected and more. 
Thank you to all the staff for making our birthday celebration one we wont forget",1,2020,10,20
106,Dream Wedding,"We recently stayed in the Landmark London and hosted our wedding breakfast in the Tower Suite.

We have to say the Landmark London were beyond exceptional in their professional but personal service. They remembered our names and the names of our guests who were also staying in the hotel. 

The rooms for our guests were very comfortable, well appointed and large. Our guests reported the beds being very comfortable. 

My wife and I stayed in the Landmark Suite which was exceptional in its style and elegance. Large and spacious, plenty of space for the wedding party to get dressed and pictures to be taken in. 

After the wedding, we had dinner and high tea in the Winter Garden and all the staff were attentive and more than willing to accommodate any dietary or menu changes.

I must say the doorman Rupert, was exceptional in making us feel welcome and relaxed in the hotel. He remembered our names and helped the bridal party to enter and exit the hotel comfortably. 

Overall, I could not have chosen a better place to host our wedding and our closest family. You took care of us to a level we did not expect. Thank you for everything and we can wait to stay there again.",5,2020,10,19
106,Absolutely amazing!,"Absolutely amazing and extremely clean!, spoke to an amazing a lady called Melisa who checked us in. Felt extremely safe regarding Covid as all safety measures being adhered to. When back in London this will be my 1st choice!",5,2020,10,12
106,Fantastic for families,"We had high expectations because of the price tag, and all of them were surpassed. The building and amenities are stunning, the wait staff in the restaurant are some of the best we've ever had the pleasure of being served by, the food was excellent and every need was pre-empted. It was the perfect staycation for our family of 3 (2 parents and a 2-year old). We were particularly impressed by the dining experiences - 0ur toddler's needs were catered for, the tables were well-spaced, and the staff were incredibly attentive, professional and friendly. We found the breakfast particularly impressive and would highly recommend the family room. We'll be back - thank you very much for a perfect weekend.",5,2020,10,11
106,"Beautiful hotel, helpful staff, wonderful stay.","The hotel is in a fantastic location, it's so impressive when you walk in and see the atrium, the rooms were of a really high standard and modernish, not old and stuffy and heavy. Staff all lovely. Look forward to coming again. Thank you",5,2020,10,09
106,Anniversary! ,"Best hotel in London. Come every year and it’s always exceptional. Great food in the Winter Garden of chicken and sea bass - both were excellent, amazing staff and an incredible setting. Married there 18 years ago and it’s still amazing!",5,2020,10,05
106,25th Anniversary,"We booked to stay here for our 25th wedding anniversary and chose to stay in a deluxe room. We arrived on Oct 3rd were on checking in we were upgraded to a superior room, yippe. On entering the room which was much better than we thought there was a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket and a cake on a plate which has written on it in chocolate Happy 25th Anniversary. The room was very spacious with a king size bed, dressing gowns , slippers etc etc. The bathroom had a walk in shower and a seperate bath. Overal this is by far the best hotel room weve stayed in in London and will defo be coming back in the furture. Although we only stayed one night we were very much spoilt by them because of our special day and all the staff were fantastic and nothing was to much trouble for them. Cant wait to return  ",5,2020,10,05
106,5th time lucky!,"Having visited on five occasions at various times and mainly to celebrate an occasion. This year was meant to be so special for us, two 60th Birthdays and 40th wedding anniversary. 

Tragically this was not be be due to the death of my wife’s mom, but having booked the Landmark as part of our celebrations we continued with our planned visit.

From booking to staying the Landmark was impeccable, staff go out of their way to make your stay a memorable one, and travelling allot and always using five star hotels I can confirm there is no better hotel in the world, the rooms surroundings and staff are amazing, yes it’s slightly out but central London is served by a railway and underground station or a nice flat fifteen minute walk to Oxford street through the delightful Marylebone.

Afternoon tea in the glow of the giant Christmas tree is just magical (Book 5pm to enjoy the tree to full).

Our room view could not be better, thank you to the hotel for this.

Can’t recommend this hotel high enough.
",5,2020,10,04
106,Disappointing and dull stay,"The Landmark has always been our favourite hotel in London- a short drive from our home, close to everything in central london, and a place we spent many happy family moments such as one of my children’s first christmas’s. It is also were we would sometimes stay for a night just my husband and I as a romantic night away. Which is why we came this weekend- our first hotel stay since the Covid outbreak for my birthday. So i REALLY don’t want to leave this review, but it’s just completely changed, the landmark we knew has gone. 
We pulled up with our car to be told no valet parking anyway. When this used to be standard. Very rude sullen doorman simply told us to go up the road to the NCP. Hassle we could do without in the freezing wet rain and I wish we had been told before our arrival then I would have got a cab (told properly, not in some email on page 4 of 24 in small print somewhere!) Check in was so weird- almost robotic. Asked to sign a paper, keys handed to me the guy barely looked up- again same sullen rude attitude. The place reminded me of a funeral parlour- everyone miserable and not a warm friendly greeting in sight. Bizzare, literally zero service. We went upto the room- marylebone studio that was about 25% cheaper than we would usually pay for it. It was ok- spacious for us. No water bottles in the room though, tired old looking pillows (2 out of the 4) toilet was incredibly hard to flush and the bath well k couldn’t let out the water the plug was stuck. The housekeeping who brought me extra new pillows and water was very sweet and lovely- but she was the only one who made any effort at all with us. We ordered room service, not cheap and oven chips, a sandwich my husband just couldn’t eat as he said was ‘horrible’ and the bottle of wine which was good. It didn’t make us want to eat breakfast there at all! I didn’t sleep well to be honest. The atmosphere was weird in the evening the winter garden almost empty and everything else shut and a few people milling about- just no atmosphere really. All quite doom and gloom. We have a reservation for a family booking here at christmas and seriously considering cancelling and booking somewhere else.",2,2020,09,27
106,25th Wedding Anniversary - Absolutely stunning,"We stayed at the Landmark London for 2 nights in September. It was a double celebration - our 25th wedding anniversary and my birthday.  Our suite was out of this world! Very spacious, clean, comfortable with a very luxurious bathroom. Welcome with champagne, strawberries and chocolates. We had afternoon tea and that was the best afternoon tea I have ever had. Dinner was also very delicious. We had breakfast and the bento boxes was great with a wide variety to chose from. Staff were very engaging. They were also very thoughtful; we had an anniversary cake and a birthday cake the following day which was my birthday. All this in the exquisite ambience of the winter garden. Spa facilities was great with complete compliance to covid-19 guidelines. Great choice. Would visit again.",5,2020,09,25
106,A really disappointing stay,"Our family of 4 stayed at The Landmark for 2 nights over the August Bank Holiday weekend.  Having been unable to have our planned family holiday over Easter, and staycationing over the summer holidays, this was to be our way of treating ourselves before the kids returned to school.  
We chose this hotel because of its central location, the pool and the reviews on Trip Advisor.  The location is brilliant - an easy walk to Regent's Park, a do-able walk to Selfridges, just round the corner from Madame Tussauds - a great place to be based for a London weekend.  
The mattresses were super comfy too.
Sadly, those were all the positives as far as our experience went.  Our family room was dirty (we swept up a heap of litter and detritus that had been missed by the vacuum cleaner), shabby and exhausted looking.  The furniture looked like it had been cobbled together from store rooms or car boot sales - think draylon headboards, occasional tables with dull drapes to hide the marks on top, and a play tent from ikea that a 2 year old would have loved but our 10 and 8 year olds found a bit strange.  It felt like a room that had been taken out of an attic rather than one that had been carefully put together.
We were unable to book to use the pool - disappointing for our kids but these strange times are dictating strange protocol.  We had to ask repeatedly to be given a space to have an early evening drink, having been turned away from a the Winter Garden, the only available place for guests to get one, despite 75% of the tables being vacant at that time.  I could go on and on.  With breakfast being £34 per guest we decided not to bother, and the afternoon tea's sandwiches seemed dry over the cut surfaces - we ate towards the end of the afternoon, so perhaps we received ones that had been left out or uncovered.
All in all, a thoroughly disappointing stay which fell so far short of the mark in almost every way.  I really couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2020,09,19
106,Weekend of luxury ,"A big thank you to the Landmark Hotel in London for making our weekend visit so memorable,  from entering the hotel along the drive upto the front door just feels special. Through a glorious entrance to reception  and a fast and professional checkin by Robbie . Our room was glorious and the view overlooking the winter garden is outstanding, the facilities in the room are first class and has one of the largest bathrooms I've seen for a hotel room  the sofa also gave us the chance to put up our feet in comfort whilst in the room   The evening meal was a treat and very filling as well as flavoursome,  thank you to the waiter Heimi for his attention to looking after our dietary needs . Breakfast was a treat and exceptional,  sitting in the winter garden dining area was a treat and can only assume leaves other such hotels envious of it. Special thanks to Nikki for the breakfast service , we left heartedly full, and Giulia for a friendly goodbye when we checked out. A great location close to Central London for a walk and Marylebone station at the back with its covered walkway   a great weekend n a wonderful Hotel I truly hope to experience again. ",5,2020,09,16
106,Amazing in room dining breakfast,"We stayed at the Marylebone Suite which was impeccably clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Was a wonderful getaway and perfect for destressing. To top it off, we had an amazing breakfast the next morning.  Blown away by the muffins which apparently made fresh in house.  We've been searching for amazing muffins for the past 3 years in London and have finally found it.",5,2020,09,10
106,Treat away,"We booked a night over the bank holiday weekend as a treat as we didn't get a chance to go away during covid lockdown.

Booking was efficient and price was reasonable for a 5 star Hotel in London. 

Check in was swift and the hotel lobby, entrance and Winter garden restaurant was stunning. A lovely inside out hotel made you feel as though you were in the Med! 

We were upgraded to a suite as we registered to become friends of the landmark which was huge. Plenty of room and a large comfy bed.

I had booked a spa treatment and access to the pool which you had to pre book for a 2 hour slot. This was clean and inviting. The receptionist asked if we had hats for swimming and so we had to buy them which wa costly. If we had known this before we arrived, we could have purchased cheaper swim hats. Nevertheless, we had a relaxing time.

We ordered room service which was delivered to us promptly and it was delicious.

I had also booked a massage which was quite costly and although very relaxing I wouldn't say that it was mind blowing or anything too special. You were offered some time in the relaxation area but no water was even offered after a 50 minute massage which I found unusual.

Nevertheless, a lovely stay at the hotel. Would highly recommend.",5,2020,09,03
106,Wonderful,"Myself and husband have just returned from a night at this hotel and were blown away. We stayed in the Landmark Suite which was absolutely beautiful. My husband had an amazing massage at the spa which he said was one of the best he has ever had. The breakfast was fantastic, at first I thought I would miss a buffet however the service was incredible and the amount of food was plentiful. I asked for almond milk to be brought to our room when we checked in  and it arrived within minutes! Every member of the team that we came in to contact with could not have been more helpful and amazing. We were given a later checkout which was greatly appreciated The hotel have taken great lengths to make everyone feel comfortable throughout the hotel in the current climate. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel!",5,2020,09,01
106,Winter garden,Supreme service and delicious food at the winter garden restaurant. Was very busy but staff were in flustered and courteous throughout. Tuna tartare was exceptional and all round delicious food. Thank you for a wonderful experience and much needed refuel in delightful surrounds.,5,2020,09,01
106,Fabulous service,"We were greeted by Richard who is one of the Concierges and it set the scene for our fabulous stay. We arrived earlier than the check in time and he ensured that our bags were taken up to our rooms for us.
Check in was quick and easy.
We had an Executive Room and it was spacious with a separate bath and shower.
The bed was large enough and comfortable.
My son was in a family room on the same floor and they made it so welcoming for our 3 year old grandson. I was very impressed.
Breakfast was waiter service and there was a good choice.
We used the restaurant on the first evening. The steak was good and matched the Margaux. The salmon was overcooked with very charred skin and it was overseasoned for my wife's taste. I dont understand why so much salt is needed. It only dries out the salmon. 
My wife had a manicure and pedicure with Anna. She did an excellent job.
I used the pool which has to be booked in advance because the numbers are limited.
All of the staff are a credit to the hotel, especially Richard who always gave us such a wonderful welcome.",5,2020,08,30
106,Return to this fabulous hotel,"My wife and I returned to the Landmark Hotel this weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
It reopened last week after being closed for many weeks due the pandemic.
Firstly I would like to say that the hotel have excelled in dealing with all the safety measures introduced to cope with Covid 19 and we felt extremely safe.
Temperatures are taken on arriva, there is a clear one way system around the communal areas and social distancing is well observed by staff and guests.
There are hand sanitizer stations in all locations with clear policies for the use of lifts.
The hotel was extremely clean inside the rooms, the communal areas and externally has benefited from redecoration during lockdown.
The staff were extremely helpful and those we spoke to were clearly very happy to be back at work.
Without the buffet the hotel has introduced a new breakfast menu known as a bento box which allows you to choose a unique meal which suits your own requirements and it is a memorable experience which I don't think will be repeated anywhere else.
I understand the hotel will be opening the spa shortly and hope to open other facilities as soon as they are able.
Well done to everyone and thank you for a first class stay......as always",5,2020,08,23
106,Pleasant and reassuring stay,My wife and I just stayed at the Landmark Hotel in London. It was the first time we have ventured out since Easter. The hotel paid meticulous attention to hygiene and social distancing. Highly recommend!,5,2020,08,21
106,"BEWARE - THIEVES !  Our bags - including cash,passport,PC were stolen in the Lobby in front of the hotel's incapable tea","BEWARE - THIEVES !  Our bags - including cash,passport,PC were stolen in the Lobby in front of the hotel's incapable team and poor security team. 
Even worse than that - the hotel management did not even offer ANY compensation or help except stating that ""it is not their responsibility"".    
A VERY BAD EXAMPLE of CUSTOMER SERVICE - - Find a better hotel!",1,2020,07,21
106,What a stay!!,"Beautiful hotel that really ticks all the boxes.
Delighted with our very spacious room and the service we received from check in to leaving was first class.
Would highly recommend and look forward to our next visit.",5,2020,06,01
106,Amazing family hotel,"Spent an amazing night in this hotel with my wife and kid. The guest relations team went all out providing a tent and cookies for my boy. Thank you to Gemma & Maria from the Front Desk for your help, and special thanks to James the Night Manager for his assistance.",5,2020,04,03
106,Outstanding experience,"Staying at The Landmark was an outstanding experience from start to finish. The room was magnificent, the personnel always ready to help, not to mention the incredible location next to the metro station.

I recommend The Landmark to everyone that is looking for a great stay in London!",5,2020,03,28
106,Thank you for a wonderful stay,"Fabulous hotel with a great location. The position and evaluation were very good, and the staff were very professional helpful. Every issue could be solved in a timely manner. Delicious breakfast, unfortunately we didn’t get to try the afternoon tea there. If you want to be treated like the royals, this is the place.",5,2020,03,28
106,Thanks Landmark,"It was a great pleasure to make a return visit to The Landmark for a weekend in the Capital. As ever, London was a full on experience and we always cram so much into our first day. On this occasion, rather than stay out all evening as well, we went back to the hotel at about 8 o'clock, to enjoy it's first class facilities. Breakfast to start Sunday is a delight, drawn out over an hour, a superb range off food with the usual first class service. The room was excellent and the service from most pleasant staff is second to none. The West End, a short pleasant walk away was vibrant. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2020,03,25
106,Afternoon Tea,"As a Christmas present I received an email telling me I was having afternoon tea at this amazing hotel.  We have stayed at the Landmark on several occasions, however I have always wanted afternoon tea.

I was not disappointed, it was everything I expected and more.  The staff just can not do enough for you.  Our waiter for the afternoon was Francesco, he attended to our every need, nothing was too much trouble for him.  The food was amazing and plentiful.  

If you want to give someone a gift they wont forget then I would suggest a trip for Afternoon Tea.  You mum/partner/girlfriend/sister will love it.

I will certainly be returning and next time it will be an overnight stay.  From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are made to feel special.",5,2020,03,25
106,Beloved Landmark,"Every time I come to London I absolutely love to visit The Landmark London Hotel. It doesn’t matter if it’s for a night or two or just for their famous Afternoon Tea. This year I had an amazing opportunity to spend four incredible nights at The Landmark London again. Just as we entered, we experienced a warm welcome at the reception and the same hospitality continued during the whole stay from all the staff members we’ve met. The breakfast was the best part of the day, Kamel and his team looked after us very well, remember our order preferences. This time we also visited Champagne Brunch with its amazing food, cakes, life music, Champagne and great service. I would highly recommend also the visit to their Spa, where I had a very relaxing treatment that rejuvenated me for the weeks to come. We stayed at The Landmark Suite which was spacious, elegant and very comfortable. Room service delivery was very fast and all the food was up to expected high standard. We also dined in Great Central Bar & Restaurant, which can be easily overlooked, but it’s definitely worth to visit as food is tasty, cocktails are delicious and the service is friendly with attention to details. We did not have an opportunity to visit their Mirror Bar this time, so we saved it for our next visit, which I hope will be very soon. ",5,2020,03,23
106,Nothing was too much trouble for The Landmark London — absolutely nothing.,"When it comes to choosing hotels, I like ones that are luxurious, elegant, plush, & regal -The Landmark London is all of that & more!! The Landmark London is absolutely beautifully decorated & maintained. It’s “palm tree” atrium is cozy & comfortable to dine in. 

Before our stay I’d emailed Andrew Batchelor, the manager of the Landmark, as my sister & I have both dairy & gluten allergies & I wanted some assistance in terms of what foods we could & couldn’t eat. I had no idea  how much effort & attention to detail Mr Batchelor would personally make turning my hotel stay into the best one I’ve ever had (I’ve stayed at some pretty luxurious hotels)!!! Every single staff member we came in contact with went above & beyond & beyond even that! 

My sister planned a surprise birthday afternoon High Tea & Mr Batchelor & his team (Gary Klaner, head chef, & Marcela Noble, food & beverage director) went all out to make my birthday extra special - they spoilt me rotten!!!! The entire tea was gluten free (3 different breads no less) & dairy free. Gary made the most delicious gluten free, dairy free birthday cake, & Marcela decorated our table with hearts & confetti. She also made sure anything we needed was taken care of. It was honestly one of the best birthdays I’ve had in a long time & a large part of that was due to the Landmark London.

The only downside to this whole experience was that I had to leave. I really didn’t want to, I could’ve stayed there forever, it's just that kind of hotel.",5,2020,03,15
106,"First class service, First class hotel","Booked a room for one of our clients and the service from start to finish was outstanding, as was the room offered. Special mention to Malisa Shepherd who helped at such short notice. Thank you so much and we'll definitely be booking again!",5,2020,03,12
106,The most magnificent and special stay.,"Just checked out today and I felt the need to write this review straight away because we have had such a special stay and been so looked after by the attentive staff who all have a spirit of excellence. The hotel ambiance was wonderful. Not too busy. Staff went above and beyond . Special thanks to Davide on reception . Also thanks to the hotel manager for the birthday touches in the room . The cake was delicious and we also had a complementary upgrade. The room was gorgeous, beds super comfortable, no outside noise we had such a good sleep and feel so refreshed after our stay. The hotel is stunning.
It’s also very close to oxford st , just a small walk. We also had wonderful snacks and meals in the garden terrace. We will certainly be back for another treat in the future. Thank you so so much to all the team at The Landmark Hotel.",5,2020,03,10
106,Superb spa visit,"Visited the Landmark spa for a birthday treat.  The service is fabulous and lots to do in the spa.  Well maintained and attention to detail adhered to.  A lovely place to relax - will recommend to all my friends.

Will go back for afternoon tea another day!!!!",5,2020,03,09
106,Heaven on earth ,"Luxury, relaxation, total bliss. I’m not sure I’ve ever enjoyed a hotel so much in the UK.  The room was comfortable and top class.  The service and staff were 5 star excellence.  Location a dream.  I kept feeling I was on a magical cruise ship.  ",5,2020,03,08
106,Spa treatments with Paulina,"I spent few hours at the landmark spa facilities, it’s a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the pool.... but the cherry on the cake was the massage by Paulina! She is very professional, caring and gentle ! I had a great time, I will definitely going to come back.",5,2020,03,06
106,Amazing!!,"The Landmark exceeded our expectations. 

It has been an unforgettable experience from the moment we arrived! 

Grigor took good care of our luggage, with a warm smile. Check in was smooth and quick. Being welcomed by friendly and professional staff such as Davide, Gemma, George and Gregory makes you feel really valued. They were helpful and lovely. 

Special mention to Davide, who showed the way to the room and informed about the facilities that the Hotel provides ;)
We had dinner in Great Central. 

It was stunned!!! Pauline & Kelvin looked after us in a very attentive and professional way. It was delightful!

I cannot forget breakfast, in the indoors yard. It is a ""must-do"" for everyone!!  The personal touch of Nikka, Carmen and Jose was a plus! 

Andre & Alexandros were very attentive when we went to the reception during the night, asking for recommendations.

Overall it was a simply magic visit!! Rooms are clean, large and very confi! 
We definitely are coming back!!!!",5,2020,03,06
106,A colonial style that takes you back to fair flung places,"I have stayed in the Landmark and used its garden terrace cafe. The service is fantastic, their team are very attentive and have always given me a really great service. Voted recently one of the best places to work, I have not doubt that they have a culture based on great service and providing the client with comfort. I will happily stay there when ever I can. With the added benefit of throwing you back to an older more nostalgic decor and era.",5,2020,03,06
106,"Spa and massage from
Paulina ❤️","We was together with my bf, and took 2 different massages. I took aroma relaxing massage with Paulina, and it was amazing, very good conversation!) and nice atmosphere! Thx a lot! Will be back to her again!)",5,2020,03,05
106,Deep Tissue Massage at the Spa at The Landmark London,"I wouldn't say I am a difficult person to please when it comes to massages... but maybe it is hard for me to get surprised by a massage since I often try many. However, I was definitely surprised by this one! I tried the deep tissue massage, which was performed by Nina - she did a great job... I loved it. My neck and body felt completely relieved and completely made a difference with all my muscle tension! Totally recommend it.",5,2020,03,05
106,Fabulous doorman,My daughter and I having been staying at he The Landmark for many years.... Eustace Mc Clean the doorman at the hotel is always so friendly and more than helpful... we always look forward to seeing his welcoming smile ... Thank you Eustace!!,5,2020,03,04
106,Wonderful place to stay,"Sometimes you want something more than just somewhere to sleep overnight, The Landmark is a perfect treat for London visits when you want something a little bit better. Attentive staff, lovely decor and well appointed bedrooms. Alas, we were unable to use the spa as all space was fully booked several days before our arrival  so plan further ahead if you want treatments during your stay. The Mirror Bar and Winter Garden Restaurant both have something imaginative  to offer and in my opinion offer exceptional value. With Marylebone station behind the hotel and Baker Street underground less than 5 minutes walk away it is a good base. If i had the budget, this would be my go to hotel for London - alas not so its back to hunting down special rates at Hilton!",5,2020,03,04
106,My new favourite hotel!,I have finally found my go to hotel in London!! I stayed in the Landmark with a friend for the first time this February and it honestly exceeded our expectations. It was so refreshing to be in a luxurious hotel where the staff were so be friending and helpful at every turn. The front desk had such lovely smiles all round to greet us. Credit goes to Gregory for adding a touch of specialty in our room (lovely choc strawberries) and making my friend and I feel very special! The room was spotless with an amazing high ceiling (perfect for those insta shots lol) and the bed felt like a cloud to sleep in! We ate dinner in the winter garden restaurant and wowww the food was delictable! Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to spend in the spa however we did get to have a peak of it. A lovely lady named Hida gave us a tour of their amazing spa facilities so we definitely have an excuse to come back for more as her description of the massages were so enticing to say the least! It's safe to say we will definitely be staying here again and cannot wait 😍 Thank you Landmark for making our weekend away a perfect one!,5,2020,03,03
106,Great !,"Dear Landmark Team,

I stayed in your beautiful place for 2 nights and it was perfect! The room was great, the spa was incredible and thanks to all personel who made our stay even better. The metro is right outside the door so you have a good connection to move around London. 

A special thanks to Arnaud and George who made our check in and check out so easy and made us feel welcome straight away. 

Greetings,
Pieter",5,2020,03,03
106,Impeccable Customer Service,"Beautiful Hotel , what struck me was the superb interaction with the staff who were charming, friendly and extremely professional. Julia on reception checked me in and told me I had been upgraded, so a great start and a fabulous welcome

Loved the room, being a mad sports fan happy to see TV had Sky and BT sports , so good to catch up before dining.

Breakfast in the morning was served by really friendly staff , nothing was too much trouble in meeting my requests .There was plenty of choice from a well stocked buffet
Great stay, mattress was a little firm for my personal taste but I did sleep well",4,2020,03,02
106,Great stay as always!,"It was our 4th stay in this beautiful hotel. The hotel keeps a high level of standards and with each visit we look forward to have our ""re-energizing time in this calm oasis"" and we have not been disappointed yet. We spent 4 nights at The Landmark Suite which was simply stunning. It’s large, comfortable, clean and beautiful. All the staff that we’ve met were professional, helpful and very polite and friendly. Our favourite part of the stay is usually breakfast time in The Winter Garden, but this time we’ve also experienced ""the famous Champagne Brunch"". It has a great atmosphere (piano player and singer), perfect food and of course never empty Champagne glass. It’s really good they also have gym, spa and swimming pool to burn those calories afterwards :).
 
Simply said: We enjoyed our stay very much and I would definitely recommend the Landmark hotel and can’t wait to be back.",5,2020,03,02
106,THE LANDMARK EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS,"I have previously used The Landmark Hotel and decided to celebrate my birthday this year with an afternoon tea for friends & family…our party consisted of 18 people and the Hotel gave us two long tables at the side of The Winter Garden restaurant , it was almost like having our own private room but with all the views and atmosphere of the restaurant as well, From the moment I arrived, I was welcomed by Andrei (the manager) who wanted to make sure that everything was in order before our  guests arrived. All the food and the most amazing selection of teas were served without delay and were absolutely delicious. There was a continuous supply of perfectly prepared sandwiches, the scones & pastries were superb and baked to an exceptionally high standard, the whole afternoon was an absolute delight with all my guests telling me how much they enjoyed their experience at The Landmark. The level of service, the food & the surroundings could not have been better. 

I found the whole experience of dealing with The Landmark to be exemplary & faultless, from the moment I made my initial enquiry with Agnieszka & Lyuba, I was impressed by their kindness & efficiency, all of my queries & concerns were met with the utmost politeness and professionalism, it was very noticeable that all my calls were answered within 10-15 seconds.

Thank you Landmark Hotel for going the ""extra several miles"" and making my celebration so memorable.",5,2020,03,01
106,Facial Delight,"After doing a lot of research about best facials in London, The Landmark Spa was an obvious choice for me. The walk from entrance of hotel opposite Marylebone Station to the Spa was not what I expected. The hotel looking very tired but the staff was friendly and I felt welcomed. That’s besides the point as I was there to have my first facial after three years!! Do not judge me..😊
I was greeted by lovely Alyssa who spoke to me on the phone earlier. She showed me the changing room and I was ready to be pampered. Paulina, my facial therapist was the star of the show, apart from the amazing products they use! The second I laid on the heated treatment bed, I knew I was making the right choice. Not only the facial was relaxing but she also massaged my scalp which was invigorating. I basically slept throughout the treatment and 80 minutes went really fast. My face felt really clean after being massaged with layers of Vitamin C scrub, toner, mask and lotion. I have to admit it, I had a divine pampering time yesterday and definitely will be back for more.",5,2020,02,26
106,Treated like royalty,I was lucky enough to win a nights stay at this beautiful hotel and it was absolutely amazing . Everything and everyone was charming . From the friendly doorman to the staff on reception - the waiters and the maids who kept the room spotless . The decor was lavish and spotlessly clean . Even the lifts were quick and exquisite inside. The swimming pool and spa was tranquil . The breakfast was spectacular and I have never had as much choice. We ate in the Winter Gardens and I felt like I was in a different world. It was an experience I will never ever forget and I would like to thank each and everyone of the staff .,5,2020,02,25
106,A beautiful hotel!,"We had a lovely weekend in London and would certainly recommend the Landmark as a great place to stay. From check in to check out we had a fantastic time.

Travelling to and from the hotel is very easy as it is situated right next to Marylebone station (however we didn't hear a single train). 

The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the Winter Gardens restaurant which I would say is a must. We had breakfast there which was excellent and the afternoon teas looked great too.

The bedrooms are well appointed and everything has an air of luxury that reminds you that you are in a 5 star establishment. All together a great weekend was had!",5,2020,02,24
106,A fantastic hotel with amazing staff,"My wife and I were in London to see family and The Landmark Hotel was the perfect base. We received a very warm welcome and found that this was what we were to expect throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was delivered with a smile.

We were very glad that we decided to have breakfast in the Winter Garden restaurant as the food and service was second to none, the espresso alone is enough to go back for. Unfortunately I couldn't try everything on offer so will have to book another trip! 

Thanks to all the staff at The Landmark for making us feel so very welcome. We hope to see you again soon.",5,2020,02,24
106,Never fails to impress,"When ever we are staying in London the Landmark Hotel always our choice. It’s a real treat for us to return to such a lovely place. Over the years we have always found the experience most enjoyable. 

The warm welcome at checkin is matched by the friendly staff who genuinely remember us and even, as we found out on this visit, missed us when we didn’t visit at our regular time of year. This sounds as if we are there often. In truth we tend to spend a couple of weekends a year around Christmas time. 

As always our room was spotless and serviced twice a day. The breakfast is hard to beat, offering such a wide choice of well cooked food. Although not inexpensive the quality and service makes it well worth the price",5,2020,02,23
106,Fantastic Hotel. ,"I stayed here with my 7 year old daughter as my husband had to work in London. So the hotel was provided for us. 

The staff were absolutely lovely and helpful at check in and we were made to feel very welcome by all staff, waiting staff, door staff, and maids. 

We were offered a cute little play tent in our room for my daughter. Which they provided a cute little colouring set for her as well, as well as pillows and a light. My daughter said she felt very special. 

Our room was absolutely stunning. Beautiful bathroom. All just so lovely and luxurious. 

We didn’t eat here. But the restaurants looked beautiful. 

I would love to stay here again. Five Star Luxury is such a rare treat. ",5,2020,02,21
106,Brilliant brunch and stay.,"Surprise bottomless brunch and overnight. Loved every minute, the food at brunch was so good, plentiful, with such a good variety, and they didn't skimp on the champagne. The room was  so clean and well appointed. The cocktail bar was really something, I'm a big fan of cocktails, and it didn't disappoint.  Breakfast was also great (the scotch eggs!). I'll definitely be back.",5,2020,02,20
106,A little disappointing for a 5 star,"We’ve stayed at the Landmark many times, things just seem to be sliding the wrong way! This may seem harsh but this is supposed to be a 5star hotel that you pay a premium for. As the bag man said to my mum who was trying to see if you had to put your key card in to switch the lights on ‘this is not that kind of hotel’ . It certainly isn’t - I booked a family escape, which should have included a tent, cookies etc. Nothing at all in our room. I had to go down and ask for the tent and didn’t have the energy to go back and ask for the cookies etc. They genuinely seemed surprised that this should have been there! So don’t bother booking a family escapes room, you’ll get nothing extra. In that kind of hotel you’re not let down. 
I did get a hand delivered signed card from the manager welcoming me back, I would rather he had checked the room to make sure it was as it should have been. 
With friends of the landmark you should be eligible for a room upgrade, we didn’t get one, even though there were rooms available. They did send an email to see if we wanted to upgrade before we got there. It reminded me of a certain chain hotel who auction upgrades. Shame for my daughter as this break was a big treat for her. 
On to the positives, most of the staff were helpful, especially in the spa and restaurant. We did have to send some poached eggs back - they were stone cold. But the lady apologised and replaced them. The room was very clean and turn down etc good. We rang for a DVD player, which was promptly delivered. Pool was good and clean. 
All in all you can tell it’s changed hands/management. I’m not sure if we’ll be back. Based on this visit it may be time to search for a true 5 star experience....#Four Seasons in Moscow - Wow what service...If only it was closer.",3,2020,02,20
106,Always a treat,"I attended a champagne brunch here recently and I cannot fault a single thing. Everything from the food, the service, the champagne was perfect. We didn’t even realise it was so stormy outside because we were in a cocoon or peace and perfection.

When I told front desk it was my sons 21st and my 50th I had hoped for something a little more than congratulations! I was charged for service at a bar for drinks. Bit presumptuous. Hair dryer didn’t work so asked for another which was delivered but that didn’t work either. It was the socket not the dryer. Mattress was very hard, pillows too soft and the room was airless. I requested Earl Grey tea bags and did not receive any. I informed front desk of all of these issues and nothing was resolved. Such a shame for a lovely hotel. Looks 5star but the workings inside were definitely not.

This was the response from Guest Relations Team on 11 Jan 2020
Dear guest, Thank you for taking the time and reviewing your recent stay with us here at The Landmark London. I would also like to offer you my sincere apologies for the inconveniences caused please rest assured that I have passed on your comments already to our Managers. We hope to welcome you back again soon! Warm regards, Guest Relations Team

106,An absolute pleasure.,"Sunday afternoon tea at The Landmark Hotel, described - “Would you like an adventure now, or shall we have our tea first?” - PETER PAN and it certainly was quite special.

Visited friends staying at the hotel for afternoon tea, the staff and service was quite exceptional, quality of the food superb and setting so nice.

Really had an enjoyable afternoon tea, the hotel is just wonderful, will definitely stay there myself in the future",5,2020,02,17
106,5 star hotel slowly slipping.,"Fantastic location and an amazing old hotel. 

The staff are hit and miss. Young Adam in the reception is awesome, the staff from Eastern Europe are a bit grumpy. 

Food is great, still a bit lesser than you would expect looking at the price. Eggs Benedict in the morning is a sure bet. 

Everything is clean and nice and many rooms are getting a needed makeover at the moment. 

Great beds in the suites.",4,2020,02,16
106,"The Landmark
Hotel in London !!",Love the food as there is a large variety! The food was amazing and the music was lovely ! Would definitely recommend ! The staff are so friendly ! Great atmosphere !!! 😊😉🙂😁 it’s worth the money 💴..,5,2020,02,15
106,A luxurious experience!!,"I stayed in the Landmark hotel this month and I had heard such great things about their gem spa on the basement level. I decided to try a back neck scalp massage and wowww... My therapist nina was truly incredible and I felt so relaxed afterwards. My one regret is that I got a 50minute treatment.. I highly recommend 80 minutes or more because you honestly won't want it to end!! The spa reception were so friendly and welcoming. Silvia, Lucy and Sandra very kindly greeted me on my arrival and accommodated me with robes and slippers immediately. I want to thank them as I came by myself but they all made me feel very welcome and not out of place coming alone. I will 100% be back to enjoy their picturesque spa facilities again and definitely book a longer treatment next time!! Thank you Landmark!!! I can't wait for my next visit :D",5,2020,02,15
106,Excellent afternoon tea,"Me and my husband had an excellent afternoon tea here👌☺️ Atmosphere here is very calm and relaxing 👌 Food was good and cake with passion fruit and coconut was the best😋 Will definitely come back❤❤❤ 
P.S. Also received a rose on the Valentine's day☺️ That was super cute😍 Thank you☺️",5,2020,02,14
106,Beautiful Champagne Afternoon Tea,"This was a beautiful experience, the setting, the service, the food were all perfect. Excellent for a special occasion. Totally enjoyed it and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for something just a little extra special 🍾🥂 ",5,2020,02,12
106,"Very elegant, well-maintained and very quiet.","Had a delightful stay.  My room was a top floor room well away from the lifts.  Accordingly, it was very quiet.  It also was spacious, bright and very pleasant.  Hotel service and location also were terrific.",5,2020,02,12
106,A great value,"I have had the pleasure of staying at The Landmark several times, both on business and privately with my family. It 's always been a pleasant stay,  enriched by so much professionalism and attention from all the staff! 
To be recommended!
If I have to find points of improvement but look for them with a magnifying glass I would say:
- it is not possible to pay with the new technological means (contactless by phone or similar).
- the hours of the swimming pool for children are not practical as they provide for afternoon hours during the week when you are actually discovering the city with your children.",5,2020,02,12
106,Stunning,"Absolutely loved my last visit to The Landmark! I have been in many 5 star properties over the years, but the service provided here is absolutely outstanding. Special thanks to Tamara, Mateo and Andre for their special welcome. I am looking forward to my next visit!",5,2020,02,11
106,A great value for money homely living place in London Central ...,"A great hotel for the family after more than 20 years away from the good old London , England.... Convenient, super friendly, great services and easy-to-get-to almost anywhere in one of the best and oldest magnificent cities in the world. Loved the classy looks of the setup with lots of friendly smiles and staff all round in particular to our family friend Ms Kelly Wu who truly did recommend a lovely and homely place for all 4 of us for a great start of our Travel-the-UK journey which covered over 2,000km from South to North of GB. 
Great weathers too ... surprisingly for the 6-day run ... will surely return!",5,2020,02,10
106,London’s MAIN ATTRACTION is right here at their HIGH TEA!! ,"My daughter and I LOVE coming here for afternoon high tea after business meetings. Please read on as this could be something special for you if you’re here visiting. 

Sure, it’s always great to come to London to see the attractions like Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street and so on BUT, there is something that’s a hidden gem! The Landmark Hotel offers astonishing, luxury, fabulous and Astonishing High Tea! 

You’ll need to call and reserve because the weekends are always fully booked. 

First, you’ll notice the staff are quite astonishing. Each and everyone of them. They are under the management of Achmed who is one of the nicest gentlemen you will EVER encounter. If you are fortunate enough to meet him, you’ll understand why the team are all remarkable. They are class, efficient, kind and professional. They are on the ball. 

The setting is pure elegance! Pure elegance. Did I mention that? You’ll need your camera! Sometimes they have someone playing the grand piano on the level looking over the high tea area and sometimes the have a harpist play at the front entrance of the high tea area. PURE ELEGANCE to the eyes and ears. 

The high tea is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Best tea. Served in the best classiest way. Fabulous selection of sandwiches. Fantastic scones and 2 jams. Incredible selection of cakes and deserts. It is an EXPERIENCE you’ll cherish!! 

My daughter and I travel to London 4 times a year. We go right to the Landmark to start our visit and we go back before we head home. The “attractions” in London STARTS and ENDS with the Landmark High Tea for us. Thanks to the way we were treated from our very fist visit by Achmed and his team, through every visit since, our loyalty to this “attraction” is in stone. 

I KNOW you’ll be visiting all the normal places that London has to offer. BUT, if you’d like something REMARKABLE, something you’ll NEVER forget and something that will make your journey to London PERFECT, try the Landmarks High Tea. I’ve tried the high teas from Dubai to Tokyo. From Sydney to LA and NOTHING comes even remotely close the Achmed team at the Landmark Hotel.

106,Luxury night away,"Booked high tea & overnight stay with a friend, already planning our next visit. Arrived early & whilst we were lucky enough to have the room available, our luggage was sent straight up as we had a prior engagement. Both on the doors at arrival and reception, staff were super friendly. Returned a few hours later to check in to our lovely room on the 6th floor overlooking the indoor garden where we would soon be having high tea. High tea itself was a relaxed affair with beautifully presented food and teas, even the offer of more sandwiches should you wish for any. Very much worth the money. A drink in the Mirror Bar is worth a try, some very well presented cocktails, the Mai Tai is lovely. Very comfortable nights sleep in a lovely big bed, followed by a wash & blow dry at the resident hair salon the next morning, left feeling a million dollars! Thank you for a wonderful stay Landmark, see you soon!",5,2020,02,09
106,Spa + treatment day,Amazing treatments the body scrub was fantastic I ended up purchasing it. Full body massage was relaxing and relived all stress. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Spa facilities were good and it was quite empty around the evening which is a bonus.,5,2020,02,09
106,A great place to stay,"Our rooms are huge!! We love the tub and shower there. Everything is nice, clean and classy. Great service, courteous staffs. Very high-class experience at a very reasonable price. And the location is so easy to find as well, just next to Marylebone station. The Landmark is a place you should stay when you’re in London.",5,2020,02,08
106,Grand and cozy hotel you’d love to stay,"We spent 3 days in the Landmark and loved everything there. Both the outer look and the interior design of the hotel had left us in awe once we got there. It’s so grand and classy. A building full of history. Also, the staffs were so generous to upgrade our rooms to deluxe rooms, with one even further being upgraded to an executive rooms by the time we arrived. Their services were very efficient as well. They responded very quickly and kindly to customers’ requests. It’s been a wonderful experience for us! Wish we could stay longer!",5,2020,02,08
106,As always a great stay,"I have been using this hotel for a number of years and this is my first review. The hotel is situated opposite Marylebone Railway Station it’s a magnificent Victorian building and was built as the railway station hotel. Inside the hotel is well decorated very sympathetic to its Victorian era (look at the stained glass windows at the rear of the hotel by the staircase). The rooms I have stayed in are all a good size I would suggest they are some of the biggest in London. Beds are good and really it’s just a great place to stay. The location is also very good Oxford St is 15mins walk, Baker St 3 mins and lords any easy tube journey from Baker St Tube. The final thing I must add is the staff, the doormen are wonderful, Rupert is a gem! Reception, waiters, concierge and management all great really can’t do more to make ones stay special.If you want a big hotel that has a special feel to it you should choose the Landmark",5,2020,02,05
106,Excellent in every aspect!,"We had great experiences in the Landmark already for afternoon tea- the desserts are beautiful, excellent flavours with some surprise and made perfect. This time we have decided to do a staycation and it was fab! Room was huge and beautiful, dinner was excellent, great service from Maciek and Antonis, and the breakfast had an endless selection. We were pampered in the Spa by Sanju, superb massage. Will definitely return!",5,2020,02,03
106,Always consistently fabulous ,"I am staying here weekly at the moment and am consistently impressed by the level of individual hospitality and attention - 6 stars!

From the kind doorman, Rupert, always remembering my name, to lovely Maria (and others) on the reception team who make you feel valued as an individual, to the lovely waitress in Great Central who even remembers my menu ‘likes’ and food allergies each and every time ...

And with exceptional surroundings, rooms etc as a bonus!",5,2020,02,03
106,Just fabulous ....,"All the staff at the Landmark  could not do enough for us , especially Jose and Arnaud . They made my birthday celebrations that extra special.  The room we had overlooking the atrium was spectacular and had the comfiest bed !! Thank you .... I will definitely be back . ",5,2020,02,02
106,Beautiful Hotel and Great Staff,The hotel is magnificent and provides a superb five star service. Special thanks to Arnaud and Robbie on reception and Jose in the Winter Gardens for their excellent customer service. I would definitely stay here again ,5,2020,02,02
106,Amazing time at the landmark hotel,"Dear Landmark team, 

I have just spend two amazing day with my family for my 30th birthday!
Rooms are nice, big, and quiet, I slept like a baby in the executive twin room. 
Also, all services are excellent form our arrival to check out. 
Rupert at the door and Maria upon check in were both amazing and very professional. 
Breakfast was great also with a lot of things to eat, fresh and good. 
Members team were lovely. A special thank to Eufilia for her attention to details and great service. Finally, the spa was really relaxing. I had an aromatic massage performed by Nina and a facial massage performed by BEata and I want to kindly thanks fer for their kindness and professionalism. Jack needs as well recognition for his king wishes upon departure.  
I will come back to the landmark or sur and recommend it ! 
Thank you all for a memorable stay",5,2020,01,30
106,Stunning Venue,"Its really nice to visit and see the more traditional hotels in London of which there are many. This is by no means a ""cheap eat"" but well worth it in my opinion for special occasions. Pop in for breakfast for 2 - you could probably buy a new branded shirt for the price of it but worth the experience...",5,2020,01,29
106,Mrs jiang,"非常感谢 Oliver 的热情招待，特别是在春节期间在我们的房间里放了新年快乐的祝福卡片，还有发财树，好开心啊👌🍾😘酒店相当贵族，有质感，绝对推荐👍🥂💯

The best and most friendly hotel in London, especially the Chinese New year attention such as: new years card and Chinese breakfast make us feel home and welcome , thank you dear oliver, you are amazing 👍😘👌we well come back soon 👍",5,2020,01,27
106,Overnight stay,"Had a wonderful overnight stay in the beautiful Landmark Hotel with my
Husband and children. We had adjoining rooms which were stunning and extremely comfortable. 
Breakfast Sunday morning was busy but staff in the Winter Garden were happy and smiling and so attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel very special (as was everybody) despite the restaurant being so busy.  Breakfast was amazing and we were completely spoilt for choice. 
Despite being so busy the breakfast buffet was constantly being checked by staff and topped up where needed. 
Thank you to Marta, Kamil and all the Winter Garden breakfast team for a truly amazing service and memorable experience. I am so very grateful. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2020,01,25
106,Excellent Spa treatment,"I use the gym in this hotel. Last week ,  the extremely nice, courteous, kind young lady who is called Silvia and works at the Spa reception organized a massage for me which was divine. I had never had such a wonderful treatment before. It is called Chocolate Paradise and it truly deserves its name. My therapist was Beate whom I strongly recommend. She was excellent.",5,2020,01,21
106,First visit and hopefully not last,"The location of the hotel is brilliant: it is linked to the Marylebone station or you could easily walk from Baker Street tube.

We only spent an afternoon in the hotel catching up with friends and what afternoon it was!

When we arrived we had a very warm welcome from the doormen, who pointed to us where our friends were waiting for us and offered to take our coats. The hotel is beautiful and the Palm Court where we had champagne afternoon tea was stunning. Yes, the food was delicious but for us it was the team who made our afternoon: so professional and attentive with lively smiles. Thank you to everyone who looked after us 12th January. There was also live music there on Sunday afternoon.
As we were a bit late, our friends were nosy and had a look what Sunday brunch had to offer. And now we have another reason to come back!",5,2020,01,20
106,New Year's Eve,"We're just back from holiday and are still talking about the brilliant New Year's Eve gala on the 31st December 2019.
We went for the first time with our friends and loved the food. The service was some of the best we've experienced and we eat out a lot!!
What made the night really special was the superb live band with singer. They also had a casino and even had balloons falling from the ceiling at midnight!!
Everyone managed a dance and we will be booking  with a larger group for this year's celebration.
Well done to you all.",5,2020,01,16
106,Best Hotel in London,"I just returned from a business trip to London and visited the Landmark. 
During the whole stay I just felt special. 
The staff is really courteous and helpful. 
I would like to highlight Tamara and and Leen from the Guest Relations Team. They made my stay just perfect.
I will definitely come back with my loved ones.",5,2020,01,16
106,"Biggest rooms in London, convenient location","I recently stayed at the Landmark London with my 3 children (aged 9, 11, and 12) and we loved it!  I have visited London many times, with and without kids, in hotels and in flats, and I have to say that the rooms at the Landmark are bigger than any other rooms I have encountered.  The bathrooms are also quite large.  We have stayed in other neighborhoods but we ended up at The Landmark because we were meeting friends who had rented a flat nearby. The staff were all genuinely kind and helpful, and were great with my son showing them his magic tricks on our trips though the lobby.  The restaurant manager went above and beyond to help us with my sons' nut allergies - without making us feel like it was an inconvenience or a liability - which so many places end up doing.  The location is bang on Marylebone station - literally there is a lovely covered walk to the tube station.  10-15 minutes to almost anywhere in London and just so convenient.  Lots of little restaurants around the neighborhood and a mini market right across the way.  I met a friend in the Mirror Bar for a drink one night and it was fabulous.  The lobby will make you proud to host anyone there.  We will definitely be back!",5,2020,01,15
106,Christmas party,"On arrival we were greeted at the entrance by the doorman who took care of our luggage and ensured it was swiftly taken to our room once checked in. 

Check-in was seamless with your helpful and friendly staff. We got the impression that nothing seemed to much and everyone had a warm friendly smile. 

When we got to our room, we were overwhelmed to find a welcome pack and beautiful flowers awaiting. The suite was fabulous and we truly felt like we were being spoilt! 

The Christmas Function itself again was very impressive. The food was fabulous alongside the entertainment! 

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dawn who took care of our every need. She is a credit to your elite establishment. 

We look forward to returning for our annual Christmas function again in 2020.",5,2020,01,14
106,Birthday meal,"I took my wife and son  to the winter garden for a birthday meal.
We couldn’t have had a more perfect evening the only bad part was having to leave .
The staff were so friendly and helpful even my 7 year old son said he was made to feel special he loved it there and can’t wait to go back.
We have spent many fantastic evenings here and intend to spend many more .
If you want a very special time that you won’t forget then this is the place ....",5,2020,01,13
106,Awesome place and professional staff!,"Wonderful afternoon tea at the Landmark Hotel is really an art! 
Delicious desserts and sandwiches!
Live music complemented the magical mood!
All the staff that served us were very professional and caring.
We will definitely be back!

106,"Beautiful Hotel, great location ","Perfectly located by Regent’s Park and Marleybone, this is a great hotel for your London visit. The decor is traditional but high quality and service/food is very good. Only downside was the bed...not the most comfortable! ",4,2020,01,13
106,Truly Exceptional!,"From the moment our family of four arrived to the moment we left, we were treated like royalty in the Landmark. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff! Our family room was very impressive- great facilities, beautifully decorated and very clean. We used the hotel pool several times with the children and it was beautiful. Very clean, lots of robes, towels and slippers available to use. One of the highlights of our stay was the breakfast served in the winter gardens. There was so much choice of food and drink which was all beautifully presented and it was all delicious! The location of the hotel is perfect with the back entrance being right outside Marylebone station. We enjoyed our stay so much that the only gripe we had was having to leave to go home on January 1st!! Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2020,01,12
106,Fahad Mulhim,"It was an amazing 8 days I have spent in this super luxurious hotel. I really respect the professionalism being implemented by all staff members. The room size was the biggest I have ever seen in London.

Last but not least, this time will be graved into my memory, and for sure I will revisit this wonderful place again.

Regards,
Fahad",5,2020,01,11
106,2019 New Year’s Eve,"An absolutely fantastic New Year’s Eve Dinner & Dance evening from the ambiance; the celebratory environment; warm and friendly staff where nothing was too much trouble; delicious food; great company and all with fun entertainment.

Before we knew it, the clock chimed midnight and we didn’t want the night to finish or leave!

A brilliant evening and waiting for 2020 NYE to do it all over again.",5,2020,01,10
106,Old style hotel with the old world amenities good value for money,"We were four families travelling together and we were able to get a great rate for the family rooms over the new year holidays. The rooms were huge and comfortable for a family of 3. We had breakfast only on one day but it was extensive and lot of options. Old style hotel, rooms were old but in good condition. Small gym with a pool which was used by a lot of guests. The location is very good right next to Marylebone station, M&S foods was across the street. We enjoyed our comfortable stay, the staff was very courteous and polite. All in all it is a good hotel to stay in nothing fancy but good value for money.",4,2020,01,10
106,The best hotel in London by far!,"I decided to stay at this hotel after hearing great reviews from friends and family. 

I can say that by far, this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. I can not praise the hotel or it’s staff high enough. It was a fantastic visit, staff were superb and very welcoming. 

The entire team from reception to housekeeping and everyone in between was very professional, helpful and kind. Special thanks to the night team, Gloria who checked me out and the entire concierge team. 

I had a great stay and I can’t wait to return. 

Thanks again",5,2020,01,09
106,Amazing,"It was our first time at The Landmarnk, but it will not be the last one. 
We loved the service from the beginning. Specially being welcomed by Maria, at the Reception . She gave us a good idea of the Hotel and its facilities.
The food was amazing! We enjoyed both Breakfast & Dinner-  at the  Winter Garden & Great Central ( repectively).
Definetly a visit in the future is worth!",5,2020,01,09
106,Five star stunner,"Outside this hotel is The Marylebone Road which is one of Londons most busiest and polluted roads, but walk through the entrance to The Landmark to their stunning Atrium
and you soon forget about that .Superb decor and the staff are fussing over you at the bars & restaurants. We stayed for three days and the room was perfect. 
The hotel is near Marylebone station and not too far from Paddington station.
Madame Tussauds is nearby and easy to get to The West End.",5,2020,01,07
106,No words to describe the perfection that this hotel is,"I have stayed here numerous times and i will not even consider staying anywhere else in London. Directly across the road from Marylebone station and in the most beautiful neighbourhood in walking distance of most attractions and shopping.
The staff at this hotel are magnificent.
The breakfast is a gastronomical feast
The rooms are very large with beautifully appointed marble tiled bathrooms
Must have the oats swirled with cinnamon honey, the raisin and fruit bread and the berry smoothie at breakfast
If you stay over christmas there is no place more magical and comforting",5,2020,01,07
106,Not bad,"We are a family of 4 with kids 12 and 10. We stayed for 7 nights at the Landmark hotel in London over New years. We just got back.
The lobby, wintergarden breakfast, snacks room service food were all good. The lobby is pretty but restaurant service was not super efficient or friendly. There was no special treat or touch for the kids ever! Unlike many other hotels same level we have stayed at like the Peninsula or the Four seasons which left cookies or candy every night with turn down service.
The room size was good but beds are small and not very comfortable, no comparison to US hotels; Westin or Four seasons beds.The duvet had no covers just sheets. The tea bags were not replenished even once the whole week!
The other furniture in the room was very tired looking and the tv was placed at an awkward angle so could not be well seen from the bed.
I asked for my shoes to be cleaned and concierge said ‘of course leave them outside your door and you will get them back early morning’
Next morning no shoes had to call down only to have them returned without being cleaned!No iron in the room had to ask for it.
They failed to arrange airport transport for our early morning flight back to US, we waited around for almost 20 min only to call Uber ourselves.
Location is great, steps from Marylebone station.
Would I stay there again for a week long trip with family? given the level of service and what we got for the money probably not!",3,2020,01,05
106,Every Little Detail Was Perfect,"I stayed at the Landmark London for one night with my boyfriend to celebrate a special occasion.

I can't highlight enough how different it felt to stay at the Landmark compared to other large luxury hotels I've visited in the past; every little detail of our stay was taken care of, from the spotless state of the room, to the breadth of food on offer at both dinner and breakfast. 

The room was spacious, perfectly clean and stylishly decorated, and we were greeted by a gift and handwritten welcome laid out on the coffee table. 

The spa facilities are heavenly and not over-busy, and the continental breakfast provided was simply the best breakfast I have had in my life, with offerings from around the world and even a whole honeycomb set to drain for adding to toast or porridge. 

This stay was a once in a lifetime experience; would highly recommend.",5,2020,01,05
106,What a fantastic stay!,"I booked the Landmark for my husband’s birthday and a few other occasions we were celebrating, and I am so pleased I did - our stay was fantastic from start to finish.
We arrived earlier than 3pm and were checked in by Davide. Davide was very warm and friendly, and even upgraded us to a Deluxe room as we were staying for a special occasion. Check in was very quick and easy, and we were so pleased that we could get early access.
Our room was spacious and cosy and overlooked the Winter Garden. Just after we entered the room we were surprised with a ‘Congratulations’ cake and a personalised card from the Hotel Manager - a lovely touch. The upgraded room was fantastic, and when we stay again, we will definitely book a Deluxe room. 
Breakfast was perfect - every taste was catered for and anything running low was stocked almost immediately. 
Service from all staff throughout our stay was second to none - I won’t hesitate at booking the Landmark London again!",5,2020,01,05
106,Christmas comes early,"Outstanding in every sense! My wife, 21 month old son and I stayed here the weekend before Christmas as we celebrated Christmas with my in-laws. Check-in was simple and our bags (and accompanying baby clobber, presents,etc) were immediately taken to our room. 

The room itself was fantastic. Clean, huge, Molton Brown products in the bathroom and the cot had been set up for our son with baby (washing) products and a little rubber duck (he's obsessed with!).

We had Christmas lunch in the 'Winter Garden'. What a breathtaking space. The food is something else. I could easily have filled myself up on the amazing array of starters - lobster tails, prawn cocktail, crispy Thai beef salad, to name a few. Thankfully I left enough room for main and pudding. Everything was truly exceptional.

Location is perfect - Marylebone underground is right outside and Regent's Park is 5 minutes away for a lovely walk away from the hustle and bustle.

The little things didn't go unnoticed, which in my opinion really make this hotel 5*. ALL the staff are incredibly friendly and always smiling. Even when our little boy would get under the feet of the housekeeping teams, they were so nice with him.

Can't fault this amazing hotel at all. An absolute privelege to have stayed here. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.",5,2020,01,05
106,4.5 Stars * Family-Friendly Indoor Pool *Good Location * Easy Public Transit,"Very smooth check-in process. We arrived early in the morning overnight from NYC and our room wasn't ready yet, but we had access to the spa facilities (showers & locker rooms) to freshen up. Our room became ready shortly after breakfast. We had a large room and a huge bathroom with separate tub and shower. The location of the hotel was fantastic, attached to Marylebone station which was very convenient for using the tube around London and accessing trains outside of London, including the express train to the airport. Over the course of our stay, we took advantage of the in-house laundry  (no problems), the swimming pool, sauna & hot tub (all very clean). The buffet breakfast was very expensive, but the quality of the food was good and it was refreshed constantly. One morning we did choose to eat breakfast elsewhere for variety and cost savings. 
Some things that were not perfect which is why I would give 4.5 and not 5 stars.
- In the morning there is no place within the hotel to just get a quick cup of coffee, there is no set up in the room and the breakfast buffet doesn't offer any to-go option, only full room service. I need to be drinking my first cup of coffee while I am getting ready -- so I had to leave the hotel bleary-eyed and go to the coffee shop by the train station every morning. Another place for improvement (long term) is to engineer pedestrian access to the hotel from Marylebone Rd. When we approached from this direction, we felt we had to battle cars coming up and down the ramp -- the pedestrian entrance is clearly meant to be on the other side and it's nowhere near as beautiful to come in and out of the hotel using that door. We also visited both Mirror Bar and the Great Central Bar but didn't love the ambiance in either place. There was just something off in both places -- they were cold and boring. Changing the music and lighting would help a lot. For example the lights were up way too bright in Great Central.",4,2020,01,04
106,The Perfect Christmas,"My family and I stayed at the Landmark to celebrate Christmas. Put simply: it exceeded all of our expectations and really is second to none. From the moment we arrived, we were mesmerized by the jaw-dropping decorations and the faultless, attentive service. All of the needs of both ourselves and our 1 year old son were not just met, but often anticipated in advance; a big thing when traveling with a baby! The food was out of this world. We can highly recommend the buffet which is laden with the highest quality ingredients and feels more like a luxe feast. What's more: the breakfast has everything... And I mean EVERYTHING...one could possibly want. Our room was large, tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean and the perfect temperature. All in all, we could not have asked for more. Thank you Landmark London.",5,2020,01,04
106,Early Christmas,"We had a lovely early Christmas stay at the landmark with some family. It's not our first time at the hotel and it never fails to amaze us. The staff were all great, from the people who met us at the door and took our bags to the room to the maids who would all wish us a merry Christmas when we passed them in the halls to the staff in the winter garden who made sure our glasses were always full at the brunch.

The rooms have been redecorated and look great. They are very spacious which was great with our 5 month old son to play and roll around in. We had let them know we would have a baby with us and a cot was set up in our room along with bath toys for the baby which I thought was a great touch and is one of the many small things which make the landmark a standout experience for us.

In all a very memorable stay in a beautiful hotel. We will be back!  ",5,2020,01,03
106,Dinner in the Winter Garden,"My mother and I booked on the Christmas Eve dinner in the Winter Garden... it was superb! The price was very favourable compared to other similar-level restaurants, the atmosphere was festive and tranquil, and the food was wonderful. There was so much of it that we ended up taking some home! Of course, the Landmark provided rather stylish 'doggy bags'! The staff treated us like stars and my mother, who is in her 70's, was charmed and made to feel special. Thank you to all the staff for a gorgeous evening.",5,2020,01,02
106,Great venue for a meeting!,"I visited the Landmark in December for a meeting and found it to be the perfect setting. The meeting room was fantastic, as was the food and beverage that was provided, and the location is perfect. Thank you to Oliver for arranging.",5,2020,01,02
106,Landmark LONDON ,"My stay at Landmark always great and my visit in December was no different. Great location, friendly staff and amazing food at their Restaurants not forgetting spacious rooms with great facilities. I usually stay at Landmark since 2004 and have no plan to change it",5,2019,12,31
106,"Simply ""Thank You""","The staff are amazing, always smiling and ready to help. I would like to specifically thank Maria, Claire, Davide and Margo from the front desk, Richard from the concierge and the guy at the back door (sorry did not get the name). The lady at the operator on the Christmas Eve was so helpful (sorry did not get the name), she was very professional, she called me by my name. I called her at  around 8 pm regarding a lost item and in no time it was sent to my room. Also, special thanks to Mr. Magdy from the reservation department.

The rooms are spacious and clean with nice views. The breakfast was good with some nice varieties and the Staff were really friendly and helpful.
  
 The location of the hotel is perfect, you have a train station just across the road and another one within 5 min walk. Baker street is also very close and most attractions are not so far. This was very important as I was travelling with my kids.
I look forward to another visit and wish all the staff a very happy New Year.

106,Luxury hotel with unmissable breakfast,"My partner and I stayed at The Landmark during a Christmas shopping trip to London. The room was so nice that we wanted to rush back whenever we were out exploring! The quality and choice of food at breakfast was simply breathtaking, don't miss it!!",5,2019,12,29
106,"Welcoming Staff, Great Rooms & Excellent Location","This review is based on 8 nights stay during the month of Dec 2019. I booked through the hotel website, and I got better rates and an upgrade upon arrival. The room was super clean and comfortable, spacious, and very quiet. Room dinning quality was great, although the menu had limited selections. The staff were very welcoming and offered to help all the time. ",5,2019,12,29
106,Champagne 50th Brunch,"Absolutely wonderful experience, so festive!!!

The Champagne really is free flowing, the food selection you were truly spoilt for choice......full breakfast, eggs benedict, waffles, full selection of roasts , sushi, fish and vegetarian options along with deserts to die for....followed by a chocolate fountain.....treasured memories the staff were faultless!",5,2019,12,28
106,Amazing hotel. Impeccable service!,We visited with family this Christmas. Our trip was one to remember from start to finish. Our room was perfect - it had every amenity we needed and the cleanliness was amazing. Throughout our stay the service was faultless and the food was some of the best we have ever had. Thank you to everyone for making our trip one to remember!,5,2019,12,28
106,"Great service , good location ","I was there with my fiancé for business for many time , it is easy to reach the hotel. The check in process is great , not too long . The room very Very clean, with details that we like . In the morning we have great breakfast with fabulous atmosphere. This is one of the valuable hotel in London . All the stuff is very friendly and helpful.",5,2019,12,25
106,Christmas at The Landmark,We were invited to attend a company celebrate and stayed the night. From the moment you arrive you feel relaxed and welcomed. The suites are very spacious and the breakfast was fabulous in the Winter Garden. Thank you to Richard on concierge for your assistance and advice. Thank you also to Magdy for the warm friendly welcome. ,5,2019,12,22
106,Great hotel,Best value 5* hotel in London! Excellent staff. Great breakfast rooms are perfect for me with large bathroom! Spa good! Have stayed on numerous occasions and always made to feel welcome! LHW member this also adds value!,5,2019,12,21
106,Coming home!,"After a break of about five years we have just had the opportunity to stay again at The Landmark London. It was really like coming home. The very lovely suite was complete with a Christmas Tree and after a very long flight the super comfortable bed was very welcome. 
We took breakfast at the Winter Garden which is such a photogenic venue. 
The breakfast buffet was totally complete with everything anyone could wish for no matter what your personal breakfast preferences are. The associates ensured we knew what was available and coffee preferences was asked. We had breakfast a couple of times but only needed to mention coffee preference once! Deborah remembered each day! 

I have stayed many times at the Landmark over many years but unfortunately not for the past five years and it was a pleasure to return and see the Grand Dame is still delivering delightful stays. I hope we will be back before another five years!!

Thank you Landmark!",5,2019,12,19
106,AMAZING!!!,"Just returned from a very relaxing weekend break. We have stayed here a few times before and feel so valued when this is not only picked up by reception staff on arrival, but this time there was a personal handwritten message from the hotel manager in our room welcoming us back. It really made us feel special. This hotel offers everything, luxurious enormous rooms with amazing bathrooms, a breakfast buffet like no other I have ever come across anywhere, and a brilliant location, easy walking distance for Oxford Street, Hyde Park, Regents Park for the Zoo etc. Every member of staff is courteous and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble and they remember detail, it sets this hotel apart from others. If you are looking for a tranquil haven in a central location this is the hotel to stay at. Love it so much we have booked again for feb 2020. Cant wait!",5,2019,12,15
106,Hits the standard without really standing out,There is nothing specific I can fault the Landmark on- no foible that really bothered me. But equally I couldn’t say it wowed me at all. It does what it needs to. Rooms and furnishings are a little tired (as for most west end London hotels). I’m not a big fan of rooms looking inwards to a central atrium but that’s just me. The location is convenient. At a good price this is a solid London option. ,3,2019,12,15
106,Amazing experience with incredible customer service.,"I had booked an event in the Tower Suite at the Landmark with one nights stay in the Hotel. The event was organised by Oliver who really made the whole thing a great success. Oliver also met me at check in to make sure that we're all ready for the event. The room was incredible. I've stayed in a few 5* hotels in London and this was up there as one of the best! 

The service during the event itself was fantastic and all staff were happy to accommodate all of our needs. Following this we have booked our next event in February and really look forward to hosting more there throughout the year. Thank you.",5,2019,12,15
106,Two night stay,"What an outstanding hotel! From entering to leaving, our stay here was incredible.
The staff were very attentive and polite without being intrusive.
Location was ideal for central London and many places of interest.
Our accommodation was first class with everything and more you would expect from a Five star hotel.
Would we stay again?  Absolutely, everything about The Landmark was simply lovely.",5,2019,12,14
106,High Palms High Tea,"I visited with my Mum and sister on Friday 6th December for the High Palms High Tea in the wonderful Winter Garden, what a fabulous experience! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and were given the best customer experience we could wish for. The sandwiches were absolutely beautiful and the cakes were exquisite! We cannot fault our visit and would love to experience the Champagne Brunch for another special occasion! The experience at Christmas was especially wonderful. Thank you to Dawn and the rest of the team who made our visit so special.",5,2019,12,14
106,Long Time Customer of the Landmark London Won't Return,"Since 2003, I have faithfully stayed at the Landmark London with each visit to the UK. I have to say this time was not at all up to its usual service. I booked 3 rooms for my family for a weeks stay. The beds and pillows were not comfortable at all. My husbands back suffered throughout the stay. Security was called almost every night to try to quiet guests in the room next to my mother's. Her room had a strong smell cigarette smoke. She was booked on a non smoking floor due to her susceptibility to bronchitis.The gym is absurdly small. I actually bought a pass to Pure Gym just down the corner from the hotel. We paid 10 GBP each at check-in additionally for a full english breakfast. Our breakfast food quality was decent but not up to the usual standards that I recall. Basic items like rye bread and berries somehow were not available on certain days. The service was flat out mediocre at best. We had to ask for things more than 2 times. The wait staff would make errors on orders. It was total chaos some mornings to say the least. The last straw was when we asked for a bellman to bring my mothers luggage down to the lobby on our departure. She waited over 15 mins for a bellman to arrive. I would say in general the stay was just average. Breakfast at 10 GBP per day was compt off of the bill and we were told that if we come back we would be given a suite upon booking When I stayed at the Landmark I would say 90% of the time in the past, I was upgraded to a suite for free due to my loyalty. I am a Marriott Ambassador and almost a lifetime platinum member and chose not to stay at a Marriott hotel because of how much I admired the Landmark for their generosity and for their service. Needless to say, I will not be back after a 16 year relationship with the Landmark.",2,2019,12,13
106,Beautiful Hotel but.......,"This really is a beautiful hotel - especially with all of the lovely Christmas decorations. The Winter Garden area is simply stunning! The location is excellent as two tube stations are just a few minutes walk away & taxis are easily available (the doorman can usually hail one for you in just minutes). 

Our Executive room was gorgeous, large, perfectly appointed with everything we needed, & spotlessly clean (as I would expect it to be). The bed slightly on the hard side for us but that’s personal preference of course. 

The food was very good & the breakfast buffet excellent. 

The staff were all extremely friendly & polite, but I have to hold back on saying that they were efficient. Some were, but too many appeared not to be. Maybe it was the organisational procedures that were lacking rather than the individuals, but there were definitely missing links somewhere. 

To explain these comments, we basically had to constantly repeat our requests which became quite annoying. 

1. When we checked in late afternoon, we left our luggage with the doorman in reception for our bags to be delivered to our room. We then immediately went to the Mirror Bar to meet a friend. When I went up to our room almost one & a half hours later, our luggage had still not been delivered & I had to call reception as we needed things from our bags 

2. We asked for one of the windows in the room to be unlocked as we like air to circulate in our room. Again, this request had to be repeated because it had still not been done after almost two hours.

3. On our first evening we ate in the Winter Garden restaurant. We had to ask for our wine to be delivered to the table twice. At a restaurant it’s normal to choose wine to accompany your food, but if we had commenced eating our starter as soon as it arrived, we would have finished this course by the time the wine eventually appeared at our table. 

4. One morning at breakfast, after sitting at my table for 30 minutes, nobody had offered tea or coffee, or taken my hot food order. I chose from the buffet instead. I had to eventually approach one of the waiting staff to ask for a hot drink in the end. Nobody ever came to ask if I wanted hot food, despite the fact that I kept my menu in plain site for them to see. 

5. In the corridor of our room, dirty glasses were left on tables for the best part of a whole day. I noticed the glasses one morning before we left for the day, the same glasses were still there when we returned to our room late afternoon, & they were still there when we returned from the theatre late evening, & they were still there the following morning! And yes, they were definitely the same glasses with the same remnants of drink in them. Numerous staff must have walked past these glasses over the course of this time, but nobody seemingly could be bothered to remove them. Whilst this didn’t directly affect us, when you’re staying in a hotel of this grade & paying over £500 a night, you shouldn’t really have to constantly walk past dirty dishes. 

Individually these are all small things, but when they add up they start to become annoying, & in a hotel of this standing, it’s just not what’s expected. We certainly have never had these experiences at other similar grade hotels like The Ritz, Savoy, Claridges, Dorchester, or any of the Four Seasons hotels. I certainly don’t expect anybody to jump to attention & action requests immediately, but we gave ample time for our requests to be completed before repeating ourselves. 

We did enjoy staying at this hotel for three nights, but I doubt I would stay here again as it’s just not operating as tight & seamless as it should be. As I write this review we’re now staying at the Four Seasons in Hampshire. Now this is what I call impeccable service! Maybe the management of The Landmark would care to take a visit here & make a few notes?!

106,Amazing staff.,"From the moment my wife and I walked through the door and entered the Christmas themed Winter Garden, we were made to feel really welcome. Staff were available to ensure our experience was of the highest quality, particularly in the delivery of afternoon tea and the excellent breakfast. Our room was immaculate with quality facilities throughout enabling us to relax and gather our strength prior to an intensive day of visiting tourist attractions and shopping on Oxford Street. We cannot speak highly enough of the warm reception and attention to detail offered by the Landmark. We will certainly visit again.",5,2019,12,13
106,Poor service to excessive noise.  Poor Management.,"Stayed a few times however shocking experience.  Shame as a really nice hotel otherwise but it has to, in my opinion, be backed with the customer service.  Music from party in one of the function rooms was physically vibrating the furniture.  Requested a few times for this to be addressed however to no avail.  Went to reception to speak to manager on duty who informed me there was nobody with authority to ask them to turn it down.  I was offered to move rooms at midnight which I explained was not a pragmatic solution with a young family.  We had friends staying on the top floor who could hear it too albeit a lot less so I explained this was not really a solution.  I was then offered the room for free - again I explained this was not the basis of my conversation - we just wanted to rest.  As it stands the noise carried on till the early hours and we had a tired and weary family the next day.  Really disappointed and will not recommend or return.",1,2019,12,13
106,London Trip,"What an absolutely fabulous Hotel . Facilities fantastic, location superb, service outstanding, quality unbelievable. Thoroughly recommend this timeless elegant hotel . Don’t miss out on The Landmark if you are visiting London for any reason whatsoever!

106,Excellent Visit,"An excllent Hotel with amazing staff providing the highest level of professional hospitality service.

106,Iconic Hotel with Traditional Five Star Hospitality,"My wife and I stayed at the Landmark London for our annual Christmas weekend in London.  This was the first time we stayed at the Landmark and hopefully it will not be the last.

The location of the hotel - right opposite the main entrance to London Marylebone rail station made it super convenient, allowing us to take the train direct to the hotel.  As you enter the hotel you get a first impression of the welcome from the friendly doorman as you enter the hotel impressive lobby leading to its world famous Winter Garden atrium.

We were greeted by super friendly Gemma at reception, who greeted us with a welcoming ""we have been expecting you"".  After a quick but comprehensive overview of the facilities and logistics we were should to our room.  We were told that each room in the hotel is somewhat unique - and our generously sized room with super king bed overlooked the front entrance of the hotel with large bay windows.

During our stay we got to avail of the bars (both the basement Grand Central and the  quieter more exclusive Mirror Bar) as well as breakfast at the impressive Winter Garden.  Service was excellent and friendly, but I would recommend to time your arrival for breakfast to avoid any queues.  (We arrive at 1030am and had a 10 minute wait).

I am glad to say that despite checking out at a busy 12noon period, we found the check out process by George as friendly and efficient as we experienced at check in.  Plenty of time for some Christmas shopping - topping off what was a wonderful first stay experience at this old London icon.

We will be back, and hope to get a chance to try the Spa, which looked very inviting too.",5,2019,12,11
106,An experience to remember.,"My birthday afternoon tea was an absolutely amazing experience. Lovely fresh sandwiches and delicious petite cakes,a  celebration with my 2 daughters, the service was second to none, we felt totally spoilt,the wonderful Christmas decorations made us feel very festive.
We most definitely will be back. Thank you Landmark... 
Carol Oke.",5,2019,12,11
106,£7.00 rip off for snacks.,"We had a drink in the Great Central bar last week which was an unpleasant experience.
There was a group of men celebrating a birthday and swearing very loudly. Nobody in the hotel approached them to ask this to stop.
Then another group arrived and 2 of the men placed their drinks and lent on our table and not their table next to us.
This is not the behaviour we would expect at this standard of hotel. Especially as the bar prices are ridiculous even by London standards.
Then to add insult to injury when offered nuts and olives we discovered we were charged £7.00 plus service charge. Petty. The nuts were smoked and unpleasant and not eaten.
In future we will stick to The Firmdale, Dorset Square,Potting Shed bar a short walk away. A truly beautiful hotel with pleasant guests and reasonable bar prices. With a glass of champagne being cheaper than a glass of house wine at The Landmark. 
Never again.",2,2019,12,11
106,Chocolate treatment,I went with my friend for a chocolate treatment and it was the best. My treatment was done by Paulina. She was very nice and professional and the treatment itself was very relaxing. She explained all the details about the treatment and was very gentle and subtle. I really recommend it to everyone who needs to let so steam out or just wants to relax!,5,2019,12,11
106,Great meeting venue ,"I came to this hotel for business this week and was really impressed. I'd always thought of The Landmark for special occasion meals (which I will now be back for, for sure), but it was great for a meeting too and the food and service was excellent. The hotel looks so beautiful all decorated for Christmas, I hope to be back soon. Thanks Oliver for looking after our group. ",5,2019,12,11
106,The best meeting venue I’ve been to!,"I was lucky enough to visit the hotel for a business meeting last week and I was impressed from the moment I walked in. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, which is always a lovely touch, and the staff greeted us with a smile and were very helpful in helping us to navigate our way around. A special mention to Oliver who really looked after us and made sure we didn’t want for anything. The food was also lovely and I’ll definitely be returning for afternoon tea! Thank you!",5,2019,12,11
106,What an amazing place!,"Last week, I attended a meeting at the Landmark and had a fantastic experience at this stunning venue. All hotel staff were extremely helpful (helping us find our room etc) and more than happy to answer any queries we had regarding our booking.

106,Wonderful Christmas Dinner!,"I had planned earlier this week a Christmas get together dinner with all my friends and their spouses at the Great Central Bar & Restaurant and boy they did not dissapoint! From the attention to detail service to the food and drinks quality, everything was perfect and all my guests were saying how amazing was our evening. I would like to particularly say a big thank you to Andras, Joao, Agata, Matias and Charina for looking after our little group so well. They are true example of amazing hospitality staff and can't praise them enough. THANK YOU!",5,2019,12,10

106,Cocktail masterclass,"Myself and six friends attended the masterclass in the Mirror bar yesterday afternoon and what a fantastic time we had, thank you Janus( sorry about spelling) and Spyros for your patience while teaching us to make the perfect cocktail you really joined in the spirit of the day ( sorry about the pun) of the afternoon which made it such a brilliant fun afternoon, we would highly recommend this the masterclass and the two course meal afterwards was equally delightful, with everyone making it a day to remember. Thank you",5,2019,12,08
106,Great time at the family room at Landmark London,Had a lovely time staying in the spacious family room for 10nights. Staff is friendly and love the live music at the Winter garden restaurant.Location is ideal. Would definitely go back to the Landmark the next time when we go back. Highly recommended for families and couples.,5,2019,12,07
106,But the Christmas tree!,"This was my first time at this hotel. I chose to stay here because I followed Greg, the Guest Relations Manager, from another hotel where he previously worked. I travel all the time, but every once in a while, a person really stands out for providing exceptional service, and Greg is one of those people.  

This beautiful old building is mostly remodeled inside, but what caught my eye when I walked in was the enormous Christmas tree! I love Christmas lights and this tree was stunning. Luckily, I had a very large family room for me and my daughter and a view to the tree from my room.

The staff were so kind and helpful. The concierge helped with dinner reservations as well as couriering a package and arranging a car/driver for me.

Others have mentioned this, but the rooms are very large for London or just about anywhere in Europe, as are the bathrooms. The bed was so comfortable. I slept probably the best I had in two weeks of travel.

I was thrilled with the stay and happy to return here again. Thank you to Greg, as always, for always looking out for your guests!",5,2019,12,05
106,Made My Birthday! 100 recommended.,"I live in London but decided to stay the night of my birthday in this hotel and I think I made the best choice.

Thanks Ali... again.",5,2019,12,04

106,MADE MY YEAR - AMAZING EXPERIENCE !!,"We stayed in London and chose the Landmark Hotel and we were blown away, the room was gorgeous, we had a childrens tent in the room with head lights and bears, it was much loved.

The breakfast was phenominal!!!! The spa was gorgeous, the pool was lovely.

We felt like stayiing here made our trip even more special and we created so many lovely memories and moments here.

The staff were so friendly and helpful, i cant recommend this hotel enough!",5,2019,12,04

This is a must so if you are passing please stop by for lunch and a drink. You won’t be disappointed.,5,2019,11,27
106,Amazing weekend,"I spent an amazing weekend with my two best friends in this wonderful hotel. The room was spacious and so cosy, you could really feel like at home! The breakfast buffet was delicious and so rich you were not able to try everything. We also had the afternoon tea time which was superb as well. Last but not least the staff was so attentive and always friendly. A special thanks to the concierge Richard who helped me to organise my busticket to the airport with such patience. I can only recommend to stay in this wonderful hotel!",5,2019,11,27
106,Great London experience!,"The Landmark London was a great find. We have stayed at many hotels in London and this has been our favorite. Stayed twice, on the way into Europe and the way out. Both times the room was large and very comfortable. The concierge service was top notch and the front desk was efficient and helpful. Didn't get a chance to use the spa but the gym was great. The mirrored bar was unique and fun for drinks. We had lunch one day at the restaurant downstairs and it was very good. We had never stayed in Marylebone and loved the area. Great shops and restaurants. Preferred it to Knightsbridge, Belgravia and Covenant Gardens area, where we have stayed before. Marylebone has more of a neighborhood feel and is less touristy. We will definitely be back to the Landmark!",5,2019,11,26
106,Lovely afternoon tea,"I had a wonderful afternoon tea at the Landmark the other day. The service wasn't just super attentive, but I also got really delicious gluten free options. Bread isn't always good when it's gluten free, but this one was amazing, and also the scones were great. Often they are very dry when gluten free. The ones at the Landmark were fabulous! Will definitely come back, if I manage to book a table again. It's a popular place for afternoon tea :)",5,2019,11,26
106,Excellent large party catering ,"A business event in the Empire Room.  Excellent food and very good service.   Salmon as a main course for many guests without becoming dry was impressive.

106,Afternoon Tea,"A friends birthday celebration.
The table was beautifully presented,our waitress was very nice and professional.
The sandwiches and cakes were delicious and so fresh, the waitress came around many times to top up our sandwiches and top up our tea cups.
I Thoughly Enjoyed The Experience.",5,2019,11,17

This time to visit the spa with friends.

Good value £45 to use facilities for as long as you like fruit and water available.  Towels etc.

106,High class hotel in Marylebone,"This hotel is very close to the Marylebone train station. It appears quite fancy but after having stayed a couple of times, it is showing wear.

When I checked in during my first stay in the spring, they offered the breakfast at a discounted price if I booked it during check in. I was able to identify a morning I wanted to have breakfast at that rate. The deal did not continue during my second stay in the fall. The breakfast is quite good with a lot of options.

The rooms are very large and spacious. They offer an evening turndown service and daily water bottles. The bath products have a very strong scent so you have to like the scent.

They advertise the pool downstairs as a chlorine-free pool. I went inside the pool and it felt strange! How are they keeping that pool clean?

If you put your shoes out at night for the free shoe shine service, you pick up your shoes the next morning at the concierge.",4,2019,11,10
106,Afternoon tea and an overnight for a special birthday.,"From start to finish we thoroughly enjoyed our time at The Landmark Hotel. Just over the road from Marylebone station- it was pure luxury. The setting was beautiful and romantic with live piano playing. The service was to the highest of standards and we could not have wished for a better room. It really was a special treat for a rare overnight away from our four children. The afternoon tea was plenty and delicious! The hotel also had a sweet touch by bringing out a mini birthday cake for my husband. One of the nicest hotels we have visited. I hope that one day we can return. Please pass on our warmest of thanks to the team at the Winter Garden, especially our friend from Goa, India who served us!",5,2019,11,10
106,Consistently Brilliant!,"There are 5 Star hotels and then there is the Landmark London. I have stayed here on many occasions and rate this as one of the best places to stay anywhere. The rooms are spacious, the food is excellent and the staff are simply superb. This is a truly wonderful place to visit and relax. Close enough to walk to Marylebone High Street for all the great shopping and restuarants as well as Regents Park. Highly recommended.",5,2019,11,10
106,Perfect Stay,"It at all started at the front desk. Check in was swift and smooth with great service  from Maria (Marisol) and the greeting of the Reception Manager, Andre, make the stay feel more special. Very professional and friendly treat. The room was flawless and we were surprised with a bottle of Champagne, which was a detail that made the difference.After checking the room we went for dinner at the Winter Garden. I haven't experienced a dinner like this before, incredible and succulent food accompanied with the background piano and the feeling of being in an oasis of luxury, totally outstanding. The bed is the most comfortable bed i have had the pleasure to sleep on, I had a wonderful sleep with no noise and enjoying my bottle of Champagne :). Finally breakfast was the icing on the cake, everything you might want for breakfast is there for you, fresh fruit and a typical English Breakfast, an amazing way of starting the day . Supreme stay, nothing disappointing at all, It was a five star luxurious stay.",5,2019,11,10
106,Landmark hotel,"The organization and services are getting worse every time I visited the hotel especially with the reservation , I consider my self a loyal costumer to the hotel I’ve been staying in the hotel every time I visited London since 2008, usually not less than 4 nights at least twice a year, they have no consideration to that, I don’t know if the management has been changed since then but definitely something went wrong, they will keep you waiting for your room to be ready Without the curtsy of letting you know once it’s ready and you will be sitting in their lobby for ever, once I needed to extend my stay for further 4 nights, I was told that the room is ready in the morning all I need is to call the front desk in the morning to have my suitcases transferred to my new room, that morning I was informed they need one hour to clean the room as it was not ready in fact it was not even reserved for me, I ended waiting for more than 3 hrs for it to be cleaned and you have to call the front desk to see if the room is ready as they will promise to call you back in 5 min and no surprise you end up calling them after 30 min to check. 
Definitely I’m considering ever staying again in this hotel",2,2019,11,08
106,Amazing weekend,"We visited for the wine tasting weekend and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite. The room was so comfortable and spacious. It's especially nice overlooking the winter garden.
Everything about the hotel was almost faultless from the staff, to the bedding, and the cocktails in the mirror bar. 
Dinner in the central bar was very tasty with substantial portions.
There were a few issues with breakfast but nothing major.
Didn't hesitate in booking our next stay before checking out.",5,2019,11,04
106,A true London landmark,"Quiet luxury, understated opulence and the warm, friendly, helpful staff — the Landmark was such a haven in London. It has a great location in Marylebone, conveniently close to the Tube station and several restaurants; just ask the concierge or the front desk staff for suggestions on walks, sights and where to shop. 
Rooms on the lower floors are much larger than most hotel rooms in London, tastefully and thoughtfully decorated in duck's egg blue and cream. If your room overlooks the Winter Garden, count on the added pleasure of a quiet late-night serenade by the piano player, and breakfasts and their afternoon tea are sumptuous. The light in the atrium is gorgeous, and I particularly liked the many small spaces around the hotel where you can sit and read or write in peace.
Loved the grand staircases, the art collection, and their business centre facilities are also excellent. It's great for a business trip, but it would be absolutely perfect for a romantic week in the city, too.
Special thanks to Vladimir, Vivien and Arnaud, who made an already happy stay that much more pleasant — and to Thomas, who went to extraordinary lengths to locate a taxi in the middle of rush hour. Much appreciated, and I hope to be back next year for a longer visit. Definitely recommended for couples, solo women travellers who'd like a little pampering, and for anyone who wants a restful and luxurious holiday in the city.
The lifts and wheelchair ramps make the Landmark reasonably accessible, but because of the long passages, wheelchair users may want to request rooms closer to the lifts and on lower floors.",5,2019,11,02
106,Beautiful Winter Garden Restaurant,"Came as a special occasion since we were both celebrating our birthdays. The decor is stunning. The Winter Garden restaurant gives the impression you are sitting outside. There are palm trees and plants in between the tables. The place has an elegant colonial feel to it. There is a roof but it’s so high up it feels like you are sitting outside. 
The service was very good and attentive. But the best was the choice on the menu. There were three menus to choose from. Good choice of fish and meats. There is also a few vegetarian choices so no one would go hungry! The breads were an awesome selection with onion bread, olive bread and lovely soft white. All warm with lots of butter.
My partner had pork belly for starters and beef for main. I had the egg starters and cod main. My cod was cooked to perfection. Lovely and crispy from outside. And soft from inside. The vegetable were awesome! And the jus lovely!
The selection of cheeses was also a good choice! At least five different type with lovely crispy wafers. 
It’s not cheap, but it’s totally worth it. Would come again!",5,2019,11,02
106,Our favorite hotel in London,"We’ve stayed here a few times now, the most recent time just a week ago, and we’ve always had a fantastic stay. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious, the breakfast is outstanding, and the Mirror Bar is a great place for a drink before or after dinner. Staff have always been very kind and helpful. We look forward to staying here again. ",5,2019,10,30
106,beautiful,"it was stunning, and the bedroom was amazing for a london room, much bigger than average.  The spa package was lovely, and the breakfast was very good, although had issues getting a table in the mornings.  it was a great location.",4,2019,10,27
106,True Hospitality,"In June, my wife and I stayed at this Leading Hotel of the World (LHW) located on the fringe of central London.  This is an elegant hotel with a soaring atrium, elegant public rooms and finishes,  excellent dining and lounges, and excellent rooms.  A true first class hotel in every aspect.  But what I will truly remember this place for is how understanding and helpful the Front Desk, Housekeeping, and numerous other employees were to me when I became ill there.  I became very ill with a virus that required me to seek medical attention.  The hotel was gracious to me in extending our stay, directing me to an excellent nearby hotel and checking how I was doing.  I was very appreciative of Housekeeping and I did not make their job easy - believe me.  My wife and I were very thankful that we stayed at this hotel for they helped us when we really needed help.  On our next trip to London, there is only one hotel possibility for us: the architecturally stunning Landmark Hotel which truly lives up to its name in elegance, but most importantly,  in the hearts of its employees which showed hospitality at its finest.",5,2019,10,27
106,SUPERB EXPERIENCE,"Hi, 
Would like to thank you Landmark for giving such a warm welcm and very good experience while my stay in hotel.
I was with my family for my bday celebration. Stayed there for a night and had spa treatment. Everything including spa was of excellent level.
Thanks once again to the whole team of winter garden restaurant and spa team.",5,2019,10,23
106,"Amazing place, amazing staff","Our second visit to this amazing hotel and left more impressed than the first time. Stunning scenery within the hotel, with its amazing decor. Not one fault with one member of staff who were always on hand to help and be pleasant.
The free use of the swimming pool and jacuzzi was a lovely bonus, kept beautifully clean and tidy again by the stay. 
Definitely worth a stay here, couldn't recommend highly enough. amazing place!!",5,2019,10,23
106,London London London,"We often visit UK because my family lives there but this time as I had a wedding to attend I decided to make it a holiday and stay at a hotel as opposed to my sisters’ place. My mom came down from the midlands to spend the 4 days with my kids and I’d specifically booked this hotel because of its proximity to all the wedding event things I had to attend . The hotel is gorgeous ❤️, I booked the family room with the offer that included breakfast for two and champagne . I enjoyed the breakfast but for my kids I’d say it was probably a waste of money .My mom and I enjoyed the spa and the kids enjoyed the pool. The room was large and the marble bathroom was large too however we had issues with the water temperature but the staff was prompt in addressing our numerous needs!! I would most certainly recommend this hotel if not for the fanciness , then for the location.",4,2019,10,23
106,Best in London,"This was my 5 th stay in this hotel , why “ simply perfect’ , from the front office to room service , extremely clean clean clean , shiny, good sleep quality, very comfortable furniture ,  very spacious rooms .

これまで宿泊した中でも最高の部類に入るホテルでした。部屋のクオリティも、ホスピタリティもトップレベルです。ロンドンに泊まるときは、またここを選びたいと思います。",5,2019,10,22
106,A gem in London,"We stayed at the hotel for a relaxing getaway from our busy life. We live in London and tend to try and get away often to enjoy something new. The Landmark delivered in every way. The greeting at reception was smooth and warming. They made us feel relaxed and it felt like the doorman and receptionist were people we had known for a long time! Eustace, Vladimir, Grigor, Andre, Maria and Myriam really are outstanding people. The room is gorgeous, amazing views over the Winter Garden, a large and ample bathroom but best of all the bed. That bed made our night, we wanted to take that mattress and pillows home! For dinner we decided to try the Winter Garden. We were warmly greeted and sat at a nice corner table. The atmosphere with the Piano Man was awesome and the food (recommended by Larissa) was impeccable. We enjoyed a nice glass of champagne to start and a good bottle of wine to continue, the scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavours blended together very well. Rita and the Italian Gentleman (been there for about 1 year he said) were warm and always kept our glasses full. For breakfast the next morning we were greeted by Adina and Kamel which explained how everything worked and quickly got us some great coffee and OJ. The breakfast buffet is top notch. You have a little bit of everything you might want to have and you can discover other things you never thought possible. Overall we really enjoyed the Landmark London and I do have to say that the only bad thing I can think of is that we had to leave! Thank you guys! ",5,2019,10,19
106,"Great Hotel, lovely staff and fantastic service!","Fantastic place to pop in for a drink especially on a rainy day.  We missed our train and decided to hop into the Mirror Bar to have a quick drink but unfortunately it was closed for some private event, so we have been sent to Great Central. We wanted to turn around when we saw that there is no space, but Alexandra approached us, being very cheery and attentive, and offered a fantastic table next to the fireplace. Absolutely perfect, will definitely come back.",5,2019,10,18
106,A real stylish reference!,"If you want to go British in the centre of London then I would call this a good choice. Excellent service, splendid breakfast, good food, splendid room, good meeting rooms, whatever you need!
The central breakfast place, with palms and all, to which I had a view from the window of my room is just superb!",5,2019,10,15
106,Incredible hotel,"Splendid hotel in Central London. The rooms are elegant, spacious and comfortable, the staff is incredible, great spa and swimming pool, excellent breakfast. Very child friendly. This hotel is a real gem and is worth every penny",5,2019,10,15
106,1 star for poor customer support ,"Ordered the same room as before, upon arrival placed placed in a dark room with an odd smell on the 2nd floor, right on the back elevator.  (I’m here on meetings, and traveling with wife, toddler and a boy, so needed the space to prepare) 

This room was maybe half the size of the standard family room we’ve stayed in before, and was missing the living room area (a whole 2-3 sitter couch, full glass table and another couch and hallway table, basically a whole section) and I’m not mentioning “the view”

Reception tried to explain “it’s a different setup” we wouldn’t have it and after a short discussion there was a room ready “early tomorrow morning”,  she said they will be in touch and will
come by to collect the luggage (we flew in from California, jet lag an all, so wasn’t super convenient, but was appreciated) I accepted. 

At that point I asked if a manager could please contact me about our experience (it started way before through our online order that required 5(!) calls and call backs.) They said no problems and we settled on 5pm the next day.

My wife and baby made other arrangements for the night and we waited... 

long story short, there was no contact until I called them again the next day at 2pm! 

An hour later we were in the room we actually ordered and paid for as a family.  There was never any call from the manager (this is the main reason for the 1 star, this is unacceptable behavior) this is almost a $3,000 stay, and not a first one for us with them.

We have stayed here before and are checking out tomorrow morning, and overall we travel to London quite often (only discovered it on our previous trip a few months back) in a city like London for a hotel like this, the bar should simply be higher.  Never leave a paying customer waiting. 

In a world filled with TA, Google, Yelp, Expedia and others, voices are amplified, positive (as most of our reviews are) but also negative experiences.

Back to enjoying the rest of our trip🙏",1,2019,10,15
106,Amazing elegance,"Everything tip top. Perhaps some of the corridors could be decorated differently to allow navigation and  ease of finding your room.
Do try the breakfast. Superb selection of fantastic foods. Even lemon and chocolate cake.",5,2019,10,15
106,Wonderful Hotel!,"We stayed at the Landmark for a large meeting and couldn't have been happier! The accommodations are wonderful, location very convenient to the subway and shopping districts, and the restaurants excellent. In addition, the Concierge staff had at least one Golden Key concierge (maybe they have more). This added up to a wonderful week.",5,2019,10,14
106,My new favorite hotel in London,"The Landmark will be my permanent base of operations during future stays in London.  If you're an American who doesn't know much about London, it's a great place to stay due to the fact that the Marylebone Station is right behind the hotel.  You have complete access to the city via the Underground and really never need to use a cab. (Fun fact: the Marylebone station is the one featured in the opening to the Beatles' ""Hard Days Night"" film in 1964)  The rooms are shockingly big for an urban setting.  Much bigger than a NYC or Boston city hotel.  The staff exudes British hospitality and the neighborhood is safe and full of dining options.  (This is also the property that Disney puts it's UK tours in, so you know it's been a well-vetted hotel)",5,2019,10,14
106,Fantastic Hotel,"Super Hotel if you are staying in London ideal if you are likely to shop in Oxford Street. Treat  yourself to afternoon tea, expensive however very delicious. The room we had was very spacious not sure if we were given an upgrade but it was a delightful bedroom.My wife and I stayed two nights as we attended the 35th anniversary of Born Free.All the staff were very friendly. Pleasant swimming  pool and Sauna if you want to relax.",5,2019,10,11
106,Fabulous birthday brunch,"Something special, really a fabulous treat we did the afternoon brunch and you can not fault the service, the drinks are constantly refilled,  the quality of the food outstanding absolutely everything you could think of. After every plate was finished with The table is cleared and replacement cutlery appears.
No birthday balloons allowed and after the visit I totally agree as escaped balloons would spoil the view and be unretrievable . 
We went as a party of six has a lovely round table on the side, definitely worth a revisit. ",5,2019,10,09
106,Perfect for my honeymoon ,This was sincerely the best ending possible for our honeymoon. We have stayed in this wonderful hotel for two nights and we enjoyed every moment. Thanks to all the hotel staff and direction for kindness and attentiveness. I can say your hotel is one of the best memories of our honeymoon.,5,2019,10,09
106,Birthday Break,"We stayed for 2 nights in September for both mine and my husbands birthday. On arrival we were wished happy birthday by the reception staff which was a lovely touch, we had a lovely room overlooking the inside garden, in the room was a Birthday cake another lovely touch! The room was spotless well maintained during our stay. The spa was lovely and I had the whole place to myself for an hour on Friday afternoon which was wonderful, the staff are super friendly, amazingly polite and noting is to much trouble, loved the giant comfy bed, only Criticism was the standard of the douvet , very thin and flatI have stayed in loads of five star hotels In London but this is now one of my favourites, make sure you visit the mirror bar, very cosy and the cocktails are amazing.",5,2019,10,09
106,Outstanding Hotel,"Visit 2 weekends ago, and ended up having the brunch, thanks to Kamil, the food is fantastic along with the staff of the Landmark, my 3rd visit here, and they all go out of their way to make you feel special, all interactions with all of the staff consistently do this, Bravo the Landmark Hotel",5,2019,10,09
106,Celebratory afternoon tea,"Classic afternoon tea experience in the most impressive atrium. However, unlike other high profile venues, you aren't rushed through and there is plenty of space between the tables. Huge selection of teas to choose from, endless sandwiches and loads of cakes. Skip lunch and dinner, you won't need them. 

This was a visit only for my mother's birthday tea, we didn't stay at the hotel.",5,2019,10,08
106,"Such a shame, Not so good this time !","Sorry to say not so good this time around. We were up in the 6th floor. So rooms a lot smaller & quite cramped. Room was freezing. (On both nights) I needed to go out & get thicker pj’s ! I did ask about this & said they would send someone up?? 
Breakfast is fab as before, so no problems there, 
Broken blinds on windows !? ( in a hotel like this?!?) flaking wallpaper!?! 
the chamber maids also broke my phone charger by yanking it out of a socket, so a bit annoyed about that. & left biscuits, coffee refills in the sink by the toilet??Also been over charged by £200 on my bank statement!! Which I now need to sort out. Not sure I would bother again. What a difference to last time .. such a shame. (Not cheap to stay here) just been charged £848 for 2 nights, so shouldn’t have any problems don’t you think ?....",2,2019,10,08
106,Highly satisfied - would certainly go back!,I spent two nights at the Landmark and left the hotel feeling very satisfied. I was offered an amazing and very spacious room and was very impressed by the staff who felt genuinely service-minded and really wanted to make my stay as memorable as possible. I would certainly recommend this hotel to all my friends.,5,2019,10,04

106,My first time here ,"This was my first time here in landmark London and I really had amazing time , the staff and the warm atmosphere make it even a wonderful experience. I love the setup of the rooms , decoration , smells and most importantly the cleanliness. For sure, this will be one of my first choices when I visit London. 

",5,2019,09,30
106,Favourite place in the world,"I have stayed at this hotel 4 times already this year and dined hear many more.

The food is amazing and the staff are so friendly.

 I would highly recommend the Afternoon tea at approx. £80.00pp  for couples or a gift for someone. they come round and replenish the tea and sandwiches unlike other places and the treat section is scrumptious. they change in season and made lovely Easter treats / cakes this year.
We have also dinned at the hotel over the Christmas holiday season and the décor is something out of Home-Alone just magical!! 

The rooms are very specious I have had the pleasure of staying in a standard, king and also suite at this hotel for a Birthday surprise this year and each rooms is superb.

Dining in Winter Garden or the great central the food is amazing from just snacks or a 3 course meal it can be pricy but being in London you get a lot for your money with this hotel.",5,2019,09,30
106,Best stay in London!,"I stayed at the hotel for my weekend in London, and i've honestly never see and experience something like this in my entire life.
The entrance, the design, the service, the food, everything was of extremely high standard.
I strongly recommend this hotel for a luxurious stay in Central London, and there's not even the need to look for other places to eat as the restaurants offer incredible options - and there's a SPA as well!
I will book this again for next time I'll be in London",5,2019,09,29
106,Cocktail Masterclass: Amazing experience at one of London best luxury Hotel,"We spent a wonderful afternoon, first welcomed by a glass of champagne at the mirror bar.

Once finished, we move to the Great Central for a three course delicious and sofisticated dinner.

Highly recommend!",5,2019,09,28
106,Don’t Say I Didn't Warn You,"This is NOT what you call 5 star. The shabby bed room was a huge disappointment and the bathroom even worse. Our tea and coffee cupboard have one single sachet of coffee and two small milk capsules. One packet of biscuits and an empty packet, all this for a double room ? The bath was dirty and the combination of handles, one of which was broken, couldn’t be deciphered to fill the bath at all. Cleaning staff shouting at each other in some language or other right outside our door made a long lie in impossible. Just a horrible stay.",2,2019,09,28
106,TOP 5 Star Hotel London,"The Landmark London, is an outstanding hotel, having spent four nights this week, i have to say TOP 5 STAR....   by far my best stay.

Every team memeber I met was engaging, and impecable, the Winter Garden was perfct for breakfast, we had drinks in 222 bar. 

My room was absolutly amazing, I undersarnd all the  rooms and suits have been remodeled, the cleanliness was impecable, and the lighting throughout the hotel was so soft and inviting.

From Check in ot check out, was beyond imepcable.

My only regret, I did not have time ot visit the Mirror bar, so wil have to return...

Thank you Landmark team for a wonderful week!

Totally the best hotel in London.........",5,2019,09,27
106,Best cocktail masterclass in London,"We’ve attended the hotel’s cocktail masterclass in August, and it was an incredible experience.

We’ve been welcomed with a glass of champagne on arrival, followed by some of the best cocktails we’ve ever tasted. 

The staff were incredibly professional as well as fun, and they were keen to answer all our questions around the drinks and the history of the hotel. 

We made three cocktails each, one with a gin base, one with rum and one with tequila, and the guys were really patient explaining and showing us the whole process.

This was followed by a three course meal at Great Central, one of the hotel’s restaurant, where we had fantastic food!

An experience we strongly recommend!

106,Simply superb,"Having got married at The Landmark last year we decided to come back for our wedding anniversary.   

All I can say is that the stay was simply wonderful, beautiful room ready on arrival, thoughtful anniversary cards in the room to the chocolate covered strawberries (which were delicious) and champagne.  Perfect.

Nothing was too much trouble for the whole weekend. The service was amazing , the hotel is always such a relaxed environment. I have been to many central London hotels but most seem all hustle and bustle where as the Landmark always feels chilled and relaxed , which helps me chill and relax. I cannot recommend highly enough for great service, lovely interior and if you have never experienced sitting in the winter garden and taking in the view then you really must...",5,2019,09,10
106,Outstanding luxury hotel and rooms,"We stayed at The Landmark for a night including a charity dinner at the hotel.  The arrival and reception was very luxury professional with a smile.   Nothing was too much trouble.
The room was fabulous.  A huge bed and wall to wall luxury.  Lovely view of the central atrium.  Bathroom was spacious and well appointed.  There was a safe in the cupboard, but we did not use it.
Had lunch on the garden terrace.  Food and drinks were superb, though a little pricey.  Cocktails in the Great Central bar are highly recommended, though we did not eat therfe.
A great location for walking around central London.  Had a very pleasant walk around Regents Park and might have visited the Sherlock Holmes museum in Baker Street if the queues were shorter.
Highly recommended for a luxury, relaxing stay in central London.",5,2019,09,09
106,Afternoon Tea,"I came here 15 years ago and it was a great experience. I went yesterday for my birthday and The Landmark did not disappoint.

Thank you for making my birthday special.",5,2019,09,08
106,Excellent breakfast,"Went for a mid-week breakfast “date”.  Wonderful fresh buffet serving traditional English breakfast as well as international dishes.  The dishes were replenished constantly right up to when they close.  The tea is honestly the best in any hotel in Britain- the fruit was perfect - bacon crispy - staff  charming and helpful. Very pretty surroundings with comfortable chairs. A really lovely way to start the day.

106,An oasis of calm & tranquil luxury,"We recently stayed at the Landmark London for 5 nights as part of a larger holiday through Europe & this stay was certainly one of the highlights of the trip. The rooms are very spacious & calming with many luxuries like the Molton Brown toiletries & the fabulous quality bed linen on the oversized bed. The staff are delightful throughout the hotel, from the restaurants to reception to the cheerful doormen to the room attendants - all really friendly & charming. We enjoyed the varied menu in the Winter Garden which has a tremendous ambiance & loved the cocktail selection in the Mirror Bar. And the location is sensational - there's loads to do in this area with some great cafes & restaurants within walking distance & the tube station is right there too, so it's a great base to explore London from. We will certainly stay here again when we next visit London - once you come through the doors it's like an oasis of calm & tranquility from the hustle & bustle outside. Thank you everyone.",5,2019,09,06

106,Enchanting Anniversary Surprise ,"I was treated to a overnight stay at the Landmark London to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Wow, what a beautiful hotel, you can feel the history of the building all around you and the decor accentuates and transforms this stunning hotel. The rooms are luxurious and spotlessly clean. All the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Afternoon tea in the Winter Garden was a wonderful experience. Ended our evening with late night drinks in the Mirror Bar, the cocktails were the best I’ve ever had! ",5,2019,09,05
106,A Stay To Remember,"Staying at The Landmark Hotel in London has become a very essential part of my travel to The UK. The luxury standards in this hotel are beyond any imagination!! The level of comfort is unmatched in any other luxury hotel in that area ( at least to my own knowledge) !! During my several stays in this fabulous hotel has helped me create a unique relationship with the staff who are already very kind and helpful!! 
The Landmark will stay a very important stop for me whenever I visit London",5,2019,09,04

A great setting to create memories.😃",5,2019,09,03
106,Serene and calm....really amazing cheeseboard,The set lunch is fantastic and the service is first class. The cheese course was so fantastic that we returned one evening for just that which we had downstairs by a roaring fire with jazz playing in the background. Highly recommended!!,4,2019,09,03
106,Oasis of Luxury,"My family, partner and I have been coming here for years. The team have always made us feel welcome and given us the best experience, hence the returns. Kamal is a wonderful person and always takes the time to remember us, come over and have a chat, a true asset to the hotel and a paragon of excellence.
5* in every regard from location to hospitality. Stay here!",5,2019,09,01
106,Birthday meal,"What a gem we’ve found- fabulous decor with a live pianist and such friendly yet professional staff. Fabulous food and wine with a lovely birthday cake and singing to my husband for his birthday treat. Thanks and we look forward to our return visit.
",5,2019,08,31
106,Mr and Mrs A Marsh,"Our annual visit to this wonderful hotel. Great location, wonderful attentive staff (special mention to Gregory) who was exceptional. Made to feel very welcome. Room excellent, extremely comfortable bed and lovely breakfast that set us up for the day. A truly beautiful hotel. Only wished we could have stayed longer.",5,2019,08,30
106,Sophisticated afternoon tea ☕️,"Booked afternoon tea for my nans 70th birthday.
The service was great and the sandwiches, cakes plus tea were Also. Went for the recommended vanilla tea which didn’t disappoint.
All in all a nice day out with the family.",4,2019,08,26
106,Had a good time in Grand Central,"The staffs greeted us nicely when we went in. The drinks were nice. Especially the cocktails!! And when we don’t know which main to choose, Simone and Matis gave us the recommendations. And the recommendations were really nice!! We had the lamb, sea bass and the linguine!! In the middle of the meal, Alexandra came to ask if everything’s alright. We felt very welcomed by them and had a really good night today!!",5,2019,08,23
106,Could not be better,"From the largest to the smallest detail, everything about the Landmark evidences a vanishing era of elegance thoughtfully and carefully brought up-to-date.  Rooms are large and well-appointed.  Service from all members of staff is friendly and efficient.  Dining in the central atrium was a highlight of our trip.  Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2019,08,20
106,Luxury is the only proper description....,"The room we were in at the Landmark was--by far--the largest we have ever had outside the U.S. And it was lovely as well.The hotel is a block from Marleybone Station, so a great location for getting anywhere else you'd like. But the hotel's quality is what really counts here. Good breakfast, lovely bar, and a fine dinner in the atrium. And, I must add, friendly staff--particularly a very helpful concierge desk.  Sorry to post this so long after the stay, but we've been traveling since.",5,2019,08,20
106,Spectacular for my wedding reception and overnight,"This hotel is grand. The service is impeccable.

We got married at the Old Marylebone Town Hall across the street and walked to The Landmark Hotel for stand-up drinks and hors d'oeuvre at Great Central on the ground floor. The wedding party was only 12 people and we fit perfectly into the Great Central bar/ ante room, with a long high table and a mix of tall and short chairs.

Paulina met me when we arrived and confirmed the drinks and food arrangements, as well as discretely checked in with me during our reception, which ensured our reception was enjoyable. Alexandra was our lead server. She managed our reception with confident and friendly professionalism. Alexandra worked in small teams to hand serve our hors d'oeuvre in waves that was seamless and unobtrusive. In short, the service at Great Central was flawless.

We stayed overnight in the Marylebone Suite and it was wonderful. The windows overlooked to bright courtyard area. The lounge area is spacious and the bathroom is enormous with a tub and a shower that can both easily fit two. The king bed was *very* firm.

I highly recommend this hotel. I also highly recommend Great Central restaurant for a drink and a bite, whether for locals or if you are visiting the area.",5,2019,08,17
106,A unique experience ,"I’ve left this review rather late (considering I was at this hotel last month) but time cannot dilute the brilliantness of the hotel. From start to finish, I had nothing but a positive experience. The staff were not only friendly but very helpful when helping myself and my family in relation to many things such as carrying luggage. Rooms were spacious and stunning. I guess the only problem was the small gym but for any gym user, the fitness centre does suffice. I was fortunate to witness my sister getting married at this eye catching venue and I must say the venue was a huge factor in ensuring the wedding was special. A huge thank you to all the helpful staff at the Landmark Hotel. I will be back. ",5,2019,08,15
106,Faded grandeur offset by excellent service,"HOTEL - The Landmark is a faded grand hotel with all the effort going into keeping the public areas looking nice, but rather shabby carpets and old lifts and infrastructure in the hotel. As you walk along the corridors you'll see scuffed doors, tired fixtures and fittings.  I stayed two nights in an executive room, which was 50 sq m and spacious. The aircon was old and loud and semi-effective.  The bathroom was very spacious and the whole room very clean.  The bed seemed to have a new and very firm mattress. So it seems as though the staff are really doing the best they can with an old legacy property that needs a thorough back to bones refurb.

SPA - I had a massage in the basement spa - typically do whenever I stay in a hotel with a spa - I would say it was of above average quality and typical hotel price

VALET PARKING - be aware that if you book parking with JustPark (which is a good idea as then your space is guaranteed and its much cheaper) you will need to drop off your luggage at the valet entrance but then drive the car down the garage yourself as the doormen aren't insured to drive JustPark cars.",3,2019,08,12
106,Great moment in the garden terrace.,"I went to the Garden terrace to work and have some drink at the same time. Thanks to Alexis and Jowce I spent a very great moment, their professionalism and perfect service made me happy.  I recommend !",5,2019,08,09
106,Great location,"Easy to find and centrally located, right next to the station. 

Lovely building. Rooms clean and modern. Service was friendly and responsive. 

Breakfast was very good with a satisfactory variety of hot and cold offerings to pick from.  

Recommended.",5,2019,08,07
106,Landmark in London,"We love The Landmark - brilliantly located, with Marylebone Station directly at the back door. Lovely spacious, bright and super comfortable rooms, gorgeous atrium for breakfast/lunch dining and impeccable service. Special mention must be made of Rupert, the doorman at the hotel entrance on the station side - always smiling, friendly and super knowledgeable about cricket! (Copped a bit of a bagging about some sandpaper issue though!)",5,2019,08,06
106,Excellent bar,We went to the bar of Landmark London just to have a drink. We were served by SAKIS who took care of us in a very professional way without being intrusive. The cocktail was tasty and tge place looks really funcy nut condortable. I defenetely recommend this place!,5,2019,08,06
106,Chelsea,"We checked in to visit the famous show again. This place is really top drawer. Excellent food and wine. Very clean and comfortable. Great spa.

The breakfast will take some believing.

It really is as good as anywhere. Very good with the kids too.",5,2019,08,05
106,Perfection!,"One of my favourite Hotels in London. Their staff makes you feel at home at every moment. Their attention to detail is amazing! Simply the best! 

Events in this Hotel are well organised and their staff really makes it possible.

Brunch on Sundays is a must when visiting London.",5,2019,08,04
106,Family Time ,"The service at this hotel was excellent and efficient.
The receptionist at the hotel was pleasant and helpful and did try to assist with everything we had asked. 
The rooms are spacious with enough room to put our 4 large suitcase and also move around. 
The toilet is spacious with a separate WC. 
The only thing that needs improvement is the shower as it did not have much pressure in the water. 
The concierge were very helpful and knowledgeable. 
I would stay in this hotel again and recommend it to anyone. 
",4,2019,08,04
106,We will be back!,Fantastic again. The ambience in the middle of London is hard to beat. The staff is very attentive and accommodating. Culinary wishes remain unfulfilled. A highly recommended experience if you want to experience British tea-time culture.,5,2024,07,13
106,Excellent🤩,"Exceptional hotel with special 

Service, especially Rupert was very helpful 

and likeable!❤️

The location is perfect for exploring London!

We will be back!

Very close is the subway station, so you can 

Good mobility!

106,Excellent hotel,"Very nice hotel, great location near Baker Street tube station. Breakfast is served in the winter garden, a truly welcoming bright space, quality products. Friendly and helpful staff. The room is very large and well furnished.",5,2024,04,22
106,High tea at Landmark,"The Landmark Hotel in London not only offers exquisite accommodation, but also stands out for its outstanding and attentive service. The dedicated staff goes beyond expectations to ensure guests have an unforgettable stay. We would like to say a big thank you to all the staff, but especially to Sulfikar and Alina for this excellent high tea experience.",5,2024,02,22
106,Pretty but without soul,"It's a shame, actually. The facilities and infrastructure would make it one of the really good hotels in London. Beautiful rooms, wonderfully comfortable beds, etc. However, the service lacks that touch of warmth that makes guests feel at home and welcome. Conclusion: Pretty but somewhat soulless place.",4,2024,01,06
106,Gutes Stadthotel,"Schönes Stadthotel. Lage ist sehr zentral, sodass vieles fussläufig ist. Die U-Bahn-Station ist auch direkt gegenüber.
Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und schön eingerichtet. Stil: very british. Leider sind die Zimmer etwas hellhörig.
Auch die allgemeinen Räumlichkeiten im Hotel sind sehr geschmackvoll und schön. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam.
Mit Hallenbad, Gym, Sauna, etc gibt es auch viele Möglichkeiten, sich nach einem anstrengenden Tag in der Stadt, zu entspannen. 
Das Hotel ist definitiv zu empfehlen!",4,2023,07,09
106,Una delle piû belle strutture di Londra,"Albergo molto bello in un palazzo storico nel centro di Londra.
La hall é spettacolare, una sorta di giardino invernale ricavato dalla copertura del patio interno.
Le camere sono belle e pulite anche se andrebbero aggiornate dal punto di vista tecnologico: non ci sono prese usb e apparecchi da collegare in bluetooth.
Unico vero neo della nostra esperienza é stata la colazione, in quanto ogni mattina si formava una coda di 20 min. prima di poter raggiungere il tavolo.
Servizio molto attento e cordiale.",4,2023,05,24
106,Buono ma fare più attenzione,"Ho soggiornato due notti in una camera executive, sicuramente ampia rispetto alla media, ma con alcune migliorie da apportare: l’arredamento è costituito da pochi mobili, il che che la rende un po’ vuota, i colori dei muri un po’ tristi, il bagno seppure ampio ha bisogno di essere rimodernato, toglierei la vasca sostituendola con una più comoda e funzionale doccia e sostituirei alcune piastrelle ormai ingiallite.
In un hotel di questo livello mi aspetterei che la stanza venisse rigovernata anche prima della notte, magari lasciando un piccolo pensiero dolce sul cuscino, ma ciò non avviene.
Inoltre il primo giorno lasciato la stanza alle 9 del mattino e al mio ritorno in hotel alle 15 non era ancora stata rifatta: più attenzione al personale del piano o assumerne un numero adeguato.
Buona la colazione, varia e di qualità.
In conclusione un buon albergo che per diventare eccellente deve ancora lavorarci.",4,2023,05,22
106,No te sientes bienvenido,"Hemos estados alojados en familia varios días. El recibimiento al llegar al hotel fue de lo peor que hemos tenido en mucho tiempo, solo estaban interesados en que hiciéramos el pago de las habitaciones nada más llegar. El personal de recepción y concierge no es sumamente amable como se esperaría en un hotel de esta categoría. Como puntos positivos remarcar el gran tamaño de las habitaciones, la limpieza y la puntualidad en la limpieza tanto por las mañanas como en el turn down. La situación, con para de metro justo en frente de la salida trasera del hotel, es estupenda.  El motivo de mi baja puntuación es la baja relación calidad atención-precio.",3,2023,04,21
106,Un gran hotel de lujo para negocios y disfrutar de Londres,"La habitación es muy amplia con vistas al patio interior. El gym y la piscina está fenomenal. El servicio muy atento,tanto la gente de recepcion como los camareros. La habitacion con baño y ducha y con amenities diversas. En definitiva un hotel de lujo pero pagas por lo que recibes.",5,2023,03,05
106,Ausgangspunkt für London-Explorer,"Nach einem freundlichen Empfang am frühen Morgen konnten wir das Pre-Checkin erledigen. Das Hotel rief uns an, als die Zimmer dann bereit waren. Ein Service, der nicht überall klappt. Die Zimmer sind stilvoll eingerichtet und entsprechen dem 5-Sterne Haus. Das Frühstück im Wintergarten entspricht der englischen Tradition und schmeckt lecker. SPA besteht aus Fitnessraum und Indoor Pool und lädt zum Entspannen ein. Eine tolle Adresse Nähe Baker Street und Abbey Road, gut erschlossen mit U-Bahn und Bus zum Piccadilly Circus.",5,2022,11,04
106,Estupendo hotel mantiene su tradicion,"hotel que ya conocía, muy bueno , precio calidad adecuada, es un hotel de gran trayectoria, pero siempre hay muchos eventos, que no incomodan , pero hacen mucho ruido, 
Personal del desayuno sorprendente y bajo mucho el restaurante que the grill
recomendable",5,2022,10,22
106,Mary Kay international travel,"Un hotel fantástico, elegante y en una ubicación privilegiada. Todo el personal pendiente de nosotros y siempre regresar de un paseo y ser recibidos con una sonrisa es magnífico! Lo recomendamos😁……..",5,2022,09,03
106,Grossartiges Hotel,"Meine Freundin und ich waren auf einem Kurzurlaub in London und verbrachten drei Nächte im Landmark. Der Aufenthalt in diesem wunderbaren Hotel war ein Abenteuer für sich! Ein aussergewöhnlich freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal, ein excellentes Frühstücksbuffet und ein sehr toll ausgestattetes Hotel machte unseren Urlaub zu einem Erlebnis. Der Spa Bereich und die Behandlungen waren wunderbar. Ganz besonders möchte ich mich bei George, Richard und Mars bedanken. Ich lies das Zimmer zum Geburtstag meiner Freundin ganz kurzfristig dekorieren- es sah wunderschön aus! Die 3 Herren waren stets bemüht und freundlich. Es war von Anfang bis Ende ein wunderschöner Aufenthalt und wird uns noch ewig in Erinnerung bleiben. Ich hoffe wir können dieses Erlebnis bald wiederholen. Ganz toll liebes Landmark Team!!",5,2022,06,02
106,Un bellissimo hotel,"Abbiamo fatto una conferenza in questo hotel quindi la mia recensione si basa su quello che ho vissuto e non sul pernottamento che è avvenuto in un altro hotel.
L'impressione è ottima. Gli spazi comuni e le sale riunioni ricordano il lusso vittoriano di fine 800, inizio 900. Quell'opulenza ormai dimenticata che però fa piacere ritrovare in occasioni speciali, come questa.
Il pranzo è la cosa che mi ha convinto di meno.",5,2022,02,27
106,Excepcional,"Desde la llegada con Gemma al desayuno con Rosario y Jose debo decir que el servicio es inmejorable.
La habitacion y la comida perfectas
Sin duda volveremos y recomendaremos este hotel en Londres. 
No quiero olvidarme de la Consejería.Carlos hizo que las maletas llegarán a la habitación casi antes que nosotros",5,2020,02,15
106,Schönes Zentrales Stadthotel,Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral mitten in der Innenstadt. Das Hotel verfügt über einen schönen Spabereich. Auch das Frühstück ist sehr gut. Das Zimmer war etwas laut und leider im Innenhof. Da besteht Luft nach oben.,5,2020,02,15
106,Erstklassiges Hotel alter Schule,"sehr grosse Zimmer, perfekter Service (bis auf wenige Ausnahmen an der Rezeption), opulentes Frühstücksbuffet, guter Zimmerservice, Zufahrt nicht ganz einfach für nicht-wissende Taxifahrer, insgesamt sehr empfehlenswert",4,2020,01,13
106,Das schönste Hotel in London,"Das Hotel,  insbesondere der Indoorpalmengarten ist wunderschön, eine Oase inmitten von London, perfekt gelegen in Marylebone in der Nähe der Baker Street und direkt an de4r Marylebone Station. Die Zimmer sind gemütlich und sauber, das Frühstücksbüffet ist reichhaltig, alles ist sehr stilvoll, ",5,2020,01,08
106,Bellissimo giardino interno,"Gli ambienti dell'albergo sono molto curati , particolare l' arredamento, molto belle le stanze.Molto suggestivo il giardino interno dove si può fare una colazione ricca e molto varia.Non dimenticate di prenotare la colazione in giardino perchè c'è una grande richiesta!",5,2019,12,30
106,Sehr empfehlenswert!,"Ein wunderschönes Hotel mit sehr nettem Service, tollem Frühstück und einer ausgezeichneten Tea-Time. Wir waren sehr zufrieden und haben uns wie zuhause gefühlt. Auch die Lage ist mehr als empfehlenswert, so zentral gelegen, dass wir die meisten Aktionen komplett zu Fuß erledigen konnten. 
Vielen Dank, für die wunderschöne Zeit, wir haben es sehr genossen und kommen gerne wieder!",5,2019,12,09
106,"Excelente combinación ubicación, servicio, instalaciones","Hotel clásico, ubicado enfrente la estación de Marylebone, dispone de un personal totalmente implicado en hacer  nuestra estancia inolvidable, el hotel está en un perfecto estado de mantenimiento y conservación.  La limpieza de las habitaciones es impresionante , el desayuno continental es muy completo, en definitiva mi hotel en Londres.
No es la primera vez que me hospedo en este hotel pero siendo hotelero también me confieso admirador de la gestión de personal de este hotel.
Totalmente recomendable.",5,2019,11,28
106,Noche perfecta,"Fuimos a celebrar mi 30 cumpleaños. Todo fue perfecto. Sobre todo la habitación, cuidado 100% por cada  detalle, limpieza y confort perfect@s.

106,Struttura imponente ed elegante,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo con la mia famiglia. Ognuno di noi ne è rimasto colpito per L efficienza del personale, la cortesia del desk, le ricche colazioni e la pulizia delle camere. Inoltre, la zona di residenza è centrale ed elegante, molto ben servita dalla rete di autobus e treni.",5,2019,09,21
106,splendido soggiorno,"abbiamo soggiornato per 5 giorni in questo hotel ,  in cui c'è uno splendido giardino d'inverno dove gustare una fantastica colazione. Attrezzati anche per celiaci , camere un po' anguste . Posizione eccezionale , di fronte la metro",4,2019,08,22
106,Merita,"Personale cordiale e pronti a soddisfare ogni nostra richiesta. Camera carina e in ordine. Colazione molto abbondante, tipicamente ""british"".  Non manca nulla al Landmark sicuramente se torno a Londra ci torno! ",5,2019,08,18
106,comodissimo,"Ottima sistemazione a Londra. Camera familiare spaziosa, molto ben arredata, luminosa. Colazione eccellente e molto ricca. Personale gentilissimo e altamente professionale. Una menzione particolare per Chiara, giovane italiana addetta alla reception, che ci ha accolto in hotel e ci ha dato tutte le dritte necessarie perchè la nostra permanenza al Landmark fosse la più gratificante possibile.
Torneremo sicuramente.
