129,Fantastic Experience!!,"Strongly recommend staying at The Ampersand Hotel!!! Here's why...

First, the surprise of rose petals on the bed with the number 10, along with some chocolates AND champagne, BLEW us away!!! We've never had a surprise like that so it was appreciated so much!! What an incredible way to start our anniversary trip!

Secondly, the staff was very accommodating!!! Any time we had a question or request, it was taken care of immediately. As someone from the States and how fast paced our culture is, your staff was better than any hotel staff we've experienced. 

MAJOR shoutout to the bartender who gave us tons of help and tips for navigating the city! I did ask him his name but it's escaping me...

The hotel was always clean and housekeeping took care of our room perfectly. 

The food and drinks were all delicious, very impressed with the new cocktail menu!

I can't think of many downsides other than I wish the exercise room was a bit bigger :)",5,2024,10,14
129,A week in London,"For the first time we went on a city trip for our summer holiday. We are a family of three (1 child, 8 years old) and we booked a stay at The Ampersand Hotel in the Deluxe Studio room.

Minor things:
- Wooden floors can be noisy
- Tube runs under the hotel which is also a bit noisy although it didn't affect our sleep

Positives:
- Really great hotel with amazing afternoon tea options
- Location. Practically next to Natural History & Science Museum (also Victoria & Albert is nearby) and tube station South-Kensington (District, Circle & Piccadilly lines).
- Children friendly

Overall we had an amazing vacation, in part due to the hotel & its staff.",5,2024,08,01

129,Weekend in London,"We had a lovely weekend stay at the Ampersand. We stayed as a family in a suite and it was perfect . The hotel is really kid-friendly and my girls had a lovely welcome with treats and drawing books in the room on arrival .  My 2 year old twins really enjoyed the Jurassic afternoon tea in their restaurant as well .

The hotel couldn‚Äôt be in a better location - close to the tube and to many attractions. The staff have been really helpful and accommodating . I will definitely stay again next time we are in London .",5,2024,10,13

129,Exceptional Service and Facilities,Don‚Äôt pass this one up! The staff really put this quality hotel over the top.

129,Boutique Hotel - The only place to stay in South Kensington,"I absolutely love the Ampersand Hotel. From arrival and being greeted at the front door to a heartfelt cheerio on check out, the hotel oozes style with a real personal connection to the guests. This is my fourth visit to the hotel, a big thanks to Catarina Antunes, who always makes it feel so special when we stay. Housekeeping were undeniably superb as ever, from delivering items to the room at a minutes notice to the cleanliness of all of all areas in the hotel. Well done to them. Thank you very much for another tip top stay in South Kensington, you are the very best at what you do.",5,2024,10,05

129,The Ampersand.. both thumbs up with a smile üòÉ,"Beautiful & cosy 5 star boutique hotel , only 5 floor very quite & rather chic. The color schemes & furniture are simply amazing, you feel warmth once you enter. 
Small lobby .. yet again small hotel but adjacent to the lobby is the drawing room where their famous afternoon tea is served.

The staff are all well trained & very professional, my check in took literally less than 5 min.
Concierge takes you up to the room & explains every little detail about the room. Their attention to detail & your pre arrival requests are spot on. 

Very family friendly, you see families & kids there all day either in the drawing room or the restaurant in the lower ground floor. 

Didn‚Äôt get the Chance to try the food as I out most of the time but i am sure it‚Äôs delicious.",5,2024,09,26

The staff were excellent and the room and hotel are very chic.  
Very comfortable with an excellent bed.",5,2024,09,26
129,Not at all a luxury hotel of the world! Go elsewhere,"The hotel is well located, majority of the staff is very helpful and friendly. Now here is where the problem starts. Majority of the rooms are facing a wall! They do not show this on the website. We called Amex to complain about the underwhelming room for a so called luxury hotel of the world and Amex fine hotel collection. Amex is helpful and called the hotel for a resolution. The hotel literally lied to them saying that we requested a quiet room and hence we were given the room facing a well! 
We had other family members, one of them had a room with a nice view and they asked the bell boy if this was a good room, they were told that yes this is the best, the rest are facing a wall! Is it a good hotel? Yes. Is it a luxury hotel of the world? Absolutely no. There are many other hotels in the same price range where you can get better value for money, and the management will not lie to Amex when they call for a resolution. Very disappointed, and never staying here again. 
View from our ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù room with a tiny window.",2,2024,09,25
129,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for 4 nights. Although our room was relatively small, the accommodations make up for the space. Comfortable beds, your choice of pillows, free snacks and soft drinks refilled daily. The staff was friendly, food delicious and a wonderful location to get on the tube or eat in the neighborhood. ",5,2024,09,24
129,Great hotel with excellent location,"Very close to South Kensington station. Impeccable service. I had a small double room which was small but cozy, a good size for my short stay.",5,2024,09,21
129,London Visit,"This was our second stay at The Ampersand Hotel and it was wonderful again (10 years later).  The location is perfect for museums, shopping and restaurants and the Underground is very convenient even to Heathrow.  Great friendly staff and lovely rooms. ",5,2024,09,18
129,Quick Londer trip,"I found the Ampersand Hotel off the AMEX FHR section. It was a little more expensive than other hotels in the area, but i like the location to the underground and thought it would be a good choice.  Next time, i would pick something else.Nothing wrong with the hotel, the view outside was just boring.  ",5,2024,09,16
129,Good Hotel,"Great location and well priced hotel. The rooms are extremely well appointed and comfortable. It‚Äôs a good spot for a quick stop in London. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Only downside is that the lifts are not controlled by rooms keys, which for me isn‚Äôt as secure as anyone could go to any floor. Also bar service was poor, so we ended up leaving without ordering.",4,2024,09,15
129,Best boutique hotel in central London.,Pleasure. Ampersand hotel is the best smal luxury hotel in central London in our opinion. We will be back in 2025.,5,2024,09,15

129,A five star experience,This hotel was a delight to stay in!!!  We were taken care of so  beautifully by Zoab at the desk. He made sure everything was just perfect for our stay including getting us coffee before the restaurant opened. The room was quiet and clean and the restaurant staff and bartender at dinner were lovely as well. We will be back for sure! Located  in a great restaurant area with the tube a block away makes this a 5 star experience.,5,2024,09,15
129,A gem in South Kensington!,"The Ampersand is wonderful! The hotel is beautiful, has an excellent location. But, the best part is the staff! They are kind, attentive and made us feel welcome and care for. My son turned 10 during our stay and the staff made him feel celebrated with many details through the day! We will come back to The Ampersand on our next visit to London. ",5,2024,09,09
129,Exploring London,Very nice hotel. Excellent location near the South Kensington station on the Piccadilly line. Had an issue with thermostat and room was very warm. Did not receive an update and issue was not resolved. A grab bar in the tub/shower would be helpful getting in and out. ,4,2024,09,09
129,There is no finer place to stay in London,"I do not have a single fault for the Ampersand - they are quite seriously perfect and set the standard in service and care. The accommodations are beautiful and comfortable, but it's the staff that go above and beyond. Allowing a very early check-in after 24 hours of flying was simply divine of them. The food is excellent (the best room service club sandwich I've ever had - and there have been a few!). And S. Ken tube being a stonesthrow away, and the black cab rank out front means that you get where you need to be very very quickly. I will only ever stay here in London going forward - could not recommend higher.",5,2024,09,07
129,A wonderful stay at the Ampersand,"We had the most wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel, the room was perfect and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. The location is also great! ",5,2024,09,06

129,Lovely Boutique Hotel in South Kensington,"This is a lovely boutique hotel in South Kensington. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. Staff always greeted you when you left for the day and upon our return.
The tube station is across the road, which made travelling around London a breeze.
There are also small cafes and shops in the surrounding streets.",5,2024,09,02
129,"Excellent service, beautiful hotel, friendly and helpful staff,","The hotel was beautifully clean, staff extremely helpful and excellent attention to detail for those with mobility/ disability issues.  Would recommend. ",5,2024,09,01
129,Great location with even greater service and rooms,"The location cannot be beat if you want quick and efficient access to The Underground, buses and taxis. Its South Kensington location is awesome; great neighborhood with many restaurants around. Hyde Park/Kensington Palace is a 15 minute walk. Natural History Museum and the V&A Museum are also within a 10 minute walking distance.",5,2024,08,29

Every single one of the staff was extremely kind and welcoming. Also very helpful. I think the key point of this hotel is the staff. The breakfast was pretty amazing too. Such a lovely lovely hotel have been before and will go Again,5,2024,08,27
129,Wonderful as always!,"We've stayed at the Ampersand for over 10 years and we always have such a lovely time. The staff are so friendly, helpful and always go the extra mile. We usually get a suite but as we were not staying long in the room this time we opted for a deluxe double, we were delighted by how the room was arranged with a sofa at the end of the bed. They also gave us a really quiet room after requested it. We can't wait to visit again soon! ",5,2024,08,27
129,Another great stay,"As alway really clean comfortable rooms, everything you need & if there is something the front of house & other staff will try their best to help you",5,2024,08,25

129,Five star Hotel,"Thoroughly recommend this hotel, the service of the staff is excellent being discrete but attentive. The rooms were scrupulously clean and after several stays the high standard remains the same. The hotels location can‚Äôt be bettered with taxi‚Äôs tube and buses on it‚Äôs doorstep. Highly recommended.",5,2024,08,15
129,family visit,this hotel is very good located to visit our family in London. We can imagine that for a tourist the hotel is very well located in order to visit the centre of London. the room has all the facilities you need but could use a liittle bit of freshing up after 10 years.,4,2024,08,13
129,Great Hotel,Superb location with friendly staff. Comfortable and clean room with nice heated floor bathroom which had a tub and separate shower stall.,5,2024,08,10

129,Superb and ideal location,"This hotel is a gem, we spent 4 nights here and honestly everything was Triple A.   Check in, seamless!   Staff wonderful!  Our room (012) was perfect!   Bed so comfortable.  My main bugbear with hotels is poor quality showers, no worries on that score here; super pressure and great shampoo/bodywash.  Bathroom and bedroom very spacious!   Breakfast was great!   We ended each evening with a cocktail, again staff friendly and welcoming!   Location just perfect!   45 minutes from Heathrow to South Kensington, exit station at Museum and hotel literally across the road!  If l could give more than 5 stars l would",5,2024,08,06
129,Nice hotel in great location,"Recently stayed at The Ampersand Hotel as a family of 3. Hotel is in a great location - less than a minute walk from South Kensington underground station, a few minutes walk from Natural History Museum, Science Museum and V&A. Lots of places to eat nearby. Easily within walking distance to Hyde Park and Oxford Street.

The hotel is lovely. We didn't eat in the hotel but enjoyed a nice drink in the bar. Our room was lovely and very spacious - plenty of room for 3. The hotel is very family friendly and on arrival there was a kids dressing gown and slippers, kids bedding on the camp bed and sweets and hot chocolate for my son. Great way to make young guests feel special. 

Staff at check in were lovely and the water presented to us on arrival was a nice touch, having arrived in 25 degree heat!

We will definitely return to The Ampersand Hotel.",5,2024,08,06
129,London calling,"Throughly enjoyed my wonderful 2 week stay at this lovely hotel. Perfect location to access all of London, great staff, and facilities.",5,2024,08,02
129,No air con and they couldn‚Äôt care less,Air con in room did not work. A half hearted attempt to rectify it turned out to be pointless. When mentioned to staff at checkout they did not even comment or apologise. They did not seem care less!,1,2024,07,30
129,A lovely boutique hotel in great location in London,"We just love to stay at The Ampersand in London.  A quality hotel with chic and comfortable bedrooms.  The bed was sooooooooo comfy!  Tasteful decor.  And spacious bathroom with quality toiletries.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  And the hotel is in a great location with superb connections by Tube, bus or even walking into central London.  Highly recommend.  And we will certainly be staying there again on our next visit to London.",5,2024,07,29
129,"Location, Location, Location!","The Ampersand Hotel is very well located, just a short walk from South Kensington tube station and very handy if you are visiting Royal Albert Hall or the museums, Hyde park etc.
We didn‚Äôt spend much time in the hotel as we had lots of activities planned. There are lots of restaurants, places for brunch etc locally so there was no real incentive to use the hotel dining facilities and we didn‚Äôt no this occasion.
Our room was on the ground floor and we paid for a superior double. It kind of had everything as described on the website ie inspired by music, notation wallpaper, free soft drink minibar, robes etc so you can‚Äôt really complain. However it was an odd room, L shaped but with barely any room to fit the bed in ( I think it was a Queen) only one chair (admittedly a bugbear of mine) but an enormous accessible shower room but with nowhere for your toiletries. It must have originally been an accessible room but decommissioned as the emergency cords were all still visible but cut at ceiling level. There was one window looking at a brick wall, so very dark and it was next to the cleaners cupboard so noisy in the mornings. Had we not had a busy schedule or had been staying longer I might have requested a move. Not a complaint as such but just a bit of a letdown when you book direct and choose an enhanced category of room. 

",4,2024,07,28
129,Ampersand.  Insanely responsive staff.,"Ampersand.  This hotel smells delicious upon entry and is small enough that you get to know your staff whilst you're there (ie darling Abu in the bar). The bed was legit one of the best I've experienced.  Floors creak, but that's part of the charm.  They have excellent showers, insanely responsive housekeeping and room service, excellent bath products, great storage for clothes, robes and slippers.  Oh, and the location could not be better.",5,2024,07,27
129,Our Fave London Hotel,"I have to visit London every 12 weeks and I wouldn‚Äôt choose anywhere else to stay. The Ampersand is a most beautiful hotel, with fabulous friendly staff, gorgeous rooms/bathrooms, and a stunning dining room for afternoon tea. We love this hotel and will visit time and time again.",5,2024,07,24
129,Fantastic stay!,I can't say enough positive things about the staff at the Ampersand.  They are very keen to help and are all extremely pleasant.  Great location for the hotel.  Will plan on returning for sure!,5,2024,07,17

129,Great location and sumptuous comfort!,"The place to stay when luxury and comforts are your requirements. The entire hotel is beautiful, comfortable and staffed by the best people you‚Äôll meet in hospitality. The reception staff was so welcoming and only too happy to assist!
The breakfast was delicious, ready before we arrived to enjoy and was able to meet our tight schedule. They were happy to arrange our transportation and answer our questions with no further inquiries needed!",5,2024,07,10
129,A Lovely Hotel in The Perfect Location,I've stayed here before with work but got the chance to stay for a family trip and all the staff are exceptionally nice and friendly. So handy to visit the museums which are 2 minutes away and beside the tube also. ,5,2024,07,09
129,Great Boutique Hotel,"Great friendly staff, spectacular location, manager Catharina was super helpful. The non alcohol mini bar with snacks and soft drinks was free and replenished daily. The room was also cleaned daily with a turndown service in the afternoon. The room was a bit small but comparable to a boutique Hotel in NYC. The hotel was very quiet at night and so was the residential neighborhood.  We did not eat at the hotel but the restaurant was busy and lively.

The Ampersand is one minute walk to South Kensington Station on the Piccadilly and District lines.  
We took the Piccadilly line from Heathrow to South Kensington Stop about 25 minutes with NO line changes.  There were few stairs to deal with at the South Kensington Station with luggage but not extremely difficult.  Plenty of restaurants in the area  ranging from English pubs, Italian, Indian and Lebanese. The grocery store was around the corner for  water and wine.

The V&A, Science and History museums are a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  We also walked to Chelsea in 10 minutes and Knightsbridge in 15.  

As a helpful note, do your research, We saw  a guest complain that the independent private car service sent by the hotel to Heathrow charged $145 pounds. It clearly says it on the private car website.  A taxi and Uber range from  65-100 depending on time of day.  A private car service is always double even in the U.S.",5,2024,07,07
129,Excellent Location,"The Ampersand is a lovely hotel in the heart of South Kensington.  The location is ideal with the South Kensington underground station across the street and many attractions, including the V&A museum a short walk.",5,2024,07,05

129,A Splendid Residence.,"Excellent staff, comfortable rooms and a great location for the V & A , Royal Albert Hall and Natural History Museum. The residence is adjacent to South Kensington Tube Station with a direct line to Heathrow Airport. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel.",5,2024,06,26
129,Best location in a  wonderful neighborhood,The Ampersand Hotel is a very nice place to be. Very friendly and accomodating staff. The menu in the restaurant is good. The rooms are nicely decorated but rather small. If there were less decoration pillows one would profit of more room to put personal belongings whereever possible.  If the room is situated next to the elevater you can hear it running up and down. It can bother your sleep. Better check before booking.,4,2024,06,26
129,Very small rooms,Location of hotel was great but I would not stay here again.  Rooms are incredibly small and I was assigned to an accessible/handicapped room.  I asked to move but the front desk told me they were sold out.  Thrrr was no place to hang clothes and my luggage had to be kept in the bathroom due to lack of space.  Poor service and poor value,1,2024,06,21
129,Perfect location and lovely stay.,My room overlooked the street and was very quiet. I slept amazing and the staff was great. I forgot many things and they had my things sent to my next hotel. The underground and bus stops are steps away and many taxis are available. The bus systems is amazing. You can take the bus a few stops to museums and Harrods. ,5,2024,06,18
129,Wonderful hotel in terrific neighborhood!,"We only stayed one night as we were stopping over in London.   We wanted a hotel on the Picadilly Line and easily accessible to Heathrow.  the Ampersand fit the bill perfectly.  Basically across the street from the South Kensington tube and close to tons of restaurants and shops.  In two days, we squeezed in lots of great meals, a visit to the Natural History Museum and the British Museum and a stroll through Kensington Gardens.  The hotel was super comfortable.  Highlights included a big bathroom with a rain shower, heated floor and tub with a TV.  The staff was wonderful and very helpful.  Highly recommend!",5,2024,06,15
129,Wonderful stay,"Just had a fabulous stay at the Ampersand. Staff were wonderful and went above and beyond to make our stay special. Gave me lovely chocolates for my birthday too.

129,Fantastic stay!,"Absolutely lovely hotel! Steps away from the South Kensington Tube station & really close to Hyde Park, the Victoria & Albert museum. Clean, well staff who were pleasant, respectful, responded quickly to requests. Catarina made our check in smooth. My wife is Deaf and Catarina asked if we wanted devices for accessibility without our asking. 

Would absolutely recommend staying here.",5,2024,06,06
129,Wonderful Hotel,Everything about our stay at The Ampersand was wonderful.  We received a warm welcome from the staff as well as assistance with our luggage.  Our room  (deluxe studio) was spacious and spotlessly clean.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the shower worked really well with great water pressure.  We enjoyed our included breakfast at Apero and found the location just a short walk from South Kensington Station was perfect for traveling all over London.,5,2024,06,05
129,Just Splendid,"The Ampersand never fails to impress in every respect and I look forward to my next stay. The location, the welcome, the quality of service and comfort goes beyond the needs of a visitor to London. Well done The Ampersand.",5,2024,05,30

129,Location and Comfort is Everything,"I booked this hotel knowing it was a busy weekend (ie. Chelsea flower show, Chelsea in Bloom) meaning the price/night would be higher than other times of the year. I did not regret this decision. The hotel is right near the Piccadilly, District, Circle line which made it very convenient to come from LHR. We had a deluxe double room. Full disclosure: The room is small so if you have several check in sized luggage, then it could get crowded but we only had 2 carry on (US) size luggages for our 4 day visit. The bathroom is also a bit tight (ie. tight clearance just to open the door and not hitting corner or sink). With this said, as a NYer and someone that travels a lot to major cities known for smaller hotels (ie. Europe, Japan, HK) I was not bothered by this because the location is phenomenal. It's near Natural history museum and Victoria&Albert museum. It was a 15 min stroll to the end of the Chelsea in Bloom area. A great small coffee shop is nearby (hagen) but there's also more well known bakeries right across from the hotel. The hotel staff made sure we had umbrellas and opened a bunch of new ones when they ran out. They received a package for us and delivered it to our room. They got a taxi for us to go to the airport (we didn't want to deal with commuter rush during our departure with our luggage). Bed is comfortable. Shower temp and pressure were good. Overall would recommend this hotel and it's moved to the top of my London hotel list! Hoping to return next year! ",5,2024,05,23

129,A very pleasant stay,"A problem with our initial room was handled promptly and efficiently. The hotel offers excellent housekeeping; in fact all staff we encountered were most professional.
I also appreciated the espresso machine, and the yummy cookies.
The breakfast was a bit of a weak link, but not enough to detract from the overall experience.
Do try the high tea.",5,2024,05,18

129,Looking worn,"I‚Äôve stayed at the hotel multiple times. Location is fantastic, the rooms are comfortable, and the mini bar is great. Given the ever-increasing rates, however, the rooms are looking tired and need attention. Scuffed furniture, grout missing in the bathroom, broken coffee machine, etc. aren‚Äôt luxury hotel standard. I will be returning to London in the fall and will probably stay elsewhere.",3,2024,05,13
129,Location & beauty,"The staff here is so attentive, especially via email before arrival. We had a very smooth check-in process and same on checkout. Location is great, especially if you don't need to stay super central. The Piccadilly line is right out the door, making it easy to get anywhere, including Heathrow. Beautiful rooms, clean. Apero, the restaurant was not my fave dining experience. Only recommend in a pinch, but there are dozens of restaurants surrounding the hotel. Eat there instead. The Science Tea is so fun!",5,2024,05,13

The hotel is spotless, the rooms are exceptional, beds comfortable, and service top notch. I had a very minor issue in my room with a blinking light and I was able to leave my belongings in my original room and sleep in another available room to be comfortable. I was blown away by the staff and kindness here. Would absolutely recommend and return! ",5,2024,05,11

129,Fabulous start to our UK vacation,"This wonderful hotel is located perfectly in the South Kensington District. The location is incredible.  Easy walking to the Victory and Albert museum and The Natural History Museum.  The tube station is incredibly close. 

Upon checking in the front staff gave us warm greetings and very helpful in storing our luggage since we arrived at 11 AM-well before our check in time

The suite on the 5th floor was just lovely, the sitting area and bedroom were cozy and comfortable. The bathroom with its huge tub and heated floor was amazing!  The shower was the best. Walk in shower doesn't begin to describe it. You step up to the left from the door opening into easily a 6x6 open shower with a large rain shower head

 The soft drinks and water were all complementary. 

We ate one night in their restaurant which is located below street level. The food was amazing. 
 
You must try the Science Afternoon Tea. It is one-of-a-kind. 

Highly recommend staying here. We will be back",5,2024,05,01

129,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"One night was just not enough at The Ampersand. We were over the moon wit our upgrade to a suite and the room did not disappoint! We are staying as we were attending an event at the Royal Albert Hall and the location is perfect. Lots to see and do around the area but once in the Hotel, you felt like you'd escaped London. Perfect! Oh and the breakfast was exceptional. We will be back. ",5,2024,04,26

129,Another pleasant stay,It was my second stay and again it was a great place to return to after a long day out and about. If there is anything you need there is always a member of the staff there to provide help - quick and generous. ,5,2024,04,20
129,Service could not be improved it was perfect,"The hotel was great, it was just the room size and the gym size , no luggage no problem, I hate being negative about the stay because the staff were amazing 
",4,2024,04,20
129,"Good, not necessarily great.","This property is billed as a 5-star hotel and in some areas they are, but for the most part I think it would be more of a 3.5/4-star facility.

The location is the best feature for this property. It's near/close-by tons of activities (e.g. restaurants, museums, train station, etc.). To enter the hotel, you have 2-sets of 4-5 steps to climb to get to the lobby.  Being a ""5-star"" hotel, I would have assumed there would be a bellman posted at the front door to assist with luggage and such, but nothing of the sort at our arrival. Coming from a long journey and trying to shlep multiple luggages up these stairs is not fun. 

The room we stayed in was an upgrade and told to us was one of the largest.  For a European hotel, this was a spacious room and it looked like they combined 2 regular rooms to make it a suite. I would recommend booking a suite vs. a regular room.

We used the restaurant a few times and wasn't fully impressed with the service or quality of the food. It wasn't bad, but nothing really stood out either.  The buffet style ""counter service"" item on the menu is really a joke. There are no hot food items available and essentially you're paying about $25 USD for an expanded continental breakfast. I've had better choices at a Hilton Garden Inn.

The front desk staff and the bellhop (at the front desk) are very friendly and accommodating. 

Overall, not the ""5-star"" hotel experience I was expecting, especially being located in 
South Kensington...one of the more affluent areas of London. I would not consider this property for my future travels.",4,2024,04,19
129,Lovely Stay in London,"We stayed one night in The Ampersand Hotel in London and I wish we had stayed longer! It was a lovely and comfortable experience. We booked a superior double room which was a really great size especially by London standards. Everything was so clean and stylish. I loved all the special touches in the room like heated bathroom floors, complimentary drinks/snacks, toiletries, etc. The hotel location was also perfect! Right next to the South Kensington tube station. And best of all were the hotel staff who were so kind and attentive! Thank you to Phillip who helped us with our (very heavy) luggage and showed us how to work all the technology in our room! We will definitely be staying at The Ampersand Hotel again!",5,2024,04,19
129,Perfect hotel in a perfect location,"5 stars for a 5-star hotel. This is the perfect location in South Kensington. It is within walking distance of the Museum of Natural History, the Albert Hall, the Albert and Victoria Museum, Harrods, and so much more. Right out the exit from the South Kensington tube, you will not find a better location.

The room was surprisingly large for London, and the price was more than fair.  We never dined there, but we immensely enjoyed the bar and bartender.

We will return!",5,2024,04,18
129,Charming hotel on a perfect location,"We had a delightful stay at The Ampersand hotel. Our room was so comfortable and had everything we could need. The staff were so helpful and accommodating.

We look forward to returning!",5,2024,03,27

129,Best Boutique Hotel in South Kensington,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this hotel! The room, staff and housekeeping were outstanding. We booked the Deluxe Studio and the freestanding tub, heated bathroom floors and large rain shower were favorites. Although it was only 2 blocks from South Kensington tube station, the hotel was very quiet and peaceful and I looked forward to returning after a busy day sightseeing. We spent 9 nights which was longer than most stays but it flew by and we were sad to leave the Ampersand hotel. The Apero restaurant for breakfast and dinner were also really good, and I can see why it has such a high rating on Trip Advisor.",5,2024,03,19
129,Best hotel experience ever !!!,"The best experience of a hotel stay in 20 years !!

129,Excellent small hotel experince in a great part of London,I had yet another excellent stay at the Ampersand.  It is well located for the Tube and buses.  Several great museums are walking distance and there are tons of places to eat/drink/coffee nearby (the hotel has a great tea room and a very nice breakfast restaurant as well).  The rooms are clean and comfortable (nice bath tubs) and the staff is great.,5,2024,03,19
129,"Fairly good, not exceptional","I would recommend The Ampersand for the business traveler that does not need a big room but has quick accessibility to the South Kensington tube station and a good breakfast. I was disappointed by minor things: there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer, so I had to dry my hair in an awkward corner of the room. Very few mirrors, something silly that can be easily fixed. The toiletries were nice. The AC was slightly noisier than I expected. The bed was extremely comfortable and I got a great night's rest. The regular breakfast that is offered is not quite what I was expecting, but you can order a good one √† la carte, priced at 22 GBP. All in all, a good option in South Kensington, although I was expecting more.",4,2024,03,13
129,Simply The Best,"This must have been our fifth of sixth visit and it's as good as ever. We sometimes think about having a change of scene but as soon as we get to the Ampersand we remember why we love it so much. The staff are great, the hotel has a nice feel to it, the rooms are tasteful, clean and very comfortable, the food is good and the location ideal. We are always made to feel very welcome and special here, it's like a second home in London. Well be back.

129,A nightmare,"The hotel is very noisy, I didn‚Äôt sleep for three nights! 
Then, the housekeeping staff moved my bag and my ring and my earrings went to the floor. I lost one earring‚Ä¶when I reported to the Front Office, the guy called a colleague saying that I lost the earring! Is this a 5 star hotel?? No one apologised to me! ",1,2024,03,10
129,Lovely hotel but restaurant is in need of improvement,The ampersand is a lovely hotel in a nice area. The staff are friendly and the rooms are well maintained and comfortable. The hotel is not cheap but worth what you pay. The Apero restaurant is however not up to standard and breakfast was poor but expensive. If the restaurant was improved then the whole experience would be better. ,5,2024,03,10
129,Super Ampersand,"I spent two nights at the Ampersand and the stay was simply amazing‚Ä¶ Lovely staff, great location - next to South Kensington tube station - stylish luxury hotel with a touch of British. Its bar ‚ÄúApero‚Äù serves sophisticated and elegant cocktails. 10/10!",5,2024,03,09

The beds are made out of clouds and the design of this building is amazing. I will be back and I will for sure recommend this place to friends and family.",5,2024,02,24
129,We just keep coming back.,This hotel never disappoints. The decor is amazing and the staff are always super helpful and courteous. The tube is just across the road and there is a taxi rank right outside. This is the hotel to stay at for the Royal Albert Hall and many of London‚Äôs top museums. ,5,2024,02,21

I had not time to try the bars or restaurants in the hotel but if they are anything like reception or my bedroom, I recommend trying.",5,2024,02,03
129,The Ampersand is First Class,"The Ampersand fully deserves it's five star rating, the staff are outstanding nothing was to much trouble for them.

The room was absolutely quiet despite the location very close to South Kensington station and the warm welcome each evening really made us feel like we were coming home!",5,2024,01,21
129,Another great stay at one of London‚Äôs finest,"I think the Ampersand is consistently one of the very best hotels in London. As a Brit who now lives in the US, I choose to stay here every time I return ‚Äòhome‚Äô. Niels and his team provide exceptional service - nothing fussy or unnecessary, they just do all the important bits really well. 

The rooms are great. Plenty of nice touches - including quality free snacks and drinks. Fresh milk in the in-room fridges means you can make a proper cup of tea. 

South Ken is a great neighbourhood. The Piccadilly Line makes transfers to/from Heathrow relatively quick, easy and inexpensive. 

I highly recommend you give The Ampersand a try. You probably won‚Äôt want to stay anywhere else in London.",5,2024,01,18
129,The Ampersand,"Do not change a thing about the hotel. I am happy to let you know about my recent stay; however, I do not want the details of my review to be posted on any social media. I trust you will respect my wishes.",5,2024,01,15

129,We loved the Ampersand even more than we expected to,"As many have mentioned, the personal warmth and competence of the desk staff was remarkable. It was a very relaxing place to stay, as a result. One felt genuinely welcome. Proximity to museums & tube stop a plus! And to be honest, the free sodas, juices & snacks in the room, and the use of a refrigerator make a big difference. Though we ended up ordering breakfast in the room, because it was excellent & reasonably price (unlike US hotel breakfasts!). 
In addition, there is a lot of charming space downstairs, including a game room. We didn't use any of it  . . but we might next time. ",5,2024,01,05

129,Very nice one night stay,"We stayed at this hotel as we wanted to go to the Hyde Park winter festival and we had a morning flight. Great location right next to the tube, and an easy ride to Heathrow. We booked a small room fully expecting it to be small, as we just wanted a clean cozy place to sleep for one night. This spot fit the bill perfectly. Great one stay stay! Walkable to plenty of good dinner options and pubs. Would stay again longer with a bigger room in a heartbeat.",4,2023,12,27
129,A Hidden Gem in South Ken.,"What I like as a frequent traveler is being able to control the temperature in my room. Each room at the Ampersand has its own heating and air conditioning controls. This is excellent.

Staff was personable. Breakfast had healthy vegetarian choices. Check-in and check-out was fast and efficient.

Ask for fifth floor room. They are the quietest. This was my second stay at the Ampersand. I‚Äôll be back.",5,2023,12,23

Our stay was short, but we'll certainly be back again. A wonderful experience.

",5,2023,12,19
129,"Cosy, luxurious small hotel","Very clean and tastefully furnished hotel. House keeping is of high standard. Counter staff were helpful. Excellent access (2- or 3-minute walk) to a station with 3 Underground lines. The room was small and cosy but the layout of my room was not suitable for more than 1 large luggage case. If you are going to have 2 large luggages, it will be necessary to inform the hotel in advance if they have a room with a layout that can accommodate that. My large luggage had to be placed at the short access to the bathroom and room door. As such, the narrowed walking space will affect efficient movement in an emergency evacuation should there be one. The issue isn‚Äôt really about the floor space/area, but a matter of reconfiguring the furniture layout within the room. ",5,2023,12,17
129,Delicious afternoon tea cakes and tea blend,"Took refuge from heavy rain and popped in for tea. We didn't want the full afternoon tea staff modified so we could just have the cakes and tea.

The staff were very responsive to our needs, iclcuding dining, charging our phones, or accommodating flexible check out. As we were waiting for a taxi after the check out, we were offered cans of water for the journey. This simple anticipating customer's needs was just a cherry on top.

129,Great hotel‚Ä¶uncomfortable beds!,"Great hotel in every respect but our beds were sooo uncomfortable. Pillows had no support and mattresses was so soft, they were unsupportive and uncomfortable. I think they just need to look at that as I would hesitate to look again. ",4,2023,11,24

129,Impressive service,"Don‚Äôt usually write any reviews - but I am compelled to do so for The Ampersand. The hotel is as gorgeous as shown in the photos. The most impressive was the service - I believe it was Ian who helped with the checking in and he was very helpful. Also, there was a lovely gentleman who helped with my suitcase. I have stayed in many hotels but never had any staff went into such lengths to explain all the buttons and where everything was in the room. Plus, the mini bar was free! The location cannot be beat. It‚Äôs literally right beside the south Kensington tube station. Only drawback was that I stayed on the ground floor which was a bit noisy but I will undoubtedly book the hotel again!",5,2023,11,20
129,Magical !,"It was the 3rd time we stayed at The Ampersand and we will always return when in London. The proximity and the beauty of the hotel's location is perfect. We love the decor and the privacy of the quiet rooms. The beds are out of this world, one literally sleeps on could seven.

129,Beautiful hotel in the perfect London location!,"What a fantastic stay we had at The Amperstand! Location is perfect, hotel is charming and luxurious, service is fantastic. Perfect spot to base yourself to explore London, esp with kids!

* Location: In the beautiful South Kensingtion neighbourhood, right opposite the Tube station and bus stops. Right behind some key museums - V&A, Natural History, Science. Amazing food options all within a block of the hotel.
* Rooms: luxurious, clean and charming. Spacious for Londons standards! Bathroom also very spacious and modern, the heated floor is an amazing touch! The room and bathroom were both renovated, so you have the benefit of a beautiful old building but modern facilities.
* Service: fantastic, staff were so lovely. Especially the doorman (wish I knew his name!) who was so friendly to our daughter! Yaroslav and Manina at the Reception were extremely helpful, even helping send something back to us. The staff left a welcome hot chocolate and kids amenities for my daughter, which was a big hit!
* Hotel facilities: fantastic games room and library, we played table tennis every day! The hotel is known for the Science and Dinosaur afternoon teas for kids, which we tried and enjoyed! Room service was available round the clock, which is very convenient.

Thank you Ampersand Hotel!",5,2023,10,25

We would return to this hotel without question! 
Bravo Ampersand!",5,2023,10,18
129,A lovely luxury experience in South Kensington,"The Ampersand is a lovely boutique hotel in a central area of Kensington, just a couple of blocks from the Picadilly Underground line but still quiet. I had a lovely room--the usual small size for a London hotel.  The bed was super comfy and breakfast was great. The hotel staff was very helpful. There was no doorman when I arrived, but a person at the check-in desk immediately offered to help me with my bag. The only ""blip"" was that the person who answered my email questions urged me twice to use the Picadilly line from Kings Cross but did not note that there is no elevator when one arrives--no fun if one has a small and a large suitcase and a knapsack. I only regret that I was pretty busy in London, so I didn't have time to use their gym, bar, or have afternoon tea there.",5,2023,10,17
129,Fabulous hotel opposite the tube station,"We landed up staying here due to the hotel we were in having a terrible water leak and all the guests had to leave due to health and safety concerns.

With special thanks to the following. people who made a big difference.

129,Science Afternoon Tea,"I went to the afternoon tea with my science loving partner a ms this hotel does a science themed afternoon tea.  I didn‚Äôt think it would be very good.  But I was utterly blown away.  The vegan version was OUTSTANDING and so was the standard one.  The flavours were amazing the chocolate cake - omg.  The honey chocolate spaceman. Omg.  The fossil dinosaurs. So cute. The tubes and pippetts of filling.  So cute. The sandwiches were amazing and not your bog standard at all. 

Definitely worth the money. ",5,2023,10,09

129,Good Location + Superb Service!,"During our book club trip from September 26th to October 2nd, we had a fantastic stay at The Ampersand Hotel.

Lots of restaurants in the vicinity. The staff were very friendly and always available to help. The room was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. Having tea/coffee, sodas, water and cookies in the room every day was a nice amenity. Overall a wonderful boutique hotel.",5,2023,10,01
129,Loved the Museum Theme,"This is a realy tastefully decorated hotel in a vibrant and accessible part of London, South Ken. It is a half step from the South Kennsington tube station, which serves the Circle/District Lines and Picadilly Line. This was fantastic for us as we spent 10 days going here and there by tube, walking and occasionally by hired driver. The name confused me a bit when I booked it but given the Hotel's proximity to the Victoria & Albert Museum I can't help but think that the ""&"" Ampersand name is attribuited to that connection. Museums aren't everyone's taste but the V&A certainly is impressive, large and amazing in so many ways. We also went the the Natural History Museum in the area, which was very convenient. The Hotel's staff was fabulous in every way. atentive, accomodating, friendly, informative, helpful when we had an issue. Quick and efficient without seeming rushed. The hotel is surprisingly large for a small boutique hotel. The rooms are spacious and ours had a high ceiling. The Bathroom is very nice includint a waterproof wall-mounted TV in the shower. And the door locks, lighting, TV's and furnishings  are all very modern and convenient. Overall quite impressed with the stay.",5,2023,09,25
129,A London Gem,"I stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for 7 nights and can not fault the service, location and room quality. As an older solo traveller it was perfect - the location made it easy to walk to so many fabulous local places. I can't wait to return on my next trip to London.",5,2023,09,23
129,Great Experience,"We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for 4 nights.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  Towels were plush and bed was super comfortable.  There is a controllable thermostat, but we think it is locked at a certain temp.  It was extremely warm in London the nights we were there and the air conditioning wasn't keeping up. The maid service was so great and friendly.  This hotel is right near the Tube station and very convenient to the museums.  Restaurant has a nice selection of good food.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  We would stay here again!",5,2023,09,22
129,"Paid a lot, got ""enough.""","The hotel staff were pleasant. The hotel is expensive, but the location is great. Underground station, museums, restaurants, taxi rank, everything within a very short walk. I suppose one could rate the hotel as 4 star, but certainly not 5. Not even close. Perhaps it was only our room, but it was not a 5. ",3,2023,09,16
129,Perfect hotel for ME time!,"I was down in London for some ‚Äòme‚Äô time and decided to try out this hotel. 

What an amazing surprise.   First of all this hotel is less than five mins from south Ken station.  Easy.  

I got an upgrade to a studio which was so nice.  My room overlooks the Main Street but you can really hear the traffic.  Air cons works beautifully as well.  

My room has all mod cons.  Bathrobe and slippers.  Great toiletries.   Perfect.  Decor was tastefully done and reflected in all main areas of the hotel.  Love the bar stools as well. 

They welcomed me with a text which proved to be extremely useful when I had an issue with the bar bill that evening.  All sorted with no issues.  Absolutely spot on.  

I spend a lot time in hotels around the world and this is definitely one that I‚Äôd return and recommend.  

It might just be my home from home during visits to London!",5,2023,09,16

129,Could‚Äôve been Better. all around.,"While we weren‚Äôt assigned one of our favorite rooms (after many years) our room was simply ok. Staff was understaffed and somewhat disorganized. The Bell team was running the show. Overall value for price has significantly dropped over the years, sadly. I doubt we‚Äôll be back for our semi annual trip, time to find a new favorite.",3,2023,08,18
129,Wonderful hotel!,Cannot think of anything but positives for the Ampersand. We have stayed here quite a few times and will continue to return in the future. Very comfortable beds and the room service breakfast is wonderful.,5,2023,08,18

The Victoria and Albert as well as the Natural History Museum was less than 5 minutes walk. Linens and all the accoutrements were amazing. It is now our preferred London hotel.,5,2023,08,12
129,The Jewel In The Crown,"Just returned from my fourth stay at the Ampersand Hotel & as good as ever.  The warm and welcoming staff are a true credit to the hotel & managing to check me in at 9:30am after an early morning flight was the cherry on the cake. The welcome back note and macaroons on return to my room later in the day was a thoughtful touch. I would not stay anywhere else on a trip to London. Thank you so much for another fabulous stay. 
Erika Reitter",5,2023,08,12
129,Perfect location,"The location is superb being just a short walk from South Kensington station. Service levels were generally very good throughout the hotel and especially in the Apero restaurant.  

The corridors are very narrow, but our deluxe room was a decent size with a modern walk-in shower room. The free minibar included a few soft drinks and water, and we had tea & coffee making facilities (but no Nespresso machine). Unfortunately the only window in our room featured a view of a very large brick wall. 

The themed afternoon tea is a big thing here and is an experience well worth trying (especially if you are with children). Breakfast featured a continental buffet option which at ¬£22 per person was not particularly good value for money. We also chose a few items from the a la carte menu (the full English at ¬£16 was more substantial). 

The basement features a gym, games room and library but the library in particular is really just a meeting room with a few books, i.e. not very conducive to reading.  

Overall, this is a pretty decent hotel if you are planning to stay in the area. ",4,2023,08,08
129,Best Staff Ever - beautifully friendly and caring,"We stayed a week here, the first week of our 6 weeks stay in England. The staff and service here are exceptional and they do everything to assist, amend, and enhance my every need and make my stay so welcoming and wonderful. I was happy and impressed with the friendliness of everyone I encountered. The room was a bit small even though it was a few levels above the basic and also the hairdryer doesn't plug in in the bathroom which I'm finding is quite common in London/England. But other than that, I really loved staying at the Ampersand. I used the gym, the library, the ping pong table with my son, and had breakfast and dinner there. It was also a one minute walk from South Kensington station and a block 'behind' the hotel was a street lined with delicious restaurants. My 9yo son was most impressed with the snacks and cold complimentary drinks in the room.",5,2023,08,05
129,The Perfect London Stay,"We bookend all of our trips to Europe and surroundings with a stay at the Ampersand. It is perfectly located and feels like home to us now. We can unwind in museums, walks in the nearby parks, and cozy cafes. Our trips wouldn't be the same without you!",5,2023,07,30
129,Great boutique hotel in London,"We have stayed at the Ampersand on numerous occasions over the years and it is always a great experience.

An excellent choice for a visit to London.",5,2023,07,25
129,"Close, but sometimes not close enough yet too close.","The Ampersand hotel is a very attractive and ideally located hotel. Our room was quite nice and well appointed. However, I have to say I wouldn't stay there again. For one, you can faintly hear the tube rumbling along way down underneath...yeah, trade offs (close to the tube but then hearing it). Also, the staff is fine, but just oddly distant in their interactions. So, nice place, but not worth a return. ",3,2023,07,25
129,Great hotel in great location,"Our new favourite hotel in London. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The room was spotless & the complimentary snacks & soft drinks were enjoyed. Loved that they had robes & slippers for adults AND a junior size robe & slippers for our daughter, they also left her a hot chocolate kit & lots of little toiletries. Bed was extremely comfortable and the toiletries were plentiful. A TV in the bath was great! Would have loved a welcoming bar at reception but it seemed totally geared to afternoon tea. Superb location, loads of restaurants, coffee spots & bars nearby & a two minute walk to the underground was fantastic. Will definitely return & recommend.",5,2023,07,25
129,Brilliant,Absolutely amazing as per usual - wouldn't stay anywhere else for work or for family! The staff could not be more helpful and the hotel's location is excellent.

129,Best London Hotel with Immediate Tube & Taxi Access,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Ampersand Hotel. Accommodations from arrival to checkout were courteous and quick.

129,Comfortable and with excellent service - handily situated.,"A very comfortable hotel, beautifully situated very close to South Kensington tube station and with a taxi rank outside, excellent bus links.
There is a very personal service for a London hotel.  Dogs are allowed. There used to be a lovely drawing room where you could meet people, relax or have coffee but this has been turned into a lucrative business in tourist teas, so not available without a booking.  Good restaurant in the basement..",5,2023,06,11

129,Great hotel in a great location in London!,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand. We stayed in late May 2023. The weather was perfect We were in London for a mother-daughter trip to see Downton Abbey and the Chelsea flower show. Each were easy to get to from the hotel. Our room was nice and the beds were very comfortable. The restaurant on site is delicious and the staff is very friendly. Sandeep, our waiter, was fantastic. The hotel staff at reception were also wonderful. We enjoyed interacting with Blaze, Jerry, Marius, and Neils. We didn't get a chance to try the high tea, but we could see lots of people enjoying themselves as we walked by the drawing room. Looked amazing. We will have to do that next time. One last thing to note... the hotel is within walking distance to LOTS of great restaurants, cafes, and shopping! It's also only about a 5 min walk to the Natural History Museaum, V&A museum, the Science museum and the Royal Albert Hall. It's also about a 10-15 minute walk to the Kensington Gardens and Hyde park. The location of this hotel really is superb, and mixed with the great staff... it's a perfect hotel for your London adventures! ",5,2023,06,02
129,Amazing location,"This hotel was a two minute walk to the tube as well as to a lot of cute restaurants/cafes etc. Location was amazing. Service was excellent.  The rooms were very clean and well maintained.  I only have a few things that could be improved upon. As adults - a proper bar would be nice.  Additionally, it really caters to families and smaller kids which wasn't great for us.  WIFI needs an upgrade - extremely slow. Rooms are a bit dark and need a bit of a facelift. Heated floors, free snacks and soft drinks, service and location to a lot of great attractions are a huge plus. Be warned things close fairly early around the hotel due to it's location in a residential area.  I would still recommend this hotel especially if you have a young family. ",4,2023,06,02

I can‚Äôt wait to stay again, it‚Äôs an ideal location for visiting many go to places in London and a short walk to the tube station. ",5,2023,05,29
129,Comfy Hotel,"We enjoyed our visit to this lovely comfy hotel. Very attentive  and friendly staff. We only ate breakfast but that was fine. There were other facilities which we did not use.
It is well positioned to visit shops, and museums and Chelsea.",5,2023,05,29
129,Outstanding gem in London,"Great location, beautiful hotel, lovely staff and great little restaurant-modern in style and yet comfy and cosy-great location if you‚Äôre going to the big museums and the tube is 2 mins walk-highly recommended ",5,2023,05,25
129,Gorgeous hotel and top service at the heart of South Kensington,"Excellent and eficient staff, gorgeous decoration with ample rooms, South Kensington tube station around the corner, cozy bed and top shower. The Ampersand is a must in London. The restaurant is also excellent as well as the bar. ",5,2023,05,23
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Excellent hotel with really kind and friendly attendants with always a smile and good knowledge of the transport systems and where to find a good restaurant in the neighborhood. The beds are divine and all the facilities in the room are very nice. The location is perfect if you want to go to museums and do shopping. After visiting the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, I recommend their museum shops! Full of unusual and fun gifts and merchandise.",5,2023,05,23
129,Not a luxury hotel,"This hotel is labelled a small luxury hotel.  I don‚Äôt know their definition of luxury but it isn‚Äôt a luxury one for me.  There is are no doormen at the front, even though there are 2 sets of  steps at the front entrance.  The front desk staff is polite and professional.  The first room they gave me smelled and had a bad mattress (collapsed in the middle).  After a bad night sleeping with the windows open (< 9 C outside), I requested a different room.  The second room was much better, no smell, good mattress, just as small but with with tall ceilings and a bigger window.  There is no turn down service.  On the second day, the room had not been serviced when we got back after 1:30 pm.  Great location though, away from the hustle in the more touristy areas but close to a tube station.",3,2023,05,16
129,Great boutique hotel,"Love staying here given its proximity to South Ken tube and slap in between Hyde and Battersea Parks.
Always welcoming staff, comfortable beds, a cool little bar/restaurant and chic design makes you think that this is how one‚Äôs London house would look if one had the money to own one.",5,2023,05,14
129,A Gem of a Hotel at the heart of South Kensington!,"Managed to get an amazing 2 night deal with this hotel and was not disappointed one bit. Booked a small double room but the location was the best part. Staff were all excellent and very accommodating. Highly recommend for anyone looking to visit Natural History Museum, V&A Museum and a shopping trip to Harrods. Lots of local restaurants right outside the hotel so you‚Äôre always spoilt for choice. Fantastic place to stay for a little staycation in the city.",5,2023,05,11
129,A home from home in London,We stayed for four nights and were so impressed by the excellent service at the Ampersand as well as the homey feel. Great location and the hype about the Science Tea is real‚Äîit was so cool!!! Thank you  everyone at Ampersand! ,5,2023,05,09

129,"Lovely Hotel, Friendly Staff, Great Location","My wife and I stayed here with my brother and sister-in-law and right from check-in it was a great experience. The staff are all extremely friendly and pleasant, right from the reception staff to the team in the bar to the people in the Drawing Room where we had afternoon tea. They do some great cocktails and the afternoon tea was incredible.
The rooms were spotless and very comfortable. We will definitely stay there again!",5,2023,05,02
129,Always Excellent,Returned many times to the Ampersand and on each occasion the experience just gets better. You‚Äôve now reached the summit of excellence. The little details make such a difference from the smiling  happy and helpful staff to the delivery of complimentary macaroons. We‚Äôll done everyone.,5,2023,05,01
129,Exceptional hotel!,"This was our second stay at the Ampersand hotel and yet again it blew us away! The rooms are beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean! The staff were amazing, nothing‚Äôs  too much trouble for them, they really made our stay complete! Thank you so much Ampersand! Can‚Äôt wait to come and stay with you again!",5,2023,04,30
129,Absolutely fabulous afternoon tea,"I went to the Ampersand Hotel for my 40th birthday with my husband, two young children and my parents. We booked the science-themed afternoon tea. It was wonderful! One of the best afternoon tea experiences I‚Äôve had in a very long time. I had the gluten free tea which was fabulous. My children loved making their own lemonade using real Pyrex apparatus (beaker and test tubes etc) and they also loved the smoke effect created, I think with dry ice. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The sandwiches and the hot dog for the children were replenished free of charge which was great. I would happily go back there again. ",5,2023,04,29
129,"Gorgeous hotel, wonderful staff in ideal area of London!","This hotel was beautiful and the staff were stellar. The location is excellent, 2 minutes from Kensington underground and a stone's throw from the Victoria and Albert Museum and others. Absolutely gorgeous area with loads of restaurants and sights. This hotel and its staff were memorable and I plan on returning with husband in the fall. The staff did so many things right from accompanying you to the your room to orient you to all the things guests fumble around with like the wifi, the remote, etc. They were incredibly friendly and exceedingly helpful. The bathroom products were premium and the room was spotless with lovely decor. I was also given an upgrade - a huge bonus! All around an excellent experience! ",5,2023,04,28
129,"Authentic, Great Hotel","
 Wonderful hotel with great staff and beautiful decor. Perfect location in busy London. From the front door on arrival, you will know you have stepped into an authentic London experience. Well done. You made my trip delightful.

129,hotel for business and family vacation.,"I highly recommend visiting this beautiful hotel, luxurious room, beautiful design, excellent staff and wonderful food, great price for staying in the centre of London.
Near the subway , bus station, restorants",5,2023,04,21
129,Amazing hotel in a perfect location,The service and accommodations were top notch from start to finish. The hotel is centrally located and conveniently across the way from the South Kensington Underground Station. Very easy to wake up and quickly be on your way to anywhere in London. We'll definitely be back!,5,2023,04,20
129,My first stay here and not my last,"Great location near museums, coffee shops, restaurants, public transport. Lovely service, helpful and friendly, impeccable room. Got the deluxe double based on prior reviews of the single rooms. Shower pressure in the bathroom was fantastic! Fluffy bathrobes. Restaurant at lower ground level is very popular for breakfast with non-guests. Nice vibe all around.",5,2023,04,13
129,Repeat visitor,"I have stayed at this hotel 4 or 5 times now and plan to keep returning. The rates have increased, but it is a good value for location, size of the room, helpful staff, free minibar, quiet room, etc. There are, however, some basic maintenance issues in the room that should have come to management‚Äôs attention. Trim needs to be paint needs to be repainted, there is/was clearly an issue with water infiltration on the ceiling where the plaster and paint haven‚Äôt been repaired well, a wallpaper seam is coming apart, etc.",4,2023,04,13
129,Why The Ampersand keeps us coming back,"We live in Canada but we visit London once or twice year.  The Ampersand is our ""go to"" destination.  It's central location near South Kensington underground station and ac easy walk to The Natural History Museum, and the Victoria and Albert museum make it an ideal pied a terre. 
Last time we watched the flyover heading to Buckingham Palace for the Queen's Platinum anniversary from our balcony. 
Our favourite 5th floor suite is comfortable and well appointed.  But it is the staff who make our stay so special.  They go the extra mile.   For example, one time we arrived around 11:00 am after an overnight from Toronto.  We were tired and our room understandably was not going to  be ready until 3 pm.   They provided us with a small double room for us to freshen up and have a nap until our suite was ready.  No charge!

We're heading back in September and although prices have gone up recently they kindly offered us the same rate we had enjoyed on our previous visit. 

",5,2023,04,07
129,Science afternoon tea,"Family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Really enjoyed the science afternoon tea which finished off our visit to the science museum nicely. 

The science experiment lemonade was very tasty and the kids enjoyed the dry ice which was on the sandwich tower. 

My other half had the vegetarian afternoon tea and really enjoyed the sandwich offerings.

The staff were tentative but not intrusive and made sure we had another round of sandwiches and top up tea pots. 

Really lovely experience",5,2023,04,07
129,Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,"My husband and I spent 5 days here last week on a London vacation.  The hotel was amazing.  Beautifully updated, clean and quiet.  The staff was superb.    They were helpful in getting us train tickets for a side trip to Birmingham.  They stored our bags for the night and upgraded our room to a suite upon our return!
The location is excellent within walking distance to the Underground,  Hyde Park ,Museums, Restaurants and shops.
I would highly recommend this lovely hotel.
It made our week very special.",5,2023,04,04

129,Third Times A Charm,"Just back from a wonderful long weekend at The Ampersand Hotel & third time is definitely a charm. Perfectly positioned in South Kensington with the underground & world class shopping at its doorstep, the jewel in the crown must be the warm & welcoming staff, a true credit to the hotel.The little touches such as plush dressing gowns, a well stocked complimentary mini bar & pastel coloured rubber ducks make all the difference & definitely made my stay a memorable one! The room upgrade was very much appreciated. Counting down the days until I can return to this wonderful hotel, i will never stay anywhere else. Thank you

129,Location could not be better,"This hotel is perfectly located right next to the South Kensington tube, with sensational food and tourist options all in easy walking distance. The hotel's overall quality, cleanliness and team members were all exceptional. Could not recommend more highly. ",5,2023,03,25
129,It was ok but not great ,"Our room was very small and although hotel rooms in London often are small, this one felt small and tight. The temperature control was not working well. We had to call nightly to have them reset the temperature in our room. The bathtub was rather unsafe. There were no handles and if one slipped, it would have been quite dangerous. The heated floor in the bathroom was however very luxurious and the Full English breakfast was fantastic. We also had the science tea which was beautiful to look at but the food was not that special and too sweet. This review page asks for photos. I usually take photos but our room was so small there was no angle where a photo could be taken well. Overall the location was fantastic, right by the South Kensington Tube station. If I ever book there again I would likely chose to pay more for a larger room. ",3,2023,03,23
129,Two nights in London,"We thought the hotel was quaint and clean.  It is located in a great neighborhood.  The rooms are typical of European boutique hotels, on the small side, but nicely appointed. The staff is helpful. We enjoyed our stay.",4,2023,03,22
129,GREAT HOTEL IN A GREAT LOCATION,"The hotel is in a great neighbourhood. the staff were friendly and informative. The tea room and bar were nice, the neighbourhood is really residential with all local essentials. 2 minutes to the tube and easy walking to all of west london. ",4,2023,03,22
129,Attentive hotel in an excellent location,"This was our third stay at the Ampersand Hotel in Kensington based on the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff, the quality of the rooms (quiet and in a fantastic Kensington neighborhood), very close to museums, shops and South Kensington tube station.  It also houses a fantastic restaurant in its basement, where we chose to eat all our breakfasts and one dinner.  The staff were extremely helpful in assisting in acquiring a very clean and on-time taxi upon departure for Heathrow (affiliated service), during a day of a Tube strike and closure when taxis were difficult to acquire.  Rooms are spacious for London, have a comfortable bed, clean linens, and clean bathrooms (full tubs or large shower) with L'Occitane products.  This is a quality, clean and well-staffed hotel (all excellently trained in customer service).  We were greeted with smiles and friendliness every day and often assisted with door service upon entry or departure of the hotel.  We had a third story room overlooking a busy street and didn't hear any traffic noise.",5,2023,03,19
129,"Lovely hotel, helpful staff, great location.","Stayed 4 nights. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We got a room facing the main street, and asked for a quieter room which we were given without any problems or added fees. The beds are wonderful, the rooms are spacious (deluxe), they make the bed at night if you wish. The minibar is included (non-alcoholic) and restocked every day. It is very close to South Kensington station, and lots of cosy cafes and restaurants just around the corner. The V/A-museum and Natural History museum is about 5-10 min walk away. The area felt very safe, also at night. Highly recommend, would stay there again. ",5,2023,03,15
129,A Perfect Stay!  Thank you Ampersand Hotel and Team!,"Me and my daughter stayed at the Ampersand Hotel in Kensington in November for 3 nights.  First of all, what a PERFECT location!  Just a few steps away from Kensington station, surrounded by loads of bakeries, and restaurants but most of all, we felt safe at all times!  All the major attractions were easy to get to, so this hotel is very centrally located!  There is also a taxi stand directly outside the hotel steps which is also really convenient! This boutique hotel is probably one of my favourite hotels I've visited, and I've been to MANY hotels!  The doorman, and front desk staff was ALWAYS amazing, helpful, friendly and welcoming.  We always felt like we were coming home which was so nice, especially considering it was the first time me and my daughter were travelling alone - we always felt taken care of, and safe.  The hotel was super clean, and our room was small, but fantastic!  I loved the little details they add - like each of the toiletries labelled, the little snacks that they include in your room every day... they gave my daughter a little dessert plate when we checked in to acknowledge her 16th birthday which was so sweet and thoughtful.  There is a restaurant in the hotel as well - we had breakfast there one day, and it was great!  We also did the science high tea which was phenomenal - so fun, and creatively done!  I would 100% look forward to staying here again the next time we visit London (hopefully)!!",5,2023,03,15
129,Excellent experience - we will come back!,"We discovered the hotel in the internet. The location is excellent, the service mindset is really great. You can feel that this hotel is not part of a big group, it is a boutique place. The rooms are clean, well maintained, two services per day. Hardly anything to improve. ",5,2023,03,13
129,Excellent service.  Well located,"Would come back for sure.  The room was big enough.  Bathrooms excellent,  Staff were courteous.
Very convenient to public transit service which connects everywhere.  Convenient to museums
And by tube to theater and dining.",5,2023,03,11
129,London & the Perfect Stay,"I am thrilled that I chose The Ampersand and its South Kensington location. The hotel itself lives up to its ‚Äúsmall luxury‚Äù title with every detail. My room was clean, the bed was luxuriously comfy, and the location could not be better. Easy access to cafes, restaurants, and the tube. I felt safe and well-cared for! ",5,2023,03,09
129,Quick visit to see our Daughter,"this hotel is absolutely perfect in everyway!!! the location is incredible, 100 yards from the tube and right in the heart of London. the staff, food, bar and service  all 5* plus. I couldn't recommend more highly.",5,2023,03,07
129,Sat 4 Mar,Felt like it used to be 5 star once upon a time and now hanging on a little unsuccessfully to the accolades. Rooms were nice enough and the location is great. However service fell way short which tarnished the experience.,2,2023,03,06
129,Very helpful staff,"I was working for a client at this hotel on a Saturday afternoon and had quite a lot of equipment to bring into the hotel, with the parking not being that close to the hotel I quickly parked on the single yellow line in the Road near the hotel. I was panicking about getting a ticket.
I was soon feeling much more relaxed when a guy from the hotel said he would help me he also got another guy to help bring my stuff quickly in to the hotel which allowed me to Wizz of and find parking.
When leaving had to do it all again and I was very relieved to have the help once more his name was Mahammed 
I don‚Äôt often write reviews but just felt he needed to know just how much he helped me 
And he is doing a fantastic job you are very lucky to have such a lovely guy working front of house üëçüèº",5,2023,03,01
129,Best London Hotel with Immediate Tube & Taxi Access,"My stay at the Ampersand Hotel was excellent. The South Kensington Tube Station and taxi stand are across the street. There is an Urban Barista, Pret a Manger, Starbucks, Bread Ahead Bakery, The Hereford Arms Pub and an A.P. Food (like a convenience store) open 24 hours down the street! The service, staff, security and cleanliness of the hotel are the highest standard. I felt safe and my stay was delightful because the location is excellent. Wonderful experience!",5,2023,02,27
129,Dud. A three star at best with no closet.,"Complete Dud!

How this place is a ‚Äú5-star‚Äù is illogical. 3 star at best with no closet space avail for my jacket or sweaters.

First, the rooms are obviously refurbished, meaning if done right, shouldn‚Äôt be obvious. The floors creak and the carpet is cheap. 

Second, Walls are incredibly thin I could hear a woman next to me singing in one room and in the other a couple having sex, down to hearing the guy slapping the woman. At 6 in the morning - not OK. This is really terrible and unexpected of a so-called 4+ star. 

There isn‚Äôt real closet space, just an ‚Äúillusion‚Äù of one. I tried to hang my smallest shirt and it nearly dipped into my tea cup (see photo) bc that is the only place they can fit the kettle and coffee set up. It can‚Äôt even fit a jacket. 

When I checked in and they said ‚Äúthe mini bar is free‚Äù this is a red flag that this hotel doesn‚Äôt have 24 hour room service (required to be a 4 star +), and thus cuts corners to pull off their 4+ star status with drinks valued under $4 combined. 

I live 8 months out of the year at hotels and have stayed in about 10 different 4+ star hotels in London since Jan 1. This is a 3 star hotel at best. But even most 3 stars have closet space where e you can hang your coat.

Lastly my heater didn‚Äôt work and I was cold all night when I finally called to complain they had to get me to reset my key, turn off and on the thermostat so they can manually turn it on downstairs. Again, this is janky living. 

I am still at the hotel as we speak - it‚Äôs 8am and hope I can get a refund for tonight so I can leave today! I can‚Äôt stay here when I have to keep my costs and sweaters in my suitcase and I can‚Äôt get a good nights rest. I‚Äôm supposed to check out tomorrow but 1 interrupted night of cold and noise is all I can take. 

I should have checked TripAdvisor before booking as any hotel with majority of their good reviews come from people making their first and only contribution to this hotel does not make any sense. Very unreliable. 

The only redeeming quality is the staff is nice. And Muhommad who helped my suitcases to the room was extremely helpful, friendly and nice. 

But take it from someone who has stayed at 40 different hotels in the past 12 months alone. If you have other options consider those other options.  If you want a 4 star, don‚Äôt stay here.",3,2023,02,25
129,Amazing Hotel in South Kensington,"Love staying at the Ampersand Hotel! This was my 2nd stay for business and it is a small but luxurious hotel in the heart of South Kensignton, 1 minute from the tube station and museums. The rooms are lovely, my suite was beautiful. Heated floors in the bathroom and that huge tub were probably my favorite part of the room! The staff at this hotel is very kind and helpful, they go out of their way to ensure you have a great experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to London. ",5,2023,02,24
129,The best small luxury treat in London,"We were greated and treated by service minded staff all the way.
Luxurious rooms with comfortable beds, lots of space, styled in a calming way - so that you can relax and  have a good night sleep - luxurious bathroom - very clean hotel.
The hotel is located perfectly in Kensington, near by transportation, the Museums, Kensington Palace, Harrods etc.  The hotel is placed in a very nice neighborhood, make sure to walk around and explore  this, small restaurants and shops near by. We hade a lovely stay, will 100% come back - the only bad thing we can tell, was our stay was too short.",5,2023,02,24
129,Great place to stay in London,"Friendly staff and solid hotel.  The room was not huge but wasn‚Äôt expecting anything palatial.   The location is great‚Äî 1/2 block from the South Kensington tube station.   Overall, would absolutely stay here again. ",5,2023,02,20
129,Really nice hotel,"Enjoyed our stay, room wasn‚Äôt ready on arrival so they gave us free vodka lemonades, which were really nice. Room was sparkling. Staff were really nice and attentive whenever we interacted with them. You get complimentary biscuits, coke etc. Only downside is the bed is really firm, so it‚Äôs not so comfortable if you prefer a softer mattress. ",5,2023,02,20
129,Excellent as always,"As always, the exceptional service is the 'icing on the cake' for this hotel.  The location is marvellous, and the bar is one of my favourite spots (for the ambience that is!).  Have been staying at the Ampersand for years and the quality has never wavered.",5,2023,02,19

129,A treat,"We love staying at this hotel when visiting busy London. A super location. The bedroom (bed, decor, darkness and quietness at night. And bathroom and provisions.

129,An absolutely beautiful hotel that can‚Äôt be missed,It is truly lovely. Reception sets a great impression on arrival with superb welcome from the reception staff. Rooms are beautiful and the whole ambience is everything you would want for a wonderful long weekend. The breakfast was fabulous and the staff exceptional. We have stayed in many places and this one is one of the best,5,2023,02,12

We will be using again.",5,2023,02,10
129,Excellent,"Stayed in the hotel just for 3 days 12-15 of January 2023. I should mark clean comfortable rooms, very cosy atmosphere in general and very friendly stuff! Moreover that time there were not so many guests in the hotel and I was very pleased to get an upgrade of the room and spent time in London even in a greater comfort . After such treatment definitely will stay in the hotel next time and recommend this place to friends.  ",5,2023,01,23
129,"Great hotel, great location","Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Ampersand. The staff were super-friendly, the room and bathroom very comfortable and huge (I would just suggest adding some more lights). Treated ourselves to the special ‚Äúafternoon tea‚Äù with three menu options - regular, vegetarian and vegan. We had the vegetarian which was delicious, beautifully presented and fun (with a science-experiment flavoured preparation of a lemon juice with beakers, test tubes and syringes).
The hotel is across the road from South Kensington underground station, and close to the V&A, Brompton Road shopping, Harrods and more.",5,2023,01,14
129,Favorite Hotel in London,"The Ampersand is our favorite hotel in London. The elegant yet quirky decor, the calm ambiance, the comfortable beds, excellent shower, thick towels--I could go on and on.

129,My Top Choice in London,"Every time I travel to London (three times this year alone), I make it a priority to stay at the Ampersand. The staff are always delightful and I often see the same faces among them (which I always take as a good sign that the staff are being well looked after). From the heated tiles in the bathroom to the free juice, tea, soda and coffee in the room (kept quick at hand in the bedside table fridge), it's clear the Ampersand knows what the frequent traveler needs as well as wants. The location is ideal with anything you need in a 2 to 8 minute walk, the laundry service is more reasonably priced than any other I've experienced in town, and their texting for check in and check out keeps it seamless. Highly recommend. I even told my cabbie it's my favorite spot when he drove me to Heathrow and he said he frequently hears that from others who stay there. Didn't surprise me at all. ",5,2023,01,02
129,"Excellent hotel, amazing staff!","Hotel was absolutely great in every way, could not fault it.  Room was clean, amazing decor and every member of staff we dealt with was an absolute credit to the hotel.  Great bar for a few drinks, attentive and professional service.  Thank you! ",5,2023,01,02
129,Afternoon Tea,We booked to visit the restaurant to have Science Afternoon Tea for one of my eldest's birthday. The atmosphere was wonderful and the waiters were incredibly helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and they spent time explaining what they had served and checking all was okay. It was a lovely end to our visit to London. Thank you. ,5,2022,12,29
129,Exceptional stay,"I took my 6 year old daughter for her first trip to London and this was the best hotel for us. The decor and atmosphere are amazing and it was beautiful for Christmas. They gave us a warm welcome and upgraded us from a cosy to a double room.  In the room they had left us some petit fours and a thoughtful note wishing us a special weekend. As we left they gave her an ampersand rubber duck, the same as the one in our room. 

My daughter was delighted with the huge bed and her own child size robe and slippers.  I loved the bathroom and enjoyed a soak once she was asleep using the lovely toiletries.  The snacks and refreshments in the mini bar were free and I ordered a latte to be bought to the room in the morning.  

We also enjoyed playing table tennis in the game room and a spectacular afternoon tea. 

The location is superb, in a fairly quiet street only 5 minutes walk to all the museums and opposite a tube station. I would highly recommend!",5,2022,12,29
129,one week stay at The Ampersand Hotel,"We have had a very pleasant stay with the help of Mr. Vicenzo Orsini and his team.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Hotel with its excellent location ,very near the bus and underground stations and with its friendly  and hospitable staff.",5,2022,12,25
129,Jurassic park afternoon tea,"Beautiful experience for me and my son. This was a treat for his birthday and did not disappoint. I was initially concerned it may be stuffy and people might object if my little one got fidgety but I needn‚Äôt have bothered it was so relaxed lots of other kids enjoying their afternoon teas. Nothing was too much trouble and kids are encouraged to play with and really enjoy this experience 
The liquid nitrogen was a lovely touch which fascinated my lad . Thank you so much for this wonderful experience",5,2022,12,21
129,Boutique Excellence,The staff was really lovely and helpful! The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Steps from the South Kensington tube station and near major museums. The beds were very comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay!,5,2022,12,20
129,Really comfortable and convenient South Ken stay,"We spent five days in the South Ken area and would highly recommend the Ampersand for service, comfort and location.  From the door staff to the restaurant staff, everyone was very. Friendly and helpful.  Best nights sleep and one minute from South Ken tube.",5,2022,12,19
129,Highly recommended,"Cheerful and friendly staff, a cosy room up on level 4, good porridge for breakfast and all in an ideal base for getting around London. Highly recommended. Find Pappa Roma just across the road from the hotel for excellent Italian food.",5,2022,12,19
129,Charming and in a perfect spot,"We were back at this hotel after several years, and had booked a Deluxe Studio room.  This is at the upper end of rates, but provides more room and a walk-in shower.  There is also a small minibar which has complimentary soft drinks, biscuits and crisps.  The bathroom also had a bath with a TV in front of it, although we didn't use it.

This is in a perfect spot for visiting museums, catching the tube and surrounded by many restaurants and cafes, which is just as well as there is no food available at the hotel after 9.45pm (so nothing if you are coming back from a show).  We made do with a couple of sandwiches that we had bought across the road at Pret and put into the minibar for our return.

That aside, this is a very attractive hotel with beautiful decor and little touches of whimsy in your room - charming.  The staff are excellent, and even someone waiting by the door to hand you an umbrella as you head out into the rain.  And they have interesting afternoon teas available in the Lounge.",4,2022,12,19
129,Wonderful stay ,"We normally stay in a 5 star hotel more central  in London,  but on a visit to the area earlier in the year,  we decided to give this hotel a try instead as we were attending an event at the Albert Hall and it was easy to get around London from here.

We are so glad we did. We booked a deluxe double direct with the hotel and the hotel, its facilities and the room were beyond what we had expected.  Muhammed took us to our room, explained how everything worked and where it was and that if anything was needed,  just ask. As almost the first contact at the hotel, he gave an excellent  impression of what to expect. 

The room was excellent on the 4th floor.  I had asked for a quiet room and that is exactly what I got. The bed was enormous AND  comfortable and 2 good night's sleep was had. The bathroom was luxurious and spacious and the plug worked in the sink, which trust me is not always the case.

We had 2 nightcaps which were good. We could have done with a coffee,  but by 10.45pm this was not possible.  It was also nice to have a bar that did stay open late without the need to rush back from an event like some hotels. 

We only had breakfast on 1 morning,  but the service, the quality of the food and it's presentation was excellent. 

Suffice it to say , not only will we recommend this hotel but it has usurped our favourite hotel and we will be booking for next December soon.",5,2022,12,18
129,Good-ish,Ampersand is a decent hotel.  Kensington is my go to when I have to come to London for a short while. The trek to Heathrow is very easy.  First time at Amp.  So unfortunately I booked a single studio room.  Warning. This is a very very small room.  Maybe too small.  Mine had a strange sewer gas smell. Obviously something wrong with the trap.  No worries.  I just put a wet towel over the drain and it was fine.   Hotel staff seems very nice and the restaurant in the basement is excellent.  I read some other comments and indeed the Amp has some issues with climate control.  I simply could not get my room to cool down.  Not sure what that is all about but again not awful.,4,2022,12,16
129,A gem to try,"An amazing hotel. Great location. Kids friendly. You will enjoy every detail, the room, the service, the breakfast, the tee room, and the comfortable bed. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants. I was not disappointed. ",5,2022,12,15
129,Great place to explore London,"just a few step from Tube (blue yellow and green line), surrounded with many cafe‚Äô and restaurant such as local / Thai / Chinese / Lebanese / Fish&Ships. Room are great, clean, bed is comfy. Amenities refill everyday.  Breakfast is good ",5,2022,12,15
129,Pass,The heat did not work in the first room. I requested a high quiet floor they gave me the 2nd floor by a school. Next room I was transferred to the heat worked but the water pressure didn‚Äôt work! Lol Then they tried to up charge me for a deluxe room when never ordered. Rude front desk clerks. The baggage man Deb was respectful and professional and so was ask the staff at apero. The rooms are super noisy since it was built in 1888. You can hear through the walls and people walking including your own room. No closet space. Cleaning staff pleasant as well.,1,2022,12,12
129,1st Stay,"1st Stay at this hotel and was recommended. I stay in london 1-2 nights every week and even though a good walk from the office it will now become my regular place to stay.
Highly recommended especially for the price.",5,2022,12,12
129,Ridiculously small bedroom for the price and dreadful experience at breakfast,"That is my third stay in the hotel and it is usually a very nice experience but this time I need to say that it‚Äôs been a downfall in terms of room quality and breakfast experience. The room was so small with low ceiling that I felt in a shoebox, the air con was blowing directly onto the bed and therefore unusable. That‚Äôs for the room. When came the breakfast, well it was simply a disaster: the waitress was ordered an omelette with mushroom, she came back with a ham and cheese omelette with side mushrooms. The bacon on the side came almost uncooked, I sent it back and I came back simply burnt‚Ä¶ To be honest you can get a better experience in any coffee around in South Kensington‚Ä¶To summarise, this third stay was a complete disappointment‚Ä¶",2,2022,12,11
129,To avoid,"Although I explicitly requested prior my arrival a quiet room, I got a room with a lot of noise. 
Consequently, I hardly slept, and was forced to deal with this matter myself, including visiting a pharmacist to buy sleep aids, as there was a lack to seriously solve this problem upon mentioning this several times.
Even during checking-out the bill appeared to be wrong.
In general I didn't feel heard nor respected. It's not up to the customer to employ their problem-solving skills in dealing with an organisational error, where management clearly has little interest in.",1,2022,12,11
129,Perfect stay,Very good location. Three underground lines in walking distance. Comfortable rooms. Very friendly staff. Couldn‚Äôt imagine a better hotel choice in London. Hotel is highly recommended. Thanks for the great weekend. ,5,2022,12,07
129,very nice trip,"very nice trip and very nice staff
all is very good
beds are very nice
silent hotel
foods are good
lovely trip with this hotel we spent a very nice trip in family
location is very good but just traffic jam to go to mayfair but there is always traffic jam in London
",4,2022,11,28
129,Comfortable stay,"It was a great experience and an excellent location. The staff and service were amazing. Front office staff arranged the airport transport for us, and it was less of a hassle in the morning during traffic hours in London. I was heading to Sri Lanka for 50 plus days for holiday and Business. I wish I had more time there and would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,11,25
129,Great experience,"Exactly zero complaints! Friendly and welcoming staff. Comfortable room with great beds, no noice, and a good air conditioner. The room was clean, had a nice decor, separate Wi-Fi with easy acces - just everything we needed. ",5,2022,11,25

129,Best Place to Stay in the London,When I came to Sri Lanka I was in London for 3 days and stayed in this Hotel. Front office staff were very professional and they always gave their service without asking any further thing. Top quality hospitality and guest service by all the staff members there.,5,2022,11,22
129,Excellent,"We had a great time from start to finish. The deluxe rooms were really nice and spacious. If you opt for the English breakfast you are in for a treat, it tastes superb. Lovely place and people in a perfect location.",5,2022,11,22
129,Birthday Celebration,"Fantastic stay for my Birthday! 
Wonderful location, food in Apero Restaurant simply delicious especially the sharing menu and the Vegetarian Breakfast.
Great staff.
The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! ",5,2022,11,22
129,"A truly enjoyable stay, with bus stop and taxi rank outside the entrance, with South Kensington Underground 100m away ","Well located, slightly quirky small luxury hotel. Whether it's the full 5 stars it purports to be is doubtful. Though judged by true 5 star London prices it represents good value. Staff were helpful and attentive with the room upgrade much appreciated. ",5,2022,11,17
129,Family visit,"We just returned from an 8 night trip to London , visiting our daughter who is studying abroad and whose flat was just down the street.  We stayed at the Ampersand for the entire time.  My husband and I and our 17 year old daughter stayed in the one bedroom suite on the 4th floor.  The hotel is lovely and the service, I'd say is top notch. From the minute I booked our reservation to checkout the hotel was continually attentive and assisted with our every need- from securing transportation to/ from the airport to recommending restaurants and even offering to secure a doctor for my daughter who wasnt feeling wall.  Our suite was very spacious with a separate living area with pullout sofa and kitchenette all equipped with a mini bar, mini fridge,  microwave, coffee maker, cutlery and fully stocked snacks and drinks.  The master bedroom had a king bed ( which I appreciate in Europe) and a balcony ! Bathroom was small for 3 of us and the step down from the shower/ bath was not great but we made do.  Location is fantastic!  Right near the tube and tons of restaurants and cafes.  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning- food was very good, but service at times could be spotty.  One recommendation - if you say you open for breakfast at 7- you need to be ready to go at 7am!  Other than that we very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend this lovely boutique hotel to others.",5,2022,11,17
129,Perfection!,"Wow! What can I say about this amazing hotel! We had the pleasure of staying at the Ampersand for our wedding anniversary.  Tasteful d√©cor,  immaculate super clean rooms,  the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in and a magnificent English breakfast!  The pi√®ce de r√©sistance has to be the wonderful, attentive staff, nothing is too much trouble for them, they definitely made our visit even more enjoyable. Thank you Ampersand, I hope we can return soon!",5,2022,11,14
129,Perfect place to stay in London,"Great hotel all around - definitely worth staying at if you‚Äôre looking for a five star hotel in the city.  Will stay here again soon.  Bed is super comfortable, and the best part is the rubber duck in the bathroom ",5,2022,11,12
129,Great hotel,"Ampersand is a great hotel with great service and location.  This was our second stay here. Our room was quiet and very comfortable.  The hotel did a nice touch of leaving us a plate of goodies to celebrate our anniversary.  
It was easy to get to and from Heathrow as well as access to the Underground. 
Lots of great restaurants close by as well as museums.  
Overall this hotel is the best and the service is great.  ",5,2022,10,28
129,The Jewel In The Crown,"My second visit in 2022 to the glorious Ampersand hotel & am pleased to report that my experience was even better than the first.
An elegant building, beautifully restored & maintained, it is a true pleasure to call the Ampersand home‚Ä¶.If only for three nights.
So far from the generic, cookie cutter design of many big city hotels, this hotel has a style, class & quality all its own.
My top floor room overlooking the rooftops of South Kensington was beautifully finished & I appreciated the luxury bathroom complete with L‚ÄôOccitaine toiletries.
The jewels in the crown of this amazing hotel must be the staff-welcoming, warm and friendly, a true credit to the hotel. 

Finally, the location; all the main attractions are so accessible. The hotel is on the district line to Wimbledon & Hampton Court Palace
Take the circle line to the Tower of London,
or simply step out into the most beautiful area of the city and be a Londoner for just a few days
I would not stay anywhere else on a trip to London 
Erika Reitter ",5,2022,10,24
129,Wonderful,"Lovely hotel that we will definitely stay at again. Warm, welcoming, comfortable and lots of little extras that all add up to a wonderful experience. Location is outstanding, transport links are plentiful and yet the hotel itself is very peaceful. The hot chocolate for the kids in the evenings is such a lovely touch. Thank you Ampersand, we will be back.",5,2022,10,23
129,Fabulous Gem,"A fabulous gem of a hotel. Ideal location for RAH and South Kensington Tube Station. Also lots of museums nearby.
Service great. 
Beautiful room with a small balcony.
Only criticism would be would have liked a walk in shower as we are getting older more difficult to hop into a bath for the shower!
Will definitely return ",5,2022,10,21
129,Weekday stay Oct 1922,Another excellent stay at the Ampersand. Cleanliness and service to its usual high standard. Staff friendly and attentive. Having stayed at many London hotels this one actually has an air-conditioning switch that is a easy to use. Location second to none,5,2022,10,20
129,Amazing Science Afternoon Tea,"Did not stay here as a guest, but visited to have the Science Afternoon Tea. Oh my goodness, it was amazing! I won't spoil too much, but there is a great choice for both savoury and sweet options, and they let you choose your savouries, which I particularly appreciated. There is some great theatre thrown in too, which just takes it to the next level. The team that served us were welcoming and friendly as well. I hope we can return to have it again some time!",5,2022,10,20
129,Science Themed Afternoon Tea,"Visited the Ampersand Hotel for a Science Themed Afternoon Tea.I was so impressed at the standard of customer service,the presentation & the quality of treats were given.The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you & as a lovely added extra my friend was given a few birthday treats.I would highly recommend this experience.I will definitely be spreading the word to family & friends.Very Very Well Done to the staff at the Ampersand & of course my compliments to the chef / chefs.üòÅ",5,2022,10,20
129,Enjoyable stay!,"We were delighted with our recent stay at The Ampersand.  Lovely hotel, attentive staff, great location with excellent proximity to the South Kensington tube station. Quiet room, and a very comfy bed. Definitely an oasis after busy days of exploring London.",5,2022,10,18
129,BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"WE ALWAYS STAY AT THE AMPERSAND HOTEL AND EACH TIME ITS A REAL PLEASURE. The staff is always very polite and helpful and makes you as if you were at home. I wouldn't stay in an other hotel than the Ampersand
",5,2022,10,18
129,Great location,Across the street from a tube stop and plenty of food/coffee options in the neighborhood. Was the perfect location and the hotel itself is a beautiful building. Will definitely stay here next time I‚Äôm in London!,4,2022,10,18
129,A pearl in South Kensington,"We stayed at the Ampersand for three nights and loved everything about it; the clean, well-appointed room with fluffy bathrobes and complimentary fridge that was constantly re-stocked, the very comfortable bed and the security of our private, in-room Wi-Fi. 

The location is unbeatable, next to major museums and parks, easy access to all of London from nearby South Kensington tube station (with a direct line to Heathrow). 

But the most noticeable and important asset of this boutique hotel with its quiet luxury is the team that work there! Real, friendly and welcoming smiles all around. 

Thank you, Ampersand, and a special thumbs-up to Deb, who helps us settle in.",5,2022,10,13
129,Very good place to stay,"Close to V&A and Natural History Museums.    Rooms were excellent but small.  Breakfast kind of confusing paywise, but sorted out by the front desk. Quiet during the night and comfy beds. Dining area downstairs was fine. ",5,2022,10,12
129,Wonderful English Tea experience üòç‚ù§Ô∏è,"We only had English  ‚Äútea‚Äù here it was outstanding ! We were a private party of  12 and had a private library setting  . 
The whole experience was wonderful we did the ‚ÄúJurassic science ‚Äú tea  . 
What a great experience! Food and service excellent!
We would highly recommend it !",5,2022,10,12
129,Ampersand home from home,"Best of places. Does underrated very well. Stayed here many times & will do so again. Friendly staff, superb location, lovely hotel. I wonder how much it has changed? Feels pretty timeless. Recommend the top floor. ",5,2022,10,10
129,Perfect Stay in London,"very good location right opposite of South Kensington tube station, beautifully restored old building with high ceilings and elegant modern decor, modern bathrooms and free softs in minibar, free WIFI internet",5,2022,10,07
129,Nice days in London,"We had some nice days in London to descover the Town, the museums and of course Warner Brothers. Hotel and service had been excellent, the place near the underground with the important lines was perfect.",5,2022,10,06
129,Beautiful but small,"The hotel was well located, clean and sophisticated, but for travellers with luggage there‚Äôs no room to open your cases. The coffee/tea facilities for a ¬£350 a night room are below par. Staff are great however. ",4,2022,10,06
129,An Excellent Stay,"There is no better place to stay in South Kensington than the Ampersand.  It‚Äôs close to the V&A, Natural History, and Science museums, and steps away from the South Kensington underground.  The area is far enough away from heavy tourist crowds, but is in its own vibrant neighborhood.  Our deluxe studio room was spotless and well-appointed, and the housekeeping staff went out of their way to make sure that we had everything we needed to feel comfortable.  Breakfast was great, with attentive and thoughtful staff.  Compared with other hotels in the area, we‚Äôll be making this our preferred hotel as it felt the most like home.  Honestly one of the best places we've stayed in London.

Things to note:  There are 3-4 steps to navigate from street-level, but just ask for help; when dining in the neighborhood, I suggest making dinner reservations ahead of time, as restaurants get busy in this area.

Very much looking forward to returning to our London home-base in South Kensington!",5,2022,09,28
129,The perfect short stay,"Another wonderful stay at The Ampersand.  Minutes by foot to best shopping, V&A museum and other tourist sites.  At South Kensington station and a short cab ride from Paddington once arriving by Heathrow Express.  Pleasant staff.  My room was small but for one night, all I needed and perfectly appointed.  This continues to be my go-to place in London!",5,2022,09,26
129,Another lovely stay at The &,"Always nice to return to this hotel.Great location, comfortable room and friendly staff. A sanctuary from the hussle and bustle of London but close to the action - Chelsea and the West End very easy to reach ",5,2022,09,26
129,"Great location, beautiful hotel","After staying in London's saddest Airbnb, it felt wonderful to get to a real hotel (with real hot water!) The location was so convenient to the Picadilly Line and all points of London, in a nice area. Felt safe. Hotel was clean, very sexy, and I enjoyed the cocktails in the restaurant. The staff at the front desk, the doorman, and the bar manager were all so attentive and friendly. Will definitely be back! Also, the bathrooms had heated tile floors! That was so fancy and after walking so much of London each day, I was in love.",5,2022,09,13
129,Great location. 5 star not deserved.,"Not at what I‚Äôd expect for a 5 star.
No room device after 10 pm and even tho it was 10.01pm they did not bend the rules. The nicest area is reserved for the afternoon teas but would‚Äôve been lovely
place for a bar!
We had a large deluxe room which was nice if you like overdone decor. Bed comfy but pillows were too soft and bed not made properly. No fitted sheet.
Basics come before extra decor. 
Great location but south Kensington restaurants were overpriced and not that nice. 
Wouldn‚Äôt stay again. Generally overpriced.",3,2022,09,12
129,"Ampersand was a quiet lovely hotel next close to museums, parks and shopping","My first time in London and first few nights was lovely at the Ampersand.  It was around the corner from the Victoria & Albert Museum, close to Hyde Park and loads of restaurants to explore.   Would definitely recommend.  Very comfortable room. ",5,2022,09,10
129,Hotel and Location,"Very good hotel with excellent service and clean rooms and cozy rooms with helpful staff
In good location near subway station and Hyde park and hop on and hop off bus directly outside hotel
I recommend this hotel if you are looking for that little extra
",5,2022,09,07
129,Wonderful Hotel in South Kensington,"My daughter and I stayed here for four nights as a celebration of her 30th birthday. The hotel is small but very nice. We had a deluxe studio and we requested twin beds which was granted. The room is not huge but provided enough room with ample closet space. We requested an iron and extra hangers and all were brought to us immediately. Room service was very prompt and reasonably priced. We were on the first floor (which is actually the 2nd floor) I did not notice much street noise at all. The hotel is very close (3 minute walk) to the Underground which we used every day. Very convenient. Also it is a 15 minute or so walk to Kensington Palace and Victoria and Albert Museum. S Kensington is beautiful and has lots of cute shops, cafes and pubs. Hotel is really in great location.
We did not eat at either of the restaurants in the hotel but they looked lovely and seemed to have a good crowd.",5,2022,09,06
129,UPPER ECHELON,"Good spot to stay , top tier hotel ! Staff was nice and professional the food was absolutely amazing , the apero and the drawing room were fantastic, im still thinking about the risotto and rib eye That I ate that one afternoon ! Being from the USA it‚Äôs was a little bit of a challenge to understand how the lighting controls from the room worked at first, I had to figure it out as I go. it took some adjusting it would have been nice to get a little direction in the beginning. Over all an amazing hotel in an amazing location ! ",5,2022,09,02
129,Welcoming wonderful staff,This staff was very accommodating and they are what make this hotel special. I was hoping to be upgraded because of being a Tablet Hotels plus member but that was not to be. The location of this hotel and the area made our stay special. ,4,2022,09,01
129,Lovely neighbourhood hotel,"It‚Äôs great to go back to a hotel after a few years and find that high standards have been maintained.  Our absence was a result of the pandemic so a return visit gave us particular pleasure as we had tickets for a Prom at the Royal Albert Hall just up the road.  Everything as before - nice, well appointed rooms, attentive and friendly staff in all settings, great location and public transport connections and a lovely cooked to order breakfast to get the day off to a great start.  Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2022,08,30
129,"Lovely, elegant and very comfortable hotel","We are in London for a while, visiting our son and his bride, who moved here last fall.  They had a ""Pandemic wedding"" in New York last year, like so many.  
Now was the opportunity to celebrate their marriage with their parents and many friends from around the world.   We have been kept busy with many events, from family dinners to a pub gathering with their friends, to their wonderful and elaborate ""Wedding"" party.  Then, last, a post wedding celebration brunch in Hyde Park yesterday. 
This was both wonderful and exhausting for us, as we are in our seventies and not as able as we once were.  Specifically, I have a back injury which makes it necessary that I have a lot of rest between periods of light activity.  
When there was a glitch on arrival with a request I had made about our room needs, it was solved quickly and to our complete satisfaction.
So the Ampersand has provided a refuge and place of perfect peace and rest.  Thank you so much!",5,2022,08,29
129,Great stay at the Ampersand but wish the room was better,Great service. Awesome location. Rooms had creaky floor boards that caused issues during sleep as when anyone woke up and walked around the others would also wake up due to the sounds from the floor boards. Not at all ideal. One of our bathroom door knobs fell off on the last day. The rooms were clean and the general decor was quite nice. But we were really out of by the sounds from the floors. ,4,2022,08,26
129,Great location but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,"Underwhelmed. The room was dark with only a small window to a courtyard of sorts, freezing cold with no obvious way to adjust the very noisy air conditioning. I tried to adjust but nothing changed and the noise continued at the same level.

Breakfast was ok (ish) Portions felt small and service was a bit erratic.

Location was great, hence the 3 stars. Would I stay again? I don‚Äôt think so. ¬£210 + for one person for one night, not including breakfast, seems a lot for what I experienced. I guess it‚Äôs the location you are paying for.",3,2022,08,26
129,Great small luxury hotel in a great location,"We getting there around 10 am and just want to leave the baggage in the hotel.  And front desk checked and told us one of our room is ready.  Staff are very friendly, house keeping, room service quality are great.  Room is not big, but it is in a great location.  100 yards away from subway station and very quiet at night!  Definitely will return when we go to London next time.",5,2022,08,25
129,Great Location,"The hotel is very cute , the rooms are clean, however the bed is uncomfortable and maybe its time for replacement, anytime i moved it would make noise. The floors are also very squeaky, i paid extra to be moved into a suite and honestly wasnt worth it. The science theme afternoon Tea was probably one of the best experiences there, along with their employees. Would i stay there again probably not, London has alot of options.",3,2022,08,23
129,Quality boutique hotel with great service,"This is a gem in a South Kensington location convenient for museums and shopping. The staff truly goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful--even the housekeepers are friendly which I take as a very good sign! The rooms are on the small side, which is to be expected in a city center like London, but very well appointed. There is a small frig with complimentary water, juice, and snacks. If like me you are a light sleeper, the adjoining rooms (e.g. 406-407) have a small foyer so you have double doors between you and the hallway. However, the windows are double paned and I heard absolutely no noise from the street. Highly recommend!",5,2022,08,23
129,stylish hotel in South Kensington,"i can highly recommend the Ampersand hotel, apart from the location,  great decor and friendly staff, they are also very child friendly, which is important for families. the separate bathrobe and slippers for our child were much appreciated",5,2022,08,23
129,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Great location. Room comfortable, clean and stylish. Nice touch complimentary soft drinks in fridge. Friendly staff. Bar/restaurant downstairs good quality food and cocktails, nice atmosphere. Surrounded by nice local eateries and boutiques. ",5,2022,08,22
129,Wonderful hotel/great location,First visit to London.  Great location for walking to many of the attractions.  Room was very comfortable/clean and friendly and helpful staff.  Highly recommend!  Pubs/restaurants/shopping are nearby.  We will return!,5,2022,08,21
129,Late night room service please!!,Not sure it‚Äôs correct to charge top London rates and not offer late night room service. ( 11.300pm) In the worst case have the night manager provide a list of eateries who will provide delivery service at that time! Or drop your rates to Premiere Inn rates and no problem! Otherwise good location.,2,2022,08,21
129,Fanatastic hotel,"A true gem of a hotel with amazing staff. I have stayed many times and have never been disappointed.
The location is great and the size of the hotel means that everything is within easy reach.
The rooms are a good size and the breakfast is really good too!
I would recommend without hesitation.",5,2022,08,16
129,Perfect location to see the museums,"The hotel was perfect in terms of location to visit the local museums and other historic venues. The staff were courteous and attentive to our needs. Full explanations were provided if required. The bedrooms were sufficient for a couple, clean and quiet. Bathrooms were also clean and properly supplied.",4,2022,08,14
129,A lovely stay spoilt by overnight noise,"We slept very little due to loud music coming from a club opposite the hotel. This went on until 3am, stopped for 45 mins then started up again. This spoilt our stay as the next day we were too tired to enjoy our planned activities ",4,2022,08,08
129,Excellent hotel stay!,"I've stayed at The Ampersand three times and it still does not disappoint! The front desk staff are so friendly and helpful. We enjoyed chatting with them each day as we were coming and going. 

The rooms are quiet, clean and comfortable. It's a great place to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. 

You can't beat the location. It's just a stones throw from the South Kensington tube station which is a great launching point for many destinations. Plus it's very close to several museum. The neighborhood is a great mix of locals and tourists.

I can't wait to visit again!",5,2022,08,07
129,Great location and great hotel.,"Great location, friendly staff who make it a great and easy stay! I stayed with my daughter and they looked after the both of us very well. It‚Äôs around the corner from the tube so very easy to get about London.",5,2022,08,02
129,Very nice hotel,"Enjoyed our stay and the room we had on the 2nd floor facing the street. It was comfortable, bright, and attractive. We liked the location of the hotel which was close to the station, museums, and a real neighborhood feeling as well. ",5,2022,08,01
129,Great Hotel in A Great Location,"We have stayed here a couple of times now.  It‚Äôs a lovely hotel, bright and colourful, extremely clean in all areas.  Attention to detail in all areas.

Staff are All so very very good, polite, friendly and genuine.  The front desk and Concierge most welcoming.

The room we had was a deluxe, not the biggest, but has everything you need, and the bed was the most comfortable we have ever had.  The housekeeper was super friendly and knocked to make sure we had everything we needed, excellent !

Our only slight issue is the room does not include breakfast for the cost, however plenty of eateries in the area, Gail‚Äôs is great for coffee and a pastry.

Perfect location also for the Museum‚Äôs and almost two minutes from the tube.

Definitely will always stay here next time we visit.",5,2022,07,29
129,South Kensington at its best üëå ,"First and not last time at this cosy hotel.

I am an avid bird lover and this hotel oozes birds! From the beautiful painting behind the reception desk to the decor of the room (I was upgraded to as part of SLH member privileges).

Nice breakfast room/restaurant in the basement. Lovely baristas (üò∫‚ù§ their creative cappuccino presentations).

Warm welcome and farewell at reception (left quite early and they offered to prepare a hot beverage). 

So close to the workshop venue I attended and in the immediate proximity of several restaurants. 

Their afternoon tea looked quite appealing (didn't have time to try it yet...).

L'Occitane products in the bathroom.

I'll be back soon.

The only minus : the super chilly air-conditioning in my room that pulsed right on the bedü•∂! I felt as if I was in an igloo. I asked to fix it but it was even colder. The temperature didn't change whether you chose  16C or 24C. This room's AC has to be fixed I guess. ",5,2022,07,25
129,Tiny Roon - should be outlawed,"Why would anyone want to swing a cat in a hotel room? I have never wanted to, nor do I own a cat!

Ampersand hotel is advertised as being one of the leading luxury hotels in the world.

Let‚Äôs begin withthe goodness, very comfortable bed, slept like a baby, great shower, and air-conditioning, which in this climate is both a luxury and a necessity.

But the room is so tiny they had to hide the menu bar on the bedside table! Literally!! And the room safe is not big enough to house a book, never mind valuables, a room with tiny windows dark depressing and a disgrace for a five-star hotel. I‚Äôm trying to understand why this excellent hotel is maximising the number of rooms they have by adding matchboxes??

Oh! And the TV is hidden n the corner behind the hidden minibar on the bedside table. G-d knows why anyone would want to watch television cranking their head behind the bedside table, but it was helpful as a place to hang my suit because the wardrobe was too small for hanging clothes!

And after a few tries, I managed to master entering the bathroom without smashing my knee - you have to dance around as it‚Äôs impossible to open the door without hiding the toilet difficult to explain - Essentially you have to go into the shower to enable you to swing the door closed to access the toilet, you get the idea! They must‚Äôve had a great interior designer who probably won an award for getting luxury into the size of a McDonald‚Äôs burger carton!

I gave them a chance by complaining, but they politely refused to move me. I did go out the front to request more bottled water (only to encounter the disgraceful and rude guest with the Pink Floyd T-shirt and yellow teeth‚Ä¶. - suffice to say I went out to but my own water)

Nada, so I will be moving to another hotel.

This morning - coffee hilarious but great coffee, woke up and discovered a coffee filter press in the wardrobe behind my suit very carefully I made a coffee without spilling anything over my clothes‚Ä¶",3,2022,07,25
129,Outstanding hotel in an excellent location,"This is the third time we have stayed at The Ampersand and we will continue to do so - ease of location and close to transport, excellent facilities and efficient and professional staff. The beds and pillows were soooo comfortable and the inclusions in the room made it a pleasure, particularly with air conditioning assisting to deal with the extremely hot temperatures outside.",5,2022,07,25
129,Fantastic staff especially front desk and door person. Old fashioned service - wonderful,Very good front desk staff especially Vincenzo. And wonderful door person. Like service from the olden days.  Lovely place to bring children for a treat. If you can go for a bigger room as rooms perfect but really quite small A beautiful afternoon tea. Home from home feel. Relaxed. Library and Games room can be closed for events so be aware. Again. Wonderful staff make this hotel what it is - great,5,2022,07,24
129,Stay at The Ampersand Hotel,"Excellent hotel. Handy for museums and Royal Albert Hall.staff all helpful and efficient. Good atmosphere. Very comfortable room. Close to tube station. Enjoyed my stay.
Very clean and tidy. Breakfast well presented.",5,2022,07,23
129,"Great location, great stay","You can't beat the locaion of the Ampersand Hotel.  A 5 minute walk to the nearest tube, and a great selection of restaurants right on the doorstep.  The service at the hotel was great, and we were sent daily text messages making sure that everything was to our liking which I thought was great.  The staff at reception were excellent, and very helpful in recommending nearby restaurants.  Our hotel room was far larger than most London hotels.  If you can, make sure you have at least one breakfast at the hotel during your stay, the food is delicious. I will definitely be back.",4,2022,07,22
129,4 night at Ampersand,"Great hotel, nothing to complain. Room I stayed was spacious and tidy with many amenities. There was even heated floor in the bathroom and a bathtub in the room itself (+ shower in the bathroom naturally). The bed was large and extremely comfortable.",5,2022,07,22
129,Great stay. Exceeded our expectations,"We had a great stay. 
Location is perfect; close to the museums, great restaurants and the tube station. 
Staff was very attentive and helpful, at the reception and the restaurants. 
The room had a very comfortable bed and quality toiletries. ",5,2022,07,20
129,Great location lacking in service,This is a perfect hotel if visiting the Royal Albert Hall or Natural History Museum - both within easy walking distance.  We upgraded the room to a suite - which was lovely and comfortable (albeit not the largest room).  Unfortunately the hotel was let down by the check-in experience and the poor service my wife received at check out.,3,2022,07,15
129,London calling,"Location in South Kensington near tube station was ideal.  Room was modern, quiet and well appointed.  Staff was excellent and attentive.  Apero restaurant quality was well above average.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,07,14
129,Jewel of a Hotel,"The Ampersand never disappoints. We have stayed here many times and just love this gem of a hotel. Great room, excellent staff and good food! This is our home away from home. Exceptional hotel.! The location of this hotel is quite fabulous.",5,2022,07,13
129,Consistently Wonderful!,"We frequently stay at the Ampersand when in London.  We tried another hotel for this trip and after only one night checked out and moved back to the Ampersand.   The rooms are clean, spacious and well appointed.  The staff are sincerely polite, friendly and helpful.  A special thanks to Jerry the Doorman for making us feel like returning family.  We highly recommend the Ampersand for your stay in London.  It's great location is perfect, convenient and easy access to the Tube, restaurants, and galleries.

The only negative to the Ampersand is the Restaurant downstairs.  Do not go for dinner and if you have time to go elsewhere for breakfast, do that too.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful place to stay.  It would be a 5 star if they could fix the restaurant!",4,2022,07,13
129,The Perfect Hotel,"From the moment you walk through the door this hotel is fabulous. Beautiful surroundings, friendly and efficient staff, super clean rooms with comfy beds, good toiletries and tea/coffee/mini fridge with some complimentary drinks space for your own stuff. The very best location - moments from South Kensington tube, easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and attractions. It‚Äôs perfect! ",5,2022,07,12
129,2 night stay with partner. Good not excellent,"Good sized room and bathroom. Friendly and professional staff. 
Rooms were clean but not spotless. 
Finishes starting to look a little tired (areas of carpet starting to look worn, small section of wallpaper curling off wall in one area.
Lack of late night hours for bar/restaurant/room service and additional cost for breakfast disappointing ",4,2022,07,11
129,Wonderful overnight Birthday celebration,"We stayed here for my daughters 21st. Was close to the restaurant we were dining in. Check in very efficient, rooms were extremely comfortable and had lots of nice touches. Didn‚Äôt use restaurants or bar but sure they would have been lovely too.",5,2022,07,11
129,Brilliant location,"Fantastic location, just a two minute walk from South Kensington station.  Ideal for getting around London by Underground (unfortunately the station is not step free).  Helpful and friendly staff.  Would love to stay there again",5,2022,07,10
129,Oh how we love the Ampersand!,"We spent two glorious nights at the Ampersand. Everything was perfect - location, food, the high tea (we skipped the kiddie science project, haha), and the staff were all excellent. Our room was on the smaller side but had everything we needed. The beds were heavenly! The gym was perfect for a one hour workout. This is indeed the place to stay for a brief London visit!",5,2022,07,08
129,High Tech Amenities,"Great location. Very close to the Kensington tube station. Many choices for lunch, dinner, pubs, and desserts within a couple of blocks. The rooms are lovely and high tech. Desk staff all very helpful. Would book again without hesitation.",5,2022,07,07
129,Great Boutique Hotel / Home Base in Kensington,"We stayed at The Ampersand for 2 nights at the end of our 2-week road trip around the Cotswolds and Wales (at wolfestreettravel.com). We booked a suite, which was a little small, but did have a separate bedroom and living room, as well as a great bathroom and a tiny balcony. In addition to the location, the best aspect of the hotel is Apero, the hotel's cellar bar. Totally cool atmosphere, lively but not crowded, and excellent and responsive bartenders. We spent both late nights in Apero having cocktails and playing cards, and really enjoyed the experience.",5,2022,07,07
129,Really nice hotel,"Enjoyed the stay. Hotel is beautiful and the staff were all great. Location is amazing, right beside South Kensington tube so handy for getting anywhere you want in London and loads of everything on your doorstep.

Didn‚Äôt eat there at all, and were in the bar one night but it was not busy.

Thought that the communal areas could be better. The lounge area beside reception wasn‚Äôt welcoming most of the time as it was set for afternoon teas but nobody there? It should be for residents and that should take precedence in my opinion. Didn‚Äôt go in and sit at all and would have done.

The rooms didn‚Äôt have any long hanging space for dresses and it also didn‚Äôt have any mirror at the dressing table, both important to my partner! Seems a bit silly to have such as great dresser but no mirror.",4,2022,07,07
129,Stunning hotel,"We stayed here for a trip to Wimbledon. Took 15mins from Kings Cross station and hotel a 5min walk from the tube. Gorgeous hotel, ideal location with plenty of restaurants and cafes around. A short walk takes you to numerous sightseeing spots, park and the natural history museum. Well worth a stay.",5,2022,07,04
129,Great location and friendly staff,We enjoyed coming back to this hotel with a great location and very friendly staff. We could only get a small room for the first three nights which is very small and still quite expensive. Go for the superior room if you can. Everything else was perfect. ,5,2022,07,04
129,Concerts in London,"Fabulous hotel and amazing service, in a brilliant location close to Hyde park and lovely walks. I was there for a concert at the RAH. The hotel makes you love London even more and will definitely be back to stay soon.",5,2022,07,02
129,"Third stay, just as great as our previous stays.",We stayed at The Ampersand for a night in the February half term which also was very near to my daughter's birthday.¬† We contacted the hotel prior to our stay and booked directly with them because after having 2 previous amazing stays we didn't want to stay anywhere else.¬† On check in as always¬† Niels and the team were friendly and professional.¬†¬† We stayed in a lovely fourth floor room with a small terrace and my daughter was thrilled with her little birthday treat.¬† All in all another wonderful stay.¬†¬† The hotel for us is perfectly placed for where we want to be and we never have any concerns about where we will be staying because all of previous stays have been wonderful.¬†¬† Thanks again to Niels and the team. I'm sure we will be back again soon.¬†¬† We may try the afternoon tea on our next visit as it looks fab and the drawing room is beautiful.¬†¬† ,5,2022,06,30
129,Understated Elegance,The Ampersand is a gem. Understated from the outside and still quite a secret despite it having been around for eons. It does what is does quietly and is all the better for it. We come back often because the quality remains.,5,2022,06,28
129,5* staff and superb location,"We usually stay in a very well known iconic 5* hotel but due to our plans, needed to be in a different part of London. The location of this hotel was spot on for what we needed. It is extremely well positioned for very nice restaurants, great bakeries (hummingbird), V&A as well as the natural history. 
THE STAFF ARE SUPERB. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a smaller hotel but it felt like we were family. We were treated in such a lovely way and the staff/hotel made our anniversary celebrations that little bit more memorable. It is true what they say, you remember how someone makes you feel. We were even wished a ‚Äòhappy anniversary‚Äô as we left they hotel for our evening plans - nice touch! They even recognised us the next day and said hello how are you etc. Your service actually I would say, beats a lot of the staff in the more well known hotels. 
The hotel is lovely. We stayed in a suite which gave us loads of space and a lovely balcony (highly recommend). Plenty of space to store possessions and the kitchenette would be great for families (microwave, fridge etc). The bed and pillows were design and we both had a great nights sleep! The bathroom was beautiful and very clean! If I were to pick one issue I would say attention to detail when hoovering. The lounge area just had a few bits dotted about that had been missed. Also not keen on brown carpet but just being picky here. That goes to show how wonderful everything was. Everything else was spot on. I did do a lot of research before this trip but you still never know right? I‚Äôm well travelled and have stayed in many luxury hotels and one thing I love is there is no expectation to pay a service charge. A lot of places automatically add it. On the flip side, I‚Äôd like to have been given the option as the staff deserve it. I had a text about checking out so maybe tipping could be included in the text but still left to the customer‚Äôs discretion? The Ampersand, I can‚Äôt wait to return. I loved staying here and will return in the coming months. Thank you for everything!",5,2022,06,27
129,My stay at the Ampersand,"It was great, they exceeded my expectations.  The local pharmacy, restaurants and subway access made the stay extra special. The conciergerie service was exceptional  In the future, I will stay with the Ampersand Hotel.",5,2022,06,27
129,A whole experience!,Niels and his crew were attentive and friendly.  The hotel and room were perfect- lovely to come back to after a day of sightseeing!  The location was perfect without feeling like we were surrounded by tourists.,5,2022,06,25
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Excellent location (opposite underground and next to main buses)and when we booked the accommodation it was very reasonably priced. Rooms, we‚Äôre in a deluxe, well appointed, tea & coffee facilities, clean and pretty big by London standards. Breakfast was chaotic and checkout wasn‚Äôt as seamless as it could‚Äôve been. Still recommend though and overall stay was very good.",4,2022,06,20
129,Perfect location and great staff,"Hotel was lovely, restaurant and tea were great, lots to do around the hotel. Close to the bus (picks up near the front door) and Underground (station is basically across the street). Lots of restaurants nearby.  I‚Äôd stay here again! ",5,2022,06,19
129,Wonderful Trip!,"The Ampersand is our choice when we travel to London for comfort, location and very polite and welcoming staff.  The food at .Apero and The Drawing Rooms offer such a diverse choice of culinary delights‚Ä¶.not to be missed. ",5,2022,06,19
129,London Jewel,Fantastic location . Excellent service . Modern room with king size beds and superior bathroom . Staff is friendly and extremely helpful . Nice and cozy restaurant .subway station across the street . Many dining options walking distance ,5,2022,06,18
129,Second outstanding experience,"This was my second stay with you. I had considered trying a new location but am so happy I did not. I can only say thank you for training your staff so well! Everyone I encountered was so kind and always helpful and although I did not meet them, the housekeepers were outstanding. As part of the hotel industry I look for flaws and found nothing but the best in both of my stays at the Ampersand. I look forward to my next visit.   ",5,2022,06,18
129,An elegant experience,A highly responsive professional team throughout.  Rooms appointed to a high standard from smallest to the higher priced rooms.  Interesting collection of books to reflect the focus /interests of guests.  Hygiene and bedding very hugh standard too. ,5,2022,06,17
129,"Amazing place , great team","We had afternoon tea in the Drawing Room and after moved to the Restaurant bar, overall the food was super tasty and the service was amazing, every dish that came out was delicious and worthy of an instagram moment.
At the bar we had a great chat with their bartender Stiven who made the experience a lot more enjoyable, between lots of laughs he also advised us on which cocktails were a must try and best places to visit whilst in London. 
Next time we come to the city, will for sure stay here again, the team it‚Äôs great , compliments to the kitchen and staff. Thank you for everything",5,2022,06,16
129,LOVE THIS HOTEL!!,Great Hotel!!!  Loved everything about it! Rooms and Service were great.  Beautiful!  Very convenient to South Kensington Tube station providing easy access to Central London and Airport!  Near museums and Hyde Park. 12 minute walk to Harrods.  ,5,2022,06,13
129,"Nice Hotel, Poor Management","Nice hotel close to tube stop and museums. The hotel charges an additional  150 pounds for incidentals upon checking in but upon checkout never provided a detailed invoice of charges or breakdown of rates, fees, transactions, etc.  by email as requested. I have emailed the hotel management FOUR TIMES NOW and still waiting for a detailed invoice for my stay. This is not acceptable,  so BEWARE, get a detailed print out of your transactions at checkout as they will not email it to you. You have no idea what they are charging you for. I have traveled worldwide for decades and this is the first hotel I have had problems with checkout. For this reason, I cannot recommend this hotel.",2,2022,06,08
129,We'll be back,We have enjoyed again our secon stay in your hotel (we have already sent few of our friends to do the same and all of them have enjoyed thier stay) and we'll probably be back while we visit London (and by the way - thanks for having skysport to watch the NBA finals).,5,2022,06,07
129,Great London stay @ the Ampersand,Great hotel in a very centrally located area! Walkable to lots of places. Hotel itself was very nice with clean rooms & great customer service.  I would recommend it to all my friends & family planning a trip to London,5,2022,06,06
129,Truly Exquisite!,"I am a London addict.For over ten years I have visited the city twice to three times a year, staying in hotels in the Knightsbridge & Kensington area.
In 2022, having had a horrendous two years of covid working in the health service, I was treated to a stay in the Ampersand Hotel.
Truly Amazing!
Built in 1888 this Victorian boutique hotel has been stylishly modernised,whist retaining the atmosphere & style of the original building.I loved the softly squeaking floorboards, sweeping staircase, sloping ceilings & charming corridors; so different from the generic run of the mill hotels so prevalent in all major cities nowadays. 
I stayed in a deluxe double room with floor to ceiling windows fronting onto Harrington st in the heart of South Kensington & a two minute walk from the tube station to Heathrow. 
The room was immaculate, super luxurious & yet so comfortable. I loved the striped wall-papered, double sinked bathroom, complete with L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries. The underfloor heating and the over bath tv seemed utterly decadent!
The staff are so professional yet welcoming & friendly & happily stored my luggage until I  was texted that my room was ready. The Ampersand rubber duck & fully stocked complimentary minibar were the cherry on the cake. Could not fault my entire stay & would love to return to the Ampersand again soon!

129,Wonderful stay,"Excellent hotel. Very helpful staff. Great service with extremely helpful and competent staff. Comfortable bed with high quality linen and pillows. Great bathroom with powerful shower, fluffy gowns and expensive, beautifully fragrant toiletries. 10 minute walk to Harrods, surrounded by parks and lots of great restaurants nearby including a taxi rank right outside!  They kindly added a bed for my 14 year old daughter as we didn‚Äôt want her to stay in a room on her own. She was very comfortable. Great stay! Thank you",5,2022,06,05
129,"Great location, great value",Elegant hotel in a perfect location for exploring the city. Staff works hard to make every client feel like a special guest. South Kensington underground station is a few steps away with multiple locations nearby for dining.,5,2022,06,04
129,"Fantastic Hotel, excellent Location and very friendly staff","We retired to the Ampersand Hotel and were again perfectly happy with the whole experience. While we have chosen a smaller room this time, it was still roomy for London standards, had a super comfy huge bed and everything you need. We definitely will come back and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2022,06,01
129,The coolest place in  South Kensington,"Beautiful building. Rooms are cozy and complete, with comfortable beds and pillows and a superb shower. 

Bar and restaurant are very cool, delicated decorated and they both offered great quality of food and drinks.
Location is excellent, near two tube stations",5,2022,05,31
129,5* Excellence,"Had afternoon tea here a while back, but lockdown prevented us from sleeping over. So glad we were at last able to spend the night. Thumbs up from all 3 of us.
A little disappointed that I didn't get a birthday macaroon to compliment my celebrations ",4,2022,05,29
129,Great hotel,"Trendy Hotel in a great location. Small double is indeed very small, but not a huge problem. Only issue is the restricted view from the window. However, as we were out all day this did not spoil our trip. Cleanliness in all areas was first class.",5,2022,05,28
129,Perfect choice,"Good value, pretty hotel, very good location. Hotel has easy access to transportation .  It is walking distance to famous museums and great shopping.  The neighborhood has lots of restaurants and cafes.",4,2022,05,27
129,Lovely hotel,This is a lovely hotel in a good location not far from the Victoria and Albert museum with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. The staff are very efficient and helpful. The room was very clean and perfect for a short stay. Dinner in Apero was very good.,5,2022,05,26
129,A comfortable and excellent experience,We stayed because of our daughter's wedding and we found the location and ambiance of the hotel perfect for this special event. The staff were very friendly and helpful to me personally with my mobility problems and I liked the personal touches the hotel provided.,5,2022,05,24
129,Ampersand And More...,"Excited to land in London after not having travelled for a while.  Hotel over delivered on the location and access, plus the excellent breakfast offerings.  Jerry at the door was very engaging, and could not do more to make our stay so pleasant.  

We did change rooms at the beginning, as the room we were allocated was very small, and looked at a brick wall.  As we had booked a while back and it was a holiday, we wanted something with fresh air, and at least some sky.  Luckily this was not a problem, and we were moved to a new room on the 5th floor which we loved.  The location is ideal for getting around London, and the interior of the breakfast space, was ideal.  Gym was also well maintained and handy.    I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes high tea, a lovely decor and cares about a healthy morning start.",5,2022,05,24
129,Good to be Back,"This is always such a reliable hotel for central London, with an excellent team who coped well with a large booking. It has a calm and friendly environment and the rooms are always very comfortable and well presented. Service for dinner and breakfast was a little slow, but that‚Äôs understandable given how the industry is adjusting to being so busy again. However the quality of the food was good and the atmosphere was great. I‚Äôll definitely be booking again for my next trip. ",4,2022,05,22
129,Excellent hotel,Very nice and charming hotel. Perfectly located. Nice staff. Overall I recommend The Ampersand. Even though the room was small it was perfect for us. I recommend to have the breakfast to the room since that in itself is very nice.,5,2022,05,20
129,Fantastic,"This is a lovely hotel, perfect position, within walking distance to so much, tube station half a minute away, taxi rank just outside, the  staff were delightful, without exception charming and courteous and lovely. We shall use it again and again",5,2022,05,20
129,Always an excellent experience,"Ampersand always lives up to expectations. Very good service, clean and comfortable rooms and a great location in London. Did not use the restaurant on this occasion but previous experience has been very good.",5,2022,05,17
129,A Wonderful Stay,"We had the most wonderful time at the Ampersand. We stayed for 3 nights and then returned for a further 4 nights on our return to London. The first room was a little tight, however the bed was most comfortable, whilst the second room was far more comfortable, the bathroom was tiny & the bed was extremely soft & uncomfortable. The complementary daily treats in the room is a very thoughtful gesture. The staff were amazing and most welcoming & accommodating. The hotel has a lovely vibrancy and is always busy with people coming and going for high teas etc. We enjoyed our stay & will hopefully be back before the end of the year.",5,2022,05,17
129,Boutique Hotel in South Kensington Area,LOVED this intimate yet elegant hotel.  We were welcomed with warm staff that supported our every need.  It felt elegant and regal to stay here.  Breakfast was excellent along with best coffee ever.  We will definitely come back. ,5,2022,05,16
129,Amazing Hotel and Service,"Beautiful hotel in not only an extremely convenient location, across from South Kensington tub station and lots of great restaurants, but it's also in great proximity to Hyde Park and several museums.  The staff are exceptional as well.  Super friendly and always willing to help with anything you need..reservations, making copies, finding space for our work team, etc. 

I'll definitely be back. Only caveat, stay away from their smallest rooms.  The upgraded rooms have a good amount of space but their small rooms are claustrophobic.",5,2022,05,09
129,Best hotel experience I've ever had!,"We stayed to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and I'm so glad we chose this hotel as it made the trip thoroughly special. The staff, the room, the general atmosphere were all delightful. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and I can't wait to stay there again.",5,2022,05,07
129,So looking forward to coming back to this beautiful hotel!,"This hotel exceeded our expectation in every aspect.  I don't even know where to begin.  It is located in the so called ""French quarter"" part of London with the French embassy just around the corner.  We did not use the nearby tube station due to the pandemic but it is nonetheless convenient for those who are brave enough to continue to ride the subway.  There are museums nearby: V & A, Natural history, Science and a small music museum housed inside of the Royal College of Music.  Within 5 min of walk, you can find the following cuisines: French, Italian, Mediterranean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Polish, Thai and of course, British pub food.  There is also bubble tea, gelato (Snowflakes) and the list goes on and on.  Now onto the hotel.  It is absolutely gorgeous and spotless.  The rooms are small but that is to be expected for London.  The complimentary snack bar and beverages is a nice touch.  We slept quite well because the comfortable bed.  We had breakfast included in our room rate and it was fabulous.  The menu had great variety and the portion was generous. In fact, we kept telling them to give us smaller portions as we did not want to waste any food.  The fruit salad was all fresh fruits and delicious, as was the Greek yogurt with granola.  Who can resist the full English breakfast?  The presentation of the food was also quite nice.  Should definitely try the breakfast at the hotel.  We did not do the tea time at the hotel but it looked very busy every day and the room where it takes place is bright and colorful.   The only small complaint we have is we never figured out how to control the room temperature.  It was either too cold or too hot but we did not approach hotel for help so can't fault them on that.  Housekeeping does a very good job in refreshing the rooms.  The gym is open 24 hours.  We were surprised that we needed a COVID test to return to the States the night before our flight home and we were in a panic mood, but the front desk quickly directed us to a pharmacy 3 min away and we got what we needed and crisis solved.  All in all, we had a great stay and so happy we found this hotel.  The details matter and we were just amazed at how well managed this hotel is.  We travel quite a bit and this is by far one the best hotels we have ever stayed at.  This will be our designated hotel  in London moving forward.",5,2022,05,06
129,Excellent Stay,My friend and I stayed at The Ampersand to celebrate my 30th birthday and the whole experience was beyond expectation!  The staff were lovely and were always willing to lend a helping hand in case I needed anything.,5,2022,05,03
129,Great location and very comfortable.,Great location and very comfy super king bed. Opted for the larger room which was a great call. Really close to South Ken tube and walking distance from so many great attractions. The hotel is good value for money. Have stayed here before in one of the smaller rooms and glad this time we had a delux room that was much larger. Bed was so comfortable.,5,2022,05,03
129,Very convinient location and nice play to stay,"The hotel is very well located, 1 minute to South Kensington tube station. The restaurant is good enough to stay after an intese day of activity in London. The service was really friendly and the hotel and restaurant are very family friendly. We were with an eleven years old girl, and they treated her pretty well.

Very good place for families.",5,2022,05,03
129,"Good location, friendly stuff and great stay","Had a really good stay in this hotel. The hotel stuff was really helpful and friendly. The room was specious, clean and fresh with a comfy bed. The location of the hotel was perfect with a walking distance of many beautiful places. Highly recommend!",5,2022,05,03
129,Great experience!,"Such a beautiful hotel, excellent location in South Kensington. The rooms were lovely, and the bed was SO comfortable. The staff was helpful and responsive. We didn't eat at the hotel, but ordered many lattes. The hotel also left a nice little tray of sweets for my husbands birthday, which was very appreciated.",4,2022,04,27
129,Gem in south ken,"Perfect hotel in South Ken with a sweet restaurant/bar in the basement. Really lovely staff who make the whole experience a real pleasure. Good quality throughout. Food excellent   Be aware that the standard double rooms are, as they say on their website, small - suitable for short stay. ",5,2022,04,21
129,Excellent stay & superb staff!,"Great location in South Ken. 
Superb staff; incredibly helpful & friendly.
Excellent food & service.
Ideally placed for museums & parks.
Priced competitively for London.
Consistent, high-quality hotel.",5,2022,04,19
129,Excellent stay,Great hotel. Location was perfect. Central location and  a short walk away from the circle line. I got one of the smaller double rooms. For two people it is perfect for a day or two but keep in mind it is a bit of a tight squeeze especially if you have full size bags. The bathroom was spacious  and I could spend hours under the rain shower head. If I have to find fault with anything it would be the creaky floor boards.,5,2022,04,18
129,Daughter's 5th birthday,"The hotel went out of their way to make our daughter's birthday special including chocolates, activity pack, mini robe and slippers, hot choc, bookmark, biscuit and a special note. It made her stay.

Very good (Inc gluten free and child) options for breakfast. 

Room comfy and had cbeebies. Loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom.

Afternoon tea was magical and an experience for the little one.

The only improvements would be choice of decafe tea in the room, at breakfast and in the afternoon tea. Also I would recommend swapping the chicken sandwich on the gluten free afternoon tea to another option.

Great staff and a wonderful stay in a great location (opposite south ken tube and 2 mins from natural history museum).",5,2022,04,16
129,Excellent Hotel in a Convenient London Location,"I stayed here recently for four nights. Excellent - rooms are what I would call ""London-Sized"" in that they would be considered small by 90% of the world, but I am familiar with this. Rooms were well-decorated and very clean, bathroom modern and well-stocked with quality toiletries and - even though I faced the street - had a very good night's sleep each night. Staff friendly and helpful - none of the brusque-ness you encounter at some hotels in London. Very good stay - would return.",5,2022,04,13
129,Great short stay,"Fabulous location, friendly staff and incredibly comfortable bed. A good choice of breakfast options which was well presented and tasted good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Great 2 night stay.",5,2022,04,13
129,"Beautiful, friendly hotel in lovely area of London","This lovely boutique hotel in South Kensington is well worth a visit, particularly if you like museums and quality shopping, as it is near some of the best in London. It also has bus stops and a tube station just round the corner giving easy access to every area of London. The area is peaceful in an evening which is the perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of the over-crowded West End. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautifully styled and furnished. The bathrooms have heated floors, fluffy towels and bathrobes, slippers and luxury toiletries. It is worth every penny.",5,2022,04,12
129,S. Kensington,"Great location!  Amazingly helpful staff!!  Check-in was a breeze, got there early, they held my luggage and placed in my room. 
Room had a beautiful view!  But had some noisy something in the wall.  Maybe old pipes?  And, room was hot, even with climate system turned off and window open. 
Will stay there again!  Convenient to S. Kensington tube!!!",5,2022,04,09
129,An normal stay,"Fot a 5 star hotel it is just ok.
Very clean, good size room, but I did not find anything peculiar or different from a good 4 star hotel.

Nice location, very closed to South Kensinghton tube station.

The restaurant (kind of italian food) was fine, nothing special, a little but costy. 

Overall a good stay but do not expect to treat yourself.",3,2022,04,07
129,Beautiful hotel,"The decoration is beautiful and of high quality. The hotel is very well located in a nice area near Hyde Park, the underground and several museums. Perfect for visiting the city. Good dinner at the Apero. ",5,2022,04,03
129,Amazing stay,"Having read the other great reviews we were interested to see how well it lived up to our expectations. Well, I can say that it far exceeded what we thought it would be like. It is a wonderful hotel in a great location, we had an immaculate, huge and beautiful room. The communal areas were finished to a very high standard and as soon as we walked in there was a lovely clean fresh smell. Staff were very friendly and helpful and we were granted a late check out. It was a perfect stay.",5,2022,04,03
129,Good location,"Deluxe double was a terrible squeeze, felt like a prison cell. Small window, no view. Distance between wall and side of the bed minuscule . No dressing table to use with hairdryer and lack of mirror for makeup.  Service at breakfast terrible, requested a second cup of coffee but left because fed up with waiting.  The hotel has a good location and staff were friendly. ",3,2022,03,29
129,family visit,very well located and next to underground. in the morning you can run in Hyde Park which is 300m away. the museums are next door and you can jump on the bus for a guide tour wright in front of the hotel,4,2022,03,29
129,London in South Kensington,"It was a pleasure to stay with you and we will come back soon. Quiet hotel rooms, perfekt service, very obliging, very close to Chelsea, bus stop in front of the hotel, nice restaurants around the area.
",5,2022,03,28
129,Disappointing,"I usually take time out to write reviews when something has been exceptional but felt obliged to share my underwhelming experience of this hotel. I booked the Ampersand for one night so we could visit our daughter who lives in London. We stayed in South Kensington last time and it‚Äôs a great location. The hotel is very close to tube station which is fab but they weren‚Äôt stopping there on our visit. We arrived and check in was ok, small reception but efficient. Entering the room was the biggest disappointment, so tiny! Whilst it was described as a small double we really were shocked with the compact room and bathroom. Nowhere to get ready properly for 2 people. As only one night and no time we had to rush out. Hard to navigate rote to bathroom round tiny space- bed almost up against side. The window didn‚Äôt open much and we had a hot stuffy night. We were offered a text checkout but checking my bill on screen showed a different room number bill. Not a great end! 
I mentioned our experience to check out staff and she said she would put a note in for next time but I said there probably wouldn‚Äôt be a next time. Simply not good enough and then no real response to my concerns.",3,2022,03,27
129,Amazing stay! I strongly recommend!,"Our stay couldn't have gone any better, everything was perfect. It was a family trip for a very special event and all went beyond our expectations. The whole hotel is superb: fantastic rooms, extremely comfortable beds, delicious breakfast options, convenient location and transportation around and amazing staff. I can't recommend it enough.",5,2022,03,21
129,Excellent stay and beautiful hotel,Beautiful hotel in a great location. Staff are always very helpful and welcoming and the rooms are designed well with comfortable facilities. Worth trying the restaurant which is excellent for all meals ,5,2022,03,21
129,BEST HOTEL IN LONDON!,"If you are looking for somewhere to stay in a convenient location, clean room and very good service, this is the one! All my friends who stayed there are very happy and satisfied!  Lovely room, very welcoming atmosphere. Staffs are always available to help when needed. Lovely coffee and tea with biscuits in the room too! ",5,2022,03,18
129,very nice,"lovely hotel ,   amazing location for south kensington tube .   staff very nice and friendly,   beautiful communal areas .  lovely decor.    stayed in a suite.   ""seating"" area in suite very disappointing ,  poor layout and very small. overall layout and size of suite a bit disappointing.    bedroom lovely but extremely poor lighting.  bathroom amazing.  kitchenette area very well stocked and well thought out.  lovely bar /  restaurant area in basement of hotel..    would definitely stay again but would request different room. would rate the room  good rather than average but no option for this    would also rate the value good ,   but again no option.",4,2022,03,17
129,Love this hotel!,"The hotel is spotlessly clean, rooms are well equipped with toiletries, tea/coffee and cold drinks in fridge. Staff are very friendly, helpful and efficient. Location is superb - 2 mins walk to tube, lots of shops/restaurants close by, a few minutes walk to the museums and easy walk to Knightsbridge, Kensington high St, Sloane sq etc. love it! ",5,2022,03,15
129,Overall nice,"Overall it is a nice stay! The location is incredible! We had 2 days arranged in the museums and one day in Harrods, and they're all in 5-10 mins walk away which is amazing. The bed is really comfy and I especially love the heated floor in the bathroom. The toiletries are brilliant and the shower is AMAZING (I love this so much as not many hotels offer this powerful and super duper hot shower). 

Unfortunately, the room is slightly a bit small but with this great location and the price rate, I think that's definitely reasonable. Our window is not as open and bright as I thought it is going to be, but we didn't stay indoor much anyway so it wasn't an issue with us. 

The mini bar is free, the room is really quiet, and if you'd like breakfast outside of hotel there are tons to explore near the hotel. A lot of great options when it comes to food as well around the hotel and it is literally next to South Ken tube which is super convenient. 

We really enjoyed our stay and would 100% recommend! We look forward to staying in Ampersand again next time we're in London!",5,2022,03,13
129,Concert at Royal Albert Hall,Great location for the royal Albert hall and natural history museum and Gloucester Road area. Beautiful hotel and room which was spotless and the staff were so friendly and helpful they couldn‚Äôt do enough would definitely recommend this hotel,5,2022,03,10
129,The Ampersand Hotel is OUTSTANDING!,"Bee and staff were extremely attentive to our every need, but not in an intrusive way. The room was beautiful, spotless, and the bed was oh so comfortable! They sent a box of chocolates for my birthday and were incredibly helpful throughout our stay regarding a variety of requests :) We will always stay at the Ampersand when in London!",5,2022,03,07
129,London,Loved the hotel and the location and would stay again and look forward to it . Most of the staff were fantastic except for the desk staff and doorman when I was trying to check out and get to the airport.,4,2022,03,03
129,Lovely experience,"My husband and I visited Ampersand Hotel for afternoon 2 years ago. At that time, it was unfortunate the service, although good, was less than I would have expected. However the staff looked into my concerns straightaway and invited us to come back. It took us 2 years because of Covid but once again the setting and atmosphere was lovely and the food was amazing. We took our 2 daughters with us, aged 5 and nearly 2, and the staff were really attentive. We ordered kids afternoon tea for my 5 year old only, but staff brought a hot chocolate and additional treats for my younger daughter too which we really appreciated. It's a slightly different afternoon tea experience as it is science themed and the kids one is interactive, which enhances the experience for them. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,03,01
129,Perfect modern hotel,"Everything you need for a great stay. The hotel is in a great location right next to South Kensington tube and very close to the V&A, natural history and science museums. Staff were friendly and helpful without being over-fussy. Just right to give the hotel a contemporary buzz. Highly recommended.",5,2022,02,28
129,Regular Visitor,"Have stayed a number of times over the last 12 months. The hotel has everything we need - good rooms, friendly staff and a good restaurant. Public rooms and bedrooms are well decorated. Nearby parking is a plus. The location of the hotel is perfect for our needs.",5,2022,02,25
129,Excellent!,"Super clean comfortable room, great location for visiting London ,very  friendly staff  always making sure everything was going well for us.The hotel provided a hot chocolate and biscuits for my daughter .",5,2022,02,24
129,Perfect family weekend break,"Lovely bright, clean hotel in an excellent location. Family of five so we had two rooms. Hotel ensured these were beside each other. They weren‚Äôt interconnecting but this was not an issue - hotel offered us interconnecting rooms but would have meant a downgrade in room size. The deluxe superior double room was excellent and very spacious. The extra touches for the kids (hot chocolate, treats, small bath robes) went down so well. Staff were very attentive, following up to check we were happy with the rooms or if there was anything they could assist with. Hotel location is great - walking distance to museums, Hyde park etc and two minutes walk to South Kensington tube to travel elsewhere in London. Lots of great shops, cafes, restaurants nearby too. Brilliant choice of hotel for a family trip to London",5,2022,02,22
129,Lovely hotel perfectly located,"We stayed in a suite with our one year old daughter. Her cot was set up on arrival with a cute little baby bathrobe in the room also which was a nice touch. The bedroom was beautiful and very spacious, the living room was more basic but lots of space with a well equipped kitchenette. It was perfect for a family break with extremely comfortable beds and the whole place was spotless. We would definitely recommend.",5,2022,02,21
129,A belated Christmas gift,"You would not be let down at this hotel. So much is on offer- games room, library and gym. 

Accommodation is clean, comfortable and chic. Breakfast had a variety of choice to suit all. Staff are exceptional. You are looked after from arrival to departure. ",5,2022,02,21
129,Will be booking again,"Wonderful two nights at the Ampersand. Thoughtful staff, excellent food, service, stylish rooms. Spotless throughout the hotel. The little touches for my daughters birthday were very kind and made the visit all the more memorable. Would definitely recommend and will certainly book again",5,2022,02,19
129,Beautiful stay,"A simply beautiful, well appointed hotel with everything that you would expect of a high end hotel room. Beds very comfortable, rooms exceptionally clean and a nicely stocked, complimentary mini bar. I would recommend the Ampersand. ",4,2022,02,19
129,Overnight stay in London,"Conveniently located close to South Kensington underground station. Beautifully decorated hotel, luxurious rooms which unfortunately did not cater well to the female guest. (Nowhere to style hair in front of a mirror for example). Complimentary continental breakfast is best avoided. ",4,2022,02,19
129,Loved staying here!,"I‚Äôm so glad we booked this hotel. The location was great, tube station was a 2 minute walk and lots of eateries in the area.
Our room was spotlessly clean and had lots of lovely touches like complimentary soft drinks, L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries, vanity kits. We slept really well as the bed was so comfortable. 
The underfloor heating in the bathroom was great! 
Staff members were welcoming and friendly and the hotel decor was beautiful. The light fixture in the stairwell is stunning and we loved the artwork. 
I would thoroughly recommend staying here.",5,2022,02,16
129,weekday stay Feb 2022,Our third stay at the Ampersand and as before we found a high standard of room cleanliness and attention to detail. The staff were welcoming and courteous at all times. We cannot fault the service-good value for the excellent location.,5,2022,02,11
129,"We will be back, very soon!","Location perfect for V&A, Royal Albert Hall, Harrods. 

Outstanding hotel in every aspect from amazing staff, beautiful room with all your needs, and a delicious breakfast. 
I wish we'd discovered this little gem long ago.",5,2022,02,05
129,Wonderful hotel,"Such a lovely hotel in a brilliant location in South Kensington.

Nothing was too much trouble‚Ä¶ the complimentary soft drinks and room upgrade were a lovely touch.

Highly recommend this hotel and will absolutely book to stay again.",5,2022,02,01
129,A Gem in South Ken,"Great hotel with amazing staff and service.  We'll be back.
Our only negative was the lack of a plug near a mirror for doing hair/makeup plus the lighting was very unflattering!  Furthermore, the tv in the bathroom was temperamental.  None of this really ruined our experience though and all the staff were wonderful!",5,2022,01,31
129,Excellent,Thoroughly enjoyed it. Would certainly recommend it. It was a pleasure. We had a large room with a bath by the window. Very spacious. The decor was excellent. The staff are friendly. Highly recommended.,5,2022,01,29
129,excellent stay at the hotel,"Amazing boutique hotel and very helpful staff
 We will certainly come back as well situated in London and we were welcomed  with friendly people all along our stay!
We had an amazing experience...
Thank you so much! ",5,2022,01,29
129,A Gem in the heart of South Kensington,"The Ampersand was a great find for me. I have been fortunate to have been staying in 5 star hotels throughout the world, including several in London.  I favour boutique hotels and have decided that The Ampersand is my London hotel for the future.  The location, so close to South Ken Underground, the V&A, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge is unique.  Finally, it is great value; 5 star experience at 4 star prices.",5,2022,01,29
129,Afternoon tea fun,"We took our 4yr old here as they have a science themed afternoon tea which caters to both children and adults. Although we had reserved for the wrong day (we arrived a day early) they let us stay.

The waiter who served us did really well in engaging with our daughter.

We had a mini 'science experiment' while the afternoon teas were made- lemonade which changed colour.

Our daughter was in awe at her rocket afternoon tea stand and the dry ice that was added. She had fun melting her astronaut and adding the sprinkles and marshmallows to it. It had a good selection of things that she ate although she was stealing chocolates from ours as well. The single quibble was her mini hot dog could have done with some sauce. She enjoyed rolling her planet cake pop in sprinkles as well. At the end was the box where using a brush you expose a dinosaur biscuit and chocolate. 

The adult selection was good as well with generous filled sandwiches and smoked salmon and desert range. The passionfruit curd in a squeezy tube was a winner! The white choc mousse planet was our favourite.

I'd happily take her back again.",5,2022,01,26
129,Character and comfort,"Old hotel with lots of character after a refurbishment.
Very friendly and helpful staff and the most comfortable bed and the cellar bar has great atmosphere and a wide range of unusual cocktails for a very reasonable price. ",5,2022,01,24
129,Lovely hotel but suite with kitchen not suitable to use,"We've stayed in the suites before and loved them. But this time only 2 dinner plates, 1 small plate and no bowls. No washing up liquid to reuse them and no bin liner to dispose of food - it was not equipped to use the kitchen as a kitchen. This needs to improve! We requested more plates and bowls and only received 1 bowl. We discovered fridges were broken the next morning when they had defrosted all over our food - this was fixed as soon as we made the complaint. As we stayed Friday-Monday we didn't get much sleep on Friday or Saturday night due to the noise from the hight street until around 3am and also the room was too hot despite the air con being on the lowest setting and it was December. Room was very comfortable and spacious, staff were very helpful and Friendly and service for afternoon tea was lovely. We will stay again knowing the high standard the hotel usually is, but they need to improve the use of the suite!",3,2022,01,10
129,A very comfortable stay,Stayed here recently to meet up with family for a birthday celebration. Staff were very helpful and friendly and we really enjoyed the 'science' afternoon tea. Nice large bedroom which was spotless and excellent provision of quality toiletries etc. We would definitely stay at the Ampersand again,5,2022,01,09
129,"Not a 5* Hotel , Great Location","I don't want to go through how disappointed we've been as ive contacted the hotel . However in short , the hotel is a great location , we asked for a twin room , we got a double bed frame with two single mattresses . room tiny , dark and way too hot , and this is in dec . toilet would not be suitable for larger person due to being squashed against a wall . no coffee machine , just an old cafeti√®re with its filter failing so you got grains all in the cup . didn't eat in the hotel at all due to the room experience . This was a surprise trip for my daughter (age 13) Christmas present , so I could not complain whilst there as this would have made the experience even worse. the positive of this hotel is the location , staff were friendly . would we book again ...... I think I would be way to concerned about the rooms . ",2,2022,01,06
129,Amazing stay as always!,"This hotel never disappoints. We are repeaters guests.
The location is amazing next to the museums and South Ken tube.
Amenities and room cleaned at super standard. 
Staff always so polite and attentive.
We will be back!
Fully recommend it. 
Thank you Neil and team.",5,2022,01,04
129,Perfect in every way,"This was our second stay at the Ampersand.  We stayed over the New Year's Eve period and our stay was just perfect.  Prior to our stay I had been in communication with Niels and from our first contact to leaving he was exceptional and went above and beyond.  We received a room upgrade to a stunning fifth floor suite and I must say this suite was very comfortable indeed.   We enjoyed breakfast for the two mornings in Apero and again the food and service were exceptional.   Front desk staff were again 5 star, extremely polite and helpful.  I cannot rate the Ampersand highly enough, if you are looking for a perfect hotel in London then this is the one for you.  2 minutes walk from Natural History Museum and a short walk to London's finest shops.  Lastly, the ping pong table was a huge hit with our daughter.  This hotel really is hard to beat.   ",5,2022,01,03
129,An amazing hotel,"One of the best city hotels we have stayed. Great rooms, service, attention to detail, great location! There are only positives we can think about our stay. Lovely touches also in the room for families with small children. Highly recommend.",5,2021,12,31
129,Excellent stay in South Kensington.,"Great hotel, staff & location. Food is of high quality and hotel facilities are good. Excellent location for access to museums & a short cab into central London. Staff are friendly & attentive without adding extras charges for simple requests. Recommended!",5,2021,12,28
129,Winter wonderland in Kensington,"Winter wonderland stay, at the Ampersand where the excellence of London shines. The sumptuous Hotel & family friendly staff make this holiday location feel like a real holiday.
Right next to the natural history museum, science museum, Hyde Park, and South Kensington tube. Too many restraints and quick bites/long breakfasts to mention. This neighbourhood has it all.",5,2021,12,23
129,Great Hotel; great access to Underground,We had a fine stay at this location would highly recommend it. Room was clean and for the (larger) room we reserved it was quite sizable and comfortable. Access to South Kensington Tube Station is 100M away. ,5,2021,12,15
129,1 Night Stay,"1 Night stay with my partner - location was fantastic, room was beautiful with a fantastic comfy bed and beautiful bathroom. Team were exceptional. We will definitely be back and look forward to staying again soon! ",5,2021,12,13
129,Return to the familiar,"It was two years since our last visit to London and stayed at The Ampersand but all the familiar feelings were still present, meaning it felt like meeting up with a very good friend once again to pick up the conversation where we left off. Now we have returned home, I'm sure it won't be as long before the conversation continues again.",5,2021,12,13
129,Great hotel but make sure you ask for a better room,"location and service was great. 2 mins from underground and 5 to 10 mins from museums and Hyde Park. Bus nearby goes to Harrods and Chinatown.  I have stayed in the same hotel for a few times. But this time I chose deluxe (also higher price). Then I found that they just make the bathroom smaller to make the room bigger. I cant even close the door if I didnt lean on one side. I should have picked the normal room. Except that, everything is super.",4,2021,12,10
129,Birthday stay - Amazing experience,My girlfriend and I stayed here for her birthday and had an amazing experience. The hotel staff put rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart and sent up two complimentary glasses of champagne. Would definitely recommend the Ampersand Hotel !!,5,2021,12,09
129,Highly recommend,"We needed a hotel in central London just for one night so we could meet friends and see the Christmas lights. The hotel and its staff were EXTRAORDINARY. The attention to detail, the willingness to help, the location, and high-end accessories were all wonderful. There is nothing at all that I would fault this fabulous hotel on.",5,2021,12,09
129,Three Night Stay,"Check in fine.
Room was a decent size, a little dark, bed really comfortable.  
Bathroom small but fine, very clean and good l'occitane products
Had complimentry breakfast, in the most it was fine but service very slow.  One morning only wanted porridge and it took forever then it was cold, and then second one cold.  The reastuarant is open to non guessed which is understanable but I feel this encrouches on the hotel guests.  

Location is good and I would maybe stay again.",4,2021,12,07
129,Natural History Museum experience,"An excellent hotel  location in support of a wedding reception held at the nearby Natural History Museum. Excellent staff, together with a comfortable and relaxing room made for a most enjoyable - but too brief - stay",5,2021,12,06
129,Great hotel and location,"Although this was not the most luxurious 5* hotel I‚Äôve stayed in london, it was very cosy, the location was excellent and the beds super comfortable. Staff was great and they have a gym. An indoor pool/ spa would be nice if you‚Äôre staying for longer than a night but we didn‚Äôt.",5,2021,12,06
129,Wonderful Experience,"The Ampersand is a lovely boutique hotel with friendly, helpful staff.  We stayed as a birthday treat and received an upgrade on arrival, very welcome although unexpected, the room was of a high standard of cleanliness and comfort and after a theatre visit we came back to petit fours in the room, again a lovely surprise.  The food and drink in the restaurant was delicious too.   Would highly recommend and will more than happily stay again",5,2021,12,06
129,Great hotel for families,"We stayed here in 4 rooms as a group of extended families. The location was brilliant, still central but it felt quieter and away from hustle and bustle. Most importantly it was quiet at night and we all slept well.
They left small robes and slippers for the kids which they loved! Also hot chocolate and cookies were left at bedtime so that was a lovely little touch for our young children.
Food, drinks and service was great. Rooms were clean and the suite worked well with the extra bedroom. We would recommend to is hotel and will hopefully stay again when we visit London next year ",5,2021,12,06
129,Lovely stay,"This was the second time I stayed at the Ampersand Hotel. The service was terrific, the room was great, and the location is just perfect. Highly recommend this hotel. A big thanks to the entire staff for their warmth and hospitality. ",5,2021,12,05
129,Delightful treat,The service is top-notch. Staff very attentive and responsive. We stayed for my wife's birthday mostly because I wanted to treat her to the Science Afternoon Tea - which is just wonderful - such fun and with attention too detail (also available with everything gluten free which was perfect for me). After the tea the earlier appeared at our room and surprise us both with a happy birthday plate and candle. Our only compliant was that the room /bed got a bit hot even with the window open. They do have air-con but we're not big fans of air-con. But overall a real treat.,5,2021,12,04

129,Mummy and Son night away,Such a wonderful stay with my 6 year old little boy just us! We enjoyed a fabulous science afternoon tea. Natural history museum is such a short walk we did that in the morning. Staff are so friendly especially Imran and Anna at front desk. This is a fantastic luxury hotel in London for children. ,5,2021,11,30
129,Great for family vacation,"We spent a week at The Ampersand Hotel in late November. We are a family of four; our kids are 4 and 6 years old. It was our children's first trip to Europe from the US. We stayed in a suite, which were good sized rooms for our family: larger than other European hotels we have stayed in the past. The kids loved their child-sized robes and activity packs they received at check-in. As our kids were jet-lagged and exhausted from full days, we ended up ordering room service for dinner twice. The food was excellent and very reasonable. The room service for breakfast was also reasonable and very quick/convenient. 

The location was great. We walked to several neighborhood restaurants (breakfast and dinner), and it's just across the street from the South Kensington tube stop. The buses were easy also, and there's a bus stop basically right outside the hotel. We never had a problem catching a taxi. The hotel staff helped direct us to a pharmacy for our covid testing and were very helpful in general. 

We did a lot of research before selecting a hotel and were very pleased with the Ampersand. It felt like a good value compared to other hotels we were considering.  We will most likely stay there on our next trip to London, unless we have a much larger budget and decide on a more posh hotel a little Northeast of the Kensington area.",5,2021,11,29
129,Very disappointed,The whole experience from when we entered our room was disappointing the bed was really soft and the air conditioning was too loud even when off. They do not understand how to cater for vegans even though we gave them lots of notice before arriving and they assured us it would be no problem. Staff look unhappy and overworked! Understaffed. ,1,2021,11,29
129,Lovely hotel and location but‚Ä¶,"The Ampersand is in a lovely hotel in a beautiful location and has a great feel to it. However upon getting to our room we found the carpet was very, very damp. Housekeeping came and explained that this was due to the carpet being cleaned, which is great but‚Ä¶ I do not expect to be walking around on a damp floor as it isn‚Äôt pleasant.
When I asked what they could do about it we were given towels to be put down. I found the situation between the three staff in our room to feel slightly confrontational so I agreed to this.
To be walking around on towels when I have come for a nice weekend away really isn‚Äôt what I expect of any hotel, let alone a 5 star one. 
Other than that I couldn‚Äôt fault the Ampersand.",4,2021,11,28
129,Lovely hotel in great location,"I love this hotel. It has a great location in South Kensington, a few steps away from the tube station, minutes walk from museums and in a buzzy area full of cafes and small shops. The hotel is elegant, staff friendly and helpful and room was well equipped, spotlessly clean and super comfy bed.",5,2021,11,27
129,very good if travelling with kids,"excellent hotel - not cheap but very comfortable and with very professional, friendly, and engaged staff. does NOT have the slightly soulless feel of the large chains! very well situated for the big museums. very good with kids.",4,2021,11,26
129,3 stars at best,"5 star, not sure how. Stayed last night the 24th of November in a bedroom suite, room 508. Upon arrival the stink from the bathroom was horrendous. We reported it to reception who did nothing. No effort whatever to fix it, just a thank you for informing them. To make matters worse I called for the internet password to be told to turn the to on. Baffling.",1,2021,11,25
129,Family Celebration,"Overall a faultless stay 5 night stay for our family.
All rooms excellent.
Would not hesitate to return or recommend.
Location Location Location
Warm -Comfortable -Great staff- Fab building inside. Hotel was busy and experience still 1st Class.",5,2021,11,25
129,Family trip,"All good, however, bedroom was tiny as well as bathroom - this was after an upgrade as well. Location is excellent and staff are equally good. Clean throughout and well maintained hotel - would stay again if a bigger room was available!!",4,2021,11,23
129,Not great for a five start hotel,"The location was great but the actual overall experience did not meet our expectations and previous experience of staying at five start hotel. 
There was no warm welcome. The room size was good but lacked character, very bland. No mirror for when drying your hair, no fresh milk for coffee , holes in the flannel.
Overall we didnt think it was value for the money we paid on this occasion.",3,2021,11,23
129,Very disappointed,"Disappointed. Twin room. Very very very small. No room to actually get past one of the twin beds get in. Twin beds touching  View of brick wall and AC unit. Room dark and dingy because of said wall outside. Asked to move to another room as I expressed the lack of space etc. offered a room that was 2sqm smaller!! Lack of dressing table and mirrors. Lumpy pillows. Considering the price the size of the room was ridiculous. Manager at breakfast was surly. No one to show you to your table. Food and drinks took ages. For me the greatest concern was getting back to the hotel at 23:15 and I was able to just walk straight in and up the stairs to the bedrooms. No security what‚Äôs so ever. 
Great location for V&A",3,2021,11,21
129,Excellent,"Really nice place with exceptionally nice rooms, and very helpful and friendly staff. Would highly recommend a stay for business but specially if visiting on a vacation. The location is super convenient and short walking distance to great restaurants, bars and the shopping areas.",5,2021,11,18
129,A Bit Disappointed,"Check-in was fast and friendly.  The lady on reception went out of her way to welcome us and even said 'welcome back' after I told her our names - which was a nice touch.
She also congratulated us on the fact that we were celebrating our anniversary and offered 2 complementary glasses of champagne to celebrate - those never materialized though.  We had also received a message from Hotels.com when we booked that said we would have 2 free drink vouchers to use also which never appeared either - we did enjoy some drinks in the hotel bar which is a cool space in the basement - good service but no free drinks were offered even after we gave them our room number - oh well.

The room was lovely and clean - very well stocked.  

The hotel manager left a nice card and box of chocolates in our room for our anniversary - very sweet touch.

The bed was lumpy (needs a new mattress) and our upstairs neighbors were noisy - those squeaky old floorboards didn't help - but I suppose thats what we get for staying in an old hotel.

Check out was quick and easy.  We asked how we could arrange for transportation to Heathrow - the receptionist sent out another employee to flag down a cab.  When we went out - he had not been successful and suggested we either get an uber or cross the road to flag our own taxi - which we did dragging 3 heavy suitcases.  Not the kind of service we would have expected though.

Overall it was a nice visit but the excellence service I expect was not provided - we left feeling a bit disappointed.",3,2021,11,12
129,The Ampersand Hotel,"Fantastic location in the relatively peaceful neighbourhood of South Kensington.  A minute walk from the Tube Station and within moments striking distance of a number of restaurants, cafes and pubs.

Comfortable room with lovely big bed, beautiful bathroom with complimentary L‚ÄôOccitane products. 

Wonderfully warm welcome from reception staff who appear genuinely pleased to greet guests with humour and friendliness. 

Birthday made more memorable by the handmade sweets that were found on entering our bedroom.  

We really cannot speak too highly of The Ampersand Hotel. ",5,2021,11,11
129,Excellent Hospitality,"The wonderful ambience at the hotel is as good as ever, as is the general standard of upkeep. It's a treat to walk off the busy London streets into the calm aesthetic of this gem of a hotel. The warmth and efficiency of all the staff is exceptional.",5,2021,11,11
129,"Charming, friendly, comfortable and excellent value my favourite business hotel in London.","Delighted to return to charming The Ampersand Hotel to warm welcome back from the great staff, it has retained its excellent standards, great food, comfortable beds and elegant decor, my favourite business hotel in London.",5,2021,11,11
129,"Best Hotel, Best Staff, Best Location","I am a frequent traveller to London, and I cannot express how much I love and look forward to staying at The Ampersand Hotel every time that I am in the city.

The location cannot be beat.  The hotel is half a block from the South Kensington Tube Station, and is located in an absolutely beautiful grey historic building that has been transformed into this great hotel.

The staff are very welcoming, accommodating, and extremely helpful. From making sure that I have the right room to arranging transportation to the airport, I have not received better service from any other hotel.  They staff are friendly, cheerful and always remember me every time that I am London, which is a very nice touch.  I've even received little treats every time I have come back.

The rooms are really nice and comfortable.  I recommend a Deluxe Double or bigger if staying for longer than three days.

Room service is great and quick.  The flat bread and Snowy Peak drink from the Apero has to be one of my absolute favourites.

I have been going to The Ampersand Hotel for years, and will continue to go to this wonderful hotel every time that I am London.",5,2021,11,10
129,Well done,"Very solid, very nice stay for the price. I Loved the heated floors in the bathroom and the decor and aesthetic were nicely done. Breakfast and lunch in Apero were well prepared and tasty.  Great neighborhood for tourism",5,2021,11,02
129,Overall a good stay,"The ventilation in the bathroom and the lighting in the room pulls this hotel down a bit. Overall the hotel was good, but i wouldn‚Äôt rate it a 5*. The complimentary minibar, the service and the location is excellent.",4,2021,10,30
129,Great Location but not as expected,"Fantastic location for this beautiful hotel.  A really tough one to review for me I really struggled  with certain aspects of this being such a  highly rated hotel.  Booked a superior room for myself and daughter which was lovely but a few small issues when we first arrived.  A piece of the furniture had broken and also a small prince of rubbish on bathroom floor.  These were rectified and we were left with a small box of chocolates for the inconvenience.  Our AC didn‚Äôt work for the first 2 days and was really hit or miss for the rest of the stay.  We were provided with a fan at our request.  Lovely features of the hotel were it‚Äôs beautiful appearance, cleanliness the complimentary mini bar and also the complimentary child‚Äôs hot chocolate which was really lovely.  The room itself was adequate but struggled with the lack of a dressing table and mirror, and storage was poor.  I just felt for what we paid we could have got so much better elsewhere.  I booked this hotel as a treat for myself and my daughter as it was her first stay in London, kind of feel a little let down and disappointed.   Staff were really pleasant and the room was cleaned daily so could not fault that.  Also my daughter had a child‚Äôs bathrobe and slippers which was a really nice touch.  We didn‚Äôt eat here during the stay only as we found some great eateries in the area.  The afternoon tea on passing looked amazing.",3,2021,10,29
129,Lovely Location : Great Staff. Nice Rooms. But.... CRAPPY INTERNET,"Great location, happy team. 
We moved rooms three times and got really lousy clock speeds. 
And super variable serivce - sometimes fine but just not consistent
Calls dropped, wifi service simply terrible. 
You cannot work from this hotel  - you cannot attend a board meeting and be secure that the line will not drop.",2,2021,10,29
129,Return traveller,"Comfortable and helpful staff but do not bother with breakfast. There are much better options nearby which offer much better quality, choice and value for money. Rooms are quiet and clean. Bathrooms are well equipped.",5,2021,10,24
129,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful hotel with lovely staff. A pleasure to stay here and I look forward to visiting again .
The most amazing bed and gorgeous bathroom products and free mini bar.
The hotel is clean and very pretty.
It is situated in South Kensington which is very easy to travel anywhere in London . The tube and bus stop and taxis are in your doorstep.",5,2021,10,23
129,Average,"Average. Not a five star, more like a 4 star hotel. Service not great. Could be so much better. Location great, near all the good museums. Tube near too. Decor nice, but our room was tiny, with a view of a wall. This should‚Äôve been indicated. We booked at short notice.
",3,2021,10,21
129,It gets better with every stay!,"This is our second visit to Ampersand.
It gets better with every stay.
Really enjoyed our visit - great location, great quality and while you‚Äôre in the middle of everything going on outside the hotel - the hotel itself is quiet and calm. Great stay.
We will be back soon, with friends joining us.",5,2021,10,20
129,Excellent Weekend Away,"Stayed with husband and 12 year old daughter. Beautiful boutique hotel in a fantastic location, extremely near to the South Kensington Tube Station. Location was perfectly based for visiting museums and shopping in Knightsbridge. Tube line so convenient to visit all over London.

Staff helpful and attentive.  Stayed in a studio deluxe. Spacious room, very well appointed and comfortable beds.  Bedding and decor excellent. Very clean and stocked with toiletries.

Stayed the weekend on a bed and continental package.  Food was good and service in apero was quick and well done.

A great hotel in a very appealing location.  Literally lots of options for food and drink.  Felt very safe walking around even at night with my daughter.

Would love to visit again soon.

Many thanks for a lovely weekend.",5,2021,10,19
129,Excellent hotel,Stopped here for a long weekend. The room was a deluxe and was lovely. It was always cleaned every day. The hotel and staff could not be faulted. 2 mins from South Kensington station. Taxi rank just outside. Afternoon teas seem popular but we did not try them.,5,2021,10,18
129,Lovely hotel in a brilliant location,This is the second time we have stayed at The Ampersand. It is in a brilliant location just steps from South Kensington underground station and with a taxi rank outside the door transport is easy.  The rooms are lovely and breakfast is excellent quality and good value for London.,4,2021,10,15
129,not a five star hotel,"Not impressed I'll not come back. My room was so small that I think it's no rentable, they wrote 11 sqm but that's less than 9 sqm. You cannot move, you cannot open the bathroom door for ¬£197 a night, crazy. Staff don't take you to the room. give you wrong info like to go to apero to eat at 16 o'clock and then they told me they don't have food at that time. Breakfast horrible again at apero. I didn't like the location, the service (no one welcoming you, nothing on the table, nothing related to breakfast) and the food. No tasty at all. I'll not come back and I'll not suggest this hotel to anyone. Poor management and poor service first of all than not nice breakfast experience and not nice room. So anything went well during my stay",2,2021,10,15
129,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location and warm attentive staff","Enjoyed a (too) short visit. Loved the hotel, the location and the staff interactions. Highly recommend a visit. Room was immaculate and the little touches to make your stay that much more enjoyable were just perfect",5,2021,10,13
129,Wedding party stay - Sept 2021,"Thanks to the wonderful team at the Ampersand we had the most amazing stay with our family and friends as part of celebrating our wedding on the 9th September 2021

From the moment we checked in to the minute we drove away from the hotel 4 days later we were treated impeccably, the support and assistance of every single staff member truly meant our whole wedding experience was flawless. 

All of our rooms were superb! Clean, fresh and the beds were so comfortable! Every guest was treated like royalty with early check ins to make sure they could get ready for our big day stress free! Room service food was wonderful and the gym was an added bonus for us on the morning of the wedding. 

As the bride I couldn‚Äôt have asked for better care, From help up and down to our rooms with (lots!) of wedding luggage, to the maintenance guys bringing mirrors and chairs to our rooms, the amazing F and B team setting us up a private delicious cooked to order breakfast for all of our guests the day after our wedding, nothing was too much trouble and we honestly feel blessed to have found this wonderful hotel in such a great London location.
 
Thank you all! Every single one of you played such a huge part of making our dream wedding come true! 

We cannot wait to see you all again soon and look forward to celebrating our anniversary‚Äôs with you from now on

129,"Gorgeous hotel, wonderful stay","Loved our stay here!  I was doing the London marathon and it was my birthday and the staff were lovely and really welcoming, chocolates in the room when we arrived and I requested a room with a bathtub in the bedroom which they kindly arranged for me. The room was gorgeous and spacious, the bed was the comfiest bed I have ever slept in , complimentary mini bar was a lovely touch and breakfast was yummy! Loved Apero bar, really cosy and fab for a post dinner drink. Thank you team for such a memorable stay! ",5,2021,10,05

129,What a little Gem.,"We stayed here for one night, the location was perfect just down the road from the tube station, the staff at the hotel were so helpful and friendly. We had one of the small rooms but it was perfect for one nights stay. The little touches in the room were lovely complimentary soft drinks including juices for the morning. The bathroom was beautiful with everything you need even a little sewing kit. Beds were so comfortable.  Would highly recommend this hotel fantastic value for money.     ",5,2021,10,04
129,Excellent afternoon tea,"Good location, lovely afternoon tea and a generous selection of cakes and sandwiches.  We weren‚Äôt rushed and had a very pleasant leisurely afternoon.  Service was attentive and friendly. Science afternoon tea was fun for everyone, great for children.",5,2021,10,03

129,Short Break in London,"My wife came across the Ampersand when we were looking for somewhere to stay for a couple of nights in London. We wanted to be in the South Kensington area so the hotel was ideally located. 
V&A and Natural History Museum are very close by and Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are in easy walking distance.
Lots of eating places near the hotel if you don`t fancy the hotel restaurants.
We had a deluxe room which was spacious, clean and had a very comfortable Super King Size bed.The bathroom was lovely and well provided with L`Occitane products.
All the hotel staff we met were friendly and efficient and went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed our stay.
Highly recommend this hotel for a short break in a lovely part of London.

129,A home from home,"Wonderful hotel with beautiful rooms and bathrooms, a fantastic restaurant for dinner and breakfast and lovely staff. The location is great being 2 mins from the tube and plenty of shops close by, highly recommended.",5,2021,09,25
129,A South Kensington gem,"We stayed 1 night in a Standard Room. On the small side, but good value. Perfect location for the museums and Royal Albert Hall , all within walking distance. Service and cleanliness superb. Breakfast was a la carte; a good idea. We chose the yogurt , honey and strawberries - generous portion and quality ingredients. Being able to leave luggage at reception very welcome as the V & A have no cloakroom facilities at present. So if you are looking for somewhere to lay your head after a gig at the Royal Albert Hall and spend the next day checking out the museums the Ampersand is certainly comfy, relaxing and good value for money.",5,2021,09,24
129,Always great to come back - home away from home,"The Ampersand is just a great hotel - it is very conveniently located, with Tube and nice restaurants for every taste just around the corner. The staff is just wonderful - thanks a lot for making this a great stay once again! ",5,2021,09,24
129,Gorgeous boutique hotel,"On arrival at this hotel, we were greeted by the lovely reception staff.  Our room wasn't ready so we left our bags and went off for the day.  They said they would text us when the room was ready which they did.  Our bags were in our room on arrival back at the hotel.  The room was beautifully decorated and quite quirky as it was at the top of the building.  Very clean with a lovely bathroom.  It was a change to have a bathroom that had plenty of toiletries in them rather that having to constantly ask housekeeping for more.  Staff were all really friendly.  I would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again.",5,2021,09,22
129,Fab hotel in a great location,We stayed for a birthday celebration and the staff went above and beyond to help ensure that things were fantastic. The rooms were spacious and clean and the location of the hotel was fab with lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from. ,4,2021,09,20
129,Excellent location and rooms but not 001,"I enjoyed the replacement room the. staff were friendly and efficient. The location was excellent Pre theatre Restaurant  too busy and staff overstretched making it a stressful experience as waiting times too long. Didn't have breakfast here so cant comment. Would I stay again..yes. Thank you

But ",5,2021,09,20
129,Perfect our overnight stay,"We stayed for one night as we were in London for our wedding anniversary. Great location, perfect size, faultless staff experience. We were upgraded without asking, which was appreciated and I had the best nights sleep in a hotel that I‚Äôve ever had - the bed was so comfortable. 

My only feedback would be that the decor and the lighting made the room rather dark but that‚Äôs just personal taste. 

Would stay again and would recommend. ",4,2021,09,19
129,"Excellent location, beautiful hotel","Loved our romantic stay here. Beautiful room and really central location. The V&A Museum's round the corner and Harrod's is about a 10 minute walk away.  The staff were also great. Comfy, great sized rooms",5,2021,09,18
129,Always fabulous!,"For us, there is nowhere else in London that matches this hotel!  It‚Äôs our go to!

We have recommended this hotel to many friends who now also use it while in London! ",5,2021,09,16
129,Very Good,"Clean room , good Service and great location. Probably not a 5 star hotel but near enough for me to recommend. Good value for money too. 
The hotel bar was empty for the duration of our stay which was a shame as we were forced to look elsewhere for some atmosphere. The mattress on the bed was a little soft, as were the pillows. 
Other than that our stay was pretty faultless.
Well done.  ",4,2021,09,15
129,Thank you!,"Wonderful hotel with incredible staff who go out of their way to help you.

We received wonderful treatment, especially when my wife was rushed to A&E.

Partly due to your team she made it quickly and has now fully recovered.

Excellent service, rarely seen today.

Your staff are a real asset to your business.",5,2021,09,07

129,Perfect short break,Stayed for two nights with my sons (14 and 8) for a short break and sightseeing. We requested an extra bed in the room to accommodate us all and this was set out perfectly. Staff were so helpful and made the stay really nice for us all. The hotel is beautiful; we've been a few times before and I'd always try to stay here when in London. Rooms are perfect and the beds are super comfy. Totally recommend. ,5,2021,09,03
129,Mid Week Treat,"Returning to the Ampersand and it was a lovely as I remembered. The staff are very helpful, generally give great service, and the location can not be beat for access to the V&A and the Natural History. The beds are perfect for dreamers who need a good nights sleep in comfort. 
",5,2021,09,03
129,Excellent stay!,There is a lovely feel to this hotel and we felt at home from the moment we arrived. We chose this hotel as it was very near to the wedding venue that we were attending. But the location in general  is excellent. We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel so I can‚Äôt comment on that. The room was lovely with a large and extremely comfortable bed. We will definitely be returning! ,5,2021,09,01
129,Excellent stay at a luxury hotel with great location,"We stayed for 3 nights in 2 connecting rooms.  The rooms are separate but share a little hallway with a single external door.  When requesting connecting rooms it would be good to provide door stops as standard so you can hear the kids.

We had a science afternoon tea, which was incredibly well thought through in terms of detail and the food was delicious.

The hotel and the rooms are spotless and well maintained - so many 4 or 5 star hotels can be a little shabby around the edges, but this is perfect.  Bathrooms are luxurious, great towels and lovely beds and bedding.

The service at the hotel is phenomenal- when booking the phone was answered straight away by someone who could actually help and book rooms for us.  Check in was smooth, check out was easy (and not until midday!).  There was always someone on desk and they were always helpful.

Location is great - minutes from the museums, lots of restaurants and bakeries and right next to south Ken tube station.

Highly recommend, would definitely stay again",5,2021,08,28

129,Business Trip to London,"The location is excellent literally a stones throw from the tube station at South Kensington. 
Check in was good - the staff were pleasant and gave me a free upgrade - I had booked a standard double room but apparently they are really small so they put me in a superior double (also very small so I‚Äôd hate to see the standard) ‚Äî that said the bed was comfy the TV had lots of channels and the WiFi was fast. Everything was clean and the toiletries were well stocked - the shower was powerful too so that‚Äôs a win! 
The mini bar was free but only stocked with non alcoholic drinks. 

I didn‚Äôt have breakfast in the place but do have an evening snack of prawns Proven√ßal- they were delicious but as a main course it would not suffice. 

The check out was done via text which is fine but I have yet to receive a receipt!",4,2021,08,23
129,Perfect night away in South Kensington,"Took the wife away for the night for her birthday. Literally nothing at all I could fault.

129,Good value for money,"Excellent location. Decent rooms although a little on the small side. Staff and customer service are very good. Friendly, and straightforward. Check in and check out very easy. It is a shame they have no spa, but overall the rates provide very good value for Money.",4,2021,08,22
129,Enjoyable short stay in South Kensington,"Excellent South Kensington location with museums close by and lots of places to eat.  Lovely looking building. Clean and modern feel to the rooms. We experienced very good service.

129,My Favorite Place to Stay In London,"I've been to London many times and this was my best hotel experience ever - I will always be staying here from now on. The room was ABSOLUTELY beautiful, the location was central to everything - I walked everywhere. And the staff made me feel like I was family. Everyone was so kind and thoughtful and genuine. I had a lovely time and I didn't want to leave. I can't wait to go back.",5,2021,08,21
129,The staff excel,"I've used the Ampersand for meetings pre-covid and on returning with my family this week it was the perfect place. Great location for exploring the usual tourist sights. The hotel has a lovely ambiance with designs reflecting the Natural History Museum which is a stones throw away. THe main shout out though goes to the staff, they are excellent and my young boys felt like they had made a new best friend in your concierge. Thank you. Massively appreciated as travelling with a family ranging from 4 to 80 was made wonderful.",5,2021,08,20
129,Afternoon Tea Must!,"We visited the Ampersand Hotel this week for the first time for afternoon tea, and I can honestly say, I was so impressed.

Generally, the hotel is spotless and in a great location in central London. I can't explain how friendly and helpful the staff were. They are a real credit to this venue.

We opted for the Science Afternoon tea, and it did not disappoint! Food was really fresh and fun. Very impressed that they offer a full glutton free range. My friend really struggles to find restaurants where the glutton free options are as good as the main range. The glutton free options looked pretty much identical to the main range, so she could enjoy the experience without feeling singled out.

Highly recommend this venue, and we will hopefully return again soon!",5,2021,08,20
129,The Ampersand Hotel,"An excellent escape in the heart of South Kensington.  The Science Afternoon Tea was a real treat!  Easy access to Kensington Gardens, the V&A and the Saatchi Gallery.  Lots of lovely restaurants nearby too.  Highly recommended.",5,2021,08,20

129,Rude and uncommunicative,"Emailed the hotel on the 3rd August about our upcoming visit to London... NO REPLY.. Emailed them again 8th August to see why I hadn't had a reply.. Guess what.. NO REPLY.. final email sent 12th August.. Also NO REPLY.. So called the hotel and asked to speak with the Duty Manager.. Was told ""He's on a break call back in 45 minutes or maybe just half an hour"" when I asked if it was not customary for a hotel to take customer details and call me back, I was told ""well I can, but he's really busy so I have no idea when he'll call you""
Guess what.. NOBODY BOTHERED TO CALL ME BACK!
Appalling service from a hotel I used to love.. Will spend my money elsewhere in future!",1,2021,08,15
129,superb 4 day stay in London,"From start to finish our stay was superb!
We were contacted after booking by the hotel concierge who offered to,help with any plans whilst staying in. London - we didn‚Äôt use this service but a really nice touch.  We were able to check in early due to our travel plans - this was fantastic given we could freshen up and then head out to explore.
The room was fantastic, with amazing shower and luxury toiletries.  My only even better if would be to offer a choice of pillows as these were too soft for me - this didn‚Äôt stop us getting a good sleep though!

Hotel is located near to lots of bars and restaurants as well as being near some of the popular museums, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge shops.  We love to walk and this was an ideal area to stay to explore this part of London.
The nearest tube station is South Kensington (2 min walk) but for us this was closed for our stay so we used Gloucester Road (15 min walk).
Overall, definitely recommend this hotel if looking for some luxury and superb service in this area of London.

129,Relaxing stay in a small luxury hotel,"This was our first time in London since the pandemic. We have stayed several times before in the Ampersand Hotel and felt we would be safe there, made to feel welcome and would have a positive experience. 
We were definitely not disappointed and the service we received right from the start was exemplary. Staff at reception has been made aware of our previous visits and welcomed us back. Throughout the visit, staff checked that we were enjoying ourselves and if there was anything they could do to enhance our stay. This was most appreciated. Rooms are lovely as are the general public areas. We received a free upgrade on arrival and had a lovely room overlooking Harrington Road.
The area is a brilliant place to be based for all parts of London and is within walking distance of Knightsbridge and the Kings Road. Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens are also very close. 
Will be returning.

129,Lovely Boutique Luxury,"So glad we chose The Ampersand for our short trip to London. It is a beautiful little boutique hotel right where we wanted to be. The Natural History Museum was just a short walk. The service was excellent from the very beginning- everything is automated through your phone or the hotel tv which means no queuing at reception. We booked a suite and it was the perfect size for the three of us, with a lovely balcony view. My daughter loved her little welcome pack and her hot chocolate. Great location, service and style.

129,Wonderfully original afternoon tea,"Science afternoon tea is highly recommended! A wonderful location and setting for such a fun afternoon tea with a science theme. We arrived earlier than booked and were able to start the tea earlier which was incredibly helpful.

129,Satisfied customers given the members discount we received.,"Great location, good staff, service and quality of accommodation. However, although the hotel is really nice, this is not a 5 star hotel from my experiences over many years of travelling across the world. 

If we had to pay the full price, without the members discount, I would have been much less satisfied about what I believe to be value for money. ",4,2021,08,02

129,A wonderful family stay,This was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in. It made our 6 day trip to London so special. We wouldn‚Äôt have enjoyed our holiday as much without it.

We slept fabulously in the best beds ever and looked forward to returning to our room after a busy day out in London. We can‚Äôt wait to stay here again. This hotel contributed to us having a very memorable trip. The convenience of the location could not have been better and we would happily spend our next trip exploring the area more. ,5,2021,07,24

129,Outstandingly good hotel,"We booked the 1 night in order to extend our stay in London we had already booked in elsewhere. I could not have made a better choice.

Fantastic location less than 5 minutes walk from the Natural History Museum. The hotel itself is very nicely decorated and clean. Best of all we‚Äôre the staff. Friendly, helpful and genuinely seemed to want to make your stay a pleasant one.

Excellent bedroom for my family to share and a luxurious bathroom with a large freestanding tub. We also ate in both restaurants. Afternoon tea in The Drawing Room was delightful - fun and scrumptious. Breakfast in Apero was well priced and cooked to perfection.

When your 4-year old asks why can‚Äôt we stay longer then you know you‚Äôve found a gem! We will be back here a lot I suspect.",5,2021,07,15
129,Excellent stay with the family,"We stayed in interconnecting rooms, a double and a twin, with our teenage daughters. Perfect location right next to the NH museum and South Ken tube.

We were so lucky to have an early check in and our room upgraded which had free refreshments in the mini bar such as water, orange juice, Diet Coke etc throughout our stay. The rooms were spotless and plenty toiletries, robes and slippers. Iron was available on request. 

The hotel is a stones throw away from South Kensington tube station and a short walk to Harrods.  There are plenty food options available nearby, try Muriel‚Äôs for breakfast that was lovely 

We ended up staying an extra night and we would not hesitate to return here

I would really like to highlight that each and every member of staff that we had contact with were fantastic",5,2021,07,08

Location is great, just a minutes walk from South Ken tube station, all of the staff we encountered were so polite & friendly, & the suite was amazing (well worth the upgrade!) - just amazing having a balcony at a London hotel. The toiletries were lovely (L'Occitaine), bed was super comfy and both the bath & shower were great. Science Tea was a great experience, really unique & the staff were so friendly.

The team couldn‚Äôt be more helpful and I will be staying again ",5,2021,06,26
129,Utterly perfect in every detail! Really special stay,"With 2021 shaping up to be another year of frustrated travel plans (Amber list to Europe in June, our 25th wedding anniversary scuppered by lockdown etc). We decided short notice to have a getaway couple of days in London late June.
The Ampersand stood out based on reviews and (at time of booking) on price too. 
The hotel is utterly brilliant. The outside exudes Victorian design and reminded me of the equally gorgeous looking Met Hotel in Leeds.
As soon as we walked in Bee and the team made us feel exceptionally welcome, a great start.
The room we had was brilliant, the most amazing comfy bed, great views and done to a very high standard. The decor throughout the hotel Is done with a quirky flair and to a very high standard.
I have stayed in hotels around the world and the Ampersand goes right to the top of my list for being a special place to stay.
Well done Ampersand team, you have a new fan!",5,2021,06,24

The room was enormous, very comfortable beds and great toiletries. I could not recommend this place enough!",5,2021,06,14
129,Weekend trip made perfect by this lovely hotel,"Loved staying at the Ampersand hotel. It was such a lovely and pleasant stay - we were particularly impressed with the decor which was really pretty. The little touches such as a free room upgrade, personalised note and free chocolates and soft drinks in the room are the sorts of things that leave a lasting impression in the guests mind. We loved the fact that check out was at 12pm rather than the usual 10am that most hotels have - this allowed for a nice leisurely morning and really enables you to get the most out of your stay. Thank you to the staff who were very polite and attentive too. We will be returning when we can to stay at the Ampersand again. ",5,2021,06,14

Mini bar was a nice touch but very limited. Staff were very friendly and provided good customer service. There were cup stains in the room, some channels didn't work (especially Sky channels) and TV reception went in and out at times. No tissues in the tissue box either. Mini bar could have some alcohol or more soft drinks included. I enjoyed my stay but expected a little more for ¬£170 per night.

We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room, which was a lovely surprise. The bathroom was very luxurious with a his and hers sink. The room offered a free minibar (non alcoholic drinks) but still a nice treat - especially for a London hotel. 
We made use of the hotel gym which was small but had everything you needed for a short weekend workout. The cocktails from Apero bar were all very unique, our favourite was the ‚ÄòDippy‚Äô.
One of the best things about the hotel was their messaging concierge service - messages to check in on how our stay was going, the ability to book a slot at the gym, and order room service. We loved staying in a different part of London for our summer staycation and couldn‚Äôt have been happier with our choice of hotel. Next time, we will have to try the science themed afternoon tea which looked pretty spectacular!",5,2021,05,31

129,Great Hotel & Afternoon Tea,"My wife booked this beautiful hotel for a 3 night break over October half term.  
We stayed with our 14 years old son, adding an extra single bed in a double room, still plenty of space for the 3 of us.  The rooms are well furnished, with a luxurious feel.  Bathroom, shower and toiletries were excellent.
Staff were very friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out, they even looked after luggage all day on check-out, as we‚Äôd booked a late train home. 
Hotel is in a great location, very quiet and 50 metres from South Kensington Tube.
My wife booked us in for the Science Afternoon Tea, honestly it was amazing.

129,A lovely hotel and great location,"The staff are friendly and always ready with a smile. The staircase is beautuful with a stunning light feature and the rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable and I thought the Delux room was big by London standards. They are generous and leave a good selection of complimetary soft drinks, toiletries, teas and coffees and the robes and slippers are a nice touch. My daughter loved the rubber ducks for the bath. 
There is a heated floor in the bathroom, good selection of television channels and a refrigerator. 
We dined in the Apero and the food is delicious and the taster menu for two is a good value choice. We loved the childrens menu, the portions are quite generous and also enjoyed having the private table in the 'cubby'.

There were only a few issues. We were in 219 and the floor above was creaky so when the people above us were in it was very loud and actually woke us up as they were coming in late. 
The first night we had had a long journey and wanted something to eat. We found the room service a bit confusing as you access the menu on the television which I suppose makes sense with Covid as it reduces books and menus having to be touched. We were not sure how to order anything as this was not clear on the hotel information. The menu also was quite limited and although it worked well when we were dining at the Apero the second night, some more simpler options would be well received for those wanting a more relaxed meal in their room or a lighter option. There was also no childrens room service menu on the television menu. I rang down and someone said they would bring one to our room but it never arrived so we opted for a deliveroo after my daughters bedtime was fast approaching! My husband popped to the bar for some drinks as we could not ring through to room service and still got charged the service charge which we felt was a bit strange. 
When we had spoken to reception prior to booking into Apero they confirmed that they were still doing a 50% off the food bill on the night of our booking and this was also stated on the website. However when we checked with the waiter he said that offer had stopped now. He did say he would honour it (we heard another family had been told the same thing) but it  was somewhat embaraassing for us. The sharing menu I think from seeing afterwards on the hotel menu and website was supposed to finish with an affogato which we never received but the food was so tasty and more than enough that it plicated us on that score. 

I would say this is an overall great hotel in a perfect location but maybe just plan your meals a little if you are travelling with children.",4,2020,11,01
129,Superb ,What a great hotel. Excellent value for money.. Staff are great... Rooms are fantastic. We will definitely return. Tube station 2 mins.. Loads of restaurants nearby and if you like sports cars the Lamborghini showroom is a cross the road.. ,5,2020,11,01
129,A lovely hotel in the heart of South Kensington.,"My partner and I stayed at the Ampersand for two nights for a short break in October. Having visited for afternoon tea in January, we were eager to stay here and we weren‚Äôt disappointed! 

We stayed in a suite on the 5th floor. The room was clean, and beautifully designed. Our highlights of the room was the huge bathroom and private terrace which we really enjoyed. The room was well stocked with luxury amenities for everything you would need for a short break. We called down for toothpaste as we had forgotten ours and they brought some up straight away. I would say that one small critique of the room I have was that there was limited natural light in the bedroom area, only a small window which didn‚Äôt create much natural light at all. 

What really made our stay special was the exceptional service at the hotel. On arrival, we were offered complimentary champagne during our stay and then later visited the bar. I did raise a concern to Giuseppe, the F&B manager, that I felt that the space provided for our drinks wasn‚Äôt as socially distanced as expected but he went above and beyond to ensure that we were reassured we were in safe hands. I also spoke to Niels, the manager on duty, who was kind enough to come and discuss the issues that were raised and passed on the comments to the team. 

I‚Äôd like to extend my thanks to Giuseppe for his great service and for making our break so special. 

We look forward to visiting the hotel again!",5,2020,10,31
129,Stylishly elegant  family hotel,"the Ampersand is the most relaxing stay in sumptuous modern elegance. I would recommend and stay here again, such a relaxing stay after a busy sight seeing family London trip with a child of 5 and an under 1 year old we enjoyed every minute. The staff were welcoming and helpful when we needed them, thoughful of our needs, and made it easy for us to want to return ",5,2020,10,29
129,Cosy Kensington Comfort,"I had the pleasure of staying here this week for one night. 
I booked a studio room with a bath by the window. 
My room was ready on arrival at noon. 
I was welcomed in an extremely pleasant and professional manner. 
My room (216) was spotless. 
Nothing was too much trouble for housekeeping when I rang them to ask for some additions. 
I only wish I had stayed here longer and would recommend the hotel without any reservation. Right next to the tube station and lots of local restaurants. 
Also a thank you to them for my birthday plate of chocolate‚Äôs. 
As for the science afternoon tea it was amazing and a must! ",5,2020,10,29
129,Super hotel in a great location,"I stayed with my husband and daughter. The room was spacious, even with an extra bed for my daughter. Our bed was amazingly comfortable. Lovely bathroom, shower was fabulous and  L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries. Complimentary minibar with soft drinks and water was enjoyed by my daughter. Dinner in Apero was excellent and we took advantage of the 2-4-1 cocktails offer. Location is great, so close to the National History and Science museums and the V&A and one minute walk to South Ken tube for easy access to the rest of London. ",5,2020,10,29
129,Best staycation ever,"Originally planned to be abroad for my boyfriend's birthday but due to COVID couldn't travel. Decided to have a staycation, having dined at Apero before we always wondered what it might be like to stay at The Ampersand; took advantage of their current 2-for-1 deal on overnight stay and fair to say it exceeded our expectations! Will definitely be back.",5,2020,10,26
129,A Gem,"Lovely hotel with a great location. Super friendly and efficient staff. Lovely public areas. spacious room with comfy bed, great shower and lots of toiletries. Great breakfast choices. Didn‚Äôt want to leave!",5,2020,10,26
129,Amazing Stay,"The location of the hotel is brilliant, walking distance to the museums and South Kensington underground is 1 minute away. The hotel staff were so helpful and friendly, the room was beautiful and the stay was brilliant. Would highly recommend and will be back",5,2020,10,25
129,"The best location, a bit different during Covid","This was our 3rd stay as a family and we absolutely love it here. We were going to royal Albert Hall and the natural history museum so a 3 min walk from there was ideal!!!! The hotel rooms are great and this time we had a suite on the top floor with a balcony. We had a sofa bed for our toddler and cot for our baby put in too.

I have to say the rooms do look different during the pandemic. Usually there are gorgeous cushions, throws, piles of books to read, magazines which help soften the room but now it‚Äôs bare. There is not a thing on any of the surfaces which makes it sparse. I understand their reason, but it does give the rooms a less luscious and premium feel with the stark white sheets only. Surely you can‚Äôt catch Covid from a cushion? It almost gave it a travelodge feel, that‚Äôs probably a bit dramatic but it‚Äôs just literally the bed and the chair now! Missing anything that made it cosy.

There‚Äôs no turn down either which is a shame as they used to do such a nice one. Appreciate this is 2020 though and hospitality is struggling. They said the housekeeper goes home at 4:30pm.

Everything in the mini bar is free of charge, there‚Äôs a nespresso machine etc.  All the products are lovely, as well as the huge dressing gowns and slippers. Everything really high quality. We really appreciate the extra ducks and bath fizzes for the children, plus their robes too!

The staff are lovely and again the location makes this hotel a total hit for us!",4,2020,10,24
129,Great service and good location for Chelsea and Knightsbridge,We had a pleasant stay at the Ampersand hotel. We encountered some issues with the temperature control of the room and the breakfast but we were offered a gesture to compensate for these. Great location and good service. ,4,2020,10,21
129,Thank you for an enjoyable stay,we enjoyed our stay   .  Look forward to stay at the hotel again in future .   The reception staff were really helpful.  Check in and check out  out staff were hand ful and see to all our  needs.  We had a great time.  The only regret is not having a stand alone bath in the suites.,5,2020,10,10
129,5 stars for a 5 star hotel!,"Although there 's something a bit weird and old-fashioned about this hotel you've got to remember that its a boutique-style establishment! And they've got that down to a tee with the dim lighting, high bed headboard and black tiles! Even the antique-style safe and hairdryer make a creepy noise when you start them up! The grey walls outside are lovely and attracted me to the place! The staff are really pleasant and helpful and the shower was lovely with great temperature control and accompanying bidet-style sprayer!",5,2020,10,10
129,"Great hotel, service, and location",The hotel had everything we required. Really good service and nice friendly staff who attended to everything needed. Stayed with a new born baby and they could not have made it easier for us all. Thank you ,5,2020,10,06
129,Beautiful and perfectly located!,I went to the Ampersand for my wedding night and it was just perfect. The room was huge with an amazing bathtub right near a window. The quality of everything is very high and with nice touches everywhere. The bed was extremely comfortably. The service was great as well. I really recommend it!!,5,2020,10,04
129,Lovely little gem,"My husband and I stayed here just a couple of weeks ago, the hotel is very easily reached from South Kensington tube, literally across the road, and less then 10 minutes from both the natural history museum and V&A.

The hotel itself was  spotless throughout, every member of staff greeted us with a smile and hello. We especially liked their text service, it was a great way of keeping in touch. Our room was surprisingly spacious by London standards and the free mini bar was a bonus, even more so that it was restocked each day with water soft drinks and juices . A beautiful comfy bed with crisp linens as well. The bathroom was a little compact  compared to the room butwas more then enough, the rain showner was lovely

Taking advantage of the hotels 50% food in Apperol we had a fabulous dinner in the restaurant in fact one of the best steak dinners we have had for some while, along with some very tasty cocktails.

The hotel had a very quite vibe even when their drawing room had several patrons enjoying high tea, socially distant of course.

Neither my husband or my self could find any major fault, a truly surprising gem.

",5,2020,10,03
129,Excellent stay!,"We stayed in the Deluxe Studio room for my fiance's bday. I requested both a bath an shower following a previous review I had read. 
Prior to arriving, there was communication from the hotel and I was asked for things that were required which I thought was great. 
Our room was exceptional, really spacious with a huge bed. Lots of nice touches, especially the L'Occitane toiletries. 
The bath in the room was a lovely treat. The shower head on the walkin shower was massive.
Complimentary soft drinks and nice bday treat for my fiance

The only downside was the restaurant was really small and there wasn't really anywhere to just have a drink. There were 241 cocktails from 5-7 so would have been nice to sit somewhere other than the restaurant but this might be due to COVID

The staff were really friendly and helpful and liked the txt messages. 

The natural history museum was literally round the corner. 

Would highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay again.",5,2020,09,26
129,Fantastic 2 night stay,"We chose this Hotel to extend our stay in London by 2 nights. The welcome on arrival was friendly and I had requested a Studio with a bath in the window which they were able to accommodate. The room was beautiful and as we wanted to visit the V&A museum it was a perfect choice as it‚Äôs within very easy walking distance. There is also a great choice of restaurants around the area. The bar and restaurant at the Hotel itself is lovely and although we only had a drink there my husband commented that the steak looked amazing! So that‚Äôs something to try next time.... Thank you so much staff at Ampersand Hotel. 

PS, love the little ducks! They have both come home with us ;) ",5,2020,09,25
129,Luxury London break with our dogs,"We've not taken our dogs away before lockdown. This has been a wonderful stay, the room is luxurious and the staff have been so helpful, especially with the dogs. They provided dog beds and treats in the room. Unlike most hotels there is no nightly charge for the dogs, a considerable saving. Highly recommended ",5,2020,09,17
129,Friendly warm service,"My daughter and I had a wonderful visit, enhanced by the kind service displays to my daughter. We were allowed to choose our room, and games were placed for us to play. The rooms were luxurious and I had a terrific nights sleep. Thanks go to Guillermo for making us feel welcome",5,2020,09,13
129,A gorgeous hotel in great location,"We had a fabulous stay at The Ampersand. We arrived slightly early and the more than helpful staff were so friendly and offered us a hot drink while we waited for 10 mins. The Deluxe studio room was very spacious & quiet for London and we had a TV in the bath! Massive comfortable bed and nice toiletries. Pre covid, we originally booked for my husband‚Äôs birthday and had to re-arrange, but as this was marked on the booking they delivered some chocolates to celebrate, very thoughtful and going the extra mile! 3 tube lines on your doorstep (tube is 1 min away). Only suggestion is it would have been great to have breakfast included but there‚Äôs so many lovely restaurants near, it‚Äôs not an issue. Thank you for a brilliant visit &!",5,2020,09,13
129,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for one night. The hotel itself is lovely & clean. It‚Äôs situated literally opposite the tube station and close to the museum‚Äôs. We spent our day visiting Chelsea so everything was within walking distance. 
I booked a deluxe room with the picture showing a bath in the room. When we arrived ours didn‚Äôt! I was told I needed to state I wanted the bath so bear that in mind when booking!! We had a TV in our bathroom but that didn‚Äôt work! The staff however were really great and friendly. ",4,2020,09,09
129,A pure gem,"Excellent location, overall decor and staff attention made this a much needed positive experience in a year of significant change. The Ampersand provides a realxing atmosphere that is genuine and is in easy reach to a side of London that we rarely visit making for a perfect weekend away.",5,2020,09,07
129,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"We decided to book this hotel for a romantic night in London. The location is an ideal stone's throw from South Ken tube and waking distance to great restaurants and pubs. The decor is quirky, beds and pillows downy and the bathrooms are stylish with tv's above the bath and luxurious L'Occataine products.
We had a couple of Covid restriction challenges but these were dealt with promptly and professionally. Would highly recommend this gem!",5,2020,09,06
129,The amazing London,"Now staying in London is not a problem for us as long as this outstanding boutique hotel is ,my next homelike. A hotel of the highest quality. Ideally situated close to the museums and attractions. The entire staff is helpful. ||I I We highly recommend The Ampersand,a traditional memory.Wonderfully situated hotel in South Kensington.One minute to the South Kensington Underground station
and several bus stop provide potential rides in almost any direction in London.Rooms are very new, nice and comfortable. A bit small but we are in London!",5,2020,03,25
129,Great Place to stay in London,"Great hotel in a good spot with fantastic, friendly staff. We emigrated from London a couple of years ago and having tried several different options, this is the hotel we choose to stay in when we are in town",5,2020,03,19
129,Perfect Anniversary Weekend,"We had a lovely night away at the Ampersand for our anniversary. The staff were lovely; always exceeding expectations and happy to help. The food was delicious, the best room service meal we‚Äôve ever had. The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful, clean and well looked after. We will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone. Next time we will try the afternoon tea as it looked amazing!!",5,2020,03,15
129,Simply the best,"Why stay anywhere else in London, we will return often.  A hotel of the highest quality. Ideally situated close to the museums and attractions. 
The entire staff are attentive and helpful. 
We highly recommend The Ampersand. ",5,2020,03,15
129,Loved the Ampersand !,"Family of 4 stayed in a deluxe studio w/a rollaway bed for 4 nights last summer while in London. We loved everything about this hotel - the whimsical decor, the location, it was perfect.  Stone's throw from South Kensington tube station, which is a GREAT area to stay with kids - close to museums, Hyde Park, Kennsington Palace and easy ride to other major sites.  The treats, slippers, and robes left in the room for the kids were a very nice touch and made them feel welcome.  We had afternoon Science tea in the Drawing Rooms and that was wonderful as well - a real experience ! The kids and even my husband enjoyed it !  Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2020,03,12
129,"Great hotel, just wish loyalty was better recognised.","I stay at this hotel every week, it is my home from home, and overall I love it. However there are some finer points I find frustrating as a regular guest, sadly due to lack of continuity and consistency of staff. Every single week I have to have the same conversation about certain things. The check-in / out process is generally painful and something I dread now. 
",4,2020,03,12
129,Afternoon Tea,"We had an unforgettable Afternoon tea
The food was fantastic and the service was excellent
A big thank you to Fabio Who took care of us.
I will definitely recommend this experience to my friends.
Definitely a five star experience",5,2020,03,08
129,"Fabulous Hotel, amazing staff","Lovely modern, yet traditional, hotel. Incredible warm and welcoming team. The rooms were bright and extremely clean with a very comfortable bed. Great power shower.  Looking forward to staying again soon. ",4,2020,03,06
129,"Stylish, Friendly and Well Located Hotel","I stayed for one night in March 2020 on business. The hotel exterior and interior is very stylish with some lovely design elements. The staff were friendly and smiley and could not do more to help. They provide ironing board requested swiftly and went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. The location was handy and surrounded by some lovely eateries should you wish to stay outside of the hotel. The room was modern, tidy and the bed was huge and very comfortable. The only point I would raise is the location of a dressing table to sit at to dry your hair/put your make up on in front of a mirror etc. As the mirror in the room was inside the wardrobe which wasn't ideal but a small detail. If you are looking to stay in Kensington, stay here. You will not be disappointed. ",5,2020,03,06
129,vacation stay in London,"great hotel, friendly staff and the location is perfect next to South Kensington tube stop with Circle, District, and Picadilly lines. Direct tube to Heathrow and Paddington Stations. The hotel is relatively small to give intimate feel and lots of neighborhood restaurants nearby.",5,2020,03,05
129,Amazing location in South Ken,"Great boutique hotel in an excellent location in South Kensington. The room was renovated, nicely decorated and clean. Hotel staff and the Apero restaurant met our expectations. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay. ",4,2020,03,04
129,Flawless,"I spent three nights there over the course of a recent weekend.  The reception folks were excellent.  The rooms itself was perfect.  Clean, well appointed and comfortable.  A quality bathroom.  The street level bar/restaurant was very good.  And finally, the location/neighborhood could not have been better.  i would stay here again and again.",5,2020,03,03
129,Always Perfect!,"A beautiful oasis in South Kensington with lovely accommodations, outstanding staff and excellent restaurants. Whether one needs a boarding pass printed or directions, an extra pillow or help with the internet, all requests are handled promptly and with grace. As a guest who has stayed at The Ampersand several times, it feels like coming home! It's my favourite London hotel.",5,2020,03,02
129,Really nice hotel,"Ideally situated in South Kensington, we were made to feel really welcome from the minute our booking was made. Front of staff were very helpful.  Comfortable, clean and great service, will definitely be back.",5,2020,03,01
129,Impressive,"A last minute trip booked to London led us to The Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington and when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the hotel staff and the aesthetic of the hotel- everywhere you look, you see something interesting and colourful. The location is perfect: with our five year old we  were able to walk to the museums (the Natural Science Museum was our favourite at 5 minutes away) and for our daily meals we were spoiled for choice in South Kensington with a great variety of local restaurants around. The hotel room itself was cosy and the bed was one of the most comfortable we‚Äôve slept in. Service was top notch: our son particularly enjoyed the kids‚Äô afternoon tea served on a rocket ship cake tray. I made use of the gym which was a great plus staying at this hotel. We will definitely return to The Ampersand for our next short trip to London. ",5,2020,02,29
129,Great stay in a spacious room with excellent staff,"We stayed 3 nights in two rooms, a deluxe room and a superior room.  Both rooms were spacious (especially for London) and had excellent beds with plugs on both side tables.  The mini bar was refreshed daily and the bathrooms were cleaned/refreshed twice daily including at turn down.  I can't overstate how nice these rooms were for being in central London at this price point, an absolute steal, especially including the extras mentioned above and the quality of robes, towels, linens, bath products, etc.  

Each room also had its own segregated wifi which meant lightning fast speeds and also came with light controls via the TV if tech is your thing!  The Times was also delivered daily and you could send laundry out to be pressed if needed.  Overall the room experience was excellent and punched well above its price point. We did have one night where we heard folks stomping in the room upstairs, but that seemed to be a one-off and the room was otherwise very quiet.  

Check-in and check-out were friendly and efficient as was service throughout, including everyone form doormen (offering suggestions and carrying bags, providing umbrellas, etc.) the front desk staff, and cleaning crews who were always there with a smile and to ask if you needed anything. They even sent along a special plate of treats for my dad's b-day!

The rest of the property was well appointed.  There were several spaces to just relax and what appeared to be a beautiful tea, though we didn't participate.  The gym was also fine, with only a few machines, but that was enough as I was in there 3 times and never saw another guest.  The only drawback I thought was the basement restaurant where service and the food was a tad lacking.

Location wise this was perfect for us, across the street from South Kensington station (circle/district and Piccadilly) but on a quieter side street.  This enabled us to get anywhere throughout the city quickly while being away from the touristy crowds (well as much as you can be in London.)  I'd highly recommend staying at this location and property again.",5,2020,02,28
129,"Really, really good","We stay in London regularly and often feel the prices we pay don‚Äôt reflect the level of comfort/service. Not this time! 
This hotel is really beautiful and the service is wonderful. 
To be fair, we did have an upgrade (much appreciated) so it‚Äôs fair to say we paid less than we should have...but I suspect the experience would have been as good anywhere in the hotel. 

The room was really lovely, great toiletries, coffee, soft drinks, magazines, books, technology, decor - and immaculate. 

The turn down service was so good. Our room was not only refreshed, but toiletries, coffee, water etc were all replaced. Bin emptied, toilet paper checked, everything you could ask for! 

We didn‚Äôt use the restaurant or the drawing room (but we will next time!) but they looked lovely. 

We had a great sleep and stepped outside to find a handy taxi rank. 

Can‚Äôt fault it. Thank you Ampersand, you are our new london hotel of choice. And we‚Äôre fussy! ",5,2020,02,28
129,Big Birthday Trip,"Stayed 3 nights from 25th Feb, brilliant staff, all very friendly from concierge, to reception to housekeeping. Couldn‚Äôt be more pleasant or accommodating. Our room was spacious and comfortable and spotlessly clean. Complimentary soft drinks in the minibar, plus Nespresso coffe machine and a fine selection of teas. ",5,2020,02,27
129,Luxury in south kensington,"Super location near the tube and some excellent restaurants and pubs.   Over all service very good. Staff were friendly and helpful. 
Rooms were modern, comfortable and of a standard you would expect in a Hotel with this grade. ",4,2020,02,24
129,Great stay,Lovely big and clean rooms. They did a nice birthday plate surprise for my boyfriend with chocolates on them. The price for a pot of tea at breakfast was a lot! But otherwise very good. Thank you very much,4,2020,02,24
129,Design flaws,"I have stayed at the hotel multiple times, in rooms with different layouts, and they all have the same problem. The wardrobe is squeezed into a corner, and you can‚Äôt access it without reaching around the door to get into it. There is a desk crammed into another corner, which is really the only place to open your suitcase. I travel light but even the superior room is just too poorly laid out for my one medium-sized bag. Although I have seen a doorman in the lobby during the past 3 days, none of them has ever opened a door for me or any other guest. I return for the great location and quiet rooms. Showing signs of its age: chipped furniture, stained bedskirt, mattress needs replacing.",3,2020,02,22
129,Would highly recommend,"My husband and I stayed at The Ampersand for five nights in February. It is a top location for anyone who wants to be slightly out of the hustle and bustle, yet a two minute walk to the South Kensington Tube station and lots of bus options also. There are several museums only a block or two away also and many restaurants. The hotel itself is top notch. Friendly staff, well appointed rooms and a great restaurant and bar located on the ground floor. We had a fourth floor room facing the school, but it was Half Term so it was exceptionally quiet outside. I didn't find the room any smaller than other European style hotels, but maybe a bit less storage space than you might want to unpack your things. Loved the heated floor in the bathroom. Small touches like that made it special. There is a minibar with water, soda and milk, a tea pot and even some snacks that were refilled daily. It's an easy Tube ride from Heathrow....if the Tube is running normally on the weekend. Check the schedule before boarding.",5,2020,02,21
129,Home from home,"Lived here for 2 months and loved it, so friendly, top class service, brilliant location and gorgeous rooms. Cocktails downstairs a great way to start any evening. Room extras are perfect for long stays",5,2020,02,21
129,week-end stay in London,"The staff is very kind and helpful, but rooms described as ""SUPERIOR"" are no superior rooms, these rooms are very tiny and they don't have any storing place for clothes or luggage. The restaurant and the breakfast have a large choice.",3,2020,02,19
129,The Ampersand is a very good hotel to stay in.,"A modern,clean, comfortable,quiet and convenient hotel that has great food as well. It is not the cheapest of hotels, but the standard of service and its ideal location in South Kensington literally across the road from the tube station make it hard to beat in terms of access to all London has to offer. I highly recommend it, particularly for solo travellers.",5,2020,02,18
129,Excellent,The first time was great and memorable and the second time was even better. I thought after the first it won't be the same but the service level and delivery was better. Great location and wonderful place. My favourite place to stay in London.,5,2020,02,17
129,Our ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù Hotel in London,"My family and I stay at the Ampersand every time we‚Äôre in London. This would have been our third stay with our four-year-old daughter (and the fourth for my Husband and myself). The hotel is absolutely fantastic - from its location across South Kensington station, to the cleanliness and decor of the rooms and common areas and most importantly, the unrivalled quality of service we receive every single time. The Ampersand has especially made our daughter‚Äôs stays so memorable, and she now considers it her ‚ÄúLondon Home‚Äù. Thank you especially to the front door staff (I‚Äôm so sorry but I‚Äôve forgotten the name of the two lovely gentlemen who were at the doors on Thursday/ Friday and at the weekend past!). But they were just so friendly to my daughter, always taking the time to speak to her and ask her about her day, and spoiling her with the rubber duck and the car! We truly can‚Äôt fault the Ampersand, and we look forward to returning once again.",5,2020,02,17
129,"Lovely boutique hotel, warm, modern feel and great location.","My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ampersand in early Feb 2020 for three nights. We found the hotel warm and charming. The decor is delightful - a bit modern and traditional at the same time. Staff were friendly and easy-going. The room was small but most London hotel rooms are. Breakfast was nice, but you can get the same around the corner for < half price. I'd definitely stay here again. I think the biggest plus was that there was an underground station about a minute away and the general area is super nice with tons of shopping, restaurants and coffee shops. Frankly this is a more desirable stop to walk around than just about anywhere else in London. 

I think the hotel was good value for the quality and most importantly we slept very well. It was quiet and we weren't kept awake by anything.",5,2020,02,16
129,Great stay,"We stayed in this hotel while I was receiving hospital treatment and the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. The hotel is very clean, beautifully decorated and comfortable. We were in a room with an amazing wet room which was brilliant for me as I have a disability. They even got me a stool at story notice. We would pick to stay there again. ",5,2020,02,16
129,Excellent hotel,"Great location, great and attentive staff, lovely room with complementary minibar, very nice bathroom with robes etc, and very comfortable bed. Very close to museums, and very close to subway! Would love to come back!",5,2020,02,16
129,Exemplary,Made to feel welcome and important by every member of staff. A comfortable hotel in a great location. Every aspect of the Ampersand is first class. Will definitely stay here on my next visit to London.,5,2020,02,15
129,Always a great stay at The Ampersand,"The Ampersand is still our favourite hotel stay in London. Staff are great and always helpful. We were lucky to get an earlier check-in on this occasion which we very much appreciated. Location of hotel is so convenient, next to South Ken Tube. ",5,2020,02,10
129,Outstanding service + lovely imaginative afternoon tea,"We booked afternoon tea on our way to a day at the museums. The welcome from the staff excellent - we were a little early and waited in the foyer; the two staff members talked to and engaged our 6yo which was a great start. The scientific afternoon tea was excellent - imaginative, well presented and tasty. We had the standard one, vegetarian and the kids one - we were all full afterwards. Two things made the afternoon tea special - the staff in the drawing room were great (attentive, friendly, could not do enough for us, but were not all over us) and sciencey bits like beakers,pippets, measuring syringes to make a drink and occupu the time between ordering and the food arriving.  Food was very well thought through - four savouries, two scones and four desserts - little extras helped like a tube of passion fruit paste, chocolate and biscuit dinosaurs to discover at the end. Pricey but worth every penny as a treat.",5,2020,02,09
129,A fantastic stay,"In a business trip I staid in this hotel, fantastic. Rooms, service, position and staff arenall superlative. I warmly recommend it. It has also a restaurant that I did not try, I had only a drink. I did not have breakfast, I found the price to high ",5,2020,02,08
129,Perfect Place to Stay in London,"My husband and I were returning from a cruise  and decided to spend a few days in London before our return to the states. Without a doubt, The Ampersand Hotel was wonderful. The staff was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. They talked me through understanding the currency, the transportation system and answered all my ‚Äúclueless‚Äù questions about London. The room was well-appointed and had a very comfortable king-size bed (hard to find in most GB hotels). The location was also perfect, a very short walk to the underground and also had bus-stops right in front of the hotel, including the hop-on hop-off tour bus. All in all a perfect place to stay in London!

We have two preteens with us who loved the whole experience, this is a must if you have a future scientist.  We had visited the Science Museum prior to then surprise the children was fabulous. The experiments that are placed on the table just make such a lovely experience.

The Drawing Room was a lovely setting and the food was outstanding. 

Well worth a visit for afternoon tea.",5,2020,02,04
129,Winter Getaway,"Me & my wife spent 4 wonderful nights at the Ampersand. Conveniently located just a block from a tube station, it was the perfect location for exploring London. The hotel was spotless and beautifully decorated, with quirky art and fun wallpaper throughout. Our room had a king bed which was extremely comfortable. We loved the Science Afternoon tea, which was delicious and fun. The Apero restaurant in the basement was charming and had some amazing cocktails, my favorite being the Alphonse.

129,Customer Service Second to None,"We chose the Ampersand for our overnight stay in London due to its proximity to the Royal Albert Hall and we couldn‚Äôt have chosen better.  It‚Äôs a beautiful building and the decor is luxurious yet fun - our room was Mozart themed, with manuscript wallpaper and cushions.  The room was very comfortable, with lots of little top notch extras. Getting back from the Albert Hall late, we ordered french fries from room service and they arrived freshly cooked, in generous portions and still hot. Breakfast was also excellent. Throughout our short stay the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us - especially the reception staff - and their warmth and attention to detail was very much appreciated.

The tea was fantastic, as was all the food. I got the gluten-free menu, and everything on it was delicious. It was great that you couldn't tell it was gluten-free while still getting the cool science experience
The service was amazing too, every one that served me was so nice and willing to do anything to make the experience great. The atmosphere was very relaxing and great for solo tea drinkers (myself) and those with more than one person

The hotel exceeds expectations every time. The location is absolutely perfect and within walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants. It‚Äôs also walking or a very short cab ride to our favorite shopping. There is a taxi queue right in front of the hotel plus it is literally across the street from the south Kensington tube station, so you are an easy ride to anywhere you want to go. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about The Ampersand and the staff.",5,2020,01,05

The place itself is fabulous, great design, the staff always is welcoming and willing to help, breakfast and very good amenities (all the mini bar is complementary)

The only thing I would recommend is to take the superior room instead of the small one since it‚Äôs much more comfortable.",5,2019,12,30

Unfortunately bad service in the restaurant. However, good service in the hotel. Good but small gym.

129,Science Afternoon Tea,"I have few words to describe the adults and children‚Äôs Science afternoon tea except: Absolutely AMAZING. No more words available look at my photos. Service was brilliant, the food superb (unlimited refills on both sandwiches and drinks), probably better than superb actually. Our children were absolutely mesmerised by the way in which it was served and that they could make their own lemonade from liquids in test tubes provided. Did I mention the food was sublime? It is expensive but absolutely worth it.",5,2019,12,29
129,Doesn‚Äôt worth the money,We found the hotel through the booking comments where it was excellent. Well it‚Äôs nit nice 9 sqm room very small can‚Äôt move and more than 200¬£ for a night!

129,London visit,"Great location with a nice staff but in-room facilities could be better (eg. better WiFi service, Nespresso Coffee machine, bigger TV with more premium channels). Insisting that reviews contain 200 characters really annoying and Tripadvisor has rated this very good value for money while I rate it at average at best!",4,2019,12,16
129,"Wonderful hotel, great location and fantastic staff.","Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more accommodating staff when I came to stay with my four month old twins. Extra touches that would have been nice would have been being told in advance to book the drawing room (or reserving some capacity for hotel guests), use of a baby monitor, and a solution for loading/unloading the car on arrival/checkout of the hotel. But honestly otherwise had the most wonderful stay and look forward to returning in the future. ",5,2019,12,10
129,Our home from home in London,"In my humble opinion a great (as opposed to a very good) hotel is one where you don‚Äôt feel like you are in a hotel at all - other than the fact that others are doing all the hard work!  I‚Äôve stayed in the Ampersand quite a lot in the last few years because I get that feeling.  It was especially important this trip because we were accompanied by my 88 year old mother in law.  Everything worked perfectly from check in to check out, in particular having linked rooms.  For all these reasons the Ampersand is our home from home in London.",5,2019,12,10
129,Hotel Perfection,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location, amazing attentive staff - what more could you ask for!  Nothing was too much trouble during our stay.

129,Room for improvement,"Generally the location is good. The hotel needs to work on improving the rooms/sizes and becoming more ""green"" and ""smart"". 

In addition the staff the hotel should consider adding to the overall experience by offering more included services such as shuttle service to the airport or a special attraction experience. ",3,2019,11,26
129,Great Central London Hotel,"The food, staff, location, and amenities were excellent at Ampersand. The underground in directly across the street for any access to the city you could need. The neighborhood felt safe and taxis are easy to come by. ",5,2019,11,25
129,Long weekend and Royal Albert hall,"Excellent location, great hotel, staff are attentive to guests needs and nothing is too much.

129,Fantastic Location and property,"Staying in London on my own for 2 days, South Kensington provided the ideal location for me with so many tube lines and connections and the Ampersand was right on its doorstep.
The hotel itself is wonderful, a boutique luxury hotel with helpful and friendly staff who couldn't do more to help.
There were 2 bar areas available for working in the evening over a glass of wine along with an office if you required more privacy.
With regard to food, the breakfast was really delicious. I didn't eat there in the evenings as the menu was more tapas like and nothing really jumped out at me. But in South Ken there was a host of other options on the doorstop.
Superior Room itself was small but perfect for 1 person for the couple of nights that I stayed - to be fair to them they clearly call this out on the website. 
If I was coming back with my husband I would be looking to book the next room up for the extra space and storage.",5,2019,11,19
129,Home Away From Home,"I loved coming 'home' to Ampersand after a busy days exploring London.  The bed was extraordinary and the bathroom, oh I wanted to bring it back to America with me.

129,Oasis,"Calming and cosy hotel in a fabulous location.

Staff are very engaging and caring.  Our room was not large for a Superior, but this is London and partly due to the massive bed (comfortable).  Room seemed to have been upgraded in recent past, so tech, aircon and bathroom all great.  

Breakfast in the Apero basement restaurant is a mixed bag for me - too expensive for Continental, given my preferences, but tasty for a la carte.

Will hopefully be back soon...",4,2019,11,08

The rooms have lovely amenities include loofahs, good soaps and bottled water. Would highly recommend. ",5,2019,10,22

The hotel is immaculately clean, the rooms are stunning (the tall ceilings are especially beautiful) with plenty of great quality amenities, underfloor heating in the bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. The staff are so friendly, we were greeted with a smile by every person that we interacted with, and I'd like to especially mention Hossam who went above and beyond to make our anniversary extra special by booking us a last minute visit to have the science afternoon tea (delicious by the way!), leaving a lovely message of anniversary best wishes in our room, and complimentary treats - thank you Hossam!

Not only is the hotel a luxury in itself, but it is also in a brilliant location for good transport links (South Kensington tube is just across the road) and for sightseeing - we walked to the Natural History museum, the Science Museum, and even Hyde Park. 

Whether you're visiting London for the first time or just looking for a lovely stay in the city, I would highly recommend The Ampersand Hotel.",5,2019,10,18

129,Perfect Spot,The Ampersand is a perfect place to both explore London and to hide in and do nothing. When you get nestled down in the basement bar then nestling down does seem rather appealing.

129,"A lovely, family friendly hotel in an excellent location","The Ampersand is a lovely, quality hotel with thoughtful, attractive decor in an excellent location for museums, public transport, restaurants etc.   The staff in particular were very helpful, attentive and genuinely warm and friendly.  They made us feel very welcome and, when they found out we were there for a family celebration, they arranged a congratulatory gift of chocolates to be sent to our room - how lovely!",5,2019,10,11
129,Trip to London,Had booked this hotel for a Birthday trip to the Royal Albert hall for my wife we were so well looked after it made the experience a memorable one for us both Many thanks to all the staff at the Ampersand hotel ,5,2019,10,10
129,Fabulous location!,"Love this hotel and always recommend to friends. Superb location, fabulous room and outstanding staff! This is at least our fourth stay, our favourite room is the Deluxe studio with the bathtub in the window!",5,2019,10,08
129,Brilliant afternoon tea....,"We booked for afternoon tea for 12 for a 40th birthday... the Science themed tea was great for the children aged 4, 6, 7 and 9... the adults enjoyed it too....  we were in the Library so the children could be noisy without disturbing other guests... and they were kept busy with experiments and weird food for the full two hours... amazing.  I would recommend Ampersand....",5,2019,10,08
129,perfect,"Great location, serviceThis is a perfect hotel in the south Kensington area that has close proximitry to Kensington Palace and gardens. Great local restaurants in areas esp Rocco's! Definitely would repeat!",5,2019,10,07
129,Nice hotel. Service could be improved.,"Generally a good hotel but service at breakfast and for afternoon tea was slow. Rooms great. Location good. 10 minute walk to the royal Albert hall and tube station a few minutes walk. 
We have stayed at many SLH hotels and the service needs to improve to bring it upto standard.
",3,2019,10,07
129,Another great stay,"I really think the Ampersand has got it licked - really friendly helpful staff, a lovely clean and comfortable room and a great position.  For London it also not too pricey especially if you book direct.",5,2019,10,07
129,Great stay,Worked well for business and couples travel. Very comfortable and quiet room and helpful front desk staff. Basement restaurant was excellent for breakfast and evening drinks. Will use this hotel again  and highly recommend it.,5,2019,10,07
129,Excellent Hotel in an Excellent Location ,"Wow, from the moment we arrived we loved this hotel. The service is always friendly and attentive, the standard of amenities and furnishings is excellent. 
We had a wonderful room overlooking the road but almost zero noise. The room was massive and had fantastic amenities. 
We loved the lighting options and the controls for the room on the tv. The wifi was very fast.
The bed is exceptionally comfortable and warm. The bathroom was very well appointed and even offers a tv.
This is an hotel we look forward to returning to. ",5,2019,10,06
129,Brilliant London hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and also had the Science themed afternoon tea with friends.  Firstly, this hotel is located in one of the best spots in London - just a short walk to the South Kensington tube station and the museums (Natural History, V&A).  There are also a number of lovely cafes (not cheap though!) and restaurants within easy walking distance too.
The hotel is lovely - staff were friendly and efficient.  The science theme is carried through with the decor.  The rooms were lovely, and the bathroom was surprisingly huge for a London hotel - complete with shower (not in a bath!) and even with underfloor heating.  The bed was comfortable with good pillows.
The afternoon tea down in The Drawing Rooms was gigantic, and fun for the kids with mixing of drinks and dry ice.  
Definitely would stay here again",5,2019,10,06
129,Wonderful boutique luxury hotel in South Kensington,What an amazing hotel.  Room was bright and lovely and the staff was helpful in every way imaginable.  Breakfast in Apero restaurant was delicious and thanks for the gluten free toast.  Literally steps from the South Kensington stop on the Circle and Liverpool lines and a very short walk to major museums and Hyde Park.  Was able to cram in so much with a 2 night stay.  It will be my go to booking on my next trip to London,5,2019,10,05
129,Lovely Boutique Hotel near South Kensington Station,"Great boutique hotel located just right near South Kensington Station in London. Room had a very comfortable bed and great shower! 

Buffet breakfast they provided was great and they also consider vegan options as well. WIFI was great and room was nice. Staff were friendly, nice and provided excellent service. 

Not only is the tube around the corner, it is in an area were there are plenty eating options, close to the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museums. There is a also a bus stop near the hotel.

There is also an area to use a few computers and the restaurant/wine bar was very good and quite popular. They also had a service for booking a car to Heathrow which I used for my flight out of London.

Would stay here again.",5,2019,10,04
129,Excellent stay,"Very clean quiet comfortable room, also very spacious. Decor in room and lobby unique. Location very good for museums and transportation. Staff always very friendly and helpful. Would happily stay there again.",5,2019,10,01
129,Simply Wonderful in Every Regard,"At our recent stay, every last detail was attended to.  Our specific bed requests were accommodated before our arrival, and the bed for our kiddo was bedecked with her own set of towels, toiletries, child-sized robe and slippers.  Our bed was superbly comfortable (and this may be the first trip I've had in ages where I've had no complaints about the pillows!)  The location could not be better, with about a one block walk the the South Kensington underground station, making all of our destinations easily reachable.  There are a wealth of good restaurants all reasonable walking distance.  The in-room stocked beverage mini bar was such a lovely gesture, and the Ampersand had my heart at an in-room french press for making coffee every morning.  The staff was delightfully helpful and genuinely friendly.  I'm not one to make effusive reviews of hotels in general, but the The Ampersand truly goes above and beyond for their guests and it was most appreciated.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else when we return to London.  ",5,2019,09,30
129,Great hotel.  Great location,"Lovely hotel in a great location. Very comfortable bed with a lovely room. 
The hotel car service was very good and affordable. Didn‚Äôt eat at the hotel so can‚Äôt comment. Only stayed for one night, would be nice to come back again sometime. ",4,2019,09,30
129,Really nice hotel in a great area,"Friendly and alert staff. 
Clean and fine rooms. Some of them a bit small. 
Great area with nice restaurants and atmosphere. Not as busy as the area around Oxford and Regent street. Over all very nice to try out a new part of London. ",5,2019,09,30
129,A Gem of an Hotel,"Superb location with easy access to many museums, Harrods and other London attractions. 30 seconds walk to the tube with 3 major tube lines including the Piccadilly line. Excellent quality and cleanliness of accommodation. Friendly and attentive staff. Also charming, cosy  Apero with excellent variety of cuisine with some Italian influences.A true gem of an hotel - would highly recommend for my friends and business colleagues, whenever they are visiting London for business or pleasure. Best, Julie",5,2019,09,26
129,Best hotel in my books for a London visit,"The Ampersand is my favourite hotel for business and leisure trips to London. The location in South Ken is ideal in terms of getting to most places in London and the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and has the most friendly, attentive and efficient staff.",5,2019,09,25
129,A perfect weekend in London,"We enjoyed our stay at the ampersand hotel very much. The service was very good, the rooms cosy and the location is more than perfect. We dined at the restaurant and it was delicious. Everyone was very friendly and helpful ",5,2019,09,24
129,Two women and a baby,"Nice location, fine room, when we changed to one with a large bed, and very nice staff. Traveling with a baby was no problem as long as we walked the streets. However, we now know that only few underground stations in London have lifts, South Kensington not being one of them, and for car service/taxi travel, you have to arrange way in advance to get an appropriate seat for a 4 months old baby.",5,2019,09,24
129,Home from home,"Have been going to the Ampersand since it opened its doors. Feels like home now. All is great and take it from me I am difficult to please. Well done. Above all the people make it great. Always cheerful, helpful. Thank you",5,2019,09,24
129,Still top for service and style in London,"The Ampersand manages to provide a stylish and calming retreat from the noise and chaos of London. Service from every member of staff we met was exemplary- smiling, polite and helpful. Rooms are well maintained and beds very comfortable. Breakfast provides a good cold buffet choice or well cooked hot dishes to order. We had a family meal in the Library which every guest left full of praise for the venue, food and service. Well done to all at The Ampersand!",5,2019,09,24
129,"Small Luxury Hotel in South Kensington, London","We just returned from a lovely stay at The Ampersand Hotel. The staff was very attentive and tried very hard to make our stay comfortable and pleasant.  The rooms were clean and comfortable. It is a lovely hotel, in a great location.  We loved the location.  It was close to the ‚Äútube‚Äù and was easy to get to the attractions we were interested in. ",5,2019,09,19
129,Didn‚Äôt live up to expectations,"My partner and I stayed at The Ampersand for five nights last month. We were really looking forward to our stay, but walked away feeling pretty disappointed. While we raised various concerns with the Front Desk team during our stay, they were not addressed. 

-	Our check-in experience was poor. There is no attendant at the door, so when we arrived, we had to haul our luggage up the stairs with no assistance. The staff member who checked us in barely acknowledged our existence, preferring to engage in an animated discussion with her colleague while she scanned our passports and took our deposit.
-	Attention to detail was lacking. For example: (i) we were celebrating a special occasion, which was not acknowledged during our stay (despite my written correspondence with the hotel); (ii) in advance our arrival, I asked the hotel to confirm that my dietary restrictions had been registered for afternoon tea, and the Front Desk fobbed me off to the Restaurant Team, who never responded; (iii) allergen information at breakfast was inconsistent (for example, the muesli was marked vegan on the menu, but marked with a milk allergen at the buffet); and (iv) we were asked five times by five different people for our room number during breakfast. 
-	Our room (Deluxe) was dark and pokey, even though I suspect it is one of the better rooms in the hotel. There were two towels in the bathroom. The combined bath/shower was very slippery, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for older guests who may struggle with their balance. 
-	The gym is very small, and during our entire stay one of the (four) exercise machines was broken. My boyfriend is training for a marathon, so the Front Desk had offered to compensate him for the cost of a daily pass at a local gym until the machine was fixed. At the end of our stay, we presented the e-passes issued by the gym, along with a bank statement confirming payment, and this was not accepted as sufficient evidence. So we ended up paying. 
-	My deposit was held by the hotel for over two weeks. When I followed up, the Front Desk gave me the approval code, and told me to contact my bank. My bank, in turn, told me the code needed to be communicated officially through the hotel. After reaching out to the hotel once again, the amount was released the following day.

On the positive side, the location is good. The hotel is clean, and the light fixture in the main staircase is pretty. The hotel is also reasonably priced by London standards.",2,2019,09,19
129,Ampersand Hotel:  loved it!,The Ampersand Hotel is a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of South Kensington. The staff were friendly and efficient. Room was clean and comfortable. Location is great near museums and the tube. We highly recommend it!,5,2019,09,18
129,Great small business hotel in South Kensington,"The hotels location and the interior design was excellent. As we were a small international group of 6, the wine room was perfect for our two-day meetngs. Metro station is like 100 meters away and it is always possible to find a taxi or uber. Many dining options around the hotel. The staff at the hotel always take good care of us. The gym downstairs was large enough for my morning workout and water is provided with clean towels every morning.",5,2019,09,17
129,fabulous london hotel!,"we loved our stay at the ampersand hotel. the location was perfect. south kensington is such a charming neighborhood that was walkable to hyde park. our room was very comfortable and we loved all the details (like the bathroom amenities and cute ampersand rubber duck in the shower). our only minor issue was the absence of a top sheet on the bed...which we have come to realize is a UK thing. we just get too hot without the option to throw off the duvet and still be covered by a top sheet. the ampersand staff was very warm and helpful. they even helped us pre-book a car to take us to heathrow the following morning. that was so convenient! overall, would recommend the ampersand hotel to anyone looking for a hip, comfortable place to stay in london. ",5,2019,09,15
129,Excellent hotel in London,"Great location of the hotel. A boutique hotel, high quality in the highlands. Kind and attentive staff to customer needs. Cozy breakfast, high-end room service, room arrangement and towel change twice a day. Free mini bar.

129,Wonderful stay!,"The Ampersand is our favorite hotel in London.  The rooms are cozy, clean  and  comfortable.  The location can‚Äôt be beat!  The restaurant offers delicious food. We  walked to museums, restaurants and Shops.  The tube is a few feet away from the Hotel.  ",5,2019,09,09
129,Wonderful place,"We prefer to travel 'on the fly' so we can be flexible. Stumbled onto this gem and so glad we did! Staff was super helpful, if highly accented at times. High end toiletries, amazingly comfy beds were a welcome plus! Only sticky point; we did have to ask 3 times for a room service  menu on the 2nd day which we never did receive. When we just decided to phone our order down in the AM they asked why we didn't submit a menu!!! üòí Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend! ",4,2019,09,08
129,Excellent experience,Excellent Hotel! Great Location. Walking distance to Victoria and Albert Museum and the tube. Modern facilities. Very helpful staff. Great breakfast staff and meals. Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London. ,5,2019,09,07
129,"Comfortable, fun hotel in fabulous location",We loved our stay at The Ampersand. It is a stone's throw from the South Kensington transit stop and very close to wonderful museums (including the Natural History Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum). The staff were welcoming and gracious. The room was large and comfortable. We love the new technology. We enjoyed the decor/aesthetic. We look forward to returning when we come back to London.,4,2019,09,07

129,A Perfect Hotel!,"I didn't think I'd ever use the word ""perfect"" to describe a hotel but it's truly the only word to use in describing The Ampersand!

129,Loved it!,"We chose this hotel to be near to friends who live in the same street. It was a good choice. The position, close to the tube, is excellent. The area around it is busy with even a little market accross the road on Saturday morning. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We loved the little extras in the room like milk, cookies, coffee and cooldrinks as well as complimentary newspaper.
They have lovely fluffy towels and gowns and the rooms a good size. The bed was comfortable and our room quiet. The interior is beautiful - would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,09,01

129,Didn't disappoint,"Booked for our wedding anniversary and didn't disappoint. Small but beautifully laid out room, with a big bed and gorgeous bathroom. Rosepetals were a lovely touch to our occasion. Afternoon tea was incredible, one of the best I've ever had. The staff were efficient and pleasant. Everything you'd expect from a hotel in this price bracket. Would love to return!",5,2019,08,31
129,Gorgeous hotel in a fantastic location,"We stayed for one night for my sister's birthday and couldn't fault our visit.  Our bedroom was on the ground floor near reception but blissfully quiet.  Although one of the cheapest rooms there was plenty of space, complimentary soft drinks in the fridge, lovely toiletries and robes, slippers etc.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in and we both had a great night's sleep. 

We had mentioned the birthday and were gifted a little plate of sweet treats with a postcard from one of the lovely staff.  Everyone we met was so warm, welcoming and friendly - faultless.   We had a room service breakfast of a full English that was superb.

The location is excellent - opposite South Kensington tube, 5 minutes walk to the V&A and surrounded by delicious foodie outlets.  Our only regret is that we didn't get chance to try the afternoon tea - any excuse to return!",5,2019,08,30
129,Excellent location - ‚Äúbut included‚Äù breakfast is cold food only,"Best possible location- super close to the tube.

All staff were absolutely wonderful. 
Would go back. ",5,2019,08,29
129,Luxury with convenience,"I stayed at the Ampersand two different times on my recent trip to the UK and both times the staff was very friendly and helpful.

129,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED/VERY SMALL ROOMS INCLUDING THE SUITE!,"We were extremely disappointed with both the service and small rooms in this hotel. We were traveling to London with a family of 4 and spoke with several staff members before we booked the hotel. I requested ""connecting"" rooms to accommodate a family of 4 and they assured me that the ""suite"" connecting to a ""standard"" room was the best and only option.  However, we couldn't believe how small the rooms were!! The ceiling was ""slanted"" so it felt like we were sleeping in an attic...there was no space to walk around the side of the beds.....the size of the ""suite"" bedroom area was the same size as the bedroom in the standard room. The only difference was a small area with a couch. The rooms were narrow and tight....so we couldn't really get comfortable or unpack our luggage. The carpeting in the rooms were ""old and worn"".....need to renovated.  The service was just terrible!! Unfriendly, unhelpful staff at the front desk!! The ""Asian lady"" (i'm sorry I don't recall her name b/c she never introduced herself to us!) at the front desk always seemed annoyed if we asked a question. In one situation, she actually just ""threw"" the map at my husband rather than answering his question.  She definitely did not want to be bothered. This hotel definitely needs a separate concierge or should target just ""local"" guests not international, as we were traveling from the US. We definitely overpaid for suite.  Also, we were never informed at check in that breakfast was included so we only ate breakfast there once.",1,2019,08,25
129,Best Stay,"The location, the hotel services and the staff are top notch! Don't miss their afternoon tea. It is an experience not to be missed. The restaurant menu is superb. Their location (1/2 block from the Underground) makes it super easy to get everywhere. We will be back!",5,2019,08,25
129,"Great hotel, great location, excellent stay","Stayed in a suite with bedroom, ensuite, lounge area and kitchenette and small balcony.  Located on the top floor.  Amazing bed, very comfortable, great ensuite with TV to watch from the bath or shower.  Breakfast in the onsite restaurant was terrible, both food quality (arrived cold 2/2 times), customer service and of the 2 times we ate breakfast there meals did not arrive for at least 20-30 mins after ordering.  Great hotel though, just go elsewhere for breakfast.",5,2019,08,25
129,Fabulous Hotel in a great location,"We have stayed at The Ampersand many times and it never disappoints - great staff, lovely room and comfy beds, Fabulous buffet breakfast and great coffee!  and a good location for getting about London. ",5,2019,08,25
129,"Great location, friendly staff, excellent service",It's all in the title. We we treated very well by the staff and had a wonderful stay. South Kensington is busy and more trendy than ever so there is plenty to eat and do just a short walk from the hotel.,5,2019,08,25
129,Afternoon Tea,"We came for the afternoon tea after a morning at the science museum and WOW! From the minute we were welcomed in and shown to our seats we had the most amazing service. We ordered the science afternoon tea for the adults and the sci fi afternoon tea for our daughter-the theming was brilliant, so quirky and everything tasted fabulous. I have a night booked here in October for my daughters 5th birthday and after our afternoon tea experience, I am so looking forward to our stay here. Can highly recommend!",5,2019,08,24
129,What a Gem!,This is a wonderful boutique hotel. Light bright and beautifully presented. The staff are kind and nothing is too much trouble for them. The rooms have everything you could need. Fabulous! Will use this hotel for all our visits from now on.,5,2019,08,24

129,A Little Gem!,"We stayed here for a couple of nights in the middle of the week, late August, as we had tickets for the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall.
The hotel is 2 minutes walk from South Kensington Underground station, about 10 minutes walk to the Albert Hall. and 5 minutes walk to the V&A, Natural History, and Science Museums. So convenient.
We stayed in a ‚Äòsuperior room‚Äô on the ground floor. It was on the small side, and there was no view from the window, but it was immaculately clean, very comfortable, and remarkably quiet. The air-con was fine, great Wi-fi, lovely shower with nice towels and toiletries, tea & coffee making facilities in-room too. All brilliant.
Our deal included continental brekkie, which was great. The public areas were comfortable, and the staff were friendly and efficient. All told, we had a lovely stay, and would certainly return.",5,2019,08,22
129,Delicious Afternoon Tea,I went with my family to try the afternoon tea and I was really surprised! When art and taste meet everything can only be perfect. Any sweet or dessert were well presented and delicious. Staff is helpful and polite explaining and suggesting different options for you. Absolutely recommended!,5,2019,08,20
129,Beautiful Environment But Poor Climate Control,"What a gorgeous hotel situated in beautiful South Kensington. However, we were surprised that the air conditioner in our room did not work.  Our room temperature ranged from 24 to 29 degrees.  We enquired about this 3 times, and nothing was done (other than a service technician recommending that he bring us a fan).  For a hotel with a 5 star rating, this is totally unacceptable.  We also had opened snacks and beverages in our refrigerator on the first evening.  Very disappointing overall.  We really wanted to love The Ampersand.",3,2019,08,19
129,Outstanding - thank you x,"We cannot praise this hotel enough!
I rarely note a review but this has been a pleasure. 
Our stay has been first class !

129,Wonderful staff fabulous food ,I went to the Ampersand Hotel in London today with my mum and my son (5). I am often nervous about taking him places like this because he is autistic and can be a bit noisy so I emailed to ask if it would be suitable for him and they were so accommodating and told us the quietest times to visit so he would find it less stressful. When we got there everyone was very welcoming and they had arranged for us to be in a private dining room which was just so amazing because it meant we could be relaxed that we weren‚Äôt going to bother anyone. The first thing you get to do is make your own lemonade which just really set the tone for a fun afternoon. The food for both the adult tea and the children‚Äôs tea looked incredible and my son who is normally quite nervous about foods got so caught up in the excitement that he tried everything. At the end you get to ‚Äúexcavate‚Äù chocolate fossils from chocolate soil. By the time we left he said his cheeks hurt from smiling so much. If you are going to the science or natural history museum this is right round the corner and I really recommend it. ,5,2019,08,14
129,"Welcoming, clean and beautiful interiors","Great location in South Kensington, two min walk from the Tube and a small walk to some of the attractions in the area.

129,family visit,as usual very good. this feels like coming home with a staff that answers your requests in the best possible way. Would be nice if the hotel could provide e-bikes to cover some distances. And then again the distance to the nereby metro station is roughly 100 meters,4,2019,08,13
129,Vacation with the family,"We booked the room above the standard room. Our room was nice but tight. We had a king size bed and maybe afoot between wall and the bed. The location is great and easy to the tube. Easy walk to museums and shopping. A lot of restaurants in the area. Quiet side street.great walking area as you can easily get to many of the major tourist areas.    Staff is excellent. The gym was small but adequate. Breakfast was good.   I would recommend the hotel. Can‚Äôt really change the size of the rooms. It very well may be a function of the building types in the area.  The buildings all are similar so another hotel may not have larger rooms. I reality you don‚Äôt spend much time in them.

129,Best hotel in London,"I have staid at this hotel numerous times and so I can honestly say that the friendliness of the staff and quality of service is impeccable. The position of the hotel is very convenient, close to some of the best museums and concert halls in the world, and the hotel is like a wonderful home away.",5,2019,08,12
129,Post concert lunch,"Looking for somewhere sufficiently off the main tourism track to be sure of tranquility and speedy service, it was great to revisit the bar/restaurant at the Ampersand after a two-year gap, and discover nothing has changed! It may be a basement bar but the layout, design and lighting combine to an airy welcoming ambience which makes for a really background to a good meal.  Food was good, wines well worth exploring, service excellent: perfect for a light brunch/lunch/supper after a concert at the Albert Hall. ",4,2019,08,11
129,Another great stay,This is a lovely hotel in a great location . The service is efficient and friendly and the staff clearly enjoy their job and make guests feel very welcome. This was our second stay and we would always choose this hotel again if visiting attractions in this area of London.,5,2019,08,11
129,"great service, amazing location, best afternoon tea","one of the best things is the location because it's right next to the south ken tube station, and many local bakeries and cafes are nearby. also beautiful area and nice run to hyde park! the staff is very nice and accommodating, and the service was very good. the rooms are nice and spacious but our shower drain was a bit slow and after 2 showers it leaked out and made the floor and carpet wet. i like the high-tech keys and phone system as well because it is very efficient. the afternoon tea is a very fun and memorable experience and definitely worth the money! tastes so delicious especially the scones. i got the vegan one and my dad got the normal one and both were amazing. the dry ice and soda things were fun little things that added to this wonderful experience! ",5,2019,08,09
129,A beautiful experience,"A perfect location for visiting London, close to the subway and in a beautiful neighborhood. The hotel is equipped with every comfort, it is very clean and the staff is friendly and professional. I recommend this hotel!",5,2019,08,07
129,Sumptuous,"This was incredible value for money when I booked in advance. I‚Äôd definitely stay there again as the menu was extensive and delicious, the bed was exceptionally comfortable, the bathroom was exquisite, and the staff were very kind and friendly indeed. I enjoyed listening to music on the TV, and the sweet touch of having a book on Mozart left next to the bed was endearing. I ordered a meal at about 2:30 one morning and it was brought to my room in 20 minutes and thoroughly enjoyed. How efficient and kind that was. A charming hotel and could perhaps only be improved by giving guests greater and more reliable access to the drawing room. The hotel‚Äôs restaurant seemed very comfortable and attractive though I didn‚Äôt have a meal there on this ocasi√≥n. Wonderful hotel for my four night stay in London. And the location is fabulous.",5,2019,08,06
129,"Great location, Great Value, and Five star service","We just spent the last three days at this property at the end of our European adventure. It was a great way to end our travels. The staff is so professional. A can do attitude. The location makes total sense. We've been to London many times, and this was the best value for our money. Try them out. You'll be impressed.",5,2019,08,06
129,Wedding Night,"We loved everything about this: excellent, spacious and comfortable room; friendly and thoughtful staff. There was no unnecessary fuss, and the whole experience was understated, but good.

Ian and Amabelle",5,2019,08,05
129,"No complaints, not very luxurious","Great service and really nice staff. Wonderful location. However, this hotel  somehow misses the mark for the price point in ways that are difficult to describe. As an example: there were messages in the hallway and room that due to road closures there would be no laundry service on Sunday. My thought: this seems fairly specific and  not relevant to me. However, it turns out that there were other more salient disruptions, i.e. no taxi service to Heathrow, which I learned upon checking out! Obviously, the road closure is in no way the fault of the hotel but they seemed to miss the big picture. Luckily, the hotel is a block to the subway, which was an easy ride. And the hotel staff was excellent in assisting me in figuring out the steps I needed for using the subway. Again, no real complaints but for the price point and the number of options in London, would stay elsewhere in the future. ",3,2019,08,04
129,Worst visit,"I travel to London on a fairly regular basis. I have got a group of hotel I visit and the Ampersand is one of them. I find that London hotel prices vary with demand and why not. This time around sent me to the Ampersand for a quick turn around business visit. They put me in room no 1 which was so dark that I could hardly see with every light on in the room. When I opened the curtains I looked into a brick wall which has only happened once before in my travelling career. The shower was open and for a reason I know not I had two showers side by side suggestion a luxury which the room certainly wasn‚Äôt. Net result a bathroom awaiting a serious fall and me paddling around with wet feet and moisturizing the carpets. The whole room was ridiculous to the extent that when I packed to leave I left my trousers because I could just not see to pack. All this is very negative but I have to say as always the staff was very good, very helpful and I slept in a room which was normally reserved for the staff. Never again if this is to be the standard.",2,2019,08,04
129,Always high standards,"We love this hotel, the high quality service, room, food and location all add up to the only place we stay when going to London.  South Kensington tube station is a v.short walk as is the museum and countless great restaurants and sites. ",5,2019,08,04
129,Some Thoughts,"This hotel is located in an active area within easy walking distance of several museums, and close to an Underground entry.   The staff is courteous and helpful not only at the front desk but also in the dining area.

The lounge areas are quite nice, and all is clean and tidy.
",5,2019,08,01
129,A wonderful London hotel -brilliant Location,"The more I travel the more the experience is the staff!
at the end of a month away i was blown away with the service! I had 3 rooms booked and the staff could not have done more for us- accommodating our varied needs!
Location is fantastic for just about any visitor to London- rooms are varied -small rooms are only really for 1 person as per their website",5,2019,07,31
129,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed (as a couple) for four nights this June. The hotel was great, staff always friendly and responsive, loved the free drinks and treats in the room (very nice, friendly touch). My only possible ding was that the room was quite small (we were the highest possible non-studio category), but I guess that's expected for London. Location was good, breakfasts fantastic and near any possible coffee or restaurant one could want. ",5,2019,07,30
129,London Vacation,"A superior accommodation with attention to detail! From the moment of arrival I was treated as a valued customer. The food in the restaurant was of the highest quality and nice options. As an American, I was used to free refills and water with my meal. When asked, the wait staff provided water but in small quantities. I would return if ever in London. ",5,2019,07,30
129,K Jones,"Really nice little boutique hotel, beautifully decorated and helpful and pleasant staff.
Made first day in the UK a pleasure.
Easy to get to Hyde Park and Museums, and the little bar and restuarant downstairs is lovely",5,2019,07,27
129,Our stay July 16 thru 19.,"We will recommend this hotel to others and use it again when we return toLondon. It was a great value as we stayed 3 days but paid for 2. The location was wonderful related to 1) local travel walking to museums, restaurants or bars, or other travel via tube or taxi. The staff at all levels were very customer focused making our first experience in London wonderful. ",5,2019,07,26
129,"Wonderful, Absolutely Wonderful","Selecting a hotel in a place I have never been before is always challenging. Many of my friends are relaxed about it as they consider their hotel just a place to sleep, shower, and change clothes. But for me, it‚Äôs my comfort spot when I need a break from being a tourist, so I prefer it to comfortable, roomy, attractive, and well appointed. To that end let me just say I picked so well!
The hotel does not look like a hotel from the outside, in fact it reminded me of an upscale townhouse. Inside the common area is medium in size with a lovely afternoon tea restaurant. It‚Äôs clean and neat but also warm and has an understated elegance. And the staff are friendly and make you feel like a welcome familiar face.
Our room was a suite with a separate bedroom and a small balcony that gave us a nice view of a bustling street and over roof tops into town. It was my husbands morning coffee with the newspaper and early evening coffee spot. The living room had a kitchen with two small fridges - one was a mini bar stocked with bottled water, juices and sodas which were all complimentary and restocked daily. For us, that alone was cause to pick this hotel. So comforting to come back to our room, receive a warm greeting from the reception desk staff, then sit on our balcony with a cold juice in hand while reminiscing about the day and discussing where to go for dinner.
Anyway, the other fridge was empty so we had room to store things separate from the minibar. There was also a sink with plates and silverware - a mini kitchen. I believe there was a microwave but I do not do any cooking while on vacation, so... And everyday there was a fresh supply of nespresso coffee and a bag of chips or cookies. It was just so pleasant. And a round of applause to housekeeping!!
The couch pulled out to be full size sofa bed which was perfect for our son. The bedroom was small but still gave us sufficient room. There was a table and chair that were convenient for fixing my hair and makeup. Only downside was the bedroom was kind of dark, only one long but narrow outside window. 
The bathroom was great! Lots of light and windows. The shower was a large open wet space; it was separate from the bathtub. We loved the shower. And the amenities were upper end and plentiful.
The hotel has a restaurant, library and game room, and good air conditioning. The location is in South Kensington and is right next to a tube station as well as taxis. There are several restaurants, shops and museums (Museum of Natural History and Science, Victoria and Albert Museum) in the immediate area.
It is the ideal hotel. Our next European vacation with include a few days in London and we‚Äôll definitely stay at the Ampersand!",5,2019,07,25
129,Quiet neighborhood in London,"Excellent hotel in every aspect.  Short walk to Underground station for three lines, Circle, District and Piccadilly.  Staff were all very professional and obviously well trained.  I highly recommend this property.",5,2019,07,25
129,"Everything ok , but the room","Nice hotel , good location , service not up to a 5 star franchise (no one there to help with the luggage etc). Biggest downside was the room. I have never ever seen or stayed in such a shoebox (which was already upgraded - hard to believe. The room was around 10m2 had absolutely NO wardrobe or anything to hang a suit. Funny enough the bathroom was similar sized with 2 showers. If I wanna be positive it was charming but that‚Äôs the end of anything positive. This is not a return option. Overall for SLH a real disappointment.
",3,2019,07,23
129,Disappointing,"The reviews on TripAdvisor seem to depend on which room the person stayed in. Our room was small, dark, with worn out carpets. The bathroom, however, was modern and clean. Hotel location is very close to a tube station and near several restaurants and shops... which was convenient. Overall, for the price we paid, the room was very disappointing.",3,2019,07,21
129,Accomodating,"The hotel is situated next to an underground station and bus stops. They provide free soft drinks in the mini bar (which get restocked daily - my favorite part - made me feel very welcome). The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They made a point of greeting me every time I walked past them. 

The room had electrical issues. The lights would turn off on their own then flicker back on. The sink in the bathroom leaked. I also had a view of a wall from my window. Overall it was a great hotel. The bed, soft drinks, and the staff make up for it. (In their defense the hotel was booked solid for Wimbledon)

I would def. stay here again but request a different room. ",4,2019,07,21
129,Ampersand - July 2019,"Had an excellent stay at The Ampersand Hotel.  The staff were extremely pleasant, the room was lovely and spacious.  The bed provided us with the best sleep we've had in years. 
The bathroom was a little smaller than we expected but still functional and very nicely decorated.
The extra personal touch of the sweet treats wishing me a happy birthday was extremely thoughtful and they tasted delicious.
We look forward to returning for a longer trip.",5,2019,07,20
129,Thank you Guiseppe!,"We had an AMAZING celabration of our sons 8th birthday with the science Afternoon tea. Thank you for making it so special ‚ù§ The food was great, and ill reccomend this for any family who want to have some extra fun while staying in London.",5,2019,07,18
129,Disappointing experience,The hotel was overbooked on arrival after we had made reservations several months ago. The manager only appeared after we started asking detailed questions. We were moved to a hotel round the corner that felt lower standard (comparing actual room vs pictures). The bed was a very small double and very old. Overall the room had a very worn out feel. The manager offered free breakfast (not sure why didn‚Äôt upgrade our original room considering it was their mistake) and whilst appreciated did not make up for previous. Overall a very disappointing experience.,1,2019,07,18
129,Excellent in every way!,"From our arrival to us leaving our stay was brilliant. Hotel lovely, staff really lovely and food lovely. Really close to car park, underground and Hyde Park where we were attending BST. Really good central spot and lovely area.
Will definitely stay here again. Thank you Ampersand!",5,2019,07,18
129,Brilliant Accommodations,"Our stay at the Ampersand was brilliant. The team at the hotel was attentive to every need we had, our room was more that gorgeous, and the food and bar outstanding. In addition to being in a prime location this hotel stands out for its service and attention to every detail. We left impressed and looking forward to out next stay. ",5,2019,07,17
129,MCs,"A great central London hotel to base your stay.  Room, food and service all good and will definitely return.  We only stayed for one night but the beds were comfy and breakfast the following morning was very good.",4,2019,07,16
129,Science Afternoon Tea was Fantastic!!,"We had the privilege of having our last afternoon in London be spent at the Science Tea at the Ampersand Hotel.  Our kids (ten and seven) loved the science experiments and science-themed food.  We don't prefer the less healthy food often offered on kids' menus so we ordered the adult teas instead (ordered 3 for the 4 of us since 2 were kids).  It worked out perfectly.  There was plenty of food and they bring more on request.  The teas were made from fresh, high-quality leaves.  The atmosphere was beautiful and no one rushed us... we took our time and enjoyed every minute.  The service was way beyond any we had received in London thus far.  We spoke at length with Javier and he took great care of us, as did the several others who stopped by our table frequently to see if we needed anything.  If you're looking for a great tea to take the kids to, this is the place!!!",5,2019,07,15
129,"Lovely hotel, great location","Everything about the hotel is excellent but a single room is not worth the money. Location, decor, staff etc. all very good.  This was my second visit and I was on my own so booked a single room - not a good idea -- too small and closet-like.  No floor space to open a suitcase - ended up leaving it next to me on the bed. ",4,2019,07,14
129,Superb!,"The attention to detail and interior design is what makes this 5* hotel worth the visit. We arrived at 9am on a flight from the USA & every effort was made to accommodate us. Early check in was seamless and much appreciated! L‚ÄôOccitane products (including hair conditioner) & a rubber duck in the bathroom were a nice touch. As was the free soft drink mini bar & Times newspaper. 
We booked breakfast for 6 people and were shown to a beautiful private dining room, the food was excellent! 
The location couldn‚Äôt be better for South Ken tube station and the front desk were very accommodating storing bags for us. Will always stay here for visits to London from now on! ",5,2019,07,14
129,Lovely property in excellent location,"Our family of 5 very much enjoyed our stay at The Ampersand in June. The afternoon tea was unusual and fun, the rooms were comfortable and the staff was efficient. The location is a favorite of ours, so close to the tube and restaurants. ",5,2019,07,13
129,Reliable Comfort and Care,"Have stayed at the Ampersand several times now, and recommend it highly for convenient location, notable comfort, and exceptional care and attention of staff.  The property is lovely.  The rooms are well appointed and plush.  The staff is friendly, competent, efficient, and eager to help with any request.  The neighborhood offers everything a traveler could need:  immediate access to multi-line Tube station (including the Piccadilly Line for direct service to/from Heathrow, and District/Circle lines for one-train service to Paddington and Kings Cross/St Pancras Stations), a wide range of food options (everything from takeaway food to fine dining, in a range of cuisines, and including a handful of artisan bakeries and a good local pub), services such as shipping, and easy walks to the Natural History and V&A Museums, Hyde Park and Harrods.  The Ampersand always offers a satisfying stay.",5,2019,07,13
129,"Great position, great hotel, friendly people","This hidden gem is located in South Kensington in the heart of the French quarter. Perfectly positioned near the Tube station, there are bars, cafes and restaurants everywhere. It's also walking distance to museums and Harrods, Harvey Nics and shopping.The hotel rooms are very comfortable and the staff amazing. Great restaurant downstairs also.",5,2019,07,12
129,30th Wedding Anniversary Launch,"Loved staying here, perfect mix of location and comfort! The food and service was excellent! The scones were fresh baked each day and the room service provided prompt service with hot food still hot upon arrival!  ",5,2019,07,11
129,Amazing hotel,"If you want luxury and location pick this hotel. I have yet to experience such quality in London - from the well-stocked (and complimentary) mini-fridge, french press and snacks to the pampering products in the bathroom. An air-conditioned, silent room with excellent tech - even your own phone for your stay. 1 minute's walk to the tube station. Amazing. ",5,2019,07,11
129,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed at the Ampersand for three nights and enjoyed it very much.  The location is so perfect for walking around as it is close to parks, museums, restaurants, and the S. Kensington tube station.   The rooms are very comfortable and stylish.  My bed was very comfortable and my room was very clean.  It was very quiet and I was on the first floor.  

Originally, I booked a single room and realized it was way too small for me and my large suitcases.  I asked for an upgrade and fortunately a larger room was available.  They were very gracious and transferred all my luggage to the new room when I returned at the end of the day.  Anyway,  just be aware that the single room is really, really tight and the bed will take up most of the space.  If you're just there to sleep and don't have a lot of luggage, it probably won't be an issue but I highly recommend at least the superior room if you like to spread out and not feel cramped.

The staff was great and the service was excellent.  All the decor and difference spaces to hang tastefully done with a touch of whimsy.  I noticed every day the tea time was very popular.   

I would definitely stay there again!",5,2019,07,10
129,Amazing afternoon tea,An incredible afternoon tea experience. I went with my 12 year old daughter for her birthday and we were treated like royalty. All the food was literally out of this world. So theatrical but also delicious. Highly recommended. Definitely worth every penny üòä,5,2019,07,09
129,Good. Could do better,"They try but for this type of hotel it should be better. 
The staff are friendly. Great location to get around. Staff are friend. 
AC doesn‚Äôt work well. 
The insulation between the floors is so so. You hear the guest in the room walking around. Very annoying when you are trying to sleep.  Due to the fire doors being heavy they slam. You hear all the bedroom doors slamming as people come and go from their rooms. Again incredibly annoying if you are trying to sleep. They need to put some padding on the door frames so the doors don‚Äôt make so much noise when they close. 
Housekeeping kept missing or forgetting things. Everyday it was something. 
Don‚Äôt think I will stay here again. ",4,2019,07,09
129,Fantastic Summer London Location,"Stayed here for my 50th birthday in 2017. With the three-nights-for-two offer, we splurged for a suite - absolutely the right decision. The room was quiet and comfortable, and frankly I could have stayed in the bathroom - one of the best I've seen in a hotel. The neighborhood is delightful, a really enjoyable change of pace from more touristy parts of London and yet still within easy reach of museums and Hyde Park. South Kensington is especially enjoyable on warm summer nights. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning, which was above hotel buffet standard, and the Science Afternoon Tea on another day. I highly recommend that experience. The staff were uniformly friendly and attentive to our needs. It's nearly two years later and we still talk about this stay. We will be back.",4,2019,07,08
129,Lovely hotel,"A really lovely relaxed hotel with very attentive staff, and individual style and rooms. Lots of little details such as complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar, real milk rather than UHT plastic, bath robe & slippers, quality bathroom toiletries etc. The public rooms and the bedrooms are stunning: ""Boutique"" and stylish without being naff, and the staff are fabulous. We stayed in a ""Superior room"". My husband booked this as a special weekend for me and my daughter and we were blown away. It's not cheap, but I would still like to save up and stay again. Thank you everyone at Ampersand for making our weekend great",5,2019,07,08
129,Comfortable and Cosy in an elegant London setting,"The Ampersand is a true ""gem"" in the wonderful location of South Kensington.  The hotel is a block from the underground station and close to many of the important museums (Natural History, Victoria and Albert, Science)  My husband and I have stayed there numerous times because it meets all of our needs.  The rooms are spacious (we reserve Deluxe) and the ""little extras"" (free soft drinks/water, fluffy towels and robe, plush and comfortable beds) make our stay feel almost more comfortable than home.  There are no complaints, only praise for this wonderful facility!  A true five star experience.",5,2019,07,07
129,Lovely experience,"stay regularly now and love it. Sleep really well, in expertly fitted out rooms. Soft pillows - a rarity! Everything works. all eating in a choice of attractive places. Award winning ‚Äòtea rooms‚Äô still with room all day. Visitors come from all over the world. All ages & stages with mountains of luggage or like me, living within sight of the hotel with builders too loud to bear. all welcome!",5,2019,07,06
129,Warning!! Don't bring a cat - there's no room to swing it!,"We stayed here for one night when our usual London hotel was full. Thankfully it was only one night and any longer and I could not have stood it.  There is a reason the photos of the rooms have only limited pictures of the room, mainly featuring the headboards. It's because this is all you can see.

The tiny room was dark with a view onto a brick wall.  No room to put your cases and we only had two hand luggage bags!  You have to shuffle around the bed.  Hardly any storage in the so called wardrobe which is only half height so ladies don't bother bringing a dress with you.  As usual dingy lighting for doing hair and makeup but The Ampersand is not alone in this.

Easily wins the Smallest Room I Have Ever Stayed in Award. It also nearly won the I Couldn't Care Less Award for the reaction from the front desk when I mentioned this fact the following morning.

On the plus side the rooms were clean, the bathroom was good and the Public areas are lvery stylish but the bedrooms are a complete rip offI   Unlike Arnie, We won't be back.",1,2019,07,05
129,Perfect location!,"Second time I‚Äôve stayed here.   Love the location, the staff are great and it‚Äôs a very nice (and not too big) hotel.  Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book it again and will hopefully stay longer on the next visit.  Rooms are lovely, as is the rest of the property.",5,2019,07,04
129,A unexpected stay.,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel at very short notice. I actually walked in off the street as we were badly let down by the Rockwell Hotel, although they blame Booking.com. So be warned, I have never been let down like that in all my years. The Ampersand staff were fantastic, the room was great (Room 2) on the ground floor. I could go into lots of detail, but I won't. All I can say is that the Ampersand Hotel and especially the staff made a disaster of a weekend into a great one! We will be back soon! A special thank you to the doorman who tried so hard to hail us a cab when the Tube station was closed very suddenly. ",5,2019,07,01
129,Very Pleasant Surprise,"We checked into the Ampersand Hotel after a long weekend watching our favorite baseball team get stomped by the New York Yankees. Needless to say, we were whipped. After settling in to our nicely appointed room, we decided to try the hotel bar/restaurant before we wandered around Kensington. We sat at the bar and Laszlo the bartender (bartender doesn‚Äôt do Laszlo justice. He really is a quality mixologist) was so enthusiastic about the quality of the food and the beverages that we decided to stay for dinner. Good choice.

The cocktails were top notch. The steak tartare was a generous portion and seasoned perfectly. The smoked mackerel pate (and I always turn my nose up at mackerel) was wonderful. I had the duck for an entree while my wife had the pork Ragu. Both were wonderful. We finished it off with cappuccinos, rice pudding (not your traditional, but maybe better than), and the Swiss roll.

This was 5 star all the way. Service, ambiance, quality, and a reasonable price.",5,2019,07,01
129,Very good hotel,"I stayed for 1 night on business. The hotel was excellent: good clean room, helpful staff, and great location. It was above the standard that I would normally expect. I used one of the meeting rooms for a training session and that was very good also.",5,2019,06,28
129,"The best hotel in London for quality, service, location and price average.","The service is wonderful from your arrival until your departure, The rooms are very nice, the breakfast excellent and the dinner a yery good experience. The personnel in the reception will tray to help you in any think you wiil need, And in particular the maitre and the all the personnel in the restaurant are alwways happy to serve you in  the best way.",5,2019,06,27
129,"Wonderful service, great location","I stayed at the Ampersand at the end of a business trip after staying in another London hotel, and could not have been happier. The staff was courteous and very helpful, offering tips for local restaurants and answering any questions. The room was beautiful and very clean. Perfect location right near the underground. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!",4,2019,06,27
129,A gem in South Kensington,"We generally stay at different places around London, and this was our first time here.  We stayed 3 days, then were away for a day and came back for a fourth day.  The hotel is just steps away from the South Kensington tube stop and the museum areas. 

The writeup on the Ampersand is good, and the actuality is better.  The staff was warm and friendly, and while we were not able to get into our room immediately (straight from the airport) we were able to leave our things and walk over to the V&A museum, less than two blocks away.  They called us when the room was ready, and we came back to find our bags in the room, and we had a very quiet,  well appointed room with brand new bathroom which we loved. Complimentary paper in the morning, and good coffee. (Note: we love to have a Nespresso machine for coffee in the morning ‚Äì the higher grade rooms have them).  We never had breakfast with them, since there were so many good coffee/pastry shops around the neighborhood.  

When we returned (they had held onto our bags for the intervening day), they upgraded our room for the last night (Thank you!) and we were able to finish out our stay in an even nicer room, equally quiet.

Many thanks to the staff who made our stay so pleasant.",5,2019,06,27
129,Central London gem,"Excellent location, just a block from the Picadilly line. So easy to go from the line to the hotel to the airport! A few blocks from The Victoria and Albert Museum, Harrod's, and Hyde Park. It's very busy around the area, lots of tourists, but lots of great restaurants and lots to see. The hotel is beautiful and service excellent. Americans, remember, rooms are smaller in Europe! Great place, we would stay there again.",5,2019,06,26
129,Two day summer stay,"Staying at the Ampersand is always a wonderful experience and this time didn't disappoint. 

On the first night the two of us we ate at Apero, the food and service was excellent, it was so good that we bought 3 friends to join us for dinner on our last night.  The experience was equally as good. This is a new favorite for us in So. Kensington.  ",5,2019,06,24
129,"Beautiful design, excellent service, highly recommended.","My husband and I stayed at the Ampersand for the second time, and it is even more wonderful than we remembered. Beautifully appointed, gorgeous design, clean and scent-free, comfortable bed, restful surroundings...perfect haven after a long day of sightseeing. Shower had excellent water pressure. Minor note: our room had very little storage space for a couple; we ended up keeping most of our clothing and personal items in our luggage. Customer service was excellent everywhere - at the front desk, at the restaurant (Apero) and in the Drawing Room (we loved the Science Tea! Be sure to make reservations ahead of time). Wonderful neighbourhood!",5,2019,06,22
129,Perfect in every way,"Good location, extremely accommodating & helpful staff, very reasonable rates, comfortable room, can't  begin to praise this hotel enough.  My new go-to hotel in London, for sure.  The hotel is spotless & service is seamless.",5,2019,06,20
129,That rare find - a truly good hotel,"It would be nice to always get what you pay for but it is rarely the case.  However the Ampersand delivered on all counts.  The staff were courteous and efficient, the room was spotless and well designed, the shower was powerful and was walk in and it was in a great spot.  I will definitely stay again.",5,2019,06,19

129,"Great London Boutique Hotel Location, Breakfast & Afternoon Tea","We loved our stay at the Ampersand Hotel. Our family of four, 2 adults and 2 boys, stayed in London at this amazing hotel. We booked through Mr. & Mrs. Smith and enjoyed our adjoining double room family suite and delicious breakfast daily.  Upon arrival at the airport, we were greeted by a private car service arranged through the hotel who quickly dropped us off in comfort and also drove us to the airport upon departure. So convenient and accommodating! The Ampersand is in a fantastic location near Tube stops and in easy walking distance to shops and cafe's on a nearby promenade walk-street. The hotel's restaurant recommendations in London allowed us to sample all types of international and English cuisine. We visited all of the great sites of London from our central location at the Ampersand. We highly recommend The Ampersand Hotel! We will definitely stay there again when we have the opportunity to return to London.",5,2019,06,16
129,"Science Afternoon Tea, Exciting Experience, Great Service","My partner and I enjoyed the Science themed Afternoon Tea at the Drawing Rooms, the Ampersand Hotel. The whole experience was really exciting with lots of different science-themed activities as part of the dining experience. Although themed, the meal was not gimmicky or cheesy, it remained very stylish. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,06,14
129,Perfect for out first time in London!,"Excellent hotel with all we needed for a super comfortable stay!  Rooms very clean and tended each day.  Lots of little extras like complimentary mini bar, Handi Phone for easy map info (including free calls to anyplace)!  We were on the ground floor and it is pretty quiet even with busy street outside.  Super close to South Kensington station that is really easy to get around the city.  Close to many restaurants that are very good.  The most comfortable bed ever!  Would not hesitate to stay again!",5,2019,06,13
129,Three night stay,Really fabulous stay! The staff was wonderful and could not have been more helpful. The front desk guy got us a wonderful dinner reservation. My only comment is I would not recommend the ground floor rooms as there is noise from the kitchen in the basement. ,5,2019,06,12
129,Perfect Location for touring London,"Not only is this property just a couple of blocks from three museums and Royal Albert Hall, but it is also adjacent to the South Kensington Underground Station. The lines that run through that station will take you directly to many of the sights on your list. We will stay there again.",5,2019,06,11
129,Usual great stay,"Stayed five times at this hotel over the last 6 months. Always receive excellent service and the staff are very professional.  Great location.  Rooms and common areas are always immaculate.  Although the hotel is often full (or near fully booked), the hotel never feels particularly busy, which in my opinion is a sign of a good hotel.

129,A home me away from home!,"My wife & I had a most enjoyable 4-day comfortable stay, with excellent service, very good food in an excellent location. We were pleased to return again. Our compliments to the staff for their special attention.",5,2019,06,08

 Museums within walking distance as well Harrods and other shopping options 
 ",5,2019,06,07
129,Very nice service & location,"I like going to this boutique hotel. The staff is very friendly, rooms are nice and cosy. I strongly recommend. Good breakfast, excellent place for an afternoon tea. Not very far from Hyde Park, at walkable distance.",5,2019,06,06
129,Charming!,I highly recommend The Ampersand. It is a charming hotel located off of the South Kensington station and surrounded by great restaurants. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The room is small but the bathroom is large. I would come back to The Ampersand!,5,2019,06,04
129,Enjoyable stay,Good breakfast and nice room. Facilities were of high standard and free WiFi . Very helpful staff. Would definitely go again.very well located about 5 minute walk from south Kensington station. Bed was comfortable and bathroom well appointed.,4,2019,06,04
129,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed here for one night last weekend as a birthday treat. On arrival i was struck with how friendly and helpful the concierge and the front desk were as they ironed out a couple of little issues with the minimum of fuss. 
Location wise - this is perfect for the Natural History Museum as it is literally a 2 minute walk away. The area itself has a few bars and restaurants but is relatively quiet - but South Kensington tube station is right next door and Harrods etc is only a short 10-15 min walk up the road.
The room we had was well appointed but quite small - but as we were only there for one night this was not an issue. Had bottles of water, small snacks etc. No iron but i do believe these were available on request. Good quality bath products too.
We went into the bar towards the end of the evening and really enjoyed chatting to the bar manager who was incredibly passionate about his product and taught us a thing or two about Whisky!.
Breakfast was a cold buffet, perfectly nice and plentiful, with the option of purchasing hot options should we have chosen to.
Overall, this is a great hotel with some truly great people working there - and we would definitely come back here if wanting to stay in this area.",5,2019,06,04
129,Great hotel,"The hotel was a wonderful find, charming well located with great staff, services and amenities. It has a well equipped gym and a lovely afternoon tea as well as walking distance to many museums and great shops. ",5,2019,06,02
129,Solo stay in south kensington,"Quality boutique hotel metres from the tube and cafes. 

Having lived in London I wanted a short stay for a couple of nights in transit. 

It was class and in an excellent location to all of London. 

Definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a quality stay",5,2019,06,01
129,Fabulous small luxury hotel,This little gem is located very close to the South Kensington tube station and within a short walk to Hyde Park and Chelsea. Very modern room with a comfortable bed. Very quiet. Highly recommend! Thanks!,5,2019,06,01
129,Excellent hotel in an amazing location,"This was my second stay at the Ampersand. The staff is amazing, very courteous and efficient and go out of their way to  take care of their guests. The location is unbeatable steps from all public transportation plus there is a taxi stand right outside the hotel and many good restaurants and pubs two minutes away. The rooms are on the smaller side  so if you are planning to stay more than a couple of days I would suggest booking a Deluxe room. There is virtually no closet space but that is a minor inconvenience given all the other benefits. The staff offered to bring a rolling rack to hang my clothes but I declined. This is my go to hotel in London.",5,2019,05,30
129,Perfect few nights stay in London,Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. Fantastic location super close to South kensington tube so easy to get to. Very comfy beds the best hotel bed I have slept in! Polite and helpful staff. Hotel decorated lovely. We had breakfast included which was also very nice. Would recommend to anyone.,5,2019,05,30
129,Perfectly placed ,"Made a last minute booking as we were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and wanted to avoid running for the last train home again. 

Perfectly placed just a stone‚Äôs throw from South Kensington tube so v convenient for museums and RAH. 

Hotel is sparkly clean and reception were friendly on check in and allocated us a quiet room on the top (5th floor) as I said I would be working in my room until check out the following day. Some people have mentioned you can hear the rumble of tubes from the rooms but it really is v minimal and didn‚Äôt bother us at all. 

Superior room beautifully decorated and plenty of room though bathroom was q small. 

Breakfast the next morning was a delight with lots of fresh fruit, nuts, cereals, breads, eggs etc and ‚Äúproper‚Äù coffee rather than the usual hideousness hotels often pour out at breakfast. 

Lifts are fast and efficient (we recently stayed somewhere where they were a nightmare). 

WiFi is brilliant and I worked in the room in peace until checkout before nipping to the natural history museum shop on my lunch break to pick up some gifts for our son. 

The hotel is surrounded by cafes and restaurants so easy to walk out to dinner/lunch. We enjoyed tapas at Casa Brindisa before our show. 

The themed afternoon tea at the hotel looked really fun and we will definitely be back with our son to sample that. 

Perfect short London break would highly recommend. ",5,2019,05,29
129,Amazing service and great bed! ,"This was our first stop on our anniversary Europe trip and wow was it a great start! The staff was beyond attentive. We arrived early and they kept our luggage until our room was ready. They called us once the room was ready and we were placed in a nicer room! It was a little small however this was not a problem because the bed was beyond comfortable! One of the best hotel beds I have slept in. The hotel was clean and nicely decorated. It was chic and perfect for a couple nights stay. It was in proximity to everything. We walked to Hyde park, coffee shops and you are right next to south kensignton station if needed. The location is absolutely perfect! It is walking distance to so many museums and shops! Plus they have a science themed afternoon tea which is sooo cool! They give you complimentary water, juice and snacks! I cannot wait to come back for another stay! ",5,2019,05,27
129,Ampersand South Kensington,This hotel is in an excellent location. it is very stylish without being pretentious. A nice blend of style and practicality with an emphasis on cleanliness and utility. The staff are very friendly in general and the front desk staff are outstanding!!,5,2019,05,27
129,Afternoon Tea,"Science afternoon tea is absolutely fabulous. We are a family of four we had science afternoon tea and kids afternoon tea, both were really fun and well thought out. The presentation was out of this world on a rocket cake stand with experiments and Dino digs to keep the kids busy. We would highly recommend. Staff were really friendly and hotel is beautiful. Location close to tube station and excellent value for money.",5,2019,05,26
129,A brilliant hotel,"The hotel where I usually stay was full end so I ended up at the Ampersand by chance, and I loved it. The location is wonderful, easy access to all parts of town, many restaurants, caf√©s and shops on its doorstep, close to the best museums, walking distance to Knightsbridge. The rooms are clean and comfortable, great beds....Staff well trained and incredibly friendly. Restaurant serving delicious food and staff going out of their way to make the dining experience a good one. I will definitely be back!",5,2019,05,26
129,Great hotel but rooms vary,"Have stayed here numerous times - fantastic location (tube, park, shopping, local restaurants) and nice small restaurant, great for drinks or breakfast. Rooms vary dramatically, some lovely big comfortable rooms but the ""single"" rooms are very small and uncomfortable - most seem to face to the interior of the building which has little light or air. Would not recommend anything less than the deluxe rooms, preferably the superior rooms. ",2,2019,05,23
129,ONE NIGHT STAY,First time here. Great staff and well looked after hotel. Restaurant was good and reasonably priced. Good location for tube links. Had a room at the rear of the hotel which was quiet even with the window open. Will stay again.,5,2019,05,23
129,Wonderful little gem in South Ken,"Superb little find in South Kensington, within spitting distance of the underground and the attractions of V&A, Hyde Park and Natural History Museum.  Great cafes and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, but the hotel itself has a wonderful restaurant too.  Slightly reluctant to tell everyone about this place in case I cannot get a reservation in future.  A real gem of a hotel. ",5,2019,05,21
129,Well Located Hotel,"The hotel is well presented and has a great location being very close to South Kensington tube station. There are lots of great casual dining options close by.
Our room was comfortable but very compact. It was on a lower floor closer to the traffic.
The hotel was not as focused on attention to detail as some others, however this in general does not detract from the overall stay.
Staff were friendly, but not overly proactive to engage with guests. 

",4,2019,05,21
129,Fantastic hotel,My home away from home. Great staff are the icing on the cake and location can‚Äôt be beat. Both the bar downstairs and the drawing room offer excellent food and service. Gym isn‚Äôt large but does the job and with Hyde Park near by who cares. ,5,2019,05,19
129,Birthday celebrations,"Fantastic customer service-outstanding. I had unexpected surgery and the hotel allowed me an accessible room with no fuss. 
The afternoon tea was mind blowing and the people in the hotel wonderfully professional yet authentic -at reception and the lovely lady I chatted with in the drawing rooms of note. 
We are still here and for my little girls 8th birthday the hotel have pulled out all stops with treat after treat (even stumbling over Lego on the floor) to deliver a happy birthday and pleasant stay gift to our room.
I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to re-book! Now my new London favourite. Huge comfy beds and a quirky contemporary feel. Thank you to the hotel and staff and see you for breakfast! #ampersandhotel",5,2019,05,18
129,Perfect Service at Perfect Location for V and A and Natural History Museum,"We decided to spend a museum day in London on the way back from Paris before our flight back to the bay area.  We took the Eurostar to St. Pancras train station and walked over to the Piccadilly platform.  After a twenty minute tube ride we walked two minutes to the hotel - which is only a six minute walk to the entrance line to the V and A!

We were immediately greeted with genuine enthusiasm.  We arrived at the hotel at ten in the morning and when we asked if we could check our bags and freshen up so we could put in a full day at the V and A with a little Natural History thrown in, they found a room for us!  

Our room wasn't huge, but the amenities were fantastic, and the room was spotless  - even had a french press with decent coffee! And strong, dependable wife.  There is an espresso bar and a little gym.  The restaurant was good enough to attract locals as a meeting spot.  

SERVICE! The hospitality was superb without being unctuous.  The staff seemed to genuinely enjoy providing good service with the perfect balance of leaving us alone when we wanted to be left alone and responding quickly when we needed something.  

The Ampersand is now our go-to hotel for the heart of what we love in London.  I would recommend the hotel to everyone.  ",5,2019,05,18
129,Stunning hotel,"Thank you to all at the Ampersand hotel for a lovely stay! Beautiful room with the comfiest bed! Fantastic location, you are literally a stones throw from South Kensington station. We wandered around the local area and there is lots to see and so many places to eat and drink. 5* stay, we would definitely stay again!",5,2019,05,18
129,Stylish and comfortable in central London,"Stylish and comfortable hotel with excellent breakfast and staff, whether you are there for leisure or business. Great neighborhood, close by tube and Hyde park. Comfortable rooms and beds. If you are on a business trip: very efficient check in & out.",5,2019,05,17
129,Poor service,My wife took I'll and we couldn't travel from Scotland to England. I called and they were rude and said too bad no refund. I think they are a disgrace. I called 2cdays before. The girl on the phone couldn't care lesd.,1,2019,05,15
129,Detailed perfection,"Since setting foot in the hotel we could not fault anything. Professional, meticulous and great service. Great finishes and modern fittings.

A great sense for detail, from the soaps in the bathroom to the wallpapers in the corridor. We are truly amazed at the quality of service. Definitely worth the money. 

We have found our place to stay in London.
",5,2019,05,14
129,Wonderful Hotel,"Even before we arrived, we suspected this would be an excellent hotel.  Their attentiveness before arrival was unexpected and truly appreciated.

129,Excellent,"I stayed at the Ampersand several times in the past with my family and it is always a pleasure to come back. Very good location, confort, pleasent staff and quality service. Also a convenient location when arriving & leaving London by Heathrow.",5,2019,05,13
129,Style + Substance ,"We were very happy with our stay. We opted for a last minute deal and lucked into a studio room for ourselves and 10 year old daughter. The room was stylish and clean, with a nice coffee/ tea station, complimentary snacks and drinks. Our room had a little balcony and the bathroom is sublime (there is a tv in the shower/ bathtub!) The area is perfection: pretty and quaint without the tourist jam and grime of other areas. The food options felt endless. For picky New Yorkers, we were blown away by some. Highly recommend Bumpkins for pub food and Muriel‚Äôs for breakfast and afternoon tea. Our breakfast at the hotel restaurant was meh and expensive. The science tea was fabulous though!",5,2019,05,13
129,Newly refurbished cosy hotel at South Kensington tube station ,I stayed in a dozens of London hotels but never in South Kensington. And I was pleasantly surprised to find the hotel with so many merits. I fully share the positive feelings of other guests on TripAdvisor and want to send special thanks to the hotel‚Äôs staff for hospitality. Just one thing I want to point out - rooms on lower floors (my floor was 2) are in dangerous proximity to underground trains and you can feel those irritating vibrations during tube operation hours. ,4,2019,05,10
129,A hotel with the X factor,"The Ampersand has become my hotel of choice in London. It ticks all the boxes a discerning traveller is likely to have and then some more.   In particular the staff are an absolute joy - nothing is too much trouble for them,  I look forward to my next visit.",5,2019,05,09
129,Science Afternoon Tea is incredible,"The staff were so great, the location is beautiful and it is one of the most creative afternoon tea experiences I've ever had. Delicious vegetarian and vegan options. Fantastic experience - would highly recommend to any science or afternoon tea lovers!

We also saw they had a children's version too which looked like a lot of fun!",5,2019,05,07
129,Highly Recommend,Had a wonderful weekend in London. Great location South Kensington half a block from tube station. Room felt spacious with high ceilings and large bay window.

Excellent service at check in / check out, at the room service and front desk. Lovely clean room with a mini bar for free. Thank you!",5,2019,05,05
129,Lovely Hotel in South Kensington,"I just stayed at The Ampersand Hotel for 8 nights. This was not my first time staying in the S. Kensington neighborhood, but this hotel has definitely become my favorite. It's a small but very cute boutique hotel. 

Located in a prime location; very close to the S. Kensington Underground station (Piccadilly line & Circle/District line), museums, bus stops, and restaurants. 

I really enjoyed my stay! ALL staff were so friendly and helpful (front desk staff, doormen, and waitresses at the breakfast area). The housekeeping staff also did a good job (although I never got a chance to meet them); they cleaned my room very nicely daily.
 
Thanks to all the staff at The Ampersand Hotel. I'll definitely return next time when I visit London again :)",5,2019,05,04
129,5 star dog friendly hotel experience,"A truly dog friendly hotel. My 200 pound Old English Mastiff received a warm welcome along with my daughter and myself.

A free upgrade of the room was given to accommodate the Giant breed.

The Ampersand distinguishes itself by being a top notch 5 star hotel that is truly dog friendly along with the English Culture, by welcoming and providing dogs with a toy and food and not charging for the dog.

The room was beautiful and up to 5 star standards and the staff was professional and very kind.
Perfect location next to top museums and central public transport.",5,2019,05,02
129,Fantastic Stay in South Kensington,"We'll officially never stay anywhere else in London.  The Ampersand went above and beyond to make us feel valued and welcome.  The rooms were luxurious, as were the bathroom toiletries and complementary minibar drinks and snacks (non-alcoholic).  The location can't be beat, as it's right across the street from the South Kensington tube stop.  Noise isn't an issue here, even though it's a bustling neighborhood.  A wonderful city stay!",5,2019,05,02
129,Love the Ampersand!,"The Ampersand is a true gem and its location is superb. The staff is extremely friendly & accommodating--plus, the rooms are beautiful, comfortable & updated.  I always enjoy my stay here in South Kensington. ",5,2019,05,02
129,"Good location, not all rooms of the same quality","Œ§he hotel has excellent location. I did not get the room I expected, since my deluxe room was in the first floor, with a very small window that hardly opened, with no view and I paid the same amount of money as my friend whose room was bigger and nicer. I also asked twice for a bathrobe and did not get it for two days.",4,2019,05,02
129,Wonderful family experience!,"If you travel to London, and especially with family, look no further than the Ampersand. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious, with chic decoration, the staff are very friendly and there are several kids-oriented amenities that my 6 year old son loved: free pop corn, hot chocolate, even special bathrobes and slippers for the little ones. We stayed in a Double Deluxe room and our bed was huge, with comfortable mattress and pillows, which were highly appreciated after the long days of sight seeing. The location is also fantastic, with major museums and tube station right outside the hotel. My son made me promise we will stay there again ""for several months"" next time!!",5,2019,05,01
129,Romantic Weekend at The Ampersand Hotel,"We had a wonderful experience at The Ampersand.  Our room was perfect for a romantic weekend - big free standing tub in the room, incredibly comfortable bed, quiet corner of the hotel.  The staff was always friendly and helpful - they even sent up a small anniversary gift for us.  We expect to stay here again when we return to London.",5,2019,04,30
129,Top notch hotel,"Great location and friendly staff. We were so impressed by the room. Comfortable bed, stocked mini fridge, TV in the shower wall and heated bathroom floors! The hotel afternoon tea is excellent. Really neat experience. We got the vegetarian tea plate and ate everything on it! You will not be disappointed with this ""small luxury hotel"".",5,2019,04,30
129,THE USUAL QUALITY SERVICE AND FACILITIES IN AN EXCELLENT LOCATION,"We use The Ampersand regularly when visiting London for concerts and theatre. Short walk to The Royal Albert Hall and direct tube link to Leicester Square and Covent Garden for theatre and opera. Service at The Ampersand is always excellent and friendly. For a hotel of its size, there is always a personal feel to the place.",5,2019,04,30
129,Very nice hotel in the heart of the museum district,We booked this hotel as it was close to the Albert Hall. Having stayed at a soulless chain hotel previously for concerts this hotel provided a very different and enjoyable experience. Not cheap but it‚Äôs worth it. ,4,2019,04,28
129,Overnight stay,"This was our  2nd time Staying at this hotel -Brilliant service all round again - I stay in many hotels around the world and this hotel is highly recommended   great location for a few nights in South Kensington

The Ampersand Hotel was perfect in every way, lovely decor, great room, perfect in room facilities, friendly and helpful staff.
Neils the manager goes above and beyond
The decor is lovely 
Breakfast was delicious",5,2019,04,27
129,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Service, Excellent Location","You cannot go wrong with The Ampersand! It meets the mark on all fronts -- down to details like heated bathroom floors and a traveling ""cell phone"" to help you with free Internet access, GPS, and more while our on the town. My only suggestion is to book at least a Deluxe Room. We originally book the Superior category and were highly disappointed upon arrival (small, worn, terrible view). The South Kensington location is ideal for museums, shopping, and the Tube. We would stay here again in a heartbeat and have already started recommending it to friends.",5,2019,04,25
129,Great London visit,"Very nice stay in comfortable room with excellent service. Location in Kensington is convenient to tubes, restaurants and museums. Staff very attentive to assisting with transportation tickets and recommendations. Rooms nicely appointed and comfortable (deluxe).",5,2019,04,22
129,Best stay in London,"We stayed at The Ampersand for one night during the Easter holidays. It was our first trip to London with our daughter and we wanted it to be extra special and The Ampersand delivered!
I'd booked a Deluxe Room (but had noted to the hotel it was our first trip so anything they could do to make our daughters trip a memorable one would be great) direct with the hotel. 
On arrival our room wasn't quite ready due to a late check out. I'd asked if there was another room available as it was 2pm, unfortunately not as we had a suite! It was definitely worth the 30 mins wait whilst we ate our sandwiches in the rest area (:-)). 
The Manager on duty also gave us complimentary Continental breakfast (¬£16ea) which as an apology. The Breakfast was tasty and had a variety on offer. You could also order off the menu. 
We were shown to our room by the Concierge who was very friendly and helped recommend a nearby Pizza place. He also came up later with a treat for our daughter a few Petite Fours and a selection of sweet treats. 
The room was great, extremely clean, lots of toiletries, spacious (even with the big bed), coffee machine, kettle, microwave, three TVs (one in the bathroom), big bath with double basin and a balcony.
This hotel is also a great base to explore Kensington and it's only a few tube stops from Buckingham Palace. 
We had an amazing stay and would love to come back on our next trip to London!",5,2019,04,22
129,Great boutique hotel,We loved our stay at the Ampersand Hotel. It's in a fantastic location - very central but at the same time quiet. Beds are extremely comfortable. Staff were fantastic. Drinks and dinner at Apero were also great.,5,2019,04,22

129,Afternoon science tea,"We visited the hotel earlier this month We visited the hotel earlier this month to enjoy their science tea, and we were not disappointed.

 - great location : in front of South Ken tube station
- nice comfortable rooms, with great bathrooms

- rooms are not that big, and storage spaces are small
- we did not test the breakfast (although because the dining room did not inspire us)",5,2019,04,12
129,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed 4 nights and loved the area.  Great restaurants in very close walking distance, subway and busses just feet from  the entrance and the rooms were excellent.  Would definitely recommend and stay again!",5,2019,04,10
129,Great stay great location,"Wonderful hotel with great service. Close to the museums, restaurants, underground etc etc. Rooms very comfortable. Excellent bed (pillows a little too soft) and great shower to wake up. It will certainly be on my list to book again for the next trip.",5,2019,04,10
129,The best around SK: location & style!,"After trying few hotels in the area at the same price levels, this seems to be the best option. Spacious rooms, recently refurbished or kept in great condition and always very clean. The studio option comes with a nice bath tub next to the bedroom right in front of the window. Bathroom is very big compared to the average of similar hotels in London. Free mini bar - seems to be worth the investment from their side since everyone talks about it in the reviews! Nice body care products. Excellent service at any time from the reception and room service. ",5,2019,04,09
129,An excellent hotel in an excellent location,"Friendly staff, attentive service, and comfortable rooms in a fine small hotel. The area has many dining choices and easy access to taxis, the tube and busses. Rooms vary in size; the lowest price rooms can be small.",5,2019,04,09
129,I would be happy to move in!,"The Ampersand is absolutely lovely.  Location is fantastic, the hotel is beautiful, room service is fast and not expensive.  The front desk staff was always helpful.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  In fact, I would gladly move in!

129,Beautiful,"This hotel is beautiful. It looks like the mansion in that new Netflix series, The Umbrella Academy. It has great beds, excellent staff amd HEATED BATHROOM FLOORS.This is the best hotel I ever stayed at and the location is great too.",5,2019,04,06
129,Excellent Location and Service,"The staff were most helpful ,considerate and courteous and gave us excellent service.The Hotel has its own individual style and is attractively furnished..Our bedroom was delightful with a well fitted bathroom.The buffet breakfast has plenty of variety to choose from and is replenished regularly.The Hotel is just so convenient for a stay in London being so close to the tube station.We will return ",5,2019,04,05
129,VERY LOVELY HOTEL IN UNBEATABLE LOCATION,"We have visited and stayed in a  number of London hotels.  The Ampersand is a unique boutique hotel right in the center of Chelsea/Kensington with waling access to top attractions, restaurants, and shopping.  In addition for those interested in accessing the Hop on Hop Off bus, the stop is right outside the hotel front door.  Extremely accommodating and friendly staff and good in house tapas type restaurant that serves traditional breakfast at a very reasonable price, particularly off the ala carte menu.  Very well appointed room and bah with comfortable ""real"" king size bed.  5 star hotel at very competitive rate.  One of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in when visiting London.  
",5,2019,04,05
129,Excellent,"staff excellent , check in gave us options for rooms, location excellent with a lot of options to eat. The tea room has a lot of energy. The bellman was very attentive to us as we were ill and he was always personable.  The size was room was ample and high ceilings on first floor (room 111).  The breakfast options were delicious in the restaurant downstairs.  Highly recommended.",5,2019,04,05
129,One night in London...again,"This hotel couldn‚Äôt be better. Friendly staff, perfect breakfast. The beds are wonderful, you sleep like a child. The location is perfect with the tube station just a minute away. Come here and enjoy!",5,2019,04,05
129,Excellent in all senses,"Always staying for few nights, but always worth as it is the perfect location to move through London. Rooms are stunning, clean and with the most amazing best ever. Staff is lovely and the so never thinking for a best place to book.",5,2019,04,03
129,Ampersand excellence,"Very convenient to South Kensington, expect personal and engaging service.  The staff is great at helping with directions and advice and organizing a trip to the airport for not a terrible amount.  The artistic art installment that goes the length of the open stair well is a beautiful modern centerpiece in contrast with the classic elegance of the hotel.  It felt updated and beautiful and truly a small luxury hotel.",5,2019,04,02
129,Its not a 5 stars hotel!,"When I checked in, as VIP on expedia who arrives to london every 2 months and pay for 5-6 rooms I was very disappointed. They offered me news every day but didn't bring it, I was paying for all the rooms and they were all on the sale class but I got the smallest room.  The interned was down several times. I just decided to leave a day earlier and the only thing I was told is that I will pay for the night. I didn't ask not to pay but its a shame that a 5 start hotel provide this lever of service and put me in the smallest room. I know not all rooms are same size but the room that i staid in , I'm not sure how its even possible to have a lower class room than what I got.  yes, I was told that they will cover 31 for the extras but I think that this should have dealt with differently.",2,2019,04,01
129,Close to the madding crowd,"Ampersand at South Kensington offers a calm place while still being so close to all the transport links, main shops and attractions.  We hadn't realised it's a Small Luxury Hotel of the World when we booked but we soon realised why it is.",5,2019,04,01
129,Fantastic Stay.,"Fantastic stay at an excellent hotel in a great location for many of the main tourist attractions. Wonderful friendly staff throughout our stay complemented excellent rooms, funky common areas and a solid restaurant in the basement. Walking distance to some of the main museums and easy access across London to other main tourist sites from South Ken tube just across the road. We will definitely stay here again when we are back in London. Highly recommended.",5,2019,03,31
129,Small Luxury Hotel - fits the description!,"We had the one night here - it was convenient for our planned evening in Chelsea, so taxi fares were kept sensible.  It's small-ish, but not bijou; it's been a hotel since 1888, and this shows in the layout and architecture, but that doesn't really cause any issues except if you want a stereotypical chain hotel you can find all around the world.
Our room had an enormous high ceiling, and the bed head was proportioned accordingly, but we didn't fell either cramped or lost - for one night it was fine, and it would probably have been OK for more, though like most hotels they seem to think that both of you in a double room will not want to sit in a comfy chair at the same time, one of you has the bed or the chair for the table.
The beds is more than comfortable enough, and the bathroom has the range of luxury you'd expect in a hotel of this class. The plumbing fittings were of good quality (not cheap rubbish) and the enormous shower head delivered copious quantities of softened water.  Yes, softened, this is London, remember, and the water is VERY hard.
There is a lounge serving coffee and cakes etc, which seemed to be more popular with groups of ladies than men, perhaps they were in the basement cellars where the bar is, and where you have breakfast, etc.  This area is, even though it;'s the cellar, well presented and doesn't give any indication of being slightly subterranean unless you watch the outside world's feet passing by at the windows!
The staff are all very helpful and friendly, and, when our requested newspaper didn't materialise, one of them went and bought one and brought it to us at breakfast.  Not many places I can think of where that would happen so personally.  On newspapers, there are several international ones available, gratis, including Le Monde, The Times and the Guardian.  As an English speaker, if you have the Guardian, you need something more at the opposite end of the spectrum, not he Times, but this is just a personal opinion - you'll never please everyone with newspaper choice.
Finally, each room appears to have a smartphone, free to use, including international calls to some countries, and  you can take it out with you around London.  This, I thought, was amazing - but it will cost you 170GBP if you lose or break it!  A lovely touch though, if your own is problematic.
Would I go back?
Yes!",5,2019,03,31
129,Perfect location.,"Second time at this small but beautiful hotel. The staff are professional, friendly and happy to deal with any questions. Although my room was facing the street it was very quiet and sleep was easy in the super comfortable bed.",5,2019,03,31
129,Beautiful hotel - great location,"We were definitely pampered in this hotel. The rooms are nicely furnished with modern fixtures, including a heated bathroom floor, and a ""handy"" cell phone that we could borrow. We actually used the handy phone when we went out for maps and phone calls. The room was quiet with a comfy bed. The room also provided complementary mini-bar beverages and snacks, as well as a tea kettle and coffee press. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but noticed that room service prices were reasonable. We did however have some tea and cake downstairs - a lovely room to relax in. Check-in was fast, as well as luggage service from the bell hop. What we loved most was the location to the South Kensington tube stop. So nice to have a quick stroll home after walking all over London during the day. The hotel is also situated only 5 minutes away from the V&A Museum, as well as many good eateries. The only thing we couldn't figure out were the light switches in the room. You need to insert your room key in a slot inside the room to power up the lights. However at times the lights would not turn on, or they would flicker. Not sure if that was user error, or something else - just one of the quirks of the room. In either case, we definitely have the Ampersand on our list to stay again for our next trip to London.",5,2019,03,31
129,Making a honeymoon really special,"Stayed at the Ampersand as newlyweds on our honeymoon. The team at Ampersand really made our trip special with some great gestures like sending some special treats to our room, champagne at the check-in and a letter from the staff congratulating and wishing us a happy marriage. We stayed in a Deluxe Studio which was spacious, elegantly designed. The bed was really comfortable. ",5,2019,03,29
129,Beautiful hotel in a convenient location,"The Amersand Hotel is brilliant. I stayed for 2 nights whilst on a business trip. Check in was efficient and quick, with concierge taking my bags to my room. I had the standard double room, which had plenty of space for a single traveler. The bathroom was small but well appointed with bath robes/slippers and shower amenities - even an Ampersand Hotel rubber duck!

The hotel is very stylish and has bright, interesting designs. I could see this being perfect for staying as a couple due to the relaxed atmosphere throughout. The entire hotel was extremely clean and the staff are always on hand for any request.

I was in room 119, which is a couple of minutes walk from the first floor elevators. A word of warning - this side of the hotel does overlook a school, so be careful when opening your curtains as you may be somewhat exposed!

I would certainly stay at this hotel again when I'm next working in London. Thank you Ampersand!",5,2019,03,29
129,First trip to London,"This was the perfect hotel for our first trip to London. The location was perfect! We were in walking distance of museums, shopping, and an underground station. The staff was very friendly and helpful - there is someone around 24 hours a day. The room was beautifully decorated and met our every need - we especially liked the heated floors in the bathroom. Every tour guide that we had complimented us on the hotel especially its location. We would definitely stay here again!!!",5,2019,03,28
129,Exellent service in elegant surroundings,"Wonderful hotel with attention to detail, both in design, colors, materials and service. Exellent location in the best part of London.The hotel is very professional, seems very safe, and has at the same time a personal touch in both service and the hotel itself. I have stayes at most of the 4 and 5 star hotels in hte area, and this is certainly the best one. ",5,2019,03,28
129,Excellent Stay !,"This was a first class stay overall and I will definitely stay at the Ampersand in future trips. The riok is very comfortable, well maintained and clean and the front desk and other staff I interacted with were very friendly and client focused.",5,2019,03,27
129,Amazing stay in London,"Me and my husband had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay at this hotel. Location is ideal:
- South Kensington train station is right across the street from this hotel (Piccadilly Line from the airport or any other parts of London service this station), 
- bus stop for regular buses as well as hop on hop off bus tours are right outside the Hotel door. You can purchase the tour tickets from the front desk
- Numerous cafes and restaurants are right across the road from the hotel
- they also offer a service where your luggage can be checked in on your behalf at the airport Incase you need to be out and about before heading to the airport the day of your departure. 

Staff is extremely courteous and helpful. 

Amenities provided during the stay are well thought out such as:
- heated bathroom floors
- personal cell phone is provided with a local phone number and all tourist related apps downloaded that offer numerous discounts on tickets etc. Calls within London and to a few other countries are free
- L‚Äôoccitane toiletries 
- Umbrella for rainy days 
- voltage converter
- free non-alcoholic beverages 
- rooms are sound proof and beds are comfortable.

We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to London.",5,2019,03,25
129,Perfect stay at the Ampersand,"Travelled to London to visit the Dior Exhibition at V&A and stayed at the Ampersand. We had an absolutely marvelous stay. Everything was perfect, service, staff and the hotel in overall. Room was super clean, the free mini bar was filled up in the evening (didn't see that in a lot of 5 Star hotels). I definitely found my place for my future trips to London. ",5,2019,03,25
129,Excellent hotel.,"Just returned from 4 days at The Ampersand Hotel. Great hotel with really friendly and helpful staff. Location near to South Kensington tube station made it super easy for travel.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,24
129,Stylish hotel in a great location and lovely staff,"I was there in a business trip so it was important for me a quite room, spacious with a desk, adn my room fulfilled my expectations. I loved the paper on the wall and teh amenities in the bathroom! 
The only things I missed were bathtube and being in a higher floor, but not essential matters neither of them. I wasn't very happy with the salad i ordered from room service one night but I didn't complaint because the rest of my experience was good.

I would like to remark Lisa assistance during my stay as well as the other italian colleague at reception . All members of the satff were really nice but they had a nice approach and were very helpfull. They definetely enjoy their job and care about their guests. 

 I look forward to my next visit to The Ampersand hotel!",5,2019,03,22
129,Great family stay,Amazing staff and hotel. Could ask for nothing more. Nice location for attractions too. We have stayed a few times now and each time has been really enjoyable. we hope to stay again either as a couple of with our daughter too ,5,2019,03,21
129,Stunning Hotel with superb attention to detail. ,"I stayed here one night recently whilst visiting the V&A museum. Upon arrival we were met by a very helpful stylishly dressed young man. No queuing to check in at all. 3 minutes later we were in our room. The bed was wonderful. So comfortable. Bathroom well appointed with lovely soaps and lotions. The shower was fantastic. A huge horizontal shower head made it feel like a lovely warm rain shower. Complimentary soft drinks, tea, water, coke etc. A really lovely touch was proper fresh milk for the tea/coffee. Room was very quiet too. We both felt it was a real oasis in the melee of the west end. It is also priced very reasonably. Excellent value. 

I will definitely stay there again and highly recommend it. ",5,2019,03,20
129,Value for money ,"We stayed five nights on a trip to London and Paris 
Couldn‚Äôt fault the Ampersand Hotel 

The location is amazing,only meters from South Kensington station , pubs cafes and restaurants.

The room was perfect good size with a king bed and modern with old charm and tall ceilings.

Staff are pleasant helpful and accommodating with requests.

Happy all round will stay again",5,2019,03,19
129,Best choice in Kensington area,"The Ampersand Hotel has been my choice for stay in London for a few years already. Excellent service, top quality - everything you need to make your stay (especially a business one) enjoyable. Will definitely come back!",5,2019,03,14
129,Perfect Choice,"We chose this hotel based on the location and our expectations were exceeded in all ways. Unbelievably comfortable bed, lovely accommodating staff, functional bathroom with nice toiletries, and reasonably priced. We were in a deluxe room with a queen bed and a roll-away bed, which was a little bit tight but definitely workable and worth it to us to not have to get a second room. The staff delivered hot chocolate and cookies to our son the first night, which was a cute surprise. It is right next to the South Kensington tube station and a quick walk to the Victoria & Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, and Harrod's. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,03,12
129,A perfect Londion stay!,"We were very satisfied with the Ampersand. Our room was very quiet, nice furniture, Minibar included. We had an offer 3 nights for 2, the value for money was very good. The location is perfect, 30 m to the subway (3 lines incl. Piccdilly (Heathrow!), 3 m to the bus station, very nice shops and restaurants nearby. We will come back again!",5,2019,03,11
129,The best hotel in South Kensington,"The location is perfect, the staff super friendly. The superior room could be bigger but the bed is very big and confortable. The breakfast is also very good and with many options and the food is very fresh and with good quality
",5,2019,03,11
129,very good,"1st time here, will be back. Very reasonable, excellent service. Room service menu could be a little karger, but what was on was geat. Very good personal, nice Indian rastaurant accross the street. Taxi's always right outside.",5,2019,03,06
129,Excellent as Usual,"Is not the first time we stay at the Ampersand and we are always very happy, the hotel is nice and comfortable and the staff is very kind and helpful. The rooms are sometimes a bit small. The breakfast is excellent. We will return for sure.",5,2019,03,05
129,A bit disappointed this time,"I have been staying at the Ampersand a few times now and am generally very happy with the hotel. This time however I‚Äôm not happy about my room, mainly for 2 reasons: 1/ I can feel the underground train passing by every few minutes which is very disturbing and 2/ because the room is on the ground floor, privacy is not good and I can‚Äôt open the curtains.",3,2019,03,04
129,3 night stay,Excellent experience overall. The internet was slower than what i am used to and became a bit frustrating.Small double room was fine for husband and wife and very clean and comfortable. Room service meals were very quick and the food good.,5,2019,03,04
129,London Stay,"Outstanding & considerate service from the front desk team when I checked in & realised I had made an error and arrived a day earlier than my pre-paid booking....entirely my fault.
They didn't bat an eye and immediately found me a room, (last one available) whilst apologising for not having anything available in my original booking category.
The next day they thoughtfully switched me to an upgraded room to 'compensate' me., which was a very kind & impactful gesture, given I was entirely responsible for the mistake.
Both rooms were immaculate and very comfortable....the superior room being fabulous.
Thank you to all the staff. I will certainly stay again.
",5,2019,03,02
129,Loved this hotel!,"We booked this hotel through our AmEx card which gave us an upgrade (if available, 5x the points and a $100 credit). We were not familiar with London and this hotel‚Äôs location. Wow! What a lovely surprise to see it is just steps from the very convenient South Kensington tube station and a bus stop right outside! When we checked in we were actually given a triple upgrade to a lovely, HUGE room with a big bathroom! We were lucky that we were traveling in the less busy winter season. Fabio and all the other staff were so kind and accommodating. Our room was very quiet as it faced a quiet street at the back of the hotel. The bed was huge and comfy. The bathroom was the star though. The floors were heated and there was a big soaker tub in addition to the big shower. I loved the Occitane bath products and other thoughtful amenities like sewing and vanity kits, a loofah mitt and robes and slippers etc. There was tea and coffee service with a free mini bar with juice, soda and water. We also had use of an unlocked smart phone to use while sightseeing. We used our credit for breakfast one morning and the best dinner we had in London. We loved the hotel‚Äôs cosy restaurant. We will definitely return to this hotel!",5,2019,03,01
129,Gem of a Hotel in South Kensington,"I have stayed at the Ampersand many times for work and it is a lovely, quiet oasis.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are small but well furnished, clean and very comfortable.  The Apero is a sweet little restaurant in the basement of the hotel and every meal I have had there  has been delicious.  I highly recommend.  Only caveat would be as with many London hotels, the rooms are seriously tiny.  I'm not sure how I would navigate one of the guest rooms if I had to share it with my husband.  ",5,2019,02,27
129,"Fantastic, highly recommended","Beautiful hotel, excellent convenient location. They couldn't do enough for us, very welcoming, excellent food and drinks and they allow dogs. What more could you want?! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and will return.",5,2019,02,27
129,Strictly Business ,"I came here on a business trip with my wife and it was the best decision I could have made.  The hotel is in the perfect location and is completely renovated with a modern touch.  The staff is superb and they really go above and beyond to please their guests.   For example, my flight from the states got in at 8am but check in time is not until 2pm.  However, they saw that I was tired and checked me into a room right away AND even upgraded my room for free! They get my vote for all visitors to London! ",5,2019,02,25
129,A must stay for families!,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night for my Birthday and my daughters first trip to London. We chose the hotel as it looked the part and had good reviews. 
My husband emailed and booked the sci-fi afternoon tea. There was a slight misunderstanding with the booking in the drawing room pre arrival but this was quickly sorted out by Raffaele and all was well.
The afternoon tea is spectacular and it‚Äôs so nice to have somewhere to cater for children and make their experience every bit as special as the adults. The food was delicious and the dry ice etc definitely gets the wow factor.
Reception staff were some of the loveliest I‚Äôve experienced in a hotel... again they went the extra mile to ensure my daughter was made to feel special and I think this is so important. Talking to and engaging with them makes all the difference. 
It‚Äôs refreshing to have a luxurious hotel that also accommodates families, you often find you have to sacrifice one for the other.
My husband as per the website suggested asked for a child‚Äôs robe and slippers, when we arrived in the lovely room this was laid out on the bed along with stickers and pencils and a colouring book...my daughter was over the moon. 
The room was just as described, the complimentary snacks and drinks is a big plus! As it was my birthday there was a cupcake on the bed and a Happy Birthday message!
For Dinner we ate in Apero the food was amazing as was the service! The decor and atmosphere is really good. It‚Äôs a hidden gem and not what you expect from a regular hotel restaurant! 
When we arrived back in our room in the evening, there was a dinosaur biscuit and marshmallows with chocolate etc with a message to call room service for warm milk for my daughter! All of these added extras made her first experience in London a magical one. Especially as she enjoyed it in the bath with lovely toiletries rubber duckies all whilst watching Saturday night Tv. 
Thank you so much The Ampersand Hotel! Such a great place to stay and one I would highly recommend! Lovely atmosphere, staff, food The Lot!!! 
I will be telling anyone who will listen about this great hotel! 
",5,2019,02,25
129,Great hotel,"The staff at this hotel were fantastic.  They treated us so well, and spoilt my 4 year old son with lovely treats in the room. I asked for a rollaway bed, room with a bath and queen size bed and we received everything we wanted. The bed was very comfortable, and the deluxe room was very luxurious and clean. The location is perfect, close to the museums and tube station.  Great location for families! thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2019,02,25
129,"Stiff staff, but comfy room","We chose the hotel based on the immediate area it is in. We normally stay on the main road, but this was very close to the tube stop and had a queue of taxis right outside the hotel constantly as a result. The neighborhood was fantastic, but the hotel left a little to be desired. It's definitely cuter in photographs, and they do a great job marketing the property - but once inside I realized it was better in pictures. Not bad, mind you but I wish I knew that the pictures were better than reality. Our room was quiet as requested, and the free minibar was a pleasant surprise but it was a dark, dark small room. I also wish the bathroom had a bathtub, but it had nice heated floors and the fixtures were the best part of the room. The interior of the room was dark, which added to the already bleak London sky. (Though I like cave-like interiors, I think lighter colors in a dark small room would be better.) I felt the staff were a bit hover-y at times, or just absent altogether. Not really in-between. I actually felt uncomfortable walking through the lobby or asking the staff for anything, which I don't normally feel at all wherever I go. Now that I think about it, it was the same kind of feeling I had when I worked at a corporation whose staff feared big corporate layoffs at any minute. ln any case, I did like the location so I may give the hotel another go. Maybe I will try a room in another part of the hotel and the staff might be a little more genuine the next time I'm there...",3,2019,02,24
129,Derek Colborn,"The Ampersand is simply outstanding, the staff and dining were highest quality, location superb, and the bedrooms excellent.
The prices charged were excellent for the area, recommend this as a five star hotel",5,2019,02,24
129,Perfect stay,"I felt warmly welcomed and had a perfect stay. Will come back again. I had room 316 and really liked it. It was on the third floor and very quiet. Perfect for a single traveller or a short trip for two. I enjoyed all the littleextras like free soft drinks fromthe minibar, l'Occitane products and the best coffee I could brew fresh ecery morning in my room.",5,2019,02,24
129,Fabulous Hotel,"The Ampersand is a lovely hotel ideally located for the V& A and other attractions. We received a warm welcome, great customer service is a real feature.

129,Excellent ,"We had a couple of adjoining rooms for our family of 4.  We only stayed one night so didn‚Äôt get to use the facilities or eat here but the staff were very helpful and friendly and the rooms immaculate and very comfortable.  We had mentioned it was a birthday treat and they had even left a cake in the room to welcome us- such a lovely touch. 

The location was perfect for us as we were going to see something at the Royal Albert Hall and it‚Äôs easy walking distance.  The tube is also really close. We would definitely come back again. ",5,2019,02,21

129,We‚Äôll be back!,"We were particularly pleased with the location. The tube station was right across the road so could access all areas of central London within minutes. Some really nice, stylish  coffee shops and restaurants beside the hotel. 
We stayed in a studio suite with our son and it was ideal. It‚Äôs hard to get a good quality room with an extra bed without paying crazy prices but this was very good value. We will most definitely be returning in the future! ",5,2019,02,16

129,A New Favorite in London,"My second solo trip to the city, I stayed with the Ampersand for two nights, but it really only took me twenty minutes past check-in to think I might have a new favorite lodging in London üòä

LOCATION ‚Äì the Ampersand is terribly easy to find, in a beautiful building on a beautiful street (as is the London way).  To/From Heathrow it‚Äôs a ~35 underground ride on the Picadilly line (straight through, no changes‚Äîjust have a seat, read your guidebook, and look up a half hour later to find yourself in London).  The South Kensington underground station is literally 60 yards down the block from the hotel‚Äîthere‚Äôs no possible way to miss it.  Several great museums are <10 min walk (like the V&A, check it out!) and the rest of London is only a tube-ride away.  With three key underground lines at the S.K. stop, there was only one place on my itinerary that took a transfer for me to get to.  Walking to/from alone at night I never felt unsafe.

SERVICE / STAFF ‚Äì Everyone I met was kind, eager to help, and knowledgeable about the hotel, the area, and being a tourist in London.  I had a curious situation where I booked my room only the night before I arrived through a discount app that focuses on last-minute bookings; in the past, I‚Äôve had situations where the hotel treated me commiserate to the discount rate I paid, rather than on par with the service they‚Äôd otherwise provide, but that was absolutely note the case at the Ampersand.  I was treated with absolute kindness and respect from the moment I stepped on-property (and a gentleman helped me with my bags).  I showed up five hours before check-in time thinking I‚Äôd store my bags and take off into the city‚Äîstill smelling like and airplane and looking like a sorta-slept 30,000 ft. over the Atlantic‚Äîbut the woman at check-in wouldn‚Äôt hear of it, she shuffled around to find me an immediately-available room and even upgraded me (upgraded!) to ‚Äúmake my stay a little bit better.‚Äù üòä  Remember the part where I thought I‚Äôd be treated like I paid the discount fare I did? Yeah, at this point, me either üòä  Check out was a similarly smooth process, with a later standard check-out time at noon, which I appreciated (like check-in, also flexible with advance notice). I am confident if I had had any issues during my stay they would have been efficiently taken care of.

ROOM -- I was escorted to my room and shown all the functionalities (it‚Äôs a pseudo-smart space). I was also greeted with a fully complimentary non-alcoholic minibar (those water were clutch) and a fully-free cell phone for using around the city (internet, calls, GPS, the works‚Ä¶).  Even a universal adapter was provided.  My king room was small-ish by American standards but quite spacious for Europe (and in a building that undoubtedly older than my home country, space-for-history is a welcome tradeoff).  There was a lovely closet with a working safe, a full desk and several small table spaces.  The bed was comfortable and the pillows were memorably-soft.  The bathroom had little in the way of counter space, and no outlets (standard in my Europe experiences) but the shower was quite large.  The provided toiletries were of good quality.  There were a few sounds (like the A/C clicking on, creaking floorboards, or moving pipes) that took some getting used to, but nothing was intolerable and again, old buildings and all that.  I do believe there‚Äôs some amount of above-average soundproofing in the interior walls, the only discernable noise from other guests seeped through the door a bit.

BUILDING ‚Äì The building has quite a bit of accessibility in terms of languages (several signs were in multiple languages) and icons, though I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call it physically-accessible.  Being in the older building it is, I only saw a stair-entrance and elevators/lifts that were quite small.   I would suggest calling to inquire about accessibility if it‚Äôs an issue for you.  I did use the laundry service offered, leaving it in my room in the morning and finding it cleaned and pressed when I returned that night.

I‚Äôm happy to recommend the Ampersand for any London travelers and particularly to my fellow solo female travelers.",5,2019,02,08
129,Great boutique hotel in a convenient location,"I stayed here for a couple of nights on business. The service was professional, the room was smart and clean and the breakfast was perfect for my tastes. It is close to the parks which was great for me as someone who likes to get out for a jog.",5,2019,02,07
129,"Great location, beautiful hotel","We had a fabulous stay here and highly recommend it to couples looking for a weekend away. The decor is delightful and the drawing room another little oasis. The dining room 'Apero' could widen their range a little to offer vegan options, but all in all the food is tasty.",4,2019,02,05
129,TRULY AMAZING,Really wasn‚Äôt expecting this hotel to be So Amazing!!! There was literally nothing I could fault as everything exceeded my expectations in every way possible!!! The location is fantastic immediately opposite the south kennsington tube station and this is such a wonderful part of town. I will be staying here regularly in future as it‚Äôs perfect!,5,2019,02,02
129,Brilliant,"The Ampersand never stops to impress me. From the moment I step foot in my ""second home"" in London until the moment I leave, I have a happy smile on my face. And that is saying a lot coming from me who always complaints. Thank you!",5,2019,01,29
129,Family weekend,Chose the Ampersand Hotel for its proximity to Royal Albert Hall and so glad we did - perfect for a family hotel stay.  Staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms clean and cosy.  Nice to have complimentary soft drinks in the rooms!,5,2019,01,28
129,pAmpersand!,"staying at the Ampersand is a real treat - the hotel features beautiful rooms, restaurants and very friendly staff. would absolutely stay here again and recommend it for couples who like to stay in a hotel with personality. the decor is elegant, colourful and upbeat. location is perfect, just a few steps away from the tube, great restaurant and museums. our room came with a spacious bathroom with a bathtub, but with very little spacecto store our clothes during our stay - might not be an issue for a night or two, but can affect the overall comfort during a longer stay. altogether great value for money with lovely details such as complimentary newspaper delivered to the room daily and a very generous selection of toiletries. thank you Ampersand Team for making our stay perfect!",5,2019,01,28
129,Weekend Away,So glad I stumbled across this little boutique hotel. Its in a fantastic location and very convenient for restaurants and shopping. The hotel was decorated to a high standard and the bedrooms had everything and more. Check-in was ease free and a delight to be taken up and shown how to use the amenities in the room. I would highly recommend.    ,5,2019,01,25
129,A pure delight,"A boutique hotel with the charm of yesteryear and a twist of ultra cool modernity. Such a great hotel experience. From the helpful reception desk, amazing rooms with all the mod cons you can think of, plus some (great hairdryer, smartphone and espresso). Comfy /cosy beds. Quiet rooms, with bath and shower. Plus the Apero restaurant - fantastic breakfast. Fitted out gym. Morning newspapers. Central South Kensington location next to Tube station. Close to the V&A and Science Museum. And you must visit the Drawing Room for the Science high tea. I could go on. The Ampersand team have made my London stay such a delight. Im like a kid in a candy store. ",5,2019,01,25
129,Excellent as Always,"smallish rooms, but thoughtfulness and niceness of staff and terrific location more than make up for that. Extremely comfortable bed, very good systems throughout. The ability to take room service post-theatre at the bar downstairs when the rest of South Ken is shut is a surprise bonus (and the pasta was excellent).",5,2019,01,19
129,Fantastic Location,"Lovely hotel - would highly recommend!  The location is excellent, staff are very accommodating and the suite had everything you needed.  The bath amenities were perfection.  Loved the soft drinks in the included mini bar. -",5,2019,01,18
129,Excellent all around,"Very high quality - very comfortable room, modern bathroom with nice products, excellent location right by South Ken tube, and friendly efficient staff. The hotel feels fresh and not faded like so many other hotels do. I didn‚Äôt have breakfast so cannot comment on this but the hotel is 5min from a numerous great spots for meals. ",5,2019,01,15
129,Wonderful as always,"We cannot recommend the Ampersand highly enough in every possible respect. Room, dining and most of all the staff always make it an experience that is memorable, relaxing and extremely enjoyable. We would simply not consider staying anywhere else in London and it up there with the very best city hotels we regularly visit in Europe and Asia.",5,2019,01,15
129,PERFECT SERVICE QUALITY!,"I come to London regulary and I greatly appreciate The Ampersand Hotel for the kindness of the staff, the quality of bedding, iand an excellent value for money. After trying several places it's reallythe one I prefer.",4,2019,01,14
129,Excellent hotel in amazing location,I have stayed at the Ampersand a few times and it never disappoints.  Service and quality are both fantastic and the location is AAA with the train station being so close and lots of good restaurants and cafes close by.  Makes London even more enjoyable!,5,2019,01,13
129,Great small hotel in London,"We stayed at the Ampersand for four days January 2-4. The Ampersand is great small hotel, close to museums and great dining. The hotel staff takes care of everything. Our room was clean and freshly stocked with refreshments every day.  The hotel bar is a great place for a quiet late drink. We will definitely stay again.",5,2019,01,13
129,The Ampersand Hotel,"Excellent all around.  Highly recommend.  Great location, great service.  Beautiful property with very comfortable rooms.  Toiletries are from a good brand, L‚ÄôOccitane.  Had a delicious box of chocolates waiting in my room when I checked in.  ",5,2019,01,12
129,Another wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel,"I stayed from the 30th December to the 6th January and this was the 3rd time in just under 2 years. I stayed in a deluxe room which was very well appointed. Bathroom is spacious and good storage in the room. House keeping was exceptional each day. I ordered twice from room service which was delivered quickly. All staff greeted me warmly and both airport transfers were waiting for me. A 30 second walk to South Kensington station which services the District/Circle and Piccadilly lines. Many cafes, restaurants and museums in walking distance. Will be staying there again at the end of January for 2 nights. I recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2019,01,11
129,Sublime.,"What to say?

This little find is just exquisite. The service is amazing, engaging helpers everywhere! Nothing is too much trouble for anyone, the staff are warm friendly and so hospitable.

The hotel itself is immaculate, the Christmas decorations were homey and comforting. My daughter said instantly ‚Äúmum, I bet you love this!‚Äù And I certainly did. The drawing rooms for afternoon tea are quirky and fun, the food looking wonderful.

The rooms are so cosy, heated bathroom floors, beautiful products and little helpers such as sewing kits, shoe shine, nothing seems too much trouble.

We had room service because it has rained all day and we were soaked... restaurant quality.

Oh and my favourite touch, umbrellas for guest use that are large and elegant on the outside and inside are puppies and kittens. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raining cats and dogs!‚Äù  Brilliant 

Bravo people, see you soon. üíïüíïüíï",5,2019,01,10
129,Excellent  Hotel,We have stayed at the Ampersand hotel before. The surrounding area has everything you need in walking distance and its close to the underground. We enjoyed the room and hotel so much we already planning going back next year. ,5,2019,01,08
129,Lovely two stays,Both stays of 4 nights were excellent other than the room allocated for the first stay had a cramped bathroom configuration which was more than compensated by the 2nd stay room which was very good. Staff are great - very friendly and always willing to help no matter what - nice to experience.  ,5,2019,01,07
129,New Years stay,"We had a wonderful stay over New Years. The staff was beyond amazing, helpful in every way and far surpassed my expectations. The hotel room was perfect for the two of us. Breakfast in Apero was the perfect way to start our day and tea in the drawing room was a nice peaceful retreat after running around the city all day and the decor was charming. Highly recommend! ",5,2019,01,03
129,Excellent location and beautiful hotel but small rooms,"Beautiful boutique hotel with excellent service from staff. Always a smile and greeting from everyone. Brilliant location within minutes walk to tube station and to the museums (Natural History, Science, V&A). Breakfast a tad expensive but very good quality for continental buffet. Didn't get to use the Games Room or Library this time due to group bookings/private events (Christmas and New Year period) but I remember them being very comfortable during a previous stay. Very comfortable beds. Small but well laid out bathroom. 

One child could stay with an extra bed free of charge, although be forewarned that this makes the space incredibly tight as the rooms are already small even without an extra bed. We could only have 1 suitcase on the floor to open up (and in a very awkward spot half under the desk), with the other 2 suitcases stashed in the wardrobe, and that only worked because I already planned to only open up one suitcase during our stay (with other suitcases for other parts of our travel). However, my child did love the complimentary snack platter of dinosaur biscuit, astronaut hot chocolate and mini marshmallows (from their very popular Science Afternoon Tea). Wonderful gesture from the hotel for young guests. Also provided child's bathrobe and slippers. I asked for a room with bathtub and my child enjoyed playing with the hotel rubber duckie at bath time (a nice souvenir of our stay too).   

I was actually in a more spacious room when staying as a single occupant previously (in same room category) so it might be luck of the draw depending on which room type you get. All rooms are slightly different in a character building like this, so there's not much that could be done. For that kind of price point, I would expect greater comfort during my stay, so consider whether you want to put up with squeezing around the furniture, or perhaps it doesn't matter if you would be out sightseeing most of the time. 

In summary, I would stay here again in a heartbeat if travelling as one or two persons, but will look elsewhere for triple/family accommodation.",4,2019,01,02
129,Beautiful stay,"My daughter and I stayed 3 nights in the Ampersand and loved every minute of it. Our room was small but perfectly formed, and had an air of luxury and style. The bathroom was a tad on the dark side but excellent in every other way. Breakfast was good and the restaurant/bar and high tea room/ salon were both beautiful. To top it off, staff were very helpful and always greeted us with a smile and a quick chat. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2019,01,01
129,Great stay in South Ken,"Customer service at its best! From the friendly front desk to very helpful bellhop and a smart phone that you can take with you exploring London! They have great amenities too with two restaurants, room service, library and play room. Great location to Museums and underground. ",5,2018,12,28
129,Very happy with our stay,"We spent five nights here. From beginning to end it was a very good experience. Got a room before regular check in time, were helped with a small emergency on Christmas day. Our room was very well appointed,  comfortable and quiet. Excellent location,  can only recommend.",5,2018,12,27
129,Love this hotel!,"My 1st choice for accommodation in London. I feel right at home from the moment I step inside. The interior design is fabulous, the service excellent and the location perfect for a solo traveler requiring easy access ro public transport and amenities within walking distance.",5,2018,12,25
129,Our stay at the Ampersand,My son and I really enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand. It felt like home to us during our visit and the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. I highly recommend. The location is great and within walking distance of so many restaurants and shopping such as Harrods. I hope we can stay there again.,5,2018,12,21
129,Gorgeous hotel...will stay again,Beautiful hotel...gorgeous room...clean and warm...efficient staff...unfaultable. Great atmosphere in bar in the cellar. Perfect location on doorstep of museums and good restaurants. Will stay again and definitely recommend. 10/10 ,5,2018,12,14
129,"Great Hotel, Great Location","I spent 6 nights in a Deluxe Studio. This hotel was a great choice, the accommodations are very nice and the location is a great jumping off point to see London. The South Kensington Underground stop is across the street. The hotel had nice touches like free drinks in the mini fridge in the room, and daily newspaper deliveries.  The breakfast in the hotel restaurant was really good. I also enjoyed their science themed afternoon tea.  The surrounding neighborhood has lots of restaurants and several museums.",5,2018,12,09
129,Great small luxury hotel,Centrally located. Super staff. They give you a handy phone for your stay. Not uptight like some of the bigger hotels. Fun bar and restaurant. Everything is electronic. WiFi reception was good. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!,5,2018,12,09
129,Fabulous boutique hotel in South Kensington ,"The Ampersand Hotel is a wonderful place from which to explore London. Less than a block from the S Kensington tube stop, its prime location was perfect for easy tube use. The rooms are of generous size for London with all the usual amenities for a hotel of this level. The service was terrific with staff ready to help with luggage, information, and arrangements for car service, etc. We were initially assigned a room on the first floor without much view or light, and with a polite request, we were moved to a gorgeous room with both. On my recent return, the staff acknowledged my recent stay and assigned another great room with plenty of light and a view. The restaurant in the hotel is also wonderful, plus there are many excellent options in the immediate neighborhood as well. Top notch hotel‚Äîcertainly my go-to hotel now for London! ",5,2018,12,08
129,"Super location , good value","Very friendly and efficient service , fast check in and check out. Good location for south/ central . Room very comfortable and well upholstered. Only minor issue was some freaking floor boards from floor above ",4,2018,12,07

129,Worth every penny,"Amazing hotel stay. Check-in staff were friendly and accommodating. The room was beautifully decorated, with l'occitane bath products, bath robe, and slippers. The shower was the best I have ever experienced in a hotel, and bathroom had heated floors - a very nice touch in cold weather! Location was excellent, within steps of the tube, and near major shopping and attractions. Would recommend highly!",5,2018,12,06
129,family trip,It's always good to arrive at the Ampersand hotel where we are recognized immediately. We've received the room we have requested during our reservation back in August. The deluxe room is spacious and the bed is of an excellent quality. Lesser point of critisim was that refill of the fridge was not performed automaticaly the first day. The location near to the south Kensington subway station is a positive argument for those who like to travel with public transport.We will be back,5,2018,12,04
129,almost a reason to come to london ;-),"We choose the Ampersand Hotel on each occasion we are in London since the location is super. For business, entertainment great connection to all parts of town.The staff is very friendly and efficient.",5,2018,12,04
129,"After many stays, Ampersand is still tops","Have been staying here for several years now, I find the location unbeatable. I especially like South Kensington and proximity to the tube. Price is comparable to, or a little lower than other fine London hotels. This is a boutique with not a lot of rooms. At check in, was surprised by the overpowering room fragrance, the odor was due to cleaning. Had not encountered this before, we are especially sensitive and the staff promptly addressed the issue. They carefully checked our room before our second stay of this trip. We did check in early, so the room may not have had time air out. 

Bathrooms are quaint, well equipped and beds very comfortable, we like firm. Paper delivered in the AM, deluxe room was spacious, especially for downtown London. Staff is friendly and helpful, recommend and will stay again.",5,2018,11,30
129,Convenient but better hotels close by,"This is a 'nice' hotel very well situated but lacks the extra care and attention that you would expect with a 5 star boutique hotel. For instance I arrived at check out a man walked into reception and disappeared into the office without any acknowledgement-nobody else in sight. Someone arrives, no help offered, the little things -'have a nice day' were missing-they were functional and robotic and nobody outside to hail a cab. As I said little things, but that's what makes a difference.",3,2018,11,28
129,Fantastic stay in a great location,Very good staff - extremely efficient and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The hotel is just what we want and we stay every time we visit London. The location is perfect and most things are within walking distance which is great with a toddler in a pushchair but opposite the hotel is the tube station. Our daughter turned 2 during our stay and the staff went out the way to spoil her with chocolate and a small gift.,5,2018,11,26
129,Great Stay,"Very good venue, location. All of the staff were great. Rooms albeit a little small for a Superior room were well equipped and very comfortable. Overall very pleased and literally 100 yards from South Kensington Tube station",4,2018,11,26

129,London break,"Having stayed at The Ampersand previously I had no hesitation in returning, and once again I was not disappointed, it is an excellent hotel, it is very clean and tidy with friendly staff who cannot do enough to assist in any way.  The rooms have all the facilities you would need, the complimentary drinks in the fridge are a added bonus after a long day in London and the L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries are a nice luxury.  I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2018,11,24
129,Family run hotel in West London,Absolutely charming. unusual to find such personal service in a central London hotel. They couldn't be more helpful. Food was extremely good in their buzzy bistro style restaurant. Breakfast was excellent,5,2018,11,22
129,Wonderful stay,"I would absolutely recommend The Ampersand, everyone was helpful and friendly and it is really pretty. We loved our Suite with the little balcony. It is perfectly situated next to South Kensington Station.",5,2018,11,21
129,A London Favorite,"We absolutely love staying at this hotel for our annual trade show trip in London. The Tube is only minutes away with virtually everything you could ask for within a few minute walk. The staff is exceptional, the rooms are spacious and very clean. The beds are quite comfortable and overall, the hotel is quiet for such a central location. I especially enjoy the rooms with the beautiful bathtub near the windows. ",5,2018,11,21
129,Great location - nice renovation,"The room was large and quiet - even though it was on the first floor.  Staff is genuinely gracious and helpful.  Location is superb - right next to South Kensington tube stop, short walk to Harrod's, steps from Victoria and Albert Museum.  Great shopping and dining close by - 10 minute walk to Chelsea.",5,2018,11,20
129,Excellent location and good atmosphere,Very friendly hotel. Hotel room is fairly large. Bed is excellent. bathroom a little bit small. Excellent breakfast even though breakfast staff is a little bit slow to take orders. Reception staff is quite helpful and excellent. ,5,2018,11,19

129,Excellent hotel near museums,"This excellently remodeled hotel is perfectly located for visits to the V&A, the Science Museum, etc. and two minutes from the South Kensington tube station. We appreciated our quiet (if small) room and large comfortable bed. Amenities like the use of a cell phone that worked for calls in and beyond London, and complimentary drinks from the frig enhanced our stay. However it was a bit difficult to get into the bathtub. Some rooms may have more accessible tubs.",5,2018,11,18
129,"Excellent hotel with great access to tube, hop-on hop-off bus, V&A museum, Kensington Palace and Hyde Park","We were fully satisfied with our stay at Ampersand!

129,Charming boutique hotel with excellent service!,We loved our stay at the Ampersand Hotel. From the moment we arrived the staff went out of their way to make our every need was met. The hotel was in a great location in South Kensington and very close to the tube. We loved the room and bathroom and will look to stay there again next time we are in London.,5,2018,11,15
129,Great stay - perfect location to explore London,"We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for a long weekend and it proofed to the perfect home away from home. Our room (Studio Deluxe) was perfectly sized, the bathroom, albeit smallish, offered all we could ask for and the staff was very attentive. 

We were not entirely happy with the breakfast but there is so much choice around South Kensington Station of towards Kings Road so no complaining about this.

The location is spot on. 2 minutes to the tube station, 15 minutes to Hyde Park and around the same time to Kings Road/ Sloane Square. As we had tickets for the Last Night of the Proms, it was an absolute treat to be able to walk there and back,

Thanks for a wonderful stay - we will be back soon.",5,2018,11,14
129,Undoubtedly the smallest hotel room imaginable ,I booked the room using the Hotel Tonight app/service for the first time. It will be the first and last time using this service. They clearly agree very low rates with hotels but with the proviso that they will take up the lowest category of rooms. In this instance the smallest single room imaginable and yet it is still ¬£220 without breakfast. The hotel itself is in a great location but only average for the pricing levels. I believe Hotel Tonight customers are differentiated in a negative way because they are generally taking up the lowest priced rooms. I am having dinner in the hotel restaurant tonight and can only hope it is exceptional to make up for the poor experience so far. Unfortunately I am struggling to find a positive when writing this review.,1,2018,11,14
129,Great Stay,Room was spacious and spotless.  Housekeeping did and extremely thorough clean every day.Bath was lovely and room service was super fast and delicious.All the staff very friendly and helpful.Would definitely stay again.  Much preferred it over Kensington around the corner on Queen's Gate where I stayed in October.,5,2018,11,13
129,One night in London,"Very nice hotel with a perfect location. Breakfast very good. Close to Harrods, museums and underground, South Kensington. The room was small, but it doesn't matter since the bed was very good and the room on the 5th floor was quiet.",5,2018,11,13
129,"Ampersand Hotel, great location, great staff but disappointed by Suite standards and catering staff","The location is fantastic, the reception and concierge staff are excellent! The Suite lacked of some amenities for the rate. The carpet was too old or not clean enough, worth changing the carpet or have wooden floor. The drawing room staff was not up to standard. ",3,2018,11,12
129,A Great find!,"We stayed one night at this gorgeous luxury boutique hotel & loved it so much were going back for another few nights. 

Decor is superb, rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. Staff are very helpful and location is awesome. Close to shops, great restaurants, parks and other must visit locations. 

Treat yourself to a stay at this lovely hotel and whilst in town pastries (Portuguese tarts) at ‚ÄúCafe de Nata‚Äù just down the road is a must do, we went back for a ‚Äútasting‚Äù batch the next morning - yum!!!
",5,2018,11,11
129,Good but ...,"Great location, restaurant service average but staff overall great.  Expensive and better value options I have stayed in with better on site restaurant service in Mayfair.  Room was extremely small and thought a mistake for 2 people - got in late so maybe last room but had booked 2 months before (and paid).",3,2018,11,08
129,Overnighter,This was a perfect overnight stay for us on a longer trip. The staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. The room was clean and very comfortable. Breakfast provided the perfect start to the day. We love the location a short walk from some favorite spots and easy access to the tube.,5,2018,11,08

129,Ampersand,Good location -clean -great room  Big shower  Excellent bed -quiet room. Good gym. breakfast ample but if you wanted more -it was available at a cost. Contnental was in my rate. Very near tube station shops restaurants.,5,2018,11,05
129,Great location,"This location is great for connecting to or from Heathrow, it‚Äôs on the same Tube line, and steps from the station. The area is busy, near museums, restaurants, Kensington Palace, and a brief walk to Harrods. The 14bus just outside the hotel‚Äôs entrance, goes to the other big areas and useful at night. The hotel is nice, compact, but a top floor suite had all the required amenities. The rooms have some technological features that require some analysis to get right. Calls made from the cell phone provided with the room were supposedly free, but it repeatedly dropped them mid-call so we gave up. The Science Tea, and Apero Restaurants were good, even if you are not staying at the hotel.",5,2018,11,04
129,Solid Hotel well located for the museums of West London,"The Staff are very efficient and friendly (although I had an issue with one at breakfast). The rooms are comfortable with a huge, luxurious bed, but this does mean that there is not much space  to move around. An example - to work at the desk I needed to sit on the end of the bed.The food is really good and I liked the breakfast buffet, which is served in a modern, industrial-chic, restaurant in the basement.

129,Best Hotel Stay ever !,"The staff genuinely cared about your comfort and the service was excellent.No request was too small or too big to accommodate .A true luxury hotelThe hotel is clean and the location is very central, less than a minute to the tube station.",5,2018,10,31

It has a great location, amazing atmosphere and every time you visit you get the same great quality service.The rooms are great and the food is delicious.Whenever I'm in London for business or pleasure I always stay at the Ampersand.",5,2018,10,31
129,My favorite hotel  in London!,October Visit for the Philadelphia Eagles game! I have stayed at places all over the world and this was by far the best service I have ever experienced. All of the staff went out of there way to make the experience one of a kind.  Tracy was wonderful!  The room was beautiful and very large.  We had a tub in the room which was a nice touch.  Can‚Äôt wait to go back again! ,5,2018,10,30
129,AMAZING,"We stayed for a week on our honeymoon and everything was perfect.  The beds are super comfortable, our room was spacious and beautiful, the hotel is in an exceptional location, and the staff is WONDERFUL.  Bee was our favorite and super helpful every day, she helped with concierge services, including getting us tickets to a last minute show!  We enjoyed Science themed tea at the Drawing Room and dinner at Apero as well, both amazing.  Will definitely stay here again upon return to London.",5,2018,10,30
129,Excellent hotel,We stayed with our 5 year old daughter and it is an excellent family hotel. Great location right next to the tube station with excellent cafes nearby. Staff are very friendly and helpful throughout our stay,5,2018,10,29
129,"Comfiest bed, great location","Brilliant stay here for my birthday, honestly the comfiest bed and nicest location in London. Breakfast was lovely, much more intimate than a large hotel, the room included snacks, water and juices which was a great unexpected bonus to have, ",5,2018,10,29
129,A gem in S Kensington,"S Kensington is a great base from which to explore London with excellent transport links and  lots of great sites on your doorstep.  The Ampersand complements this setting perfectly. The welcome is warm and friendly.  A 2 pm check in is really helpful.  Rooms are well equipped, with fresh milk and complimentary soft drinks in a fridge a v welcome touch.    Ditto luxury L‚ÄôOccitaine toiletries.  

We had adjoining rooms which suited our needs perfectly.  Both were v well equipped with generous proportions, light and airy.  We didn‚Äôt dine in the hotel but would have been happy to based on the utterly delicious breakfast with an abundance of fresh produce.  Guests booking via Small Luxury Hotels currently get a complimentary glass of champagne.  Good luggage storage facilities.  All in all a great pied a terre  if you want a boutique hotel for a reasonable price in this part of town.  ",5,2018,10,28
129,wonderful experience at the Ampersand,"We stayed 10 nights and every night we were treated like it was our first! great staff, very clean, wonderful beds! couldn't have asked for better. The restaurant was first class food awesome! We will refer this hotel to all of our friends.",5,2018,10,27
129,Very nice,Very nice hotel. Location is perfect and the staff wonderfull. Good idea for either a business trip or holidays trip.The hotel is calm and relax for a five star accommodation.I recommended you to  go there ,5,2018,10,26
129,"5 stars: beautiful hotel, great location, VERY responsive, helpful staff when problem developed","So glad we picked this hotel for our recent visit to London.  In every way, it was outstanding.  Every staff member was very friendly and responsive.  We had a small problem with one of the two rooms we were booked into.  Staff INSTANTLY agreed on problem and moved us to another room.   
Wish other hotel staff were as responsive, responsible and friendly as those here.

Hotel is in an incredible location.  2 minute walk to the Tube, within 5 minutes there are more than 20 restaurants, many of them excellent, from budget to splurge. 10 minute walk to museums, 15 minute walk to Hyde Park.

This is not ""at the top"" of hotels in terms of price.  But it is not a budget hotel.  I felt that it was worth every $/lpound that we spent here.

But there are other well located hotels.  This one stands out because of the terrific staff, as well as the very nice rooms.",5,2018,10,25
129,always a win!,"why go elsewhere??? this hotel has the best location!! right next to museums, parks, a tube station with 2 main lines, and so many places to eat!!! there is a really good gelato place called Vechi close by, go and try it out. its the closest thing to gelato in italy without going to Italy! there are many coffee shops, and night time restaurants to choose from and a lot of them are really great. the staff is always very helpful and genuine. the hotel decor is very beautiful. you can tell that the staff takes pride in their hotel, because every time we visit everything is still in top shape. no need to spend a lot of  money for a luxury London experience. i had continuous communication with the staff before our stay to make sure our needs were met and they delivered. ",5,2018,10,23
129,5 Star treatment,The staff was wonderful during our visit. We stayed 8 nights for our 27th wedding anniversary and stayed in a beautiful room with a King Size bed that was super comfortable. The front desk helped book any excursions that we requested and recommended A class restaurants in the neighborhood after long days of sight seeiing. Everyone was very positive-from the doorman to the restaurant workers. We were greeted warmly each day and asked if we needed anything. The front desk even arranged a car to take us to the airport when we left. This is truly a world class boutique hotel!,5,2018,10,23
129,"Nice hotel, similar to other 4* boutique hotels","nice hotel, good location, a little overpriced and more comparable to other boutique hotels. original room had a leak in toilet and smelt damp, however after we raised this we were moved immediately and 2nd room was nice.",4,2018,10,22
129,Can't fault this hotel!,"Absolutely loved your hotel - the decor was just stunning throughout - felt you'd got the right balance between feeling luxurious without being too stuffy. Staff all really helpful and we really appreciated the birthday chocolates and champagne for my husband! Having seen the food on offer in your restaurant I rather regretted we had booked elsewhere, but your breakfast was fantastic - really interesting food so I can only assume other meals were as interesting. Will definitely return and recommend you - couldn't think of a nicer place to stay - specially in such a great location. Thank you all! ",5,2018,10,22
129,Amazing Hotel,"Everything was 5 Star with the hotel but with a personal feel unlike bigger chains.  Decor, amenities, cleanliness, location and friendliness will have me recommending to anyone visiting London. I hope to be back !",5,2018,10,21
129,Small rooms are really tiny!,"Three stars purely for the location alone.  The hotel is right beside South Kensington station and a short walk to the museums. 

In our opinion, the room itself and the bathroom were too small to be comfortable. I was expecting a small space: I was notified that the room would be small upon booking but I liked the look of the hotel and really wanted to try it.  My own fault then but the room we were given was exceptionally small, horribly dark and almost claustrophic. I‚Äôm returning to London next month and will not be considering this hotel as I was so disappointed last time.

The common areas of the hotel were lovely and the location was fabulous so, by all means, stay here to enjoy the ambience, but choose a bigger room to ensure you make the most of your stay.",3,2018,10,21
129,Suites are great for families ,We had a fabulous time at the hotel and stayed for a week.  We stayed in a 2 room suite and it was great for a family as everyone had enough space.  We felt very welcomed and the staff was top notch.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London.  Science Tea is darling.,5,2018,10,21
129,Fantastic small hotel,"A lovely comfortable and stylish hotel in a great location for the museums of London and the Albert Hall. Also conveniently situated for a good range of bars, cafes and restaurants in a village like environment.",5,2018,10,20
129,lovely small hotel,"We will come back when in London-- really enjoyed the size and atmosphere. The location is great for the subway, walks in the nearby Park and for shopping and eating. Loved the drawing room for tea and for champagne. ",4,2018,10,19
129,Value for money accomodation,"Lovely hotel in a great location and yet, quiet when you return after a long day of sight seeing/shopping.  There are some lovely cafes and dining places near the hotel too.  Shopping is only a short walk away; as are museums.",5,2018,10,19
129,Will stay again,"The staff was wonderful. Everyone was so welcoming and helpful. The room was small, but the bed was very comfortable. I had a great sleep. Perfect location. I had a really short stay, but I will definitely come here again.",5,2018,10,19
129,London Gem,"A lovely hotel brilliantly located in Sth Ken. Brilliant facilities, delightful staff and comfortable beds. Loved the under floor heating in the bathroom. It is is nice safe oasis to come home to. I would recommend it.",5,2018,10,19
129,COMFORT AND SUPERIOR SERVICE,"The room was small but well arranged.  The large bathroom was excellent.  We were very comfortable. Temperature control was very effective, and the amenities provided were very useful.   for phones and charging capability provided very useful.  Overall, the attention provided to our needs by the staff throughout the hotel was extremely proficient. All our needs were met.staff was really top notch.  ",4,2018,10,18
129,Ampersand in London,"We stayed at the Ampersand for our recent trip to London.  We chose the hotel for the location near the South Kensington tube station.  We really liked our room, especially the very comfortable bed.  The room also came with a smart phone for local use, which was very handy.  The location is very convenient, museums, the park, nice neighborhoods for walking and lots of restaurants around.We definitely will stay here again next time we come to London.",5,2018,10,18
129,Science afternoon tea,If you are on the look for quirky afternoon teas you definitely should visit the drawing room at the ampersand hotel! One of the best afternoon teas I‚Äôve had .. each thing on the science themed menu was so much fun and delicious to eat .. highly recommend,5,2018,10,17
129,Holiday week,"Nice hotel, excellent staff although rooms are on the small size! Overall good stay and great location. Liked the mini bar and the selection of drinks. Decor both in reception and hotel rooms was modern and up to date. ",4,2018,10,16
129,"Luxurious, amazing service!","We stayed Oct 6 - Oct 12 at The Ampersand and had a magnificent time! The location to the tube station is perfect and there are so many restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The hotel is immaculate and beautifully decorated. There's a game room, business center, gym, restaurant, lobby, drawing room (for tea). The staff in each of these places were fabulous.Their restaurant is  terrific as well - the food is beautiful, fresh, and delicious. We loved the cocktails as well (Tigger Time, Scouts Honor, Huck Finn).The rooms are beautiful and so beautifully decorated. Our suite was ""botany"" and they had cool botany books, decor, etc. The bathroom was luxurious with heated mirrors and heated floors! The shower had a tv in it (although we didn't use it). The room had a lot of nice details that made the stay so comfortable. There was an electronic panel by the door, you press ""Do Not Disturb"" or ""Make up room"". Very nice touch. There was a Nspresso maker and a boiler water pitcher for tea. Their selection of tea and cookies in the room were delicious. There was a sofa at the foot of the bed, which made watching TV and eating room service so comfortable.Everything was perfect and we will be back many times in the future.",5,2018,10,16
129,Loved the Ampersand Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Ampersand Hotel because of its ratings, location and because we also like smaller boutique type hotels.  We were not wrong in selecting the beautiful Ampersand for our stay in London!

Our room was large and elegant plus the bed was extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was fairly large with nice L'Occitane products.  There is a complimentary bar in the room with coffee, cokes, water, popcorn etc. which was a nice touch.  Irons are available on request as are power adapters .  We also appreciated the umbrellas available for use of the guests since it did rain on one day while there.

The location of the hotel is perfect .. close to restaurants and shopping .. Harrods is within walking distance as are many other nice shopping destinations. The South Kensington Underground Station on the Piccadilly Line is only a half block away.  We loved visiting lively Covent Gardens using the Underground which is only a few stops away.

Staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay!  Sezay the bellman is an asset to the hotel .. so friendly and goes the extra mile to help.

The Ala Carte breakfast was really good and reasonably priced.  

Only problems we had encountered was the printer was off-line for one night and one of the computer stations was also off-line on a different night.  Staff reacted swiftly to resolve the problems.  Also, there was construction / jack hammering starting at 11PM directly across the street from the hotel which lasted until 2AM on multiple nights.  Not the fault of the hotel but a slight damper on our stay.

Overall, a wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel in a great location with a very engaged and helpful staff.",5,2018,10,15
129,Best Hotel Stay Ever,"I simply cannot say enough or recommend the Ampersand Hotel more highly to anyone going to London. I will only stay here and hope after reading this review, you decide to as well! Where do I start?

This was my second stay at the Ampersand Hotel and I‚Äôm not sure how, but they managed to make it even better than the first. I had been planning a trip with my family for sometime to London and had booked a room in April of 2019. After many different iterations of the trip, we wound up changing the date multiple times and they were always super amenable and able to update my reservations AND give me the same rate, no questions asked. We wound up moving the trip up from April to October instead and even added a room, no problem. We arrived to an incredibly warm welcome and they even gave me the same room from my previous stay that I loved so much. To make things even better, they had left a birthday treat for myself in one room and as well for my parents in the other. It really is the little things and attention to detail that make a difference! The manager on duty also personally delivered our bags and walked us through how to use all the different controls in the room. Wow!

So, you won‚Äôt get a better deal in London in terms of room perks. Rooms come with a Nespresso machine and all items in the mini bar are complimentary! That meant free popcorn and cookies, bottomless tea and coffee, as well as water/sparkling water, cokes/diet cokes, and milk for your tea/coffee. These items are always restocked. The beds are without a doubt the most comfortable hotel bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. It was like sleeping on a cloud, so fluffy, I just melted into the sheets and drifted off to a blissful sleep. The floors in the bathroom‚Ä¶are heated! The toiletries are all L‚Äôoccitane and always replenished. I always book a Deluxe Studio and some of them have a free standing tub in the room. I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed a relaxing bath until I saw it. Also, their hair dryers are this awesome salon caliber and quality BabyBliss. My hair usually takes forever to dry and is frizzy and it only took a few minutes and looked immaculate without styling. I looked for the dryer online but they don‚Äôt make them in the states, so I‚Äôm looking forward to returning üòä. 

The staff is so attentive and eager to please. My friends coordinated to have a bottle of champagne delivered to my room and it was there waiting for me with a personal note when I arrived back from dinner. I know this seems like a trivial thing but after trying to coordinate champagne delivery for friends recently at two different high end hotels in London and Paris during their stays (which both were unsuccessful with multiple day notices, credit cards authorizations etc), I was so impressed.

With all of that, upon checkout, the lovely man at the front desk gave me a special birthday gift. A cute little London black cab with the Ampersand Hotel logo. It now sits at my office desk and I can now day dream about my next trip to London when I will undoubtedly stay at my favorite home away from home. 

Thank you to everyone at the Ampersand for a fantastic stay! The rest of my family echoes all of the above sentiments and we cannot wait to return.",5,2018,10,15
129,A very comfortable stay,"Stayed 4 very comfortable nights at the lovely Ampersand at the beginning of October. Excellent location close to railway station, easy walk to museums, a variety of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel and a bank with ATM next door. The staff were always friendly and very helpful and the buffet breakfast of a high standard although no hot food included. You could also have a la carte and the poached eggs with smashed avocado and feta I had one morning was perfect. Our room was small but probably one of the best equipped rooms we have ever stayed in with everything you might need on holiday and the best hairdryer I have ever found in a hotel! The bathroom was very small but not really a problem for us. Our only little complaint was that the old floorboards squeaked, something we became used to after the first day but really creepy at first! Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,10,15
129,Good hotel ideally located,Good hotel ideally located on the Picadilly line with direct access to Heathrow and SAint Pancras.(20'). Small rooms and tiny bathrooms but common in London. Breakfast buffet is good.The tea room seems to be appreciated per the locals on Sunday.,4,2018,10,15
129,A good convenient hotel,Only 50 yards from the exit South Kensington. A good convenient place ideally located on the Picadilly line with direct acess to Heathrow and Saint Pancras. Plenty of neiborhood place around for dining. The tea room seem to be appreciated per the local. ,3,2018,10,15
129,Excellent location and service,"The entire staff was hospitable and efficient. The location couldn't have been more convenient with the South Kensington Underground Station half a block away and several bus stops also nearby. The V&A Museum is a short walk. If you are traveling alone with carry-on luggage, the smaller rooms are a good value. For a couple traveling with larger bags, book a larger room.",5,2018,10,13
129,"Location, Location, Location","We got to our hotel several hours before our check in but the staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful.  They stored our luggage while we went off to discover London and then put them in the rooms.  Our location was close to everything and we had easy access to the tube, buses and taxis.  The only drawback was the restaurant downstairs serving breakfast.  The food was poor as was the ambiance.  We would definitely go back to this hotel.",5,2018,10,12
129,Favourite hotel south of Hyde Park,Usually stay at Firmdale hotels but they tend to be expensive for long stays. This is my go to for value. I get the room styling touches with conveniences like Nespresso in room. Close to tube with 3 lines and safe. Service and housekeeping efficient but not pretentious ,5,2018,10,12
129,wonderful stay in South Kensington,"Great hotel location in south Kensington. 1 block to tube station. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Plenty of neighborhood restaurants and shops. Quick walks to 3 excellent museums. Walk to Harrods and Knightsbridge shopping.

Elevator, A/C, in-room safe & hairdryer, UK smartphone provided for local usage and international calls. We stayed in a deluxe studio room, which I would recommend if you can afford it.  Room was spacious, with two sinks in the bathroom and a TV in the shower/tub combo. Complimentary coffee maker, tea & beverages provided in room. Comfortable bed. Two nights were noisy due to emergency street repair for electrical outage across the street, not hotel's fault.  Otherwise, our room on 4th floor was very quiet.  You can feel the tube trains passing underneath, but it was subtle and not bothersome.

Small but uncrowded fitness room. We ate at hotel's restaurant, Apero for a breakfast, afternoon tea and one dinner",5,2018,10,12
129,"Friendly Staff, Great Location","Great Stay, Super Location for Museums, Hyde Park, Staff are super friendly and helpful.Quiet room requested and got at back of hotel, good size shower, usual bathrobes etc, one would expect. Afternoon Science tea was really cool (¬£40pp+12.5% service) lots of cakes and gadgets, fun for anyone but children would be enthralled.This is in a really nice area and is especially useful for the Royal Albert Hall, a 15 minute walk.",5,2018,10,12
129,London boutique hotel,"We had one night here to celebrate my husband‚Äôs 50th birthday and it lived up to all our expectations! It is really well located situated opposite South Kensington tube station and just a short walk from the museums. An early check in was facilitated and we also received an upgrade to a superior room which was a fantastic start to his birthday. The soft drink mini bar was complimentary which was great and we also received a glass of champagne each in the cellar bar which had a lovely ambience. The bed was super comfy and the room dark and quiet. Large shower in the bathroom with under floor heating; gorgeous luxury toiletries and a cute little Ampersand rubber duck which we took home off our 5 year old. The were lots of people having afternoon tea in the lounge, beautifully decorated and the food looked good as well. We decided to eat breakfast out at Fernandez and Wells and there as so many good places to choose within close walking distance. This is great value for London but also feels very special.
",5,2018,10,10
129,The best hotel I have stayed in!,"I am not usually able to stay at fancy and expensive hotels. At the Ampersand, I stayed in a fancy hotel but it was not expensive!!  The staff was attentive and helpful and really went all out to make our stay pleasant.  From the first minutes of our stay till the very end, the staff looked out for us and make us feel welcome.  There was nothing that was needed in our room that was not already thought of.  The room was comfortable and roomy and the amenities were incomparable. They provided a FREE SMART PHONE with internet, maps, and international calls that we used extensively.   I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2018,10,09
129,Not a bad stay but wasn‚Äôt impressed,"I‚Äôm currently on day 3 out of 5 in this hotel. I booked a large suite, which is gorgeous with a freestanding bathtub and a king-size bed, but the room has thin carpet that‚Äôs seen better days. The floor creaks loudly no matter where or how lightly you step, so I hope no one is staying below me. The room itself is fairly quiet aside from general city noise. Breakfast starts at 16 pounds but it‚Äôs absolutely not worth it. Everything arrives cold/room temperature, and I set myself up for disappointment by expecting an actual croissant or two for what amounts to $22+ USD. Nope, one mini croissant and one mini chocolate croissant roughly 1/4 the size of normal ones. The rest of the continental breakfast was 2 slices of cheese, 4 thin slices of Italian meat, and 2 pieces of toast cut in half. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else in London for breakfast.

The staff isn‚Äôt overly pleasant but perhaps that‚Äôs just London. They seem neutral toward me at best. I found Paris more warm and inviting, especially my hotel staff. Once I leave, I‚Äôll have spent more than $3,000 on a 5 day stay. For a 5 star hotel with a 5 star price, I shouldn‚Äôt go ‚Äúeh‚Äù when people ask how I liked the hotel.",3,2018,10,08
129,Incredibly special boutique hotel experience,"We stayed here on our wedding night and got  upgraded to the hotel suite when the lovely lady at reception found out we had just gotten married. The suite was just gorgeous, it really made our wedding night with all the special touches (the huge bath, luxurious bed, gorgeous L'Occitane products, outdoor terrace). Thanks to all the staff at the hotel who were warm and welcoming, we loved our stay.",5,2018,10,08
129,Beautiful luxury hotel in Knightsbridge,Everything was perfect I loved my stay here. It has really easy to access other parts of London. The bed was extremely comfortable the room spotless and the staff were all really friendly and nice. Thank you for a wonderful stay,5,2018,10,08
129,Loved it.,"Incredible location. Our six year old son was able to walk to all the museums, Kensington Gardens, the Princess Diana Memorial Playground in the area and there were plenty of buses and the tube within metres to take us to all the other parts of London we wanted to explore. He enjoyed a bath with L‚ÄôOccitane products after a few big days exploring. Everything we needed was in the area. Staff were friendly and attentive. Really comfortable bed. Would highly recommend. Request a room with a view out over the roof of the Natural History Museum. ",5,2018,10,08
129,Comfortable Family Vacation,"We spent a week here and found it most pleasant. Good area, hotel restaurant food very good, nice restaurants close by. Rooms comfortable with nice amenities. Staff very friendly and helpful no matter what we asked. While we did not use the tube, it‚Äôs a block away. Highly recommend!",5,2018,10,07
129,This may be the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"We were here for a week. The location is excellent, near several museums and the South Kensington tube station. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable hotel bed we have slept in, which was critical as we walked miles every day. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was small, and we had a view of an alley, but it didn't matter; we were there to sleep and recharge after full days of activity so the peace and quiet were much appreciated. The Drawing Room made great latte and sweets for afternoon tea. Conveniently located to many restaurants . It is also listed in Small Luxury Hotels, which was no surprise, though the rates were not unreasonable.",5,2018,10,07
129,Wonderful!,"We arrived late and tired from New York. They were still serving food so we had a great meal before our day ended. The concierge was helpful with every detail, transportation from the airport to our specific needs in the rooms. Very comfortable and a perfect location. I'll definitely return.",5,2018,10,07
129,"Great hotel, great location","A very warm welcome from the reception staff began my stay here on a positive note which continued throughout the stay.  The well-appointed room was a little small but every amenity was available as one would expect from a boutique hotel. While this was a business trip and did not allow for visiting nearby places of interest, nor for shopping, this hotel is ideally placed for these. The service staff were outstanding and are to be highly commended.",5,2018,10,06
129,"Great neighborhood, helpful staff","The neighborhood and the helpful staff are the two best things about the Ampersand Hotel. The hotel needs to bring in some ‚Äúsecret shopper‚Äù type experts to improve room amenities, particularly in the bathroom, because someone didn‚Äôt do a very good job of that.  ",4,2018,10,06
129,Brilliant Location! ,"This hotel is located right near the South Kensington tube station, so travel was made easy from Heathrow and to other areas of London. Staff were friendly and for London standards, the room was spacious! Great quality toiletries, free sparkling water and a turn-down-service every night. Great choice of restaurants in close proximity also. Would stay again!",5,2018,10,05
129,Can't beat the location!,"The room is cozy.  The service is solid.  The location is simply unbeatable at the heart of South Kensington.  Taxi, tube, museums within 5min walking distance.  Finally, it is chic to stay at The Ampersand.",4,2018,10,03
129,Loved this hotel!,"I stayed at the Ampersand in September, 2018 whilst visiting my son who was living in London for his study abroad program.  The location is excellent.  It was extremely convenient to be a two minute walk from the South Kensington tube station.  Neighborhood restaurants are abundant.  There are also excellent services nearby including dry cleaners.  

The hotel:  staff at the checkin desk were extremely helpful.  My room was exactly as booked.  I was on the 4th floor - down a hallway with no other doors around me.  I was spooked at first.  My room was in the rear of the hotel.  I found it spacious (for London standards) and very quiet.  There is no turndown service.  My bathroom was quite large, with two double sinks and an excellent, large, walk in shower.  Hair dryer worked wonderfully.  The amenities provided were very sufficient.

The room was cleaned each day to my satisfaction.  

The front desk was extremely helpful with answering any questions I had.  The hotel booked a tour for my son and I.  I was able to use the public computer on the bottom floor for two afternoons with no problem.

I will definitely stay here again and have already booked for my next visit.",5,2018,10,03
129,A wonderful experience,"The entire experience was exceptional. The room was extremely clean. Staff members were highly knowledgeable, patient, friendly yet professional. From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed, we were well taken care of.",5,2018,10,03
129,Great location,Great location and excellent service. Cute boutique hotel and next to the South Kensington tube. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Very welcoming. Good price for the location. Five stars all the way.,5,2018,10,02
129,"Ideal for V&A, Science and Nat. History Museums","""Luxury"" isn't easy to define but this certainly has it if you're looking for Value-for-money in West London. I like the use of a handy in the rooms which lets you make free telephone calls. Breakfast is excellent and the basement restaurant a super bistro if you want to stay in overnight.",5,2018,10,02
129,HOTEL WITH THE BEST SERVICE IN LONDON A GREAT 5 STARS,"The personnel in the hotel is very efficient  and they help you in any thing you could need, in particular the people at the reception desk and specially Fabio are exceptionnals.Great experience in London.",5,2018,10,02
129,Another great stay!,"The second time we have used this Hotel for a weekend trip to London, it is so impressively clean and welcoming, the rooms are lovely,I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.
It is unfortunate that we could not spend as much time actually in the hotel as we would have liked due to commitments but we have promised ourselves a third visit with less of an agenda simply so we can chill out and enjoy more of the hotel itself.
Easy travel from South Ken tube station got us way over to Upper Street in no time.
Parked our vehicle near enough outside the hotel without charge ( Saturday afternoon through to Sunday lunch).
Staff are so polite and helpful , I needed that beer at 1.30 am when I returned!",5,2018,10,01
129,"Comfortable, clean, and cost-effective","If you‚Äôre comparing the cost amentinites of the Ampersand to other hotels, don‚Äôt underestimate the huge benefit gained from the daily complimentary beverages at the Ampersand. If you haven‚Äôt traveled to London before, be aware that water fountains are non-existent anywhere in the city (I saw one during our entire weeklong stay), and buying water bottles is as costly as alcohol practically. The Ampersand kindly will provide water bottles and other beverages by the truckload all for free! On top of this the service is top notch, professional, and kind. Location is perfect for checking out all of London. South Kensington tube station is steps away and connects to three major lines as well as Victoria station, which further connects to Gatwick trains. Lastly, the gym is more that sufficient to appease even the most diligent gym rats while on holiday. I won‚Äôt hessitate to stay here again. ",5,2018,09,30
129,"A warm welcome ""home""",We always look forward to staying at the Ampersand with its highly personalised level of staff service and professionalism. We always receive the warmest of welcomes and are recognised by name.Never disappointed! ,5,2018,09,30
129,Superb Service,"From arrival to departure, the staff made this stay outstanding.  The room was fine and the comfort wonderful.  Would gladly return to this establishment.  All of the recommendations for eating establishments were right on.  The help provided for travel via the tube was invaluable.",5,2018,09,29
129,Love this hotel ,"Ok so this is our third stay at the hotel and I think I would struggle to stay anywhere else now when in London

Staff are very courteous and friendly 

Room is fab, comfy and clean and the under floor heating in the bathroom is a real treat 

Great location in a nice part of London with easy access to and from Heathrow 

Always enjoy the little box of sweet treats that are delivered to the room too

129,Excellent as always; home away from home!,Having been referred by friends some years ago I now only stay at the Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington.It is simply superb and consistently excellent and the professional and personable service is outstanding! The Ampersand is more than a hotel; it is a home away from home! ,5,2018,09,27
129,Better elsewhere. ,"Probably won‚Äôt return to this hotel when there are so many other in the same price bracket in London. Room was tiny on the ground floor with continued rumble of buses going past the window all night and morning. Asked to be moved at 7.20am and was told the hotel is full but they will try their best (weirdly, for this time of day, it was still the night shift receptionists who looked a bit bleary eyed). And all this after paying an extra 66 pounds per night for a so called ‚Äúsuperior room‚Äù",2,2018,09,27
129,What a find!,"Location is unbeatable. Our room (410) was large and bright and bed was wonderfully comfortable. Service was impeccable and Fabio, in particular, was a wonderful host. Would not consider any other hotel on our next trip to London",5,2018,09,27
129,Very average,"The hotel has a cute common area, but beyond that its not very nice. The rooms are tiny; ours had a terrible odor that made it difficult to even be in the room.  The mattress was lumpy and terrible.  There was a lot of street noise, and the restaurant staff were awful.",1,2018,09,26
129,Great stay at the Ampersand Hotel,"The Ampersand is well located in South Kensington. This hotel has been reecently renovated,high tech ,inviting and well maintained. The staff were very accommodating ,professional in their functions and take pride in offering quality services.Our superior room was well appointed ,kept clean and met our needs.",5,2018,09,26
129,LDF trip,"Excellent customer service and all around experience. Would highly recommend to friends, relatives, and colleagues. Through every step of the hotel experience the staff at the Ampersand were most willing and helpful.",5,2018,09,25
129,Afternoon tea ,"Went as part of a group of 5 for 2 friends birthdays. 
We had the science themed afternoon tea and I must say it was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had!! 
From the savoury to sweet it was all fantastic and looked lovely! 
We even had to make our own lemonade at the start. 
The venue is stunning and very well designed. 
Definitely worth a visit :)",5,2018,09,24
129,Outstanding in London,"The Ampersand never disappoints and on each stay showcases its outstanding professionalism.  Its staff is always ready and graciously willing in ensuring their guests are having the best experience while @ The Ampersand;  their rooms are outstanding, well appointed and extremely comfortable.  A true home away from home when in London.  And being in the heart of South Kensington, for me The Ampersand provides the most convenient location to traverse the city.  ",5,2018,09,24
129,Very nice in good locatation!,The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel right next to South Kensington station is great. Lots of shops and restaurants around. Little bit hard to deal with the light system in the room. But overall absolutely recommandable!,5,2018,09,24
129,Four night stay,"Checked in here for 4 nights and it has been wonderful. It is on the small luxury hotel world site.
Check in: very efficient and everything was ready for us.
Room: adequate size with a good size king bed and great linen. Complimentary soft drinks and snacks in your room and also a mobile phone for you to use and take about and about with you which also gives you free a local and some a overseas calls!! Excellent.
Bathroom: tiny, but nice fluffy towels and good products. A proper hairdryer too which is a welcome change to the silly small ones attached to walls.
This hotel is located right near South Kensington tube station and it is very easy to get around . We would definately stay here again.
Breakfast : we just had the continental and it was more than adequate with a quality range of things to eat . The only negative would be that the coffee is not served hot enough, even though we always asked for it extra hot, but it still came Luke warm.
Great hotel, great location , great staff,.",5,2018,09,23
129,Still as good as last time,"I stayed at the hotel this week and have no complaints or niggles at all. 

I regularly visit London for business trips and have stayed at a number of hotels ranging from Travelodge through to 5 star hotels on Park Lane.

The Ampersand offers a great option at an excellent price. The hotel is just across the road from South Kensington Underground station and so extremely convenient for getting anywhere. It is also a stones throw away from the main museums on Cromwell Road.

The hotel and room's are finished to a high standard and the staff are very friendly and efficient.

I hadbooked the hotel through the Small Luxury Hotels of the World website.

I will certainly stay here again and look forward to coming back!",5,2018,09,21
129,one night with you,"Staff excellent, beds comfortable, room a little small, bar crowded. Overall a good night's stay.Location very convenient. Pre arrival service very good. Why oh why must the review of one night's stay contain 200 characters - tres annoying!",4,2018,09,21
129,Best Hotel in London,I have stayed at The Ampersand on several occasions and every time the stay has been exceptional.  The staff is incredible and every stay has been like staying with the best of families! BEST HOTEL in London!,5,2018,09,20
129,Ample Amenity at the Ampersand!,"Fantastic find!  This charmingly mod boutique hotel is in a great location in the lovely South Kensington Area (Museum District) of London.  The South Kensington tube station is just across the street, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, and other popular sites are short walks away.  Our room had adequate space with well-placed furniture (writing desk, upholstered bench at the end of the bed, small upholstered chair), and the bed was super comfy.  The bathroom with walk-in shower was the best we'd had on our entire 25-day visit in the U.K., with huge fluffy towels and bathrobes/slippers provided. There are all types of restaurants and patisseries in the area, and there are a restaurant and tearoom on site.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Great location, value, and comfort in London!",5,2018,09,20
129,Fantastic location and service,"We stayed here to be close to the Natural History Museum and V&A, and love the South Kensington area. Service was spot on and the room (we had one with the bathtub in the room) spacious enough to allow us to have in-room massages (pre-arranged with staff) at the same time. Splendid rooms, lovely hotel, impeccable location. Book directly with hotel for best prices; we got 3 nights for the price of 2.",5,2018,09,19
129,Exceeded expectations,"Charming little hotel with top level, modern accommodations and lovely unpretentious style. Quality exceeds price point in my opinion. Centrally located, literally steps from the tube and next to the Natural History Museum, and near a university for a great micro bit of the city. Highly recommend.",5,2018,09,19
129,"Nice hotel, wonderful staff, tiny room","Smallest hotel room ever! No room to maneuver at all. Had to put suitcase in bathroom,  hardly any  place to put anything, could not access closet, really just a cupboard, without climbing over the bed.the hotel was really lovely but the size of the room was very disappointing.",3,2018,09,18
129,"Sweet Hotel, Way Too Cramped to be ""Luxury""","We booked a suite, plus one bedroom, while traveling to London with 2 teenagers.  

The hotel is very small and sweet, with a pretty lobby and drawing room and small restaurant.  High tea there was fun and delicious--though, like most fancy places, verrrry expensive.  The tube is a block away, and there are lots of little restaurants and shops around.  We were able to walk easily to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. (MIght be a hike for some, though.) Of course, the V&A is right around the corner, which is great, too.

The big issue for us was how cramped our quarters were.  We planned for one kid to use the bedroom ""king"" bed and one to use the sofa bed, but the latter was very uncomfortable and, when opened, blocked flow through the rooms. (We literally had to crawl over it.) Our bedroom had a tiny window and NO, I repeat, NO drawers to put anything in.  Likewise for the deluxe bedroom.  The 2 closets were tiny and had about 5 hangers, total.  (They did bring a bunch more on request, as we had to hang anything because, well, no other place to put them.) My husband actually stored most of his clothes in the very spacious bathroom but they ended up damp the whole time because of the open-shower situation.  (IN fact the bathroom was luxurious and more light-filled than the bedrooms, also big.)  

Be forewarned that the subway rumbles pretty loud beneath you--we were on the 5th floor and could still hear it, about every minute or so, except from about 2 AM-5AM. That said, we asked for a fan and used our white noise apps and eventually adjusted. (I will say, given its busy locale, it was pretty quiet on the 5th floor except for that subway.)

The restaurant's buffet (continental) breakfast was decent (though no place to put down one's plate when cutting, say, the ham).  Service very spotty.  One day, I had to ask for my coffee maybe 5 times, and it didn't arrive until we were done eating!

The fitness room was tiny, windowless, and with only a few cardio machines, but serviceable. 

All of that said, I don't know if I'd stay at this hotel again.  For 10 days, we probably got a good deal (I booked a non-refundable fee 6 months in advance).  Just expect when something is designated as ""luxury,"" it actually is.",3,2018,09,17
129,Top notch boutique hotel,"Top quality boutique hotel with genuine luxury feel, super comfy bed, fabulous shower and excellent customer experience. Pillows extremely soft (must be goose down). L'Occitane products. Very central and very close to Tube.",5,2018,09,17
129,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely Hotel in a fantastic area of London. Easily accessable to the train station, Staff were very attentive and showed us some terrific places to eat, I would definitely stay there again. It was a great experience being our first time in London.",4,2018,09,17
129,The Ampersand- Amazing,"loved staying here, location was perfect and close to the South Kensington tube, and plenty of attractions. Staff were very accomodating, given I arrived early. the rooms was spacious and comfortable. I will defiantly be back ",5,2018,09,16
129,"Great Location, friendly staff",We had our leadership meeting in The Ampersand Hotel this week and it went really well. The hotel is in a super location. The meeting facilities are good and the food we were served was delicious and a bit different than the usual which was nice. Staff were really pleasant and attentive & I wouldn't hesitate to return to The Ampersand.  The beds were super comfy and the rooms were quiet considering the location. ,5,2018,09,14
129,Great unique stay hotel,"Fab staff, fun theme and even better cocktails.  The hotel and drinks are expensive, but not out of the ordinary for a Kensington hotel.  So in that sense value for money.  I would definitely stay there again.  ",4,2018,09,13
129,Excellent hotel excellent staff,"We have stayed several times at this boutique hotel in South Kensington.  It never disappoints! They provide mobile phones in the room for use, centrally located, easy access to the underground, walking distance to the V and A, Museums, and restaurants.",5,2018,09,11
129,great hotel!,"warm greeting at reception, great night sleep on a lovely bed, and the afternoon tea was memorable. this is my 6th stay and each time it feels like a bit of home. clean rooms and well appointed. My only issue - it was for one night!",5,2018,09,11
129,Delightful Hotel,"Delightful hotel. Staff was attentive and friendly. Rooms were comfortable and chic. Dining experience in the hotel was average. Food was good, but service was not so good. Right next to a couple different  bus stops and underground station which made it extremely easy to get around the city taking public transportation.   I would highly recommend this hotel for friend or couple trips. ",4,2018,09,10
129,Lovely Hotel in South Kensington,"Our recent 5 night stay at The Ampersand exceeded our expectations.  It is a small boutique hotel in an excellent location - one block from the tube station in a very nice and safe neighborhood.  Our room - while small - had everything we asked for.  The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower was incredible. While we were on the street side - we heard no sound from the street.  The staff was very accommodating.  We did extensive sightseeing around London and their mobile phone that was in the room was ingenious.  You could take it with you to access the internet while out and about.   We were steps from several small restaurants.  There was a cab at the door anytime we wanted to use a Cab.  It was an amazing value for London.  I have already recommended it to several friends who are planning a trip to London",5,2018,09,09
129,Modern and chic,"I stayed in their superior room which was an ADA room. It was very spacious with a high ceiling, king size bed with a bench at the end, and armchair for seating. The bathroom had heated floors! As well as dual shower heads. The hotel puts in great effort with little details, such as branded rubber duckies in the shower, complimentary tea and candy in the library, and complimentary drinks in room's fridge which was so nice to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. They also have great bath/grooming kits and toiletries which they are generous on refreshing, The hotel is close to an underground stop which was very convenient and also walking distance to museums and plenty of good restaurants. Great location and great vibes from staff at this hotel! Would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,09,09
129,Great hotel & Great location,Location is perfect with a Metro station nearby and a Hop on Hop off bus stop right outside the hotel. The hotel itself was excellent. We upgraded to a superior room which was just as well because the standard rooms are tiny. Very friendly and helpful staff.,5,2018,09,06
129,Charming Hotel in a Wonderful Neighborhood,"Wonderful location and friendly staff. Steps away from the Underground and various Bus Routes to key London locations. Great restaurants and shops within walking distance. Room is a nice size as is the bathroom. The closet is a bit small for longer stays and the height of the tub is extremely difficult to navigate. It was quite scary to get in/out for fear of slipping and falling. Otherwise, it was a lovely boutique hotel in a great neighborhood.",5,2018,09,06
129,Treasure in South Kensington,"A wonderful luxury hotel in South Kensington.  Great location close to tube station.  Rooms are very small unless you get a ""deluxe"" room, which is regular room size.  Rooms are very well appointed. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,09,05
129,Excellent Hotel - with one small exception,"This is the second year on the trot I have stayed at Ampersand (with colleagues) over three nights, whilst in London exhibiting at Olympia.  The 12 months since my last stay had dulled my memory of what an excellent hotel this is.  Every part of the hotel looks and smells new - maintenance clearly being a high priority to the proprietors.  There are always professional-but-friendly, well-dressed staff around with a smile, ready to help with any questions, reservations, etc.. My room was well looked after during the stay.  Breakfast in Apero was excellent, with a good range of pretty much everything one could ask for at breakfast and good a la carte options.  Breakfast service was a little slow - more akin to a resort rather than the usual prompt nature of London service.The small exception was the surly nature of the bartender at Apero.  Last year we had an excellent Italian guy who knew his stuff and kept my colleagues and I up late spending too much on drinks after our evenings out.  This year we had a surly bartender who would barely look at us when we ordered our first drink at the bar on the Saturday night.  We quickly drank up and went elsewhere for the remainder of the evening and two nights thereafter.  Such a shame when the rest of the hotel is so good.",5,2018,09,05
129,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here from 22nd to 25th, couldn‚Äôt be happier, great location   , friendly,helpful staff, great rooms, good bar and restaurant, recommend this hotel to any visitors to London, quiet neighbourhood,nice pubs and restaurants nearby",5,2018,09,05
129,Fabulous boutique hotel in Kensington.,Great boutique hotel with fantastic amenties.  Complimentary smartphones in each room that includes unlimited calls to the US and UK as well as complimentary minibar.  Located near South Kensington tube station and great shopping and restaurants.,5,2018,09,01
129,Perfect choice for family or business,We used The Ampersand as our home base for 3 days in London.  We are a family of 5 and purchased two room next to each other.  Both deluxe rooms were of superior fit and finish quality with ample space and amenities. The free local cell phone and mini-bar were a very nice touch.  We had the breakfast buffet in the hotel each morning and it was very good at a very reasonable cost. While the hotel was outstanding the location was even better.  Popping out of the underground after a single 40 minute train ride and being able to see the sign for your hotel directly across the street is priceless (when will NYC learn this lesson)!  The South Kensignton neighborhood is among the most vibrant and exciting places in the city.  The icing on the cake was the cost was significantly less than similar hotels; an easy choice to make.,5,2018,09,01
129,Another lovely stay,"As with our previous stay at this hotel, it was comfortable and very enjoyable.The location is great, the staff helpful and polite. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and very comfortable, with a few nice additions not found in other hotels. We did not eat in the restaurant, but had a lovely breakfast in the basement breakfast room. We will return to this hotel in the future, when next staying in this part of London. We will strongly recommend this hotel to colleagues and friends. ",5,2018,09,01
129,Excellent services in great part of London,"The Ampersand Hotel is well appointed with a charming feel, excellent services and staff. Rooms are small but very comfortable. Location is perfect for getting around London and for many great restaurants.",5,2018,08,31
129,Completely perfect every time!,"This was my second stay, the first was with my family, this was solo.  It‚Äôs everything I want in a hotel.  Across the street from the tube, 5 minute walk to V&A, clean rooms, quiet excellent nights sleep.  Then there is the free smartphone they give you to use all over London so I don‚Äôt have to pay international roaming charges.  The food in their restaurants is great too.  I already have another stay booked on my way home from Africa.  Best layover to look forward to ever!",5,2018,08,30
129,Great location,"The hotel had great ambience and the staff were friendly and helpful.  The location was close to many attractions including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Ancient History museum, Kensington Palace and Harrods.  The underground railway was nearby and Double decker buses outside the hotel.  There are many restaurants and fast food facilities nearby.",5,2018,08,29
129,Fantastic boutique hotel,Lovely boutique hotel brilliantly positioned next to underground and both the natural history museum and the V&A. Breakfast was delicious if expensive and will definitely stay here again. Also it was my son‚Äôs 7th birthday and so they gave us a room with a view and brought him a plate of birthday deserts and a small gift. It really was very thoughtful and made the trip extra special for him.,5,2018,08,27
129,Great Intro to London,"Totally enjoyed this hotel!  Family of 5 - parents and 3 older teens - first time visiting London together.  The location is perfect in South Ken, adjacent to the So Ken underground station, short walk to Chelsea, Sloane Square (for excellent shopping), Harrods, Kensingston Gardens... You get the picture.  Super accessible to all of London.  The neighborhood is charming and great little restos and boutiques nearby.  The hotel itself was lovely and uniquely decorated.  Modern and fun.  The rooms were spacious enough and comfortable.  Teas, water, coffee and yummy biscuits were provided at no charge in the rooms.  Great toiletries provided with super lux towels and robes.  The morning breakfast was fantastic - the bread.  Oh the bread and butter!  Jams, frittatas, fruit, yogurt.  The staff was fast, efficient, pleasant and well mannered.  Looking forward to our next trip here!",5,2018,08,27
129,Our go-to hotel in London,We've been to London multiple times and this boutique hotel is by far the best (better than the Savoy and the Waldorf).  Perfectly situated in South Kensington with the tube just steps away. The rooms are comfortably furnished and clean.  Toiletries are L'Occitane.  The gym is small but Hyde Park is only a few blocks away.  Everything about this hotel is quaint and just lovely.  Staff is welcoming (front desk especially - thank you to Andre from Toulouse) and extremely helpful with suggestions.  The hotel is truly at your disposal!  We just love this hotel. ,5,2018,08,24
129,Chic boutique hotel,"Loved everything about this luxury hotel, especially the room upgrade and offer of two glasses of champagne because we'd booked through Small Luxury Hotels of the World. Perfect position next to the Tube (South Kensington) and 10 mins walk to Harrods.",5,2018,08,22
129,Awesome Hotel,"This hotel is in a perfect location to get the tube and buses.

The rooms are spacious and very modern with beautiful furnishings and a large bathroom.

Service was impeccable including assistance getting bags in and out of the hotel front door (there were a few stairs).

They were very accommodating in trying to get me in early as I arrived at 9am - they managed to contact me (i missed the call) at 1pm.

I will be staying there again in September and I am looking forward to it.",5,2018,08,21
129,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,We had a fabulous stay for six nights. Staff was excellent and location perfect! We were 3 minutes from the tube. Rooms were beautiful! Will stay again. Restaurants in the area were very good with lots of variety. ,5,2018,08,21
129,Good location but rooms not a great size for a family,"Within walking distance of great museums and a nice part of London to explore.  The staff in this hotel are amazing, really great service.  Unfortunately I found our room a little too small because we had an extra bed for a child.  ",4,2018,08,20
129,Hotel Stay,"Overall, the hotel is lovely.  Extremely comfortable rooms and beds.  Very cool d√©cor in the rooms and throughout the hotel.  The hotel staff are friendly, but the front desk ""friendliness"" leaves much to be desired.  They weren't ""mean, per se"", just mostly ignore you as a guest when you come and go.  Some guests may be fine with this approach, but at this price point and this neighborhood of London, I expect much more friendliness and attention to detail like this.  ",4,2018,08,20
129,Amazing South Kensington Botique Hotel,"This fantastic luxury Botique hotel offers excellent service and a unique approach with themed rooms and floors. The room was well appointed and the service from the hotel staff was fantastic. The hotel is located in the heart of South Kensington, steps away from the tube which runs to Heathrow.  It is an easy walk or tube ride into the centre of London. Good restaurants located nearby. ",5,2018,08,19
129,Gem in South Ken ,"Go to this lovely boutique hotel for the best service, the perfect location and a delicious breakfast spread in the worthwhile restaurant each morning. They also serve tea in the parlor each afternoon which rivals other top teas in town. The staff was efficient and helpful in every way‚Äîeven sent up two Negronis to our room one night when we stayed in and wanted a drink. We‚Äôll definitely be back. ",5,2018,08,19
129,Amazing place to stay,Definitely the best customer service I‚Äôve had a hotel... starting with making the reservation with Mikaela (forgive me if I misspelled the name which I‚Äôm sure I have) who was super friendly and accommodating through email to each aspect of my stay. Cant wait to return!!,5,2018,08,18
129,Highly recommended,"My husband and I were travelling with our son and daughter in law and I booked 2 deluxe double rooms with king beds, for 2 nights. We all enjoyed our stay. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are as depicted on the website. The beds were very comfortable, and the air-conditioning worked well in the unusually hot August heat-wave of 90 degree plus weather. The bathrooms are on the smaller side but functional.   The hotel location is great ‚Äì within a 1-2 minute walk to the South Kensington tube station. The surrounding area is wonderful ‚Äì easy walk to great shopping areas including Harrods, and lots of wonderful museums and parks.
The only meal I had was the ""cream tea"" in the drawing room, which was delicious!
Note that bags need to be carried up a few steps to the entrance of the hotel. Not an issue for most but may be an issue for some.",4,2018,08,18
129,Perfect London stay - LOVED the Ampersand,"We had a perfect stay at the Ampersand for a family trip in 8/18.  We had 2 studio rooms. The rooms were spacious, beautiful and well appointed (adapter, cell phone,complimentary minibar,etc). The hotel is well located: steps from Sourh Kensington tube, cafes, museums & Park.  The staff were very welcoming, helpful and accommodating.  We highly recommend a stay at the Ampersand!!  ",5,2018,08,18
129,Modern and convenient,"We selected this hotel for location, close to a departure point early the next morning. We were very pleased with its stylish, modern decor, its amenities, including a comfortable bar/lounge off the lobby, the small downstairs restaurant, and the very updated luxurious bathroom.  We had to rely on an early room service breakfast, which arrived just as selected and very promptly. The current price here for a double room is a bargain, given that 3-Star hotels nearby charge as much. This well-located hotel will not disappoint you.",5,2018,08,17
129,Relaxed friendly and efficient,"Our second holiday stay at the ‚Äò&‚Äô. Why? Because it meets our needs in being convenient for the tube, situated near a smart and lively square with lots of places to eat and drink, friendly and efficient staff, spotless room - they put us in the same room we had previously which was either a coincidence or silent guest care - a breakfast that has real variety and quality and in a really ambient setting. ",5,2018,08,17
129,A Wonderful Hotel in a Wonderful Neighborhood ,"When I‚Äôm in London I always stay in South Kensington. It‚Äôs perfectly located, with lots of great pubs, restaurants, shops, museums and a Tube station with lines that will get you to most of London‚Äôs attractions. This trip I had the very fortunate luck to book a stay @ The Ampersand Hotel. A more than lovely small, luxury hotel just across the street from the South Kensington Tube Station. The Ampersand‚Äôs accommodations are first rate. I was reminded of a boutique hotel, but with a far more extensive array of amenities, from a full gym to a wine bar and restaurant. But it‚Äôs the hotel‚Äôs staff that‚Äôs impressed me the most. They could not be more welcoming, helpful, kind, and professional. From the entire front desk staff, to those who served me at breakfast, and also housekeeping. The day managers and hotel manager were exceptional. If you visit London stay in South Kensington. And if you stay in South Kensington, stay @ The Ampersand Hotel!",5,2018,08,16
129,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location!",Overall was a lovely place to stay. The bed was very comfortable. The room was super clean and a great size. We would only suggestion that there be a little more attention to service in the restaurant. We would love to stay again!,5,2018,08,15
129,Perfect spot for our family,From the minute we entered we all were so comfortable.  Rooms were so nice and the staff so helpful.  We enjoyed drinks at the bar and the overall cosiness of the hotel.  Awesome location.  Nice neighborhood to walk and easy to get on T and go. ,5,2018,08,14
129,Fantastic location and friendly staff.,"I brought my 11 year old daughter for a vacation- her first time in London. We loved the friendly staff, the Science Tea, the comfortable quiet room, and the location of the hotel. Less than a minute's walk from the South Kensington tube station and a selection of beautiful little European style cafes.  A few more minutes' walk to world class museums.  We loved our stay and hope to come back soon!",5,2018,08,13
129,Refinement at its best with excellent staff,Beautiful building. Nice furniture full of details. Great and nice staff. Two bars with excellent drinks. Shower and beds were top. Ample rooms and a very nice atmosphere. The best hotel I ever stayed at in London,5,2018,08,12
129,A great place to stay in South Kensington,"Wonderful staff, comfortable room, nice dining facilities, unusual and interesting decor, and the smart phone for free calls to UK and US, and for use outside the hotel with maps etc was much appreciated. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,10

129,& yet more praise ....,"Another excellent stay at The Ampersand - great location for The Proms and the Museums - with several more degrees of polish than other South Kensington establishments. Staff are friendly, and the standard of the rooms is exceptional (They have rooms with baths & draw space) if on the small side (however this is very much par for the course for London) when you are 6ft+! Definately one of a small roster of London establishments that we will visit again.",5,2018,08,08
129,weekend stay,three times a year we visit the Ampersand hotel for a weekend stay. The language knowledge of the cleaning people could be better as it hard to communicate with them. Perhaps another idea is to publish the current events in London. but in general we have enjoid  our stay..,4,2018,08,07

129,Amphersand review,Everything  was top notch when we stayed at the Amphersand. The location was the best. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The amenities in the rom were always refreshed daily. The Nespresso coffee in the morning was great!,5,2018,08,05
129,Great,We stayed here for 3 nights last week and found it very good. It is conveniently placed near a tube station and black cabs wait on a rank outside. The restaurant and breakfast are good and service throughout the hotel is efficient and friendly. I parked my car at the Union Car Park about 200 metres away and that worked well. Bed was comfortable. We would stay again and recommend .,5,2018,08,04
129,"Pre-cruising. The staff welcome us since the entrance, they we very fast to check us in, the room was modern and clean","They helped us to book our tours in London, also they helped us with information about the train that took us to Southampton. We will love to go back because the service was excellent. the room was a little small but efficient. The bathroom had headed floor and very modern, awesome shower . Definitely nice details and attention you will feel relax.",5,2018,08,03
129,Fantastic,"Nice hotel with a very good atmosphere, very friendly staff, nice big room, free minibar with soft drinks, quiet, close to museums and Hyde park. We will definitely be back.
Only downside was the breakfast, we ordered ala carte and was disappointed with what we got. I won‚Äôt let it affect my score though, since the hotel was one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in!

129,This was a trip to London.,"This is the hotel we would like to stay when we visit London. The location is for me excellent because
museums can be reached easyly by walking, the bus stop and the underground is in two minutes distance. The hotel is very clean and service is really excellent.",5,2018,08,02
129,Friendly hotel in fantastic location,"Researching many reviews we chose this one for ease of location. Train across road, bus around corner. It‚Äôs a lovely looking hotel and easy to find. Lots of eateries around. 
We mostly had their continental breakfast because it had such a wonderful choice of foods. Unlike the country manors. 
Our room was TINY however the bed was large and super comfortable as were the pillows. We forgot about the free mini bar (no alcohol), nice touch. The bathroom was good with l‚Äôoccitane toiletries and good bath. 
It was a haven after being in busy, crowded London. 
The staff were obliging. 
The gym was small but with so much to do didn‚Äôt use it. 
An observation was there weren‚Äôt enough power points. ",4,2018,07,30
129,Very nice,The staff was welcoming and very helpful.  The room was not quite what i expected - small for a suite.  The beds were very comfortable and bath well appointed.  It was very warm in London when we visited and the AC was not working properly in one of the rooms.  Had it not been for that I would have given the rooms 5 stars.  ,4,2018,07,30
129,Excellent,"Beautiful interiors. Great rooms. Welcoming friendly staff. Good location for the tube and South Kensington shopping. Room was really
Comfortable. There isn‚Äôt any negative at all. Well worth staying there. ",5,2018,07,29
129,The Hurst‚Äôs,"Fabulous boutique hotel in a brilliant location. Staff went beyond the call of duty to sort out and rearrange theatre tickets for us. They were all, without exception efficient, friendly and kind. 
We entertained friends for lunch at Apero  the hotel restaurant which was a lovely experience- great food and wine, friendly staff and reasonably priced. Fabulous rooms and facilities. Cannot wait to go back!!",5,2018,07,28
129,Can't Wait to Return,"We enjoyed a relaxing, comfortable 3-night stay at the Ampersand during the final leg of our UK/Europe trip. We'd thoroughly researched hotels before booking, but from check-in to checkout, the Ampersand truly exceeded our expectations. The hotel itself is simply beautiful and, as many reviewers have stated, offers comfortable beds in uniquely decorated rooms, with deluxe amenities and many complimentary bonuses. 

Porter service at arrival was instantly helpful with our mountain of luggage, and check-in was smooth and welcoming. Our booking request for adjoining/neighboring rooms was met without hesitation. Our Deluxe rooms were spacious, spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. 

We enjoyed breakfast downstairs in Apero restaurant on our first morning, with every intention of trying other local breakfast eateries on following days. However, Apero was so good that it was a no-brainer for the remainder of our stay. A varied menu of delicious dishes and espresso drinks provided a wonderful start to our busy days. The restaurant service was friendly and extremely attentive, without being intrusive. 

Hotel location is perfect for exploring London both near and far. Front desk provides tickets for Hop-on/Hop-off bus for easy touring. At check out, we were ready to hail 2 cabs to take us to Heathrow when the desk clerk offered to provide airport car service. A large, luxury vehicle appeared less than 5 minutes later and we enjoyed a stress-free, chauffeur driven ride together for significantly less than the cost of 2 taxis. 

Thank you to all of the wonderful staff for your outstanding service. We highly recommended The Ampersand Hotel",5,2018,07,27
129,A real gem of a hotel üíé in a super location,"Stayed for 3 nights with my 2 children in a deluxe studio.  The hotel is in a brilliant location, mere yards from South Ken tube.  The whole area around is vibrant, lots of eateries on the doorstep, very safe, just a really lovely area of London.  We could walk to Harrods in 15 minutes as a nice change from using the tube as it was so hot!  Didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel but loved the complimentary mini bar.  What a refreshing bonus compared to most hotels that just want to rip you off!  It was even stocked with the soft drinks that I requested before we arrived.  Housekeeping was great and there was also a turndown service.  All members of staff we encountered were friendly and professional.  
The room was lovely, beautifully decorated with an equally nice bathroom.  It was a little tight for space with an extra bed but was fine for our needs.  The hotel was very quiet at night - I am a very light sleeper and was not disturbed at all by guests, just a few sirens outside but far quieter than most hotels in London I‚Äôve stayed in, and I‚Äôve stayed in a lot!  Would highly recommend this hotel, it‚Äôs a special find in London! ",5,2018,07,27
129,London Vacation!,"I can‚Äôt say enough great things about this hotel. The staff were friendly, upbeat and super helpful. The bed was so comfortable, the room was clean and the restaurant, Apero  attached to the hotel was delicious! The hotel is in a great location across from the South Kensington tube and near many great restaurants! I highly recommended this hotel!",5,2018,07,27
129,Favourite hotel in London ,My family just stayed at The Ampersand for the 6th time in 8 years. The location is brilliant as it‚Äôs walking distance to The park and Knightsbridge shopping. The hotel has fantastic design throughout and the restaurant is an attraction of its own. Thank you to Tracey and the great team. We‚Äôll be back!,5,2018,07,26
129,Great for a visit to see Frida 'Making Her Self Up' @V&A,"Great room and close to restaurants and museums in Kensington, the hotel is only a few minutes walk from the V&A and the natural history museum, the rooms have everything you need for a short stay in London",4,2018,07,26
129,Excellent stay every time,"I've stayed at the Ampersand Hotel a few times for business travel and have enjoyed it so much that I'm taking my husband and kids there to celebrate our anniversary and expose the kids to this great city! As a frequent business traveler, this will be the first time I chose to vacation where I stay for work but that's how great this hotel is - the decor is whimsical yet tasteful, the staff are friendly yet discreet and the rooms are well-appointed with wonderful extras: tea, coffee, water, juice and cookies at no extra cost, a smartphone/tablet to use when out and about London which is a great perk to save on roaming costs. So close to the tube, great museums, shops and restaurants -a  perfect stay every time.",5,2018,07,23
129,A great all around hotel experience,Everything was on target here. Details were considered. Room amenities and bed were excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful. The gym was small but well equipped and maintained. And the location was quite convenient. I would definitely return. ,5,2018,07,22
129,"Stylish, quality & convenience.",My favourite hotel in South Kensington. Close to tube and lots of lovely eateries. Great place to stay in London. Walking distance to the museums.....even Harrods (but that's a bit more of a hike). Love the friendly staff and great quality beds and furnishings. The bonus phone that you can use during your stay is fantastic....take it out and about with you and call home for free. Lots of thought put into this place and I would highly recommend. Pick a high floor and you can get glimpses of the London Eye and various historic buildings.,4,2018,07,22
129,Great Location,"Literally two minutes away from the nearest tube station and only a short walk to a number of attractions. South Kensington itself is a lovely area with nice bars and restaurants. The hotel itself is well decorated, comfortable and with friendly staff. We only stayed one night and slept well so only rating as 4stars. We would certainly go back again though.",4,2018,07,22
129,Disastrous stay!,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights earlier this month.  We were unable to get a good nights sleep on any of the 4 nights.  The first night the AC did not work and it was extremely hot weather at the time.  The hotel staff apologized and sent a repair man the next day.  They offered us complimentary breakfast for our stay in lieu of the bad night.  The second night the AC worked but we were woken up at 1:00am by noise from the room upstairs, which continued for several hours.  So again, no sleep for most of the night.  Next morning we spoke with reception.  They moved us to a room on the top floor which was a downgrade from the room we had, but we accepted it in the hope that we could salvage the rest of our trip which was being ruined due to sleepless nights.  Our plans for the day were messed up because we had to return to the hotel at lunch time to pack and vacate our room ad move to the new room - apparently this could not be done at the end of the day.  The room was stifling hot but the staff said that was because it had been vacant and the AC was off.  We turned the AC on....4 hours later the room remained stifling hot.  We informed reception and requested they have the AC checked out. The weekend staff at Reception were rude and uncaring, and did not send a repair man.  The AC just blew warm air. The night was terrible and we could not catch any sleep in the heat.  The fourth night was the same - the AC was not fixed.  On 2 of the 4 days of our stay we had the 'complementary' breakfast that had been offered, but upon checkout they reneged upon the complimentary breakfasts and we had to pay for the breakfasts, although they did remove the charges for one of my husbands breakfasts.  Although the hotel advertises that the hotel is airconditioned, the AC doesn't really work. Most disappointing though was the fiasco regarding the comp  breakfasts, where we lost complete trust in hotel.",2,2018,07,20
129,An absolute delight !,"This hotel is an absolute delight. Charming and super helpful staff : spacious and  comfortable rooms  and location is so convenient . When we had a very sick child, housekeeping went out of their way to accommodate us.",5,2018,07,20
129,family trip,"the hotel is great, location and service was great. I just wished the room was larger, we were three with a folding bed for my grandson so it was pretty tight and no closet for your clothes. But we did have a great time in London and everyone was very helpful and nice. For sure will stay there again and recommended it to family and friends.  ",5,2018,07,19
129,3 Nights in South Kensington,"This is a beautiful hotel and was a nice base for our 3 night stay in London. The location is wonderful, directly across from the South Kensington station. The decor in the hotel is quite nice, and the property overall feels very nice. Being a 5 star hotel in London comes with great expectations, which is why I'm only giving 4 out of 5 stars on this review, as there are a couple of areas that could be slightly better. For the right rate, I would stay here again and would encourage others to do so as well. ",4,2018,07,18
129,Great location and great hotel,"Very well located in South Kensington, very short walk from the tube station.  Comfortable room and the staff were very helpful. If you are doing any sight seeing, there's a Hop on Hop off bus stop right in front of the hotel",5,2018,07,16
129,Great House in a Great Location,"This is a fabulous hotel right in the middle of everything!  Easy walking for dining, shopping, seeing the sights.  Staff is so very helpful and kind, always wanting to please you and make your stay the best if can be.  Rooms are very nice and bed slept very good.  We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return again one day.",5,2018,07,16
129,Very Poor,"A very poor experience from start to finish - not what you expect from a supposedly 5 star hotel ! 

Security needs to be addressed.

The bar area needs to have a member of staff available until it closes.

A brick wall view from the hotel room is simply shocking given the price !

Staff need to be more accommodating on check-in and listen to comments on check-out

We will not be returning - very disappointed given an alleged 5 star hotel !

",2,2018,07,15
129,A gem in S Kendington,"S Kensington is a great base from which to explore London with excellent transport links and lots of great sites on your doorstep.  The Ampersand complements this setting perfectly. The welcome is warm and friendly.  Rooms are well equipped, with fresh milk and complimentary soft drinks in a fridge a v welcome touch.    The small doubles are very cosy but priced accordingly.  We didn‚Äôt dine there but would have been happy to based on the utterly delicious breakfast with an abundance of fresh produce.  Guests booking via Small Luxury Hotels currently get a complimentary glass of champagne.  Good luggage storage facilities.  All in all a great place to stay.",5,2018,07,15
129,Excellent hotel near to everything!,"As a British citizen and former resident in England, I've never had to stay in a hotel, as we usually always stayed in the family house. Unfortunately, we no longer have the house, so while the visit back to my favorite city was exciting, it was a bit sad as well. That being said, for my first stay in a hotel in London, I was very happy. Read on...

My wife and I were taking a rather late honeymoon and after doing our reviews and looking through various different websites, we decided to go with The Ampersand Hotel based on reviews and location. We were originally going to go with one of the deluxe studios...but since it was our honeymoon, I surprised my wife by booking a suite. Booking on the hotel's website was quite easy and efficient. No problems there. I was glad that I was able to book 11 nights in one go but I was booking 6+ months in advance.

After booking...perhaps a week or two after, the hotel sent us a nice email asking if we there for any sort of special occasion, which of course I answered with 'Honeymoon'. About a week prior to our arrival to the hotel, received a second email asking if there was anything special they could do for us, but we were pretty much set.

One of the huge benefits of this hotel is the location. It is less than a 5 minute walk to the South Kensington tube station, which is very convenient. For the non-London experts, South Kensington is on both the Piccadilly Line (which makes getting to/from Heathrow convenient) and on the District Line (which helps getting you to a lot of tourist destinations).

The building itself is impressive but it doesn't feel out of place in the area. If there weren't signs, you would be forgiven if you didn't realize it was a hotel. The inside of the hotel is decorated quite nicely, but we didn't spend much time in the common areas. Check-in at the hotel was easy and the staff were excellent. Our suite was on the 5th floor and the hotel has two elevators. They are small, so if you have a lot of people with you, might take a bit of waiting, but it's not too bad. Our suite itself was excellent. I'm not even sure how to explain it all...it has everything you could possibly need. It's has some wonderful quirks and we kept finding something tucked away that we didn't realize it was there. It took us about 5 days before we finally found forks and knives! Overall, everything either met or exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,07,13
129,Well done,"This hotel is conveniently located next to several fantastic museums.  It is also in a quaint neighborhood with some good restaurants close by.  The decor is slightly funky and colorful, but well done.  The beds are comfortable, and the food is good.  Also, the price point is reasonable considering the quality of the hotel and exceptional service.",5,2018,07,13
129,Luxury hotel in a great location,"I and my friend have stayed in this hotel for three times and always everything was perfect, but at the previous time there were problems with cleaning of the room.
We returned to the room around 6 pm and the room was not cleaned, we told about the problem to the reception desk. And so it has been repeated for 3 times ((
While cleaning the room, the wine glasses was not washed, they still was dirty.
There was a balcony in our room which had never been cleaned
during our stay.
But in general, the hotel is excellent with amazing rooms, comfortable beds.
Delicious breakfast in the morning.
Very friendly staff in the hotel. Of course, every time I visit London I will stay at this hotel.",5,2018,07,12
129,Great place in South Kensington ,"The hotel is clean, comfortable and relaxing.

The deluxe king rooms are a generous size for the average hotel. The bed is large and very comfortable. The bathroom has plenty of room with a walk in shower. 

The complementary mini bar had popcorn, biscuits, soft drink, juice, still and sparkling water, milk, tea and coffee. The Handy smart phone with complementary calls and data was a great help with navigating the area.

Our room was at the back of the hotel with a small window facing the V&A museum, so we didn‚Äôt not get much street noise, but the modern glass sliding window over the old latch window also did a good job at cutting out the noise. If people were talking loudly in the hallway outside the room you could be disturbed by this, as the door didn‚Äôt seem to cut out as much sound.

We would stay again",5,2018,07,11
129,Top Notch!,"This is the perfect, charming hotel for exploring Central London and feeling as one lives in quiet South Kensington.  The location just opposite the Tube is perfect for easily getting to LHR or getting around the city quickly.  It‚Äôs also ideal for strolls through the leafy Kensington streets with their gorgeous white terraced rowhouses and vibrant cafes and shops.  We easily walked to Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge within just minutes.  The inviting lobby was always staffed with the most gracious hotel staff I‚Äôve experienced in London.  Members of the Drawing Room staff should be especially commended for their warm welcomes and impeccable service each time we even stepped one foot into the room.  The rooms were tastefully decorated and extremely clean.  I also appreciated the complimentary water, milk and cola provided each day in the minibar.  Anyone who knows London understands that hotel room square footage is at a premium, and while my Double Room was indeed small, I appreciated the honesty with which the hotel described it on the website.  I would likely only recommend it for one guest or for two guests who have a very close relationship as the space could get cozy.  Friends of mine chose a larger Deluxe Studio which was decorated in a similarly tasteful style but had much more room and could likely be compared as even larger than the size of a typical hotel room from a national US chain such as Hyatt or Marriott.  My only worry about The Ampersand is that it‚Äôs striving to be a true luxury hotel such as a Four Seasons.  With it‚Äôs charming yet small, wonky footprint I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible, and I hope the rates continue to reflect that.  Would I stay again?  Absolutely!",5,2018,07,10
129,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"We had a private room at this hotel for 21. The service was excellent throughout. Communication with the hotel booking very good throughout. The science tea is a little different and a lot of fun. Extra savouries and scones were offered before being requested and boxes for left overs as well to take home. The mushroom quiche was particularly good and the macaron.
A little more pricey than some but well worth it for a special occasion.",5,2018,07,09
129,nice boutique hotel,"Everything good but the rooms are pretty small.Otherwise very good situation close to South Kensington station and lots of bus lines available.Very friendly and efficient staff at the reception.
I recommend",5,2018,07,09
129,A lovely stay,"The staff in this hotel were all very friendly and helpful, making us feel very welcome.  Our room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The room has a mini bar providing complimentary soft drinks and given the hot weather during our stay this was very welcome.  There was no iron in the room but a phonecall to housekeeping saw one delivered within a few minutes. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from South Kensington Tube Station so in a great location for visitng the sights. Our room was also quiet, giving us a good nights sleep.  I would stay in this hotel again and would definitely recommend it to friends.",5,2018,07,08
129,boutique hotel,"small room but very clean and comfortable. the main spot is that it is on the metro station of south kinsington, so you can save the taxi cost. to go to the center, you can walk through the kinstington park and hyde park.",5,2018,07,08
129,Cute boutique hotel in the heart of Kensington,"Absolutely adorable hotel, impeccably furnished. Friendly, accomodating staff. Beds are way too soft and should be replaced more often. Otherwise fabulous place to stay for all the museums and literally across the street from a tube stop.",4,2018,07,07
129,Perfect for a stay in London,"The position was perfect for our visit to London. Extremely close to the  South Kensington station on thePicadilly Line that runs from Heathrow Airport. Plenty of London Transport bus options from right outside the hotel.
Attentive, helpful staff who made us feel like a name rather than a number. Beautiful furnished rooms with a feeling of luxury. Hotels often describe themselves as 'boutique' but this one truly was.
A delightful resturant in the basement serves excellent food.
Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2018,07,07
129,Booked executive room. So small,I booked an Executive Room for my trip to London with my adult daughter. The room was exceptionally small. Staff were lovely but unfortunately the hotel had no other options at this busy time. We had to check out and find a new hotel. We could not even open our suitcases in our teeny tiny room. Do your research and ask for room size when you book.,1,2018,07,05
129,Amazing hotel,"We absolutely loved our time at The Ampersand Hotel. The staff, the food, the location. Everything was perfect! The hotel is beautifully decorated as well. The proximity to the South Kensington tube station made getting around the city a breeze. We were sad to leave. ",5,2018,07,05
129,London Comfort,"The Ampersand offers great accommodation in a fantastic location. The beds are very comfortable, staff are helpful and provide excellent service. Rooms are smallish, but very well appointed. A very comfortable stay.",5,2018,07,04
129,Perfect Locaton,"Very stylish hotel about 5 minute walk to South Kensington tube station. Staff were attentive and flexible. 
Rooms range from very small to suites. The suites are large and include a microwave and small fridge. The price was a little bit more than we would normally pay but the location and quality of service made it worth paying a bit extra.The book for 3 nights and pay for 2 nights is an excellent deal.
The restaurant downstairs is also well worth a visit and the breakfast was fresh and healthy.
Will definitely stay again next time we are in London.",5,2018,07,02
129,An excellent hotel experience,"Great service, excellent staff. Clean, high quality & a very comfortable bed. My only complaint was that the room was surprisingly small. Otherwise it was a very enjoyable stay. It is located very near South Kensington tube station. ",5,2018,07,02
129,Excellent service,We were fortunate to have a special promotion for any excellent room. The service and hospitality were amazing and we always felt welcome as if it were home. The staff was very helpful in booking tours and giving us advice on transportation and restaurants. The Kensington neighborhood was perfect and the hotel is right across from South Kensington Station.,5,2018,07,01
129,Nice Boutique Hotel in Kensington ,The Ampersand is a nice boutique hotel in a great Kensington location. The rooms were very nicely decorated with lovely bath products and cool technology. The hotel was a little too foo-foo for our needs so we would most likely find a cheaper hotel in the area if we retuned. ,4,2018,07,01
129,A real gem in South Ken,"After investigating many properties in South Ken I settled on The Ampersand and was glad I did. The staff is outstanding to deal with and the property is wonderful. Extremely comfortable rooms that are in exceptional condition with top quality amenities. The hotel restaurant, Apero, has wonderful breakfasts although we didn't try the other meals but I'm sure they would be equally good. 

It's just steps away from the South Ken tube which made it very convenient for getting around the city and, of course, convenient for getting from LHR in an economical way. Hyde Park is a very short walk and Harrod's not much further. Wonderful cafe's and restaurants everywhere.

If you're looking for a unique boutique hotel consider this one. You'll be glad you did.",5,2018,07,01
129,Excellent boutique hotel !,Hotel located in a trendy area with lots of eateries and close to museums with the underground station just across the road. Also on a direct underground line from Heathrow airport. Mini bar snacks and drinks were complimentary in addition to tea and coffee facilities which was a lovely touch.,5,2018,06,30
129,Great hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel located close to many attractions and ideal access to public transportation. We especially enjoyed the many little extras that came with the room - heated bathroom floor, complimentary cell phone with international calling and internet and complementary water and soft drinks in the mini-fridge.",5,2018,06,30
129,excellent London hotel,"Ideal location next to South Kensington tube station. We had the pleasure of being upgraded to a suite which was excellent and included a lounge and small balcony.  Complimentary soft drinks available and excellent facilities including; kettle, toaster, nespresso machine and even a TV in the bathroom.The breakfast restaurant is very good with a great buffet selection or al la carte choices.
",5,2018,06,30
129,Nice Hotel with Excellent Location,"The hotel is located just a few steps from South Kensington tube station. 
There are some bus stops in front of the hotel and around the corner as well. 

If you are working or sightseeing in this area, I think this hotel would be a good choice. 

One thing I did not like very much was that because the bus stop is in front of the hotel, there is really no proper parking area.  
So when I arrived and left by a car, the driver had a trouble finding parking and dropping me off/ picking me up, which was bit of a hassle. 

Otherwise, this is a very nice hotel with very attentive staff. ",5,2018,06,28
129,Wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel! ,"We have stayed in this beautiful hotel , and in 3 different types of room as they are always fully booked. They are all with comfy beds and amenities!

All staff are really enthusiastic and paying attention to details.",5,2018,06,27
129,Nice place to stay,"Good location, friendly staff (specially hall porter), lovely suite with balcony, very quick room service,(the coffee was better -stronger- than during my last stay :)), restaurant with excellent food and good service. I'll come back and I  recommend this hotel.",4,2018,06,27
129,"Outstanding personalized service, attention to detail and luxury experience in the heart of Knightsbridge.","From the moment we booked, we were constantly engaged and assisted by staff, asking about our personal preferences, the reason for travel and any additional requirements we would like during our few days at the Ampersand Hotel. This remained consistent throughout our stay. Overall the hotel is fresh and luxurious. Public areas are bright and accessible with access to the rooms via stairs or elevator. The corridor to our room was fantastic, with art and decor reflective of the nearby museum and arts district. A great touch. Our room was spacious and very comfortable with all the essentials and some exceptional enhancements. The in-room tea/coffee making facilities, complemented by the free minibar were great for mornings and evenings. The room‚Äôs temperature control was easy and simple to use but we could also open a window to get fresh air if we chose to do so. The room came with a complimentary mobile phone for calls and internet access for the duration of our stay, which was super helpful for work and leisure as we bounced around London. The desk even had well thought out connections for mobile devices. The WI-FI bubble unique to each room was fantastic and ensured our devices and privacy were maintained without exposing us to a public network of any sorts. Our bathroom, complete with subway tiles was luxe and spacious. The in-floor heating, robes, large shower and quality toiletries were spectacular. We had a fantastic night‚Äôs sleep. The bed was super comfortable and pillows/covers ideal for a quality sleep in a very quiet room. Look for the signature rubber duck and the branded draw liners. We could not be more complimentary of the staff who were very engaging, helpful and most of all personally accommodating. We will be back.",5,2018,06,27
129,Incredible hotel,"I stayed here with mum mum for my birthday and could not have had a better trip. The hotel itself is beautiful, the room was super clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was immaculate. The staff were phenomenal - so friendly and attentive, and as soon as they knew it was my birthday they went out of their way to make it special, sending up a gorgeous plate of desserts and making sure we were happy. I'm so grateful - it was definitely a birthday to remember because of them! This was my second stay here and I would wholeheartedly recommend. I look forward to coming back!",5,2018,06,26
129,Whimsically charming tea in drawing rooms,"My daughter and I had a special science-themed tea in the Drawing Rooms of the Ampersand Hotel. It was very creative with moon cake, Jupiter and Saturn for dessert and escavated a chocolate dinosaur from a box full of dirt chocolate. Perfect for a young budding scientist or anyone wanting a whimsical afternoon treat. Traditional sandwiches and scones were served with condiments in non traditional  science-themed containers. It is a couple blocks from the Natiural History Museum; hence the theme. Service was excellent.",5,2018,06,26
129,Weekend Away,The service at this hotel is second to none and the bedrooms are wonderful. It has to be one of the best  beds I have ever slept in while away. The breakfast at the Apero restaurant has something for everyone and the A last Carte menu is not to be missed!,5,2018,06,26
129,Returning customers disappointed,We are a returning customers and we booked a room we‚Äôve previously had. The room we were given was actually for disabled guests and was rather small. There was no room to hang any of our clothes and we were staying more than one night. The view was also looking at a brick wall at the back of the hotel so there was no light going to it at all. We usually recommend the ampersand but I don‚Äôt think we shall be returning! ,2,2018,06,25
129,Ampersand Hotel,This was our second time staying at this hotel. They remembered us from the first time and took into consideration our request for a quiet room. The staff was friendly and helpful. Excellent location and wonderful stay.,5,2018,06,24
129,Excellent Hotel,"Could not have had a better visit.  Staff took care of all my travel needs and the location was great.  Close to museums, tube, and restaurants.  This hotel was close to all major tourist spots even with a few stops on the tub.  Staff provided me with detail maps and cell phone loaded with map app of the area.  Our room was perfect felt like home not a hotel room.  ",5,2018,06,24
129,Exquisite on every count,"Our stay at The Ampersand could not have been better. The accommodations are lovely, and  the attention from all staff from front desk to waiters, the best we've ever experienced. The high level of service and graciousness was particularly in evidence as we arrived with a seriously injured member of our party. Everything from doctor visits to last-minute car service arrangements was handled with efficiency and genuine concern. We could not have hoped for more and look forward to returning in better health! P.S. The Science Tea is a must!",5,2018,06,22
129,Great place,"Fantastic location, very nice building, 30 m from South Ken Station, great staff, nice interior design, bedrooms are a bit small but very nice, fine amenities. Every time we go to London we stay at the Ampersand Hotel",5,2018,06,21
129,Great hotel in a great location,We were very happy with our stay here. Liked the design/look of the hotel and the location was very convenient- near public tranportation but also a walkable distance to many attractions and restaurants. Would recommend!,4,2018,06,21
129,Friendly staff - great location!,We had a wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel - what a great location a block away from the South Kensington tube station.  Easy to get there on the Picadilly line from Heathrow and only two stops from the theater district.  Staff was extremely helpful - anytime we needed anything it was promptly delivered.  The bed was super comfortable and we liked having two sinks in the bathroom.  Housekeeping service very efficient and they serviced the room twice per day.  Small but nice gym on site open 24/7. We ate in one night with room service and the steak was delicious.  We will definitely stay here again!,5,2018,06,20
129,Consistently excellent !,I have stayed at the Ampersand on a number of occasions both traveling on business as well as with my family. It is my and my family‚Äôs favorite hotel in London - home away from home! The service and quality is consistently excellent! ,5,2018,06,20
129,"Great, until it wasn't","My wife and I stayed at The Ampersand for a short honeymoon in June 2018. Our initial impressions of the hotel were fantastic: check-in was extremely efficient and personable; the room, while small, was tastefully decorated and maximised the space available; room service was prompt and professional and the hotel is centrally located, which made it easy to get out and about to explore London. However, on day three of our stay, after a long day of sightseeing, the last thing either of us wanted was a knock on our door at 10:30pm from a staff member seeking access to our bathroom. Apparently, some aspect of the toilet plumbing was leaking which was causing problems in the bathroom below our own. While these things happen and are beyond the control of the hotel, the manner in which the matter was handled vexed us. We were offered the options of staying in our current room and not using the toilet (?!), or moving to another room.  Obviously, we choose the latter.  While we technically got a halfhearted apology from the staff member in question, their body language conveyed hostility at their inconvenience with little to no acknowledgement of our own.  We were given a scant ten minutes to repack our belongings and moved to an adjacent room that seemed to be directly connected to /within hearing distance of the lift shaft as you could quite discernably hear the elevator every time it was in motion, something which kept us both awake. While I appreciate that a better room might have been unavailable, I was less than impressed by the downgrade. Having experienced inconveniences in 5 Star hotels before, (again, I appreciate that things can, and do, go wrong), I expected some gesture of redress, however small.  None was forthcoming. I was even more surprised when the matter remained completely unacknowledged at check out, despite my mentioning our having to change room.  The Ampersand is a beautiful hotel and by and large the staff were really lovely, which is what made this situation so surprising and frustrating.  Though the plumbing leak was not the fault of the hotel‚Äôs, neither was it ours, and the fact that it went unacknowledged exacerbated the disturbance to our stay.

129,Great Customer Service,"Would recommend this hotel in a heart beat.  Provided many little touches that made the experience wonderful.  Provided a  local cell phone to use free of charge.  Mini bar and snacks were included.  Clean, beautiful rooms.  Used the buy 2 night get a one night free special.  Outstanding.  Close to subway station.  Surrounding area was near museums and plenty of  small local dining choices.    ",5,2018,06,20
129,Great location,"I stayed at the Ampersand for 7 nights. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The location was excellent with the tube bring across the street, big bus pick up and taxis in front of the hotel. There are many great restaurants surrounding the hotel. The room was clean, comfortable, & stylish. After long days exploring, this hotel was a quiet refuge away from all the crowds, but just a short tube ride from attractions. The neighborhood was quiet and safe to walk around at night. The bed was comfortable & I was thankful for the complimentary daily mini bar refills. We used the game room 2 nights to play board games/ ping pong. ",5,2018,06,20
129,So much potential but lacked customer care and service,A beautifully appointed hotel with fab decor but a lack of good customer care and service which does not in any way reflect the 5 star status. Very disappointing for something that is not difficult to achieve,3,2018,06,19
129,perfect hotel in a perfect location,"We spent 5 nights at the Ampersand - it has great style, a lovely Mediterranean restaurant, and very helpful staff.  The superior room was a little small but quiet and extremely well appointed with a kettle, french press, and fridge stocked with juice, soda and milk for your coffee or tea.  The location is hard to beat, around the block from the V&A and next to the South Kensington tube - which is also replete with shops and restaurants including, just a couple blocks away, the Bibendum and Conrans.  We will definitely be staying there again the next time we are in London.",5,2018,06,18
129,Best Choice in London,The Ampersand is definitely the best choice when traveling to London. If you are looking for a place to replenish the energy and to be well served with kindness and a very nice staff this is the place. The quality of our stay was extremely good because of them.,5,2018,06,17
129,The Ampersand Hotel,"We just came back from our 4 night stay at the Ampersand. The hotel staff deserves  acknowledgement for their courtesy, knowledge, attention to needs, and overall professionalism. First, at the very last minute they helped us with transportation from the airport when our original car service cancelled, second they were able to provide us with an early check in after an overnight flight, and third at each contact asked us what or if we needed anything. Every recommendation they made was outstanding. I never felt anything but genuine caring that we should have the best hotel customer experience with them. Our quiet room was a generous size for Europe, with a lovely bathroom. The shower was large with a rain head and separate hand held. The bath products were upscale and they even provided eye makeup remover. The robes and slippers were nice. The mini bar was complimentary, and there was a coffee press, much preferred, rather than the usual keurig. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning, which was delicious. The restaurant was busy in the evening, but did not try it. It looked like they also served high tea in the separate reception room. The South Kensington location was very convenient. The tube station was a block away, the area is lovely with plenty of restaurants of from casual cafes to trendy and upscale all within walking distance. There is also a very nice shopping area a few blocks away with high end designer and other fun shops to browse. The Natural history Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum are all a 5 minute walk. We plan to come back and will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,16
129,Wonderful hotel,"I have stayed in this area on four previous occasions, mostly in nearby serviced apartments (of which there are many), and have walked past this hotel umpteen times. On this visit, I was able to obtain a good rate at Hotel Ampersand and I was so pleased I did. I doubt that I would ever stay anywhere else again in London on business.

It's a great location close to the tube and buses, with a taxi stand right outside the building. The hotel is charming and beautifully decorated. The room I had was great. The bathroom and walk-in rain shower were terrific. The staff were just wonderful. The breakfast was delicious - I was going to just buy something out the shops every morning, but it was so good and such good value, that I went there every morning. The restaurant was good. The gym was small but more than adequate. I really could not fault the hotel and, as I said, I doubt that I would stay anywhere else in future when on business. (Travelling privately is always a different decision). 

Special mention must be made of the reception staff on my arrival. I arrived 15 minutes before official check-in time and just off yet another dreaded 25 hour plus flight, while my room wasn't ready they could see I was exhausted and immediately offered me a complimentary coffee/tea/sandwich while I waited.",5,2018,06,16
129,Boutique hotel with sizeable rooms,"I arrive direct from 24hrs flight to the Ampersand. It is boutique beautiful. The flora and fauna decorations are clever and stylish.

Room size is very London for the price.

Locations is 40mt walk to South Kensington stations and a couple of blocks over to Kings road in Chelsea.

Staff are very polite and enthusiastic and really worked hard for the customer.

Lounge -/ waiting area was very popular for high tea, refreshments and small meetings. It is best to ring and reserve a table. 

Cleanliness - 10/10

Wifi- free and was stronger in the rooms, but for international travellers there where some blockages.

Recommend - yes
",4,2018,06,16
129,Boutique Hotel in a fantastic location,"After an overnight flight and 2+ hours getting out of Heathrow and onto the Tube, we arrived out of South Kensington and across the street to our hotel. They were wonderful upon greeting us, and offered us an available room, or we could wait for a room on a higher floor. We were exhausted, so I took them up on the available room on the ground floor. It was lovely, small, but lovely. I knew on booking we would be in a smaller room, so I was very ok with it. They did acknowledge on check in that we were celebrating our anniversary, but that was the first and last acknowledgment. 

They were always happy to greet us when we arrived back at the hotel, and offered a quick hand or suggestion when we asked. 

The toiletries were fantastic, and housekeeping kept our room tidy, and the minibar re-stocked. 

The Handy mobile phone was just that, handy. We used it as we toured London and it was a great amenity. 

This is a hotel and location that I will highly recommend to any friends and family. We didn't try the tea or onsite restaurant, but had no trouble finding food or coffee in the area.",5,2018,06,15
129,Small Luxury Hotel.,Recently we stayed here for a few days & found it to be just that - a Small Luxury Hotel.  Staff were very helpful & always bright & cheery.  Location was excellent with the main area of South Kensington within walking distance.  It was full of restaurants so plenty of choices.  There was a bus stop right outside which was great for the Hop On Hop Off Bus & train station over the road.  Would love to stay there again.,5,2018,06,13
129,Stayed on completion of Cruise,Beautiful Hotel central to everything. Beautifully decorated and the staff were very attentive. There was no waiting to check in and a room was made available straight away . The rooms however are quite small but we were able to settle in ok . Not too much storage but for a couple of nights all ok. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2018,06,13
129,Very Nice!!,Great service and property.  Staff was very helpful at checkin and providing information for sightseeing and scheduled a private car service to the airport when leaving which worked out very well.  Very clean room and great lication!!  Would do this again!!!,5,2018,06,12

Fantastic location in South Kensington close to museums, three train lines and a multitude of restaurants and cafes. The hotel itself is very comfortable with staff helpful and the rooms very stylish.",5,2018,06,09
129,An excellent hotel!,We arrived earlier than check in off a 10 hour flight and were told our room was not ready. We told them we also had a tour scheduled for noon and they gave us an early check in. The hotel staff were wonderful. The hotel itself is a two minute walk to the train station which was the most efficient form of transportation. I was extremely pleased with this hotel and will definitely go back.,5,2018,06,09
129,Amazing stay at the Ampersand!,"This hotel is 5 star from check in, to the unique tea at the drawing room, to the spotless rooms, and the most comfortable beds! The hotel is beautifully decorated, and is very central, and it is easy to get around the rest of London. ",5,2018,06,09
129,Great boutique hotel in vibrant area,"Beautiful boutique hotel in lovely area of Kensington.  Only major issue was an a/c problem which made sleeping uncomfortable as windows don‚Äôt open except a few inches.  Closet space was a bit tight.  No drawers. Bed very comfortable and room was spotless. 
Staff was very attentive to any issue or request and very friendly. Assisted with booking local attractions.  Nice bar & restaurant downstairs.

129,"Great location, comfy, quirky rooms","We stayed for our honeymoon, and had an enjoyable time at the Ampersand. The service is helpful and friendly, the rooms are clean and comfy, and the beds were so nice! Perfect location right next to the tube for easy access to most all of London, and great restaurants just steps away. The bus stops right in front of the hotel as well, so this is ideal for not wasting time walking to transportation. Check out Muriel‚Äôs Kitchen for lovely scones with clotted cream and a great English breakfast!",4,2018,06,08
129,Quaint with nice toiletries!,"I stayed at the Ampersand for 1 night.  While I found the room and washroom very small (even for London), it was tasteful and charming.  The building inside is pretty and charming.  In the room, the bed was comfortable and the washroom impressed me and the L'Occitane toiletries were a wonderful treat!

This hotel is within 5 minutes walk of the Natural History Museum and 2 minutes from the metro.  There are many bars and restaurants in the area.",4,2018,06,07
129,Convenient and Nice Botique Hotel,"This hotel was the selection by our tour company as the first night stay of the tour. We added 3 more nights here before the tour start so were there for 4 nights. The front desk claimed that we were in an upgraded room - I hate to see what a standard room was because it was tiny but comfortable except for the bathroom. Basically, it was about the same size of the New York City hotels we have stayed at. You had to squeeze in by the commode before you can shut the bathroom door. Apparently, bathrooms with tubs do not have this problem but we elected to remain since we like easily accessible glass wall showers. Also, the shower drain was clogged, causing the shower and bathroom to flood. Finally fixed after two visits by maintenance. 

On the positive side, the common areas were nice and there was a nice bar/restaurant in the basement. Also, the location could not be beat. It was less than a block away from the Picadilly subway station and there were a number of nearby restaurants/pub that were pretty good. It is also 2-3 blocks from the Natural History and Victoria & Albert Museums and about 6 blocks from Kensington Gardens.",4,2018,06,05
129,JustOneNight,Great location and beautiful hotel - I really enjoyed my stay!  One night was just not long enough.  The Drawing Room is lovely and the bar cool.  The staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly.  Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2018,06,05
129,Wish I could have stayed longer!,"Only stayed for 1 night as a layover, but was honestly one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had.  The staff was exceptionally helpful in setting up a ride from the airport and a room upgrade.  Their restaurant and bar were excellent.  Everything was very clean, efficient and aesthetically pleasing.  I just wish it had been more than a layover so I could fully enjoy their bar, games room and well equipped gym.  I travel for a living and am too often disappointed with some hotels; the Ampersand has set a new ceiling in how good a hotel can be.",5,2018,06,04

Such an excellent feature for a tourist.

Restaurant-Tea is AMAZING and definitely a must do. The Apero restaurant served a delicious breakfast and dinner

Location-in a beautiful, safe neighborhood in South Kensington. Tube line very efficient and steps from the hotel. Wonderful shops and restaurants close by. Enjoyed Rocca and Toms Kitchen. Muriel‚Äôs and Bumpkin are not bad, but not wonderful.

129,A Week in London Perfect Location ,"South Kensington is the perfect neighborhood for me, and the Ampersand is the perfect place to stay. It is near the metro and plenty of great places to eat. Want to go for a run head down to the park. Muriels near the metro is a great place to grab a cuppa and something to eat in the morning before heading out. Near the V&A Museum as well as the Natural History there is always somewhere to go here. The metro is easy to navigate from here to anywhere in town as well. 

The rooms are not only lovely they are clean and not musty as is the entire hotel. The artwork around the hotel is fun and we loved it. Everyone working at the hotel is helpful as well and polite. It was a pleasure, I will be back.  ",5,2018,05,28
129,Really fine hotel in a super location,"This is an elegant small hotel in an excellent location convenient for central London.  South Ken is a vibrant and fascinating area.
The staff were extremely helpful.  Our room was compact and very well equipped.  We particularly liked the hotel's policy of not charging for extras such phone calls and the mini-bar.
The hotel is technologically advanced with contactless door locks, smart phones, touch sensitive a/c and heating controls, etc.  These might be somewhat daunting for some guests and we did have a minor issues with the a/c.
Would absolutely recommend The Ampersand.",4,2018,05,28

129,We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel recently on an overnight visit to London. It is a beautiful hotel and located across th,"We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel recently on an overnight visit to London. It is a beautiful hotel and located across the road from South Kensington tube station and so convenient for the museums and Royal Albert Hall.
On arrival we were offered a free upgrade to a Delux room from the Superior room.
We found the check in staff were lovely, indeed, any of the staff we met in the hotel were pleasant.
The room was beautiful. The bed was one of the nicest and most comfortable I have slept in.
We decided to have breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. I would give it only 3 stars at best. We ordered the meal within a few minutes of arrival, and our pots  of tea came promptly, and then we waited and waited. After more than 30 minutes I asked how much longer we would have to wait. The food arrived fairly promptly. My husband had the full English breakfast which was generally good although the toast had clearly been made some time before and was cold and difficult to cut. I had the Eggs Royale. The smoked salmon, poached eggs and hollandaise were very nice but they were delivered on a cold bread roll (it didn't look like a muffin) which had not been toasted apart from one corner which had been slightly burned. It was now about 45 mins since we entered the restaurant and so I forbore to return it. We refused to pay the service charge which was accepted without quibble.
I would love to stay in the Amperand Hotel again but would not consider eating there.",4,2018,05,17
129,Amazing!!,"Exceeded all of my expectations. Wonderful location, service and room. I wish I had more time. I will be back to explore the surroundings and enjoy the drawing room and library.

129,A home away from home,"It was our second stay at the Ampersand hotel and our original positive experience was reconfirmed. We like everything about this hotel: the location, the staff, all the facilities and in particular the extra services provided free of charge (drinks in the fridge, tea and coffee etc). It's like being at home.
",5,2018,05,13
129,Our favourite London hotel,As always we were very pleased to be back and made to feel most welcome by the professional and friendly team at the Ampersand. The hotel even makes a note of our favourite room and tries to place us there whenever possible. ,5,2018,05,12
129,Favourite hotel in London,"I have just returned from my fourth stay at the Ampersand and found it just as good as it was on my first visit four years ago.  The hotel has an excellent location just across the road from South Kensington tube station and is surrounded by museums and restaurants. It doesn't have a fancy glitzy lobby, just a small reception desk in a quiet elegant area.  The staff are very welcoming, friendly and helpful and the check in was fast and efficient.  The room was spacious and absolutely luxurious (we booked the 3 nights for the price of 2 offer), with an extremely comfortable bed, heated floor in the spacious bathroom, great selection of toiletries, bathrobes, comfortable seating and well provisioned hospitality tray.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope it won't be too long before I can visit again.",5,2018,05,12
129,Fantastic hotel,"The Ampersand Hotel was absolutely wonderful and If i return to London I would stay there again. I stayed at the Ampersand during a vacation with my mom. The decor of the hotel was chic and welcoming. The beds were comfortable, the amenities like heated bathroom floors, premiere toiletries, wifi, digital thermostat were all welcome. We stayed in a Deluxe room and had the perfect amount of Space. The Mini fridge that included excellent amenities like juice water and milk for your coffee was greatly appreciated. i did not use the complimentary cell phone for those lookin to save international data, but it was a nice touch. The staff was friendly and room service was excellent the two times we used it In addition the hotel is in a fantastic location with the tube and multiple bus stops around it. Walking distance from Royal Albert hall and tons of stores and restaurants right around it in case you don't want to journey out too far. Thank you for making my mom's first time in London a comfortable and enjoyable one!",5,2018,05,10
129,A terrific value!,"A beautiful, classy hotel in a superb part of town for an excellent price. The staff are efficient, friendly, and professional. Will continue to stay there in the future - this is the best hotel in London for the price!!",5,2018,05,09
129,Birthday celebration,"Came to London to celebrate my 70th birthday--chose Ampersand because of features and location near V&A , tube and other museums. Visited V&A, Strawberry Hill, Westminster Abbey and Sir John Soane's Museum and the Chelsea Physick Garden. Had great meals at Apero twice.",5,2018,05,09
129,"Lovely hotel with great, convenient location in South Kensington London.","Great location.  Wonderfully appointed (albeit very, very small) and comfortable room.  Staff was helpful and excellent all around. Driver service was arranged to and from Heathrow and charged to room, which may things very easy for arrival and departure.",5,2018,05,09
129,Very best service and location ,"Charming hotel with very small euro style modern clean and comfortable rooms ..

High tea dinner or just fall out onto the street to all the fabulous restaurants in south Kensington... seconds away from south Kinsington tube station , V A museum , etc etc ",4,2018,05,08
129,Excellent service with their kind and helpful staff,"This was my second stay at the Ampersand Hotel. I highly recommend
 this hotel because the service
 we get is excellent and the staff is always very kind to help the guests during their stay. Breakfast is also served with rich choices.
I will sure choose  The Ampersand for my next trips.

129,Amazing stay so far!!,We are currently on night 3 of our 6 night stay and we wanted to offer this interim review. We could not be happier with our beautiful room in this divine boutique hotel. We have a Suite on level 4 and its perfect. But the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Nothing is too much trouble and we are grateful for this level of service. Will write a full review after our stay! ,5,2018,05,06
129,Great place to stay in South Kensington,Location is great. Kensington park close by. Tube a few steps away. Many restaurants and caf√© around the hotel. Good location to get to other places in the city. Direct tube line from Heathrow Airport. Rooms are comfortable but small.,4,2018,05,06
129,A great sleep,Great location and always a good nights sleep in quiet rooms with really comfortable beds. Close to transport and restaurants - can also walk to many places of interest. We also used the gym - which although small - was clean and well equipped .,5,2018,05,06
129,What a Gem,"We loved our stay at The Ampersand! We would highly recommend it when staying in London. The rooms are beautifully appointed, Lounge and restaurant excellent. South Kensington is a great location with easy access to tube, nice wide walking paths and pedestrian areas. Great restaurants, bars and the wonderful V&A.",5,2018,05,03
129,Perfect for a mum + son (6 yrs) long weekend,"My son and I traveled in from Heathrow and it was nice and easy with just one train to South Kensington Tube stop and from there, just a minutes walk away to the hotel. There are some stairs at the tube stop (about 10 steps) so I was pleased that our bags were not too heavy. 

The room was great and my son loved the bath with the tv screen. He also loved having the breakfast delivered. 

The staff were amazing. They gave him a car and were always friendly and attentive. They treated him like an equal guest. 

It was the same at the Apero restaurant with a lovely kid's menu (same as the kid's room service menu). The staff at the restaurant were also wonderful. We also had the Science High Tea. While my son didn't eat most of his, he did enjoy the bits and bobs that came with it and the dry ice feature. I had the high team while he picked what he wanted from an array of cakes. 

Apart from easy reach from Heathrow, it was also a quick walk to the Science/Natural History museums and we took two buses to the Zoo which gave us a nice London dbl decker experience. 

I would not hesitate to return for another of our visits.",5,2018,05,03
129,What a wonderful hotel!,"From the time I arrived to the time I checked out I was taken care of.  My room was lovely and comfortable and the hotel itself is so close to tube, shops, restaurants and museums. What a quaint, very English hotel.  I loved it!",5,2018,05,03
129,Very good,a little bit perplex at the arrival. At the reception it was not clear whether I paid before and the staff at the reception was checking if I should leave a deposit. I found the above a bit odd. A part from the above; all the staff were very nice and so was the room.,4,2018,05,02
129,Suite Stay,"Nice, small boutique hotel. Stayed in a suite which was comfortable but very small. The bed was super comfortable and the ability to sleep excellent as the fifth floor was very quiet. Some of the staff, such as housekeeping were excellent. Others did not follow through on some requests. The location is excellent and really was the top attraction for me to stay there and return. ",4,2018,05,01
129,Good location and service,"The service and common areas were very good but the rooms were not exactly charming; not too much design effort, very poor lighting and rather inconvenient bathrooms. A good value considering the location; many restaurants nearby and a taxi line and underground right outside the hotel are a plus.",3,2018,05,01
129,Excellent,"Top notch finishes, environment was super nice. Everything you want in a small luxury hotel. Shower was small, but everything else excellent. Beveled subway tile in the bathrooms was nice. Convenient to south Kensington tube stuff. Convenient to excellent restaurants ",5,2018,05,01
129,London Ampersend,"3 days in London
Everyone at the Ampersend Hotel was welcoming, warm and ready to help and answer any question.
The room was great even if it was a little bit narrow....
at the final it was a great experience !",5,2018,04,30
129,Great location,"First time in London so this area and hotel were perfect. Staff were friendly, service was very good. Had a couple of minor technical issues in my room which were attended to promptly.  Apero restaurant for breakfast was excellent. Plenty of choice and coffee was good. I had tea in the afternoon in the lounge and again, it was a lovely way to relax in the afternoon. Plenty of cafes and restaurants near by. South Kensington tube across the road and the tube was super easy to use.",5,2018,04,30
129,Great Location in London,This was our first stay at this hotel and we found it to be a great location with excellent service from all staff. The rooms were well maintained and  comfortable. The breakfast was great with good choices for everyone.,5,2018,04,29
129,Great boutique hotel in South Kensington,"This boutique hotel is a great option for Kensington  - really close to the tube, visitor attractions  and numerous great dining options. The rooms are small but well laid out with nice extra touches, good products in the bathroom  etc., We had brunch in the basement restaurant - great Italian dishes and bottomless Prosecco. great service and really good food. Would recommend highly",5,2018,04,29
129,More than i expected ,"Great hotel in a perfect location, steps from South Kensington Station.

Good to say that it it Walking distance from most attractions in London, in a very Nice and elegant location.

It happened to be my birthday while staying there, so they Left a Nice note and cadies in my bed.

It was certainly a finding.",5,2018,04,29
129,Science Afternoon Tea - Amazing!,"I chose to visit here with my husband and dog (yes, they're very dog friendly!) for my husbands birthday. The booking process was extremely quick and confirmed with me shortly after I sent an enquiry email. The staff were very friendly and attentive and asked throughout if we were OK and if we needed anything else. Science Afternoon tea was fantastic - definetly get what you pay for, in lovely high quality surroundings. Will definitely return again. Thanks again for a great experience.",5,2018,04,29
129,South Kensington stay,"The hotel is efficient, quiet and very convenient to excellent local dining options. Especially like its' proximity to the Underground which makes for easy movement around central London. We would definitely recommend it basis location. ",5,2018,04,29
129,Ampersand - best hotel in London,"Ampetsand is the Best hotel in London. Great location, amazing staff, delicious food and homey feeling. Would certainly recommend to all my friends andon't family to stay here during their next stay in London!",5,2018,04,28
129,Hotel Stay,"Great Hotel service and location. The room was large, clean and comfortable. I really enjoyed the full English breakfast in the mornings. The tea room was really a great experience in the afternoons. The front desk was really helpful with getting us to understand how to get on the computer to get our flight boarding passes, when we were leaving.",5,2018,04,28
129,Best Boutique Hotel in Central London!,"Very attentive staff, fabulous Junior Suite, extremely comfortable bed, top class champagne, will definitely be back.  We had a problem with a bedside lightbulb but the Manager sent up a glass of champagne each and upgraded our room the next day - what service!  Fario you are the best!",5,2018,04,27
129,Another 1st class stay!,We just love this hotel and it's location in London.  Staff are fabulous and helpful without being intrusive.  Great for getting about on the buses and tubes and museums and shops within walking distance! ,5,2018,04,25
129,A wonderful hotel in South Kensington,"I am about to book for a second time in the last 18 months. My last stay was in March 2017. I could not fault a thing. Room was excellent and very quiet. All staff were very friendly and helpful  - extra luggage was abled to be stored when I went to Iceland and airport transfer all organised for me. I needed to have an emergency dental appointment and the front desk organised an appointment for me within the hour at a dentist around the corner.
I am looking forward to my stay this coming January.",5,2018,04,25
129,A little gem,"A great little gem in the perfect location (South Kensington near all the museums etc) literally 2 mins walk from the tube and buses. Great and interesting decor, rooms are based on nature themes, the deluxe studio (there are only three) is beautiful and highly recommended (with a freestanding bathtub in the main room my 9 year old son was in his element - being able to bath and watch cartoons...) Nice touches include L'Occitane bath products, heated bathroom floors and a phone on the house to carry with you around the city to look up activities and venues. But the highlight is the staff - unfailingly helpful and even fun with my son (he appreciated the soccer chat and the gift of a toy black cab). Front of house were particularly great. Only niggles: very creaky floors above you (but those beds were so comfortable you soon forgot) and turndown could be earlier but otherwise a stay that could not be faulted!",4,2018,04,25
129,Wonderful Staff,"Hotel in South Ken very close to tube station, so excellent to get from Heathrow to Central London.  The rooms are very small and it would have been better to have a slightly smaller bed without more room.  The stay was made by the staff who could not have been more accommodating!",4,2018,04,25
129,Bit disappointing. ,"We booked this through the SLH website and despite calling 3 days before to confirm everything was correct and being assured all was in order, check-in was a bit of a mess with exactly the issue I tried to head off by calling and confirming everything and being assured everything was correct happened anyway. This was very annoying. 

Other than that, the room was very small, very comfy bed and it was nicely a appointed room but very very small. Continental breakfast was included in our room rate and this was ok, the coffee was good. The location to an underground station is very convenient. 

Although the staff were nice and very helpful, All in all I was bit disappointed with our stay here. ",3,2018,04,24
129,Great stay in London,"The hotel is cute and comfortable. Front desk staff were extremely friendly and efficient. Location is awesome too -- literally a stone throw away from the tube, and within walking distance of some great shops, restaurants, and Hyde Park. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,24
129,Perfect!,"Absolutely no complaints about this hotel! üëçüèºüëçüèº. Staff, room, bathroom, cleanliness, and location are excellent. Will definitely stay in this hotel again on my next trip to London, and worth telling friends about this hotel.",5,2018,04,24
129,Wonderful,"Marvellous find. Delighted to have room upgrade and glass of champagne on arrival. We'd previously stayed round the corner and decided for various reasons to,use Ampersand - very happy that we did. Attention to detail was first rate and we will certainly be back.",5,2018,04,23
129,First visit....,"Lovely hotel, beautiful decor and room was lovely and comfortable with good facilities. Staff are very helpful and friendly. We also attended a childrens birthday party here in the afternoon and it was great. We will definitely go back! :-)))",5,2018,04,23
129,Great hotel in great location!,"Very nice butique hotel in great location across the tube station ( subway/metro). Less then 10 minutes walk to Kensigton Park, museums, Harrod‚Äôs. Rooms not big, but very clean, with very nice design. Hotel‚Äôs restaurant is pricy, so we enjoyed the food from outside restaurants ( there are plenty of them). Also across the hotel are Illy coffee shop, Starbucks, and few other organic food places with super tasty foods, that makes it very convent in the morning!",5,2018,04,22
129,A few days in London,"Although I've enjoyed staying at the Ampersand before, I found the room this time to be absolutely tiny and extremely dark.  I had asked for a quiet room, which it was, but I felt as though I was in a dungeon.
Front desk staff were quite friendly and efficient and one of the barmen was hilarious.",3,2018,04,21
129,wonderful hotel,"Everything is perfect. Clean room, comfortable bed, free minibar, nice bathtub, delicious Apero lunch, friendly staff. South Kensington has a lot of museums and cafes, shops.I want to stay in this hotel again.",5,2018,04,20
129,Love this hotel!,"Just stayed in this hotel while working on London. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful! Rooms are a nice size, great bathroom and loved the decor! The service was the best I‚Äôve come across, can‚Äôt wait to come back! The breakfast was also deliciousüòã Thank you everyone at the Ampersand, in particular Andre, who was so helpful:-)",5,2018,04,20
129,Amazing hotel,I really like the hotel. The staff is very friendly and help all the time. The rooms and the location are amazing. It is the 4rd time in the hotel and we never had a bad experience. 1 minute from the tube station.,5,2018,04,20
129,Fantastic Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for the fourth time yesterday, and it was just as amazing as always. The location is perfect - away from the racket of central London yet so close that it feels like you are in the middle of everything. The hotel is right next to South Kensington station, which is right on the Circle/District and Piccadilly lines, offering direct access to almost all of central London (Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus etc...). The rooms are also great - the bathrooms have heated floors, the beds are soft and the hotel provides you with a smartphone that has complementary 4G to take with you around town.

I would also like to personally thank a member of staff - Mustafa - who was very helpful, and gave us a complementary room upgrade after I decided I would be staying the night as well (I was not originally meant to). He represents the excellent service you can expect to receive at the Ampersand. This is definitely my go-to London hotel!",5,2018,04,17
129,Neighborhood gem,"We stayed at Amersand for 3 night at the end of our 10 days in London.  The hotel was fantastic.  I would highly recommend it.  Great location, only 1/2 a block from the South Kensington tube station, many restaurant varieties near by. The service was outstanding and attentive.  Nice feature with the hotel is they provide a cell phone at no charge for each room.  This is very helpful is you are managing a roaming data plan.  The room sizes are a bit small, beyond that highly recommend.",5,2018,04,15
129,Just okay...,"I recently stayed in this hotel during my honeymoon and birthday trip to London. I wrote a note on my booking as well as sent an separate email to the hotel directly hoping that they would recognize this is a special trip for my husband and I. However, the hotel did nothing upon arrival. Initially we were given a small attic room on the top floor, then we requested to be moved and got the same room category that we booked. No welcome amenity in room, no birthday surprise... the hotel didn't feel like a 5-star hotel, it's more like a 4 start boutique hotel.  Location was great - it's right across the street from the tube. We were on Floor 1 with high ceiling and a bit of the noise from the street.",2,2018,04,13
129,The perfect place to stay,"I always stay at The Ampersand when I am in London for business. It is convenient to the Tube, restaurants and close to museums when I get a couple of hours to indulge myself. I highly recommend staying there for the quality of the room, the restaurant, gym and high quality service. I booked the 3 nights for the price of 2 deal twice. So I had 6 nights for the price of 4. Excellent value.",5,2018,04,13
129,"Stained, thread bare and views of duct work","Having had poor experience of hotels in London I chose to go all out and booked this highly reviewed and expensive hotel, this became a mistake.  

The boutique style is nice but the low level lighting hides a multitude of sins, around the bed the wallpaper was strained with residue liquid splatter from previous guests (photo), table tops and draw fronts also demonstrate a history from previous guests. Around the room wallpaper was peeling away and where pieces haven't been joined properly brown stains are visible.

Having booked via a major global agent who was offering special treatment and upgrades I was shocked to find no such thing was offered, I was placed in a room with a small window looking out at industrial ducting. I had the miscomfort to be placed on the ground floor and all its coming and goings, this was compounded by the regular noise of the tube trains running below my room.  Knowing that other guests were offered complimentary upgrades and that availablity of such rooms remained throughout the night I feel they deliberately avoiding their commitments to this agent or targeting me.

Other issues included the poor speed WiFi and poor sound proofing between rooms.",1,2018,04,13
129,Accommodating,"The hotel has a great style but it is solidly complemented by genuine features - comfortable beds, big shower heads, quality breakfast (additional cost) quality toiletries, gym with free weights, the handy phone (free mobile google maps and internet mobile phone).  Definitely stay there again. ",5,2018,04,11
129,Excellent!!!,"The best hotell I stayed in :) The staff was wonderful. The rooms so beautiful and the hotel, Im in love :) Loved the location and the quiet rooms. The bed was excellent. You felt lika a queen every time you came in to the hotel. // √Ösa",5,2018,04,11
129,Excellent hotel with great location,"We had a wonderful stay at the Ampersand. 
Great hotel. 
Friendly staff. 
One block to underground train station. 
Items in minibar included. 
Umbrellas available for rainy days. 
Comfortable bed. 
Beautifully designed. 

We‚Äôd stay there again. 
",5,2018,04,10
129,What a gem!,"Only stayed here for one night but it was great! Very easy to find, right outside South Kensington tube stop and around the corner from museums. Its a beautiful old building with high ceilings so the room felt very airy. It wasn't particularly big but it didn't feel small and had everything you needed. Small desk to the side of the bed, TV mounted on the wall, mini fridge, safe, wardrobe, and a small kettle. It is beautifully decorated throughout, both in the hallway and the room. 

The only downside was that the floor was a bit creaky both in our room and above us, we could hear the floor creaking as the people above us walked about. I wish the window opened to be able to get fresh air, the room also had a little balcony that ran along the building,  but there was no access to it (for safety reasons I am guessing). Otherwise, it was a great hotel with friendly staff!",5,2018,04,10
129,A Fabulous Hotel in a Perfect Location,"I loved this hotel. It‚Äôs location is within steps of the South Kensington Underground stop. The neighborhood is charming, loaded with all kinds of restaurants and right by several museums and Kensington Gardens. 
I arrived in the morning after a long flight from the west coast. The staff worked to get my room ready as soon as possible so I could rest. 
The room was tight, but well appointed. The bed was amazingly comfortable. There is also complimentary water and soft drinks and juice in the refrigerator. Also complimentary is  of course tea but also coffee using a coffee press! And in the fridge? Fresh milk, replaced daily. 
Next, the bathroom. Great amenities, a heated floor, robes and a mirror that doesn‚Äôt fog with steam! What I will never understand about European hotel rooms is why there is never an outlet to plug in the blow dryer. I figured it out, and you will too.
The restaurant has great food for dinner as well as a bountiful breakfast buffet. I didn‚Äôt have tea upstairs mostly because it was full every day; make reservations. If I return to London I will not hesitate to book this wonderful hotel.",5,2018,04,09
129,Best of the small ones.,"If you like small luxury hotels this is the one to stay at in London. Neat and somewhat elegant and clean. Good service and nice staff. Well located, easy acess to tubes and lots and lots of restaurants in the area.",5,2018,04,08
129,Great London Boutique Hotel,A wonderful boutique hotel that is brilliantly located (about 30 seconds from South Kensington Station and very close to Hyde Park - which is great if you're runner like me) with very helpful staff and reasonably sized rooms (for London).  Would happily stay again.,5,2018,04,08
129,lovely hotel...but!,"Stayed here a couple of years ago so had high expectations.  Unfortunately our room was not the best (401) although the bathroom was massive (modified for disabled use) the bedroom was tiny and very cramped, the only mirror was on the front of the tiny wardrobe which was against the curtains at the window making it unusable, there was no hanging space for anything longer than a t-shirt.  Also had to call housekeeping immediately on arrival as the toilet seat required cleaning. On the plus side great location lovely decor, staff pleasant enough. Would stay here again but would be particular about what room we accept.",4,2018,04,07
129,"Beautiful hotel, perfectly located.","Beautifully decorated hotel with thoughtful touches in the room (big, fluffy robe and slippers, complimentary refreshments, L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries etc) Warm, friendly staff and delicious food.  The Ampersand is a ",5,2018,04,06
129,"Splendid hotel, fantastic location","Excellent, comfy rooms with l'occitane toiletries in the bathroom. The bathroom floor is heated, but guests also have slippers and bathrobe. The bed and pillows are super. Free soft drinks and water. 

Wifi: no password in the reception area, password needed in the room (quite laborious the process, though - one needs to get the wifi credentials via the TV. It could be simplified)

Breakfast not included. Different choices. Very good quality and reasonably priced. Excellent service. 

Reception also very good. Efficient and polite.

In light of the foregoing, I highly recommend this hotel. The price range is quite high, but it does match the quality of service guests enjoy.",5,2018,04,03
129,Like coming home,Been in London sooooo many times for both business and pleasure and coming to the Ampersand is like coming home. The staff always remembers me and as I book with the SLH app I get complimentary breakfast and a glass of champagne when I arrive. Location is great üëçüèª ,5,2018,04,02
129,Great hotel,"fantastic hotel, great location friendly staff, loved the fresh milk in the room, along with the selection chocolates on our first night ,nice touch.will definitely stay here again. Will recommend this hotel wether for business or pleasure ",5,2018,04,01
129,Still the best,"Joining three concerts in a row at Royal Albert Hall there is no better place to stay. Quiet room, lovely breakfast, friendliness everywhere. And thank god unlimited hotel umbrellas... No better place for writing postcards than The Drawing Room. Recommendation!",5,2018,04,01
129,Great location and amenities,"The Ampersand is in a perfect location for sightseeing and shopping in London. We arrived from Heathrow and the South Kensington station was very easy to reach. The room itself was comfy and quiet, even though it overlooked a busy street. I sleep lightly and didn't hear a thing. The only thing is the lack of mirror outside the bathroom.  It's hard to dry your hair without one (the makeup mirror is too small for this purpose). Otherwise, everything was perfect! ",5,2018,03,26
129,you are in perfect hands,"a wonderful stay, made all the more so by the incredible staff .... their only considerations is clearly the comfort and well being of their guests ...... yes, while i was staying at the hotel, the staff made it patently obvious that i was in their wonderful care.",5,2018,03,26
129,Lovely hotel in great location,"Stayed with my family for a trip to the capital. Absolutely fabulous location for visiting the Science, Natural History & V&A museums. Friendly staff. Smallish rooms but very clean. Lacking in space in the bathroom for toiletries (only a minor issue though)! Comfy bed. Could hear guests in room above walking around but didn‚Äôt hear any other neighbour noise. Would definitely return.",4,2018,03,24
129,My favorite hotel in London,"I‚Äôve stayed at the ampersand twice now and I can safely say it‚Äôs my favorite hotel in London. The location is amazing and it‚Äôs quite easy to get there by taking the tube from Heathrow. The beds are SO comfortable and I love that all the soft drinks and juices in the minibar are complimentary, what a nice touch! The coffee in room is a double serving French press which also feels SO luxurious. The gym is very small but does the job if you need to get a quick workout in during your travels. I ate at the restaurant the night I arrived in as nothing else in the area was open and it was pretty good. All of the staff at the hotel are so warm and inviting and truly make you feel like it is your home away from home. Highly recommended! ",5,2018,03,24
129,Fantastic as always!,"Just spend two nights at The Ampersand hotel and as always it was lovely. I have stayed in a few different hotels but after staying at the Ampersand a couple of years ago I always stay here. The atmosphere is very chilled. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but beautifully decorated with everything you need and if there is something that isnt there that you need I‚Äôm sure they would get it for you. Breakfast is great and reasonably priced if not included. I am a Gym bunny so using the quiet, perfectly equipped gym is a bonus. Location is great for the tube and museums and only a quick walk to Kensington gardens and Hyde park. Overall I can‚Äôt imagine why I would stay anywhere else whilst in London . 
",5,2018,03,23
129,I just love it!,"Over the last 20 years I have been to an endless number of hotels in London but since I discovered the Ampersand a year ago and I don't even look somewhere else. Been here now about 10 times and I just love it. Sweet little oasis. Nice neighborhood. Great service, not four-seasons like, more working in the background but very helpful. I'll be back for sure!",5,2018,03,23
129,Lovely albeit small room.,The small details enhanced out stay. Small bottle of milk for tea. A welcome card on bed and heated bathroom floor. A very well thought out small room. Staff were great although we were only there for 11 hours.,5,2018,03,22
129,Wonderful stay at the Ampersand!,We had excellent service throughout and were very happy with our choice. Perfect location too. Staff were highly attentive and we loved the d√©cor. We had breakfast both days in the Apero restaurant and it was fantastic.,5,2018,03,22
129,Very nice facilities with some added perks,"Very nice room, design, and furniture. Heated floors and blackout curtains were great. Extremely convenient to South Kensington tube station. Only complaint was being able to hear water pipes in the room somewhat regularly. Not loud enough to wake us up, but still very noticeable. Overall amazing",5,2018,03,19
129,Definitely a hidden jewel!,"Without any reservations, I would recommend The Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington as a wonderful place to stay while visiting London. We had never stayed here before but will always stay here when we visit London again. The staff is superb....very reliable, helpful, cordial, and accommodating.   The facility is pristine clean, whimsical, and one not to be missed.  It is conveniently located within 5 minutes of the Tube stop and many fine small eating establishments. For sure this hotel is a hidden jewel.    ",5,2018,03,18
129,Fabulous stay,"My daughter and I had the perfect getaway. From the moment we arrived till checkout. Very friendly staff, small but clean, comfortable well appointed rooms. The hotel was a 2 min walk from South Kenisngton Tube and a few minute walk to several Museums. It was the ideal location. Will definitely stay again when we return to London!",5,2018,03,17
129,Great!,"We stayed at The Ampersand twice - when we first arrived in London and at the end of our three-week U.K. visit. 

It's a very nice, clean, convenient hotel. The hotel staff was great and they went out of their way to make sure our visit was special. 

I would happily stay there again. If I had one minor complaint, it would be that the restaurant servers were a little surly.",5,2018,03,15
129,Not Quite Luxury But Pleasant Nonetheless,"Ideal location with tasteful interior design and reasonable prices. The L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries and heated bathroom floors were nice touches, as was the incredibly comfortable bed. Service was friendly too, albeit slightly perfunctory. The staff immediately fixed our safe upon complaint and were readily available for concierge support. 

Downsides: we found the room noisy, not from street noise but from what sounded like internal rumblings of housekeeping and pipes; the room was spatially inefficient, with an armchair in the darkest corner of a hallway (nobody in their right mind would ever sit there); room service food quality could be improved upon; and when booking through Tablet, I was reassured that they'd provide a special birthday treat for my husband, which we never did receive. 

If you need to be within the south Kensington neighborhood, this is a solid, comfortable choice. That said, there's plenty of neighboring competition so it really depends on your travel priorities.",3,2018,03,14
129,Excellent location,"Stayed on a solo trip at The Ampersand for 5 nights in February-March 2018 in a deluxe room as other reviews had mentioned the single rooms were a bit tight.  With the 3 for 2 promo, the deluxe room actually turned out cheaper than the single room anyway.  Service was excellent.  I was initially in a top floor room but had to change due to the cigarette smoke from rooms next door (likely people were smoking in their balconies since this was a non-smoking hotel).  The staff were very accommodating and transferred me to a room at the front of the hotel.  Since the windows were double glazed, there was absolutely no problem about street noise.  It was also such a nice street view.  Breakfast was good, and I had breakfast there twice when I was too lazy to go out early, but if you do feel like going out, there are lots of cafes around that are better value for money.  The room itself was divine, lovely bed, great shower and well-lit sink area perfect for doing make-up.  Best of all was location - walking distance to the V and A and Natural History Museums and a few meters from South Kensington Station, which is on the same tube line for Heathrow Airport AND Kings Cross-St. Pancras (I came by Eurostar).  Felt very safe walking around the area coming ""home"" from the West End shows I saw.",5,2018,03,14
129,"Best hotel in London, recommend","Everything with our stay was soooo good. The staff is so helpfull, the hotell is really fresh and beautiful and the location is the best! One big + was the beds, we sleept like kings and queens. I will stay here again next time I'm in London.",5,2018,03,14
129,Recommend,"Very near south Kensington tube station. Within walking distance to museums, Harrods. Good transport with buses. Lots of nearby restaurants. Highly recommend this location and hotel. Hotel is comfortable.",4,2018,03,12
129,"Great Location, beautiful rooms!","We spent 3 nights (family of 3) in March'18. The hotel is located in South Kensington, near the so called Museum district of London, the S.Kensington tube station is a 1 minute walk.¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®
++ staff is excellent, and very helpful‚Ä®
++ the rooms are well furnished and decent sized‚Ä®
++ loved the toiletries, and the mini-bar was on the house (non-alcoholic!)‚Ä®
++ best advantage is the location‚Ä®‚Ä®

- the in room dining menu is too limited! But the fact that there are atleast a dozen cafes within a 3minute walk from the hotel makes up for that. We hardly relied on dine-in, even on the days we were dog-tired from all the walking around.‚Ä®

‚Ä®overall : loved the hotel, and would recommend it for a quiet peaceful stay.",4,2018,03,12
129,Superb,"On a rapid business trip, my priorities were the location, a comfortable sleep and good service when needed, and The Ampersand performed brilliantly on all counts.     Not a noticeable or grand building from the street, and the public areas and corridors are quite small, but with excellent modern furnishings, quiet despite the main road location, and wonderful service, it was a great experience. A couple of minutes walk from South Kensington tube station and the Museums, and buses and taxis easily available right outside.",5,2018,03,11
129,Nice place to stay,"They think of everything.You want it they got it.Near metro,shops and restaurants.They provide a free phone for the duration of your stay.I felt like a princess.The room I was in was small.Not much place to unpack.The rest was perfect.",5,2018,03,10
129,Best Hotel I have Stayed in the UK,"The overall service from check-in to check-out was excellent. The room was very clean, plush and expertly decorated. The service provided was great value for money and I would highly recommend the hotel to family and friends.",5,2018,03,06
129,Perfect,"Stayed here for a business meeting. 

Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

Rooms were spotless and well equipped

Location is <5 mins walk from the natural history museum, 2 mins from the Kensington south tube with plenty of good places to eat within easy walking distance.

Food in the hotel restaurant was sublime.

I really can‚Äôt fault the place. Highly recommended and I‚Äôd definitely stay here again.",5,2018,03,06
129,"Lovely place to stay close to tube, restaurants & museums! ","Small but brilliant hotel! I was nervous as first time travelling to London on my own for a 5 night stay, from the minute I walked in to the hotel I felt relaxed & safe. The staff on reception were helpful & welcoming, I received a complimentary upgrade which I was extremely grateful for due to length of my stay. I was shown to my room and was told about the free minibar, WiFi and services on offer. The room had everything that you could need including lovely toiletries. Breakfast was good and always served by professional smiling staff. Thank you to all the staff that made my stay enjoyable, they are a real credit to the hotel! Only slight disappointment was that my sheets were not changed once through out my stay but only a small matter when the rest of the hotel was perfect, thank you! ",5,2018,03,03
129,Not worthy of 5 stars,"Just back from a 4 night stay with my daughter,we shared a twin room please be very aware these rooms are tiny, you will be struggling with the cases and room to manuuvere round them, lack of wardrobe hanging space for two as kettle etc is housed in the wardrobe.Nice warm bathroom wilth all the extras you need. No atmosphere in the hotel we very seldom seen any other guests.",3,2018,03,03
129,Well situated luxury hotel,"This lovely boutique hotel is well situated in South Kensington, close to the tube. It was charming, beautifully decorated and the staff were friendly and efficient, as you would expect given the price ",5,2018,03,03
129,Another Enjoyable Visit.,"We love this hotel. It is ideally situated for what we desire when visiting London. Rooms are beautiful, staff very helpful. Close to tube and handy for Heathrow Express. Will be back before long I hope. ",5,2018,03,02
129,"Beautiful, friendly and quiet","The hotel is beautiful, located just a few steps away from South Kensington Station. The staff are super friendly, eager to help and advise. The room was great and oh, so quiet! You could hear/feel the vibration from the tube but it didn't disturb at all. We will go there again. For sure.",5,2018,02,28
129,Great choice,"I loved to stay in this hotel. The staff are very good, the location is amazing! Super comfortable rooms, very cute decoration! The breakfast was paid separately, but well worth it! I certainly recommend it",5,2018,02,27
129,Very good,"Stayed for two nights with husband. Very handy to South Kensington station. Room was small but well designed and functional. Nice touches were rubber duck in bathroom, complimentary soft drink mini bar and clever lighting. Loved the use of the smartphone with lots of handy maps etc....Curtains let in a lot of light and lots of creaking of floorboards from room above Late at night and early on Sunday morning. Recommend.",4,2018,02,26
129,A Little Gem in a Great Location,"We stay at the Ampersand once or twice a year and have no negative comments about this small hotel.

The staff are wonderful. They are efficient, attentive, always have a smile and the level of service in all areas is exceptional. The staff are probably the hotel's greatest asset.

The Ampersand is housed in a period building so rooms come in different shapes and sizes but the cleanliness, comfort and attention to detail is the same throughout.

Small things make a difference and having a fridge stocked with complimentary fresh milk, still and sparkling water, fruit juices and soft drinks is a definite plus. We also enjoy the continental breakfast. Everything is fresh and appetising and the artisan breads, ham and turkey carvery, frittata plus all the usual fare is a great start to the day. We haven't tried the cook breakfast but they look amazing. We have also had afternoon tea in 'The Drawing Room' which was lovely.

Now the location which is fantastic. We fly into London Heathrow Airport, head to the Underground (Tube) get on the train from the airport terminal and 40 minutes later we arrive at South Kensington. The Ampersand is 100 yards away from the South Kensington Underground Station which not only services the Piccadilly Line but also the District and Circle Lines so accessing theatres, Covent Garden, Chelsea and many major attractions is easy. Also within a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel are the Victoria & Albert (V&A) museum, The Science and Natural History Museums and The Royal Albert Hall.

There are many places to eat in the area and if you want a post theatre meal then 'Rocca' (Italian) on Old Brompton Road opens late.

The Ampersand is a great place to stay in Central London, a litle gem in a great location.",5,2018,02,26
129,Ampersand Hotel,"EXCEPTIONAL hotel. Highly recommend staying here! We stayed in a Deluxe room for 4 days. Hotel is near the tube and bus routes. Manager and staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. Hotel is beautiful, clean and in a great location.",5,2018,02,22
129,Nice small modern hotel,"Small room, well appointed: great L'Ocitane toiletries, nice linens. Complimentary water/soft drinks/snacks in mini bar. TV/ movie selection very good for Europe. Good location, no front awning to speak of...bit tough to get a taxi",4,2018,02,20
129,"Ignore complaints that the rooms are small, you have several choices, & the sizes are listed in the room details","I looked at about 30 hotels and their reviews before booking with The Ampersand. We stayed in a Deluxe room for 4 days and were pleased. The place was spotless, the bed comfortable, the bathroom large, and a nice addition was that of the heated floors. The sizes are clearly listed in the room details. If you want a larger room, you need to pay for such, so it's no fault of the hotel if you pay for, and are given a smaller room. I found the concierge service to be stellar. Someone was always there to grab a bag or help with a task. Each day I stopped for instructions on how to take the train from point A to point B. Each instance, I was overly satisfied with their help. The area is high end, & train service is superb. Having traveled from Houston, Texas where there are no rail services, to the UK where public transportation is so good, I'm sold. We did not get lost once.  We even ended up taking the train to the airport after our stay. It was that easy. I will book with The Ampersand on our next visit to London.",5,2018,02,20
129,Chelsea weekend break,"Really beautiful hotel up market decor service excellent complimentary products! Tv in bathroom wash plush! Will definitely  return, great location lovely eateries and bars near by I would recommend gaucho! the gaucho steak house is something special ",5,2018,02,19
129,Very Nice Hotel,"Much enjoyed our stay, very friendly and helpful staff.Stayed as went to Albert Hall and Museums.Would recommend .Were well received and attended to, comfortable room with large comfy bed.Especially enjoyed the  Tapas and cocktails! ",5,2018,02,17
129,Charm in the Heart of South Kensington,"This boutique hotel right by South Kensington tube station is absolutely wonderful. 

The staff is nice, friendly and very helpful. 
After a day at the nearby museums, just go to the drawing rooms and enjoy tea. Or if you are in need of a cocktail, pop down to Apero and relax with a nice Gin & Tonic. 
Love the atmosphere of this place! Would stay again.",5,2018,02,17
129,"Great Hotel, Inceedible Stafd",We stayed at the Ampersand this week and could not have wished for a better experience. For our child‚Äôs 3rd birthday the staff organised a surprise present and chocolates. The staff were amazing! The location was great and the facilities fantastic! We will be back. ,5,2018,02,17
129,Pleasant hotel for a medium stay,"We are a business couple. We stayed in London for a fair, also wanted to explore London. The Ampersand is the perfect location to do that. Also the facilities are perfect for business people. We appreciated the wifi-room bubble. The different spaces to relax and the perfect bed and bathroom.",5,2018,02,15
129,Deutsche in London ,"Wirklich gutes bis sehr gutes Hotel, sehr gutes Personal. This is a beautiful and very nice hotel. Thanks to the staff. So we will come for sure again. Breakfast was tasty and healthy with alote of choice and good things. ",5,2018,02,14
129,&&&,This  beautiful hotel just generates superlatives - its wonderful & so stylish & serves the best breakfast in town & excels in every way from the smallest details to the superb staff & we will come back again & again,5,2018,02,13
129,"Convenient, reliable chic!","This is our preferred boutique hotel when we come to London. The location could not be more ideal (a stone's throw from South Kensington tube), the style is quirky and fun without being tiresome, the quality of the rooms is great, and the food and service is excellent. The rooms can get a bit stuffy overnight but otherwise we can't fault the stay.",5,2018,02,12
129,Always lovely,"I love this hotel for its comfort, peace and quiet and excellent location right next to South Kensington tube station. The staff are always welcoming, very friendly and nothing is too much bother. I always recommend The Ampersand when in London.",5,2018,02,12
129,BEST HOTEL EVER!,"BEST HOTEL EVER!
The Ampersand Hotel is in a nice area and close to South Kensington Underground. Charming and cozy rooms. Very good service.
Restaurant Apero serves really tasty breakfast.
I would love to stay here again!!
",5,2018,02,11
129,"Lovely hotel, excellent value!","Excellent! But make sure your room doesn‚Äôt face the side alley which is extremely noisy! Otherwise, the hotel is lovely, and the staff are very attentive. The restaurant, Apero, was also excellent and great for both a personal and a business dinner.",4,2018,02,11
129,Amazing hotel in good location ,"One of the best hotels where you could stay in enjoye the city
Fabulous in verry well done designing
Room are comfortable in with different views
I enjoy my stay here in i definitely recommend this hotel ",5,2018,02,10

129,Another great stay,"The ampersand is always our 1st choice when taking a break in London. Location, comfort and staff all outstanding. Extremely handy for the tube and feels very safe when walking back at night.  Also a great location for the Albert Hall and there are several eateries very close by. ",5,2018,02,08
129,Great with great location,This hotel was amazing It was centrally located near all the shops in an excellent neighborhood. The staff was exceptional from the doorman to the front desk as well as the restaurants If I visit London I will stay here again ,5,2018,02,08
129,Our visit to Ampersand Hotel,"The service is excellent. Most of the staff are from Italy, Spain, Portugal or Rumania and they are all friendly and willing to help. Fabio, the check in manager, couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful. The rooms were excellent. The breakfast is lovely. The kids love the buffet. Excellent value for money. ",5,2018,02,06
129,Lovely hotel,"Excellent location. An almost perfect stay was marred by the gruff manner of one of the Receptionists,  which was highly unexpected coming from staff of this hotel. He needs to improve his manners to maintain the good name of your establishment, or should not be frontline. ",5,2018,02,06
129,Small but perfectly formed!!,"I stayed in the Ampersand Hotel on a recent overnight business visit to London.    The Hotel is located 100 metres from South Kensington Station so it is an excellent location to base yourself. 
The check in was efficient and friendly.  I stayed in a double room.  These rooms have everything you need TV, tea and coffee, mini fridge, excellent air con and a nice compact bathroom full of upscale amenities etc.  But note the rooms are only suitable for single occupancy.  
The bar/restaurant is in the basement and there is an elegant lounge serving a small menu off the lobby.  Breakfast is very good with a good selection on the a la Carte as well as a continental buffet. 
One highlight of this hotel was what excellent value it was.  I could not fault it, definitely one to consider if you are travelling to London.",5,2018,02,05
129,Excellent in every respect,this is a lovely hotel - elegant - well situated for transport - extremely helpful and pleasant staff - excellent food (breakfast a la carte menu - delicious)  - very well equipped rooms (adapter - complimentary mini-bar with water soft drinks etc). All I can say is this will be my go-to hotel in London from now on.  ,5,2018,02,05
129,Excellence at the Ampersand,I have stayed many times at this hotel and it always delivers excellence. Well done to all the team for the warm welcome and great service provided I look forward to returning again very soon and would highly recommend,5,2018,02,03
129,Super great hotel,"I travel constantly and this hotel is a sure winner.  From the check in desk, room service, restaurants the staff could not want to do more for me.  The rooms are great with great amenities and free bar with fresh milk!  A really great hotel! Best kept sercret hotel as was not aware of it and thought it was new! ",5,2018,02,02
129,Science themed afternoon tea ,"A creative and quirky take on the afternoon tea. The savouries were delicious! They serve chocolate cranberry and white chocolate scones as opposed to the fruit scones . 
When we initially entered the room, we were shown to our seats but no one explained anything to us about the afternoon tea for about 5 -10 minutes, something you naturally expect of 5-star establishment. Just as I was starting to dread the decision of choosing this tea , Piotr our tea room attendant approached and table and went through everything relating to tea. Piotr and his colleague whose name we did it not get made the experience for us . 
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the service was exceptional paired with copious amount of tea and cakes.",4,2018,01,31
129,Fantastic for couples,"Opted for a Deluxe Studio as some of these have a freestanding bath in the hotel room, very romantic. Was a great stay, room service was good value, lovely staff. I had an issue with an electrical device in the room late at night but staff were very helpful and resolved my issue promptly. I cannot fault anything here at all. Room was very stylish and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. I will be going again soon.",5,2018,01,31
129,Perfect in every respect,"Stayed at this hotel and everything was faultless, we normally stay at a Boutique Hotel nearby but will stay at The Ampersand on our next visit to London. In fact we booked before we departed. We feel we should particularly mention the amazing service at Reception",5,2018,01,31
129,Great location but technology and design faults,"This is a nice hotel located a short stroll away from the South Kensington Tube Station and the Natural History Museum. Good location with lots of bars and restaurants and cafes around it. 
The bedroom was nicely decorated but was very small, and had faulty internet tv and room thermostat which meant I had to leave the window open because it was too hot and that meant noise transfer from a nearby school. There is a big design fault in the bathroom - see attached photo of the toilet which is positioned so you can‚Äôt sit properly on the toilet . This is frankly an outrageous design flaw for a five star hotel. Security is not great there also as the bedroom floors can be accessed without the use of keycards to operate the lifts.",3,2018,01,30
129,Great Location,"The Ampersand is in a great location across from the South Kensington Tube stop. Near museums and restaurants. Hotel is well appointed and the staff friendly and helpful. The restaurant is in the basement. 
",4,2018,01,30
129,Celebration,"Excellent hotel with fantastic staff who go out of their way to make your stay just perfect in every way. Decor very fun, funky and quirky. An uplifting place to visit. I would highly recommend. Rooms beautiful and spotless. The drawing room is a lovely place to relax with tea and cakes. We will definitely be back! This was a celebration and we had lovely surprise chocolates left in the room which added a really special touch.",5,2018,01,30
129,Ampersand Lovely As Always,"I've stayed here twice now, once with my family and once by myself, and I had a great experience both times. My room was pretty and comfortable, service was excellent, and you cannot beat this location.",5,2018,01,29
129,Wonderful Room and Service,"As a Tablet member, there was a wonderful promotion that we tried this month. It was my husband and I's first trip abroad alone without our kids. I wrote to the hotel in advance requesting an early check in if possible as I arrived on a red eye to Heathrow and knew I'd be wiped out. I was thinking maybe they'd had a room by noon, but when I arrived at 10 am the room was ready and I had gotten the upgrade in the promotion as well. It was absolutely lovely to get a chance to sleep for a few hours right away! The afternoon tea was a delight, service impeccable and everything about the room was cozy and comfortable. I hope to come back again next January!",5,2018,01,29
129,Great location and service with ample sized room,"My favourite hotel in London.  There isn't anything they could do better.  Attentive staff.  Lovely breakfast and plush, large rooms.   And a thank you for coming back yet again in the form of chocolates. Thank you!",5,2018,01,28
129,Fab location,Beautifully clean and perfect location in the heart of South Kensington. Pretty building with lovely interiors and friendly staff. Close to South Kensington tube station and to all the museums. Convenient bus service right outside the hotel.,5,2018,01,28
129,London night away,A gem of an hotel. Stayed in many hotels in London. The staff at the Ampersand were so friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable. Hotel is in a great location and 2 min walk to tube station. ,5,2018,01,28
129,A warm embrace from this special place,"We arrived to The Ampersand Hotel, located by a busy bus stop and taxi stop, once we were welcomed into the calm interior we felt a peace descend.  It is a welcoming hotel with a lovely homely feel (if your home has been decorated by a talented designer), the intangible feeling of welcome and home was a delightful surprise.  The staff we encountered were all very friendly and helpful.  

Our room was on the small side but spotlessly clean and nicely decorated, with very tall ceilings, the black and white bathroom was just enough space and well equipped, the beds were very comfy and we enjoyed our stay here.  The drawing room was a lovely space to have a small meeting, read the paper, have a coffee etc. the elegant tall windows looked out onto the hustle and bustle of London while you could comfortably enjoy the warm tranquillity inside.  A fab hotel in an equally fab location. We would stay here again and we would recommend it to a friend.",5,2018,01,27
129,"Great hotel, fabulous location","We stayed at this hotel in September, and would highly recommend it. Location could not be beat. You could easily put on your walking shoes and get to many places, or the tube stop is directly across from the hotel and could whisk you all over London. Our room was very nice and spacious. The bathroom was wonderful and the bed was extremely comfortable. We loved the snacks and waters, and the cell phone given to us was key, as we were able to navigate throughout the city. Everyone at the hotel was so nice. We didn't get a chance to eat at the hotel, but did grab a drink in the restaurant. There are also so many places to grab breakfast, lunch or dessert nearby. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,01,26
129,My trip to London,"The hotel is located just in front of South Kensington Underground Station, the atmosphere is easygoing  even if is a 5 star hotel. The rooms and bathroom are of good size with very comfortable beds. Breakfast is excellent! Overall an excellent hotel. ",5,2018,01,25
129,Excellent base in central London,"Great hotel,very friendly and efficient staff. Ideal location. Breakfast excellent with plenty of choice.
Bedroom and bathroom faultless. Considering its location and the quality,the Ampersand provides good value.",5,2018,01,25
129,Wonderful stay in a little gem!,Wonderful boutique hotel in lovely location with the most comfortable bed and pillows ever! Breakfast was a real treat with a fantastic choice and quality of dishes. Staff were courteous and polite and general ambience is lovey!,5,2018,01,25
129,Excellent Service,"We had a great experience. The staff was very helpful. The room was very comfortable. Everything is automated and modern. And, many thoughtful details for an international traveler were provided, such as a cell phone you could use during your stay and a power adapter. ",5,2018,01,23
129,Would not recommend!,"Our stay at the Ampersand was quite disappointing, unfortunately. It was not what we expected and to be honest it's not what I expect a 5* hotel to be like. It was my boyfriends's birthday on the day of our arrival, we had booked a deluxe room for four nights. Nobody commented on the birthday, we didn't receive any gestures. (Don't let yourself be fooled by those photos on here, we were mislead by those too. I believe those were taken by influencers, at least some, and are nothing but false advertising.) There wasn't even a complimentary fruit basket or anything like that, which is something we are used to from other 4* hotels. We were quite let down by this because, despite it being a birthday, it's just 'common courtesies'. I just kept thinking that I could have booked a room at the 4* hotel we stayed the year before for almost half the price and where we would have enjoyed better service and a bigger room even. I don't want to be unfair, I know the price also has something to do with location - the location was perfectly fine. But it was a real disappointment nonetheless. We knew beforehand that the room would be small but were still disappointed with the design. Even though it was really tiny (especially the bathroom) the TV was too small and far away (and too old). We planned on having breakfast one day but quickly gave up on the idea because the menu is just ridiculous. Surprisingly, not vegetarian friendly at all. I believe porridge or something was the only vegetarian choice? There was definitely no way you could order a veggie British breakfast or eggs on toast or even pancakes. The menu is ridiculously restricted and I was again reminded of how much better our stay at that other hotel was, there you could just order items individually if needed and the choices were more diverse. Let me tell you again, the Ampersand costs more and is supposed to be a 5* hotel but something just doesn't add up here, simply put: you get less for more money.",3,2018,01,22
129,South Ken hotel - fabulous,An excellent hotel in South Kensington  - great staff and so professional - we didn't ask for the upgrade but was offered by reception staff  as return guests  which just made our stay perfect.   We would certainly try and stay again as we go to London probably 6-8 times a year ,5,2018,01,22
129,Awesome,"Beautiful room and people. The room was spacious , the team couldn't have done more to help us celebrate my wife's birthday. Cocktails are some if the best we have tried. Nice easy going vibe that compliments triple A service. Recommended. ",5,2018,01,20
129,a hotel which is perfect,"Location, staff, bedroom, service, comfort, there is no such an hotel in the whole of London !! It has been perfect ! I'll recommend it to whom wants to enjoy London in the most comfortable and enjoyable way !",5,2018,01,20
129,Awesome hotel in nice area,"The Ampersand is a very comfortable hotel, a real gem, in a nice, not too crowded but central area of London. Staff were great, decor beautiful and facilities plentiful. All sorts of nice museums in the area and easy transportation options around the corner.",5,2018,01,18
129,Coffee,"I found this boutique hotel opposite Kensington tube station. It's a great base to locate in for a London trip.
It is beautifully decorated see photos
The chairs are comfortable and the coffee was really good
Excellent service
Looking forward to staying here ",4,2018,01,16
129,Great hotel - will be back!,"I stayed here for my 40th birthday weekend with 3 friends and we had an excellent time. The hotel is beautifully kept, very clean and the staff are very helpful and friendly. It was so nice to be in a 5 star hotel that doesn't charge for all the little extras which makes you feel very welcome. The breakfast was amazing and location is excellent. 10 out of 10! Only thing I would say are rooms are on the smaller side but you expect that in London.",5,2018,01,15
129,Leaking sink and receptionist,"Comfortable bed, good size room, quiet, clean but one unpleasant experience from a receptionist who likes to engage in arguments with hotel guests, so I would not stay here again based on this experience.  Leaking sink on arrival, reported immediately but not fixed until the next day, The receptionist was worse than the leaking sink. All other staff were very pleasant and friendly.",3,2018,01,15
129,A winter's break,The hotel continues to provide the many usual excellent facilities but these were offset by inadequate clothes storage in our allocated room. There were no drawers for clothes and the wardrobe could not cope with a winter's overcoat. An alternative room was offered which because of our short stay was declined. Some modest compensation was given at checkout.,4,2018,01,13
129,Enjoy a great winter stay in London,"Extremely comfortable hotel with kind and helpful staff. Near world class museums, good local restaurants and excellent travel links all within a short walk. Perfect for a winter city break, good value.",5,2018,01,12
129,"Great hotel, great service","We enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand. This is a lovely hotel in a great location. The room was comfortable and spacious and the bathroom was beautiful! The front desk service was top notch! The kind French gentleman who works at the front desk was extremely helpful and graciously helped make many arrangements for me during my stay. My only complaint was the loud hissing sound coming from the bathroom, possibly the water pipes? That needs to be looked into. Otherwise this is an outstanding London hotel!",4,2018,01,09
129,A wonderful stay,"We stayed one night for my birthday weekend and could not have picked a better hotel.  The hotel is really stylish, location excellent, staff friendly and super efficient.
The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in and the room and bathroom had every amenity we could possible want.  We ate in the Apero restaurant on the Saturday evening and were really impressed with the tasty tapas dishes, cocktails and wine choice - a lovely experience. Breakfast was also superb - more choices than I was expecting and all really fresh from the delicious croissants to the fresh fruit selection.
I would love to return.",5,2018,01,08
129,For us the best in London,"It is a very nice hotel, in a strategic position, 1 minute from South Kensington Station, with a high-level service in every step of your stay, very good breakfast, room comfortable, well furnished and very clean, me and my wife will surely go back to The Ampersand Hotel for our future stays in London.",5,2018,01,08
129,Love the service (and everything else at this hotel),"I stay here as much as I can when in London. It‚Äôs the ideal location, the rooms are super clean and quiet and the service top notch. On my last stay  I lost a much loved teddy bear (Luca the Elephant!) and realized I‚Äôd left him when I went to my next place of stay. The staff were amazing at tracking him down and mailing him back. It‚Äôs the small things that count (and Thanks for not laughing at 40+ lady who left a well worn Elephant behind!). ",5,2018,01,07
129,The place to stay!,"Exceptional staff, service and location. We loved our stay here and the close proximity to things you want to do in London. The front office staff went above and beyond on everything.
The hotel bar has great service and cocktails!",5,2018,01,06
129,Little Jewel!,"We love staying at The Ampersand. This was our second stay and plan on returning whenever we‚Äôre in London. Friendly staff, gorgeous room and convenient location next to the South Kensington tube station and a five minute walk from the V&A and Natural History Museums make it a perfect choice!
",5,2018,01,05
129,Price-quality excellent,"This is a Luxury boutique hotel, Nice decorated, friendly staff , close to tube station, taxi stand in front of hotel.
I have been here already 5 times, need to say more ;)
The beds are great, the only minor are the toilets in the basement ;not always as clean as they should altough the rooms are clean, don't understanding this..
",4,2018,01,05
129,Ok hotel but no more,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel from the 31/12 to the 2/1 and the hotel is clean and nice but I would not say that this is a 5 star hotel, for me this is a 4 star hotel.
The staff is ok, the room is ok. Well everything was ok but would say it‚Äôs the worst 5 star hotel I‚Äôve stayed at in London(and we‚Äôve stayed at maybe 10 or 12). 
The area (south Kensington) is lovely!!! Plenty of good restaurants around and close to everything!!!",3,2018,01,03
129,Outstanding stay in London.,"A must stay in London. Lovely location in Kensington with lots of small eateries and shops. The staff and service was outstanding and the restaurant had a delicious tapas menu. Coffee, tea, and treats were served In the tea room. ",5,2018,01,03
129,Very nice hotel in S. Kensington,"A small luxurious hotel close to the South Kensington metro station. We enjoyed New years weekend here. The staff was friendly and helpfull, the room was small but very nice and with everything you need from coffe/tea to internet and hairdryer. I was only missing a coat hanger by the entrance.
The lounge (the drawing room) and their restaurant are also very comfy.",5,2018,01,03
129,Great location,"This is the third time we stay at this hotel. The hotel is very near to South Kensington station and many shops & restaurants. Staff are nice and helpful. Even though my last time staying here was not up to the same quality, it‚Äôs still my choice of hotel in London though.",4,2018,01,03
129,Excellent stay!,"Had never heard of the Ampersand before, but have no hesitation in recommending it. 
Excellent management and staff and clean modern well appointed rooms.
Did not use Room service or the Restaurant so cannot comment on these facilities, but feel it would be in keeping with the rest of the experience ",5,2018,01,03
129,Excellent Boutique Hotel in London,"If you want a small hotel near the Tube in a great neighborhood in London, definitely stay at the Ampersand Hotel. We had the most wonderful stay at the hotel and the location was phenomenal!
The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was comfortable. 
",5,2018,01,02
129,It was a perfect stay!,It was a perfect stay. The Hotel is very good located. Also we booked last Minute there was everything ready when we arived. The kids enjoyed the hotel as there is a separted games room.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful. ,5,2018,01,02
129,Beautiful hotel but such small rooms!,"My hotel was beautifully decorated, pristine and spotless, truly living up to the title of elegant boutique hotel. But my first room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. The available floor space was too small to lay out my suitcase. And there wasn‚Äôt enough counter space in the bathroom to hold my toiletry bag.  When the ceiling in the bathroom started to leak I asked to be moved and they were great about it, and that room was much larger, approaching a normal size. I wonder if they would have put me In such a small room had I not boookd through Expedia I get the sense that sometimes hotels treat you less well if you use Expedia. Who knows. ",4,2018,01,01
129,Perfect ,"Picked this off of trip advisor because of its location halfway between Victoria and Paddington (landed at Gatwick left from Heathrow).  The hotel is less than a block from Kensington tube, surrounded by good restaurants, and walking distance to great shopping and parks. 
The room, though small, was well appointed and very comfortable. Bathroom was great. The sitting rooms by the lobby are great for sipping coffee or tea, people watching or reading. 
We‚Äôll be back. 
",5,2017,12,31
129,A great choice - excellent location and top notch service,"Excellent location , well  appointed and very friendly hotel . A stylish and very comfortable hotel - with great facilities- and a very friendly and attentive team of staff. Could not fault them. Bedrooms are generally on the cosy side but very beautifully decorated and well designed. ",5,2017,12,31
129,Great Location,"This hotel is conveniently located. Really close to the tube, The Science Museum, the Natural History Museum and the V&A. Lots of restaurants, pubs, cafes and your doorstep too.

Our room was quirky and elegant. The bed was so comfy I didn't get up for breakfast. My son said it was good though. 

It's not the cheapest of places but you get what you pay for. I would definitely return there. ",4,2017,12,31
129,Family Trip to London,"The Ampersand was beautifully appointed appointed hotel and in a nice central location.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to London and the Ampersand Hotel. We would definitely stay here, or another hotel in this group, again.",5,2017,12,31
129,Nice but not luxury,"the hotel is nice but service is not 5 stars. We arrived in the morning, aorund 11am and room was not ready. At the bar there was no service and we wait more than 1 hour to have a cup of tea. Room and bathroom quite small
Breakfast is very poor. Service in general is not 5 stars",2,2017,12,29
129,Excellent Hotel and Excellent Location,The hotel and the staff were amazing! The location was perfect. Close to the museums and the tube station is less than a block from the hotel!! The staff were friendly and efficient. Would highly recommend this hotel to my friends and family. ,5,2017,12,27
129,Good location and great service,"We stayed at The Ampersand for 3 nights on our last leg in London.
Prior to check-in to the hotel, we traveled to Edinburgh for the weekend. The staff was kind enough to store our big luggage so we could just off to the highland with a smaller suitcase.
The room was nicely decorated and warm. We got the one with the ornithology theme. The bed and pillow were so comfortable. Bathroom was a good space with double sink and heated floor, Completed with toiletries from my personal favorite brand. 
Service was great from everyone in the front desk, housekeeping, engineering and the Drawing Rooms.
Hotel is located in a very convenient address. Walking distance to museums and other places of interest. Public transport like bus and tube station were practically in front of the hotel. So it was easy to go around London.
Overall, it‚Äôs a lovely hotel. ",5,2017,12,27
129,Great Location. Wonderful Service,"The location of this hotel is half a block from the South Kensington tube station. So, very convenient! Very near the museums and Royal Albert Hall are all within easy walking distance. Friendly staff and the servicing of the rooms was excellent.",5,2017,12,26
129,A Warm Retreat,"The Drawing Rooms for coffee, cake and a catch up - what can I say? There's much to recommend it! The fire was roaring in the bleak mid-winter, the cake trolley / counter beckoned with a beautiful array of treats and the tea was served in pots! My coffee (cappuccino) was lovely; if not on the small side at least it was piping hot. Plenty of daily papers to read and all beautifully laid out with spare copies for everyone and so need to miss out on your newspaper of choice. 

I love finding these gems in the heart of the Big Smoke. Perfect when you want to escape the hustle and bustle for an hour.",4,2017,12,26
129,Ampersand Delight,"This is a simply wonderful little boutique hotel located in a French neighborhood of London. It is ideally located to visit the Victoria and Albert Museum, but quite a distance (by cab) to other major tourist spots. There is a wonderful restaurant in the hotel - Apero and a really good Chinese restaurant across the street from the hotel. We would most definitely stay in this hotel again!",4,2017,12,24
129,Great Location,"This is our second stay at the Ampersand. Staff friendly and polite, great location, steps away from the South Kensington underground. Small bath tub with awkward configuration. More like a four star vs five. Great stay overall.",4,2017,12,24
129,Beautiful Hotel in a superb location,"Delightful hotel, easy to get to. A quiet and very well presented room with all the facilities you could possibly need. Great location for the museums all within easy walking distance. Warm welcome at the door and a smile while checking out at 5:00am.",5,2017,12,20
129,A visit to Natural History Museum,We were looking for a family friendly hotel and we found it with The Ampersand. Everything was perfect the staff were very helpful and made our little daughter feel like a princess. The food was excellent as was the decor. Location is ideal being just 2 minutes walk from South Kensington Tube Station.,5,2017,12,20
129,Most Wonderful Hotel!,Would absolutely stay again.  Loved it. Staff so helpful and friendly.  Beautiful decor.  Wonderful Xmas decorations.  Attention to detail 100%.  Beautiful rooms with luxurious accessories in the bathroom.  Great mini bar and treats with the tea and coffee.,5,2017,12,18
129,Disturbed Night‚Äôs Sleep,"As a returning guest, I was looking forward to another visit. Unfortunately a few minor problems, the main ones being that there was no hot water from the basin tap returning in the evening and I was woken at 02.30 hrs with a ‚Äòphone message flashing.The message was not for me and was left 6 months previous. On leaving the hotel, the standard ‚ÄòDid you enjoy your stay?‚Äô wasn‚Äôt relayed. Small point but no morning paper offered when I checked-in. No added value for a returning guest.",3,2017,12,16
129,Top class,"Superb hotel in a great location at the hub of the transport network. Lovely bedroom and sparkling bathroom with loads of smellies! Excellent staff throughout this hotel, always so pleasant and very helpful.
Well located for the two best museums in the UK and just a 10 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall.
Stayed here every year since it was refurbished in about 2010.",5,2017,12,16
129,"Smart, small boutique hotel","Conveniently located to the attractions and restaurants, in a lovely area and the hotel itself is nicely decorated, they offer helpful add on services like supplying you with your own mobile phone and sim, there is a fantastic concierge service who helped us navigate transport and activity bookings and an excellent restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",5,2017,12,15
129,Great location in nice neighborhood,"Overall I would recommend this hotel because it fit many of our needs as a leisure traveler.  The location is great! Just across from the South Kensington tube station it was really convenient to walk with luggage on arrival as well as travel around to see the sights.  It has good restaurants all around and two very good bakeries right as you exit the station.  There is a healthy food place called Squirrel directly across the street too which has tea and juice options as well as food .  Since the hotel does not include breakfast, we grabbed croissants and other yummy things as well as cappuccinos at Gails or Pauls every morning.  It is withing walking distance to Harrods and even at night my daughter and I felt totally safe walking all around. The front desk staff is friendly but there are only 2 so they are often busy.  The lobby is tiny and it would have been nice to be able to sit in the lobby with tea or something but there is no room.  Only in the restaurant which you can use only if you eat there. 

 With a reservation made well in advance we were given a room which I feel should only be given out as a last resort - room 212.  It is the size of a postage stamp. And the heated bathroom floor was not working and it was directly across from the housekeeping room so the noise from that was very disturbing.   We had the 3rd category of room out of 6 so it makes me wonder what the 1st and 2nd category rooms are like.  They did move us the next night to the same category room which was, to my surprise, much larger.  I'm a bit disappointed we were given such a bad room the first night and I feel a little compensation in the rate would have been in order but that didn't happen.  Also, because it is an older building you can hear creaking in the floor from the people above. Also there is very very little room in the sink area.  The sink in our second room was more of a half sink so water got all over the floor if you turned it on fully.

While it sounds like I had a bad experience - overall, it was actually good.  The beds are comfy - the pillows especially so.  The windows are sound proofed so on the 4th floor we could not hear street noise.  The heated bathroom floor is a nice touch too.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful with tourist questions.  They provide an adapter for European plugs in the desk which is good because I only brought European adapters thinking it was the same in all of Europe.  Whoops.  Be sure to bring adapters for England.  They provided hair dryers also.   My advice is yes, stay at the Ampersand but research your room as there is clearly big differences even within the same category and price of room.",4,2017,12,14
129,Convenient elegance,"We stayed at the Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington for a short visit to London.  It was almost across the street from the South Kensington underground station and cabs were plentiful.  The decor is refreshing and unusual, the staff very helpful and efficient, and the room quite comfortable.  I especially appreciated the optional heated bathroom floors after all our chilly adventures around town.",4,2017,12,14
129,Beautiful room,"Beautifully decorated hotel. We were given a deluxe room which was huge, the bathroom as well.
Really close to south kensington station, with train directly to heathrow.
A la carte breakfast was really good, buffet ok. Quite slow service. ",4,2017,12,13
129,Christmas trip to London,"Went to London for a long weekend and stayed in the Ampersand Hotel. Had a wonderful stay there. Staff were so helpful and location was excellent. A few minutes from the underground station, so really easy to get about. ",5,2017,12,13
129,"Ampersand hotel, a place to remember and cherish","We really liked the hotel which was full of character and very tastefully arranged and decorated. The room was lovely if a little on the small size. Maybe not enough space for putting one's stuff away when it's two people in a twin bedroom,but the bathroom had a good size and a spacious shower, excellent! The ""apero"" restaurant was very good quality and reasonably priced for a series of delicious mezze type dishes. Good place to come for breakfast too!",5,2017,12,12
129,Incredible afternoon tea experience ,"As a group of friends celebrating a hen party, we had afternoon tea at this hotel.

Starting in the cocktail bar, we were watching the care, time and detail being taken in the cocktail making. Nice selection, ten pound a cocktail.

We had a private room for afternoon tea and the tea itself was amazing. Based on a science theme there were macaroons to inject with passion fruit, a great dry ice display around a planet shaped dessert and warm scones. 

Service was great and the atmosphere was lovely. 

It was a special experience for ¬£37 a head. ",5,2017,12,10
129,Quick stay in town,Excellent hotel for a short stay in town with direct and easy access to anywhere on the Circle Line.  Beautiful comfortable rooms and a professional caring team.  Always a pleasure to stay at the Ampersand.,5,2017,12,08
129,Excellent hotel in perfect location,"The hotel is very beautiful, elegant yet cosy. The breakfast is rich, fresh and gorgeous. The single room I've stayed in was quite small, by the way, and the quilt a bit too heavy. I would certainly come back and recommend this hotel, in any case. The location opposite to the South Kensington tube station is great! Harrods at walking distance, too!",4,2017,12,07
129,Good location and very nice rooms,"The Ampersand Hotel was nice and the rooms was clean and the location was great! 
Clean bathroom and a comfortable bed.

The light in the room was a bit to dark and the staff could be more service minded.
Recomed this hotel!",4,2017,12,05
129,My home in London,"Excellent location in South Kensington (just steps from the Tube and very close to the museums, the Royal Albert Hall and Harrods), top quality services and great rooms. This was my second time in the hotel this year and I'm sure I'll go back in the future.",5,2017,12,05
129,Great Boutique Hotel,"The best kept secret in Kensigton. Close to underground, buses, taxis and Hyde Park sightseeing. I‚Äôve been to London mamy times,  but this little place was the best value for its room rate. Very attentive staff, and both in room dining and its restaurant were great. Very quiet as well. ",5,2017,12,05
129,Good location,"Smart newly decorated hotel very Close to South Kensighton Tube station which makes it very convenient. The rooms are nicely appointed as well as the bathrooms. The rooms are on the small side,most space is taken up by the bed and if you have to large suitcases it's going to be diificult to open them The beds are very comfortable though. Breakfas is good but service so -so.",4,2017,12,05
129,It used to be better,"We started staying in this hotel three years ago and unfortunately it has gone down in quality of service, dining experience and the rooms now feel dated.  The breakfast which used to be a highlight was now terrible. We will look to stay else where next time. ",3,2017,12,04
129,An absolute must!,"The Ampersand is a lovely hotel, and is perfectly located by Hyde Park, the Underground (Tube), and delightful cafes. The staff was exceptional - they were even able to secure tickets to a sold-out show!",5,2017,12,03
129,Just Fabulous ,"An excellent hotel, rooms are well appointed but small.  The bathrooms are fantastic.  The front desk and hotel staff went out of there way to make our stay a delight.  Totally customer focused and a real gem.  ",5,2017,12,03
129,Fantastic friendly boutique hotel in a great location,The hotel is in a fantastic location just next to South Kensington underground station. The staff are extremely efficient and very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The hotel has excellent facilities and a very nice bar area. It has a cosy boutique feel about it and there are some lovely relaxation areas.,5,2017,12,01
129,Excellent Birthday Vacation,"My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Ampersand, celebrating his birthday in London. I chose this hotel due to the excellent reviews on TA and the hotel certainly met up to the reviews. We had a superior studio room that was just beautiful, roomy, well-appointed with everything that you could need for a comfortable stay including bathroom scale, nespresso, lovely snacks, heated bathroom floors and great toiletries and towels, comfy bedding. The staff were so accommodating and attended to any request we had promptly. Breakfast room and tea room were lovely and food was very good. We ate dinner one evening at Apero, and the food was just superb - as was the cocktail - service could have been a bit more attentive and quicker.
Overall, this hotel is just lovely and I hope that we can return at some point!",5,2017,11,29
129,"Nice hotel, great location but does not fully deliver on promise","Stayed 5 nights. The hotel is ideally situated near South Kensington tube station, nice rooms, smallish but that's London. Good soundproofing, clean, comfortable bed. Friendly staff.
The hotel rating is Excellent but the restaurant and lounge  rating is Average only. Small premises resulting in hotel guests being being crowded out by outside patrons. somewhat pretentious menu that doesn't fully meet expectations. Trying to be too many things for too many people.
would return for the hotel but eat/drink outside.",4,2017,11,29
129,Best hotel in London,This is my favorite hotel in London. Top room with comfortable beds and a lovely bathroom. Helpful and friendly personal. Plus for the gym in the basement. Hope to come back to this hotels gem in London.,5,2017,11,28
129,A great find in an excellent location,"Excellent all round. Our second visit and the hotel delivered again. Great room, bar, restaurant/brasserie. Excellent staff. Table tennis in the basement. Cool and contemporary with a quirky British vibe. What‚Äôs not to love?! ",5,2017,11,28
129,Love this hotel!!,"I've stayed in many a London hotel and this is by far my favorite!  Location is key.  A half block from South Kensington tube station, two blocks from V&A and the Museum of natural history, 15 minute walk from Harrods and Harvey Nichols.  Really great restaurants right outside.  We particularly loved the Lebanese restaurant and Muriel's Kitchen.  The staff was lovely and always helpful with directions and bookings.  Have already booked our return.",5,2017,11,27
129,Home sweet home,"This is our fifth stay at the hotel. It's feels like home. Trendy,great location.  Lots of in room amenities .. Love the nespresso machine
Perfect price. Would not think of staying anywhere else  Will be booking our next visit soon",5,2017,11,27
129,Amazing Week Long Holiday,"I have been excited to come back to London since I studied and lived in South Kensington six years ago and have been wanting to stay at the Ampersand based on their reviews for a long time. Our stay did not disappoint. For seven nights, my friend and I stayed in a deluxe studio in the corner on the 1st floor. The decorations and ambience were incredible and we were blown away with how at home we felt. The bed was so plush and large (king) and we slept like babies. The heated floors in the bathroom were a great bonus and the shower was perfect, best shower I‚Äôve ever had in a hotel. While we didn‚Äôt get to use the standing tub in the room, it was awesome to look at it. We loved that they had the nespresso machine, as well as sodas and water for free and always replenished. By the end, they proactively gave us more waters and diet cokes because they knew we drank them so often. There was a small bit of tube noise when we slept but it was oddly comforting and to be expected with its location (which was perfect for getting around right next to the tube station). The only thing missing from the stay was a bit more storage space. There was no dresser or real set of drawers for us to put our clothing so we had to be a little resourceful in using tiny drawers on the TV stand or above the bar. 

Regardless, based on a multitude of factors, my stay here definitely lived up to my expectations and hopes and I will ABSOLUTELY recommend it to friends and be staying here. In fact, I‚Äôm already looking at rates for my next visit üòä. Thank you Ampersand!
",5,2017,11,27
129,Almost very good,"Nice hotel, good location, facilities and food in Apero, only booked Deluxe Double as it was just a 1 night stay, but this is not the most basic room. It was fairly small but very clean with a nice bathroom and comfy bed, HOWEVER it was very dark and my pet hate no mirror in the room, had to dry my hair virtually sitting in the cupboard as there was a mirror on the inside of cupboard door, is it too much to ask for a dressing table/mirror set up with decent lighting.",4,2017,11,27
129,Weekend,Great location for our weekend in London. Everything about the hotel from the moment you walk into reception was first class . Only one minor issue was with   the very slow service at breakfast on Sunday morning when Restaurant not very busy.,4,2017,11,27
129,All around fabulous!,"Loved this hotel; you will not be disappointed staying here!  Here are my highlights:

-From the minute I booked, the proactive emails from the hotel were great.
-When I emailed the hotel with questions or requests, they answered my emails promptly and thoroughly.
-The hotel is so easy to get to from Gatwick.  I took the Gatwick Express into Victoria and the hotel is two stops west bound on either the District or the Circle line.  Very easy if your carry-on is light!
-Starbuck, Pret A Manger and many other restaurants are steps away.
-Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum are 5 minutes away. 
-Everyone at the hotel was so nice and helpful!
-The hotel and rooms are beautiful!
- Loved our welcome champagne and petit fours; such a nice touch!
-The complimentary water and sodas in the fridge refilled every day was an amazing perk!
-The room came with a ""Handy"" phone.  Calls to the US were free and it provided smart phone capability. If you don't have an international data plan, this will be a huge help for your trip. 
- Toiletries are by L'Occitane
-Heated bathroom floor
-VERY comfortable bed and pillows

I wish I could live at this hotel!  It is a very special place filled with wonderful staff.  Worth every penny to stay here!",5,2017,11,26
129,A week in London,"This is a great little hotel, and with just a few small changes, it could really be fabulous! It is maintained and run beautifully, with expedient and professional service.The decor, the rooms and the food and beverage offerings are wonderful. The only real situation we had was with the hvac system - because the system was quite inefficient, the room became very stuffy, with little circulation. While this was not a deal breaker, it can make for some difficult nights trying to sleep in an uncomfortable room. To be fair, the maintenance team was very accommodating, and did their best to take care of the problem. I think the system was just inefficient. ",4,2017,11,26
129,London break,"What a lovely hotel in a excellent location close to museums and Harrods.  Tube station and bus stops practically outside the front door, all the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was excellent, we could not fault in any way.  Will definitely return
",5,2017,11,23
129,Simply fantastic in every possibly way,"I‚Äôve stayed here twice for business and so glad this the hotel that our company has decided to make the ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù home away from home since that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like, home. Friendly staff that are welcoming from the second you arrive. The rooms are well appointed and have lots of little details to make it comfy. The free phone to use is such a nice touch, big plush robes, cushy bedding, delicious tea and coffee all make your stay lovely. I can‚Äôt wait to come back already! The location is fantastic! Right across from the South Kensington station and near plenty of restaurants and cafes. It‚Äôs London perfection for any visit. ",5,2017,11,22
129,Great Service,"The room my friend and I were given was pretty small and the air did not work. While we had to stay there for one night we were upgraded for the rest of our trip. The staff was really helpful and very nice. They helped print out tickets and mail a postcard to the States. The bathroom in our upgraded room was so fabulous, it had heated floors and a shower room. There was a sitting area and even a little balcony. Loved this hotel.",5,2017,11,22
129,Excellent place to stay in London - first class service and location,"Thus hotel is really wonderful in every aspect?  The staff are first class, location in South Kensington is great - museums just five minutes walk away, quick taxi or tube rides to central London (shops, theatres) - area full of great restaurants.  Will stay here whenever in London.  Highly recommend: Its quiet to considering its location",5,2017,11,22
129,A Wonderful Property,"What a lovely hotel.  Beautiful, comfortable room and bath, friendly staff, especially the two women at the check in counter, tasty breakfast.  The location near the South Kensington Underground station was most convenient and there are lots of places to eat in the area and some nice shops.",5,2017,11,21
129,Another Visit to the lovely Ampersand,"This is my go to hotel in London. It is extremely comfortable, beautifully decorated and in a great location for museums, shopping and dining. Very close to South Kensington Tube Station, so easy transport links to all areas. ",5,2017,11,21
129,Classy Bedroom with quality fixtures & fittings. Conveniently Located.,"The first thing that I was happy about with this hotel is how conveniently located it is to public transport. Just a short walk from South Kensington tube and with a central bus stop outside and others just around the corner. 
The choice of lovely cafes close by are unbeatable too. 

The look of the hotel from the outside is very pleasing. A beautiful building freshly painted.
Small friendly hassle free check in. 

The bedroom (an executive), was of a very high standard. The fixtures and fittings within were expensive and the ensuite was lovely. There was a nice plentiful choice of bath/soaps and hair products. Even a fresh loofah. 
The bathmats (one each) were the nicest that I‚Äôve ever used. So soft and dense. 

The bed was very large, comfortable mattress with unbeatable quality pillows. 

Early evening brought a knock to the door and room service brought us a lovely box of handmade chocolates and a nice personalised note. 

We had breakfast in bed which was in my top 2 breakfasts of all time taken at a hotel, and I‚Äôve stayed in quite a lot. 

I would highly recommend this beautiful, luxurious hotel to anyone. 

",5,2017,11,20
129,Absolutely Loved the Ampersand!,"I stayed here for a week for a combination of business travel and 3 days of sight-seeing. The hotel is excellent in all aspects -- lovely staff, beautiful furnishings, clean and comfortable rooms, and central location great for getting where you need to be quickly: right next to South Kensington station on the Picadilly, District, and Circle lines. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,11,20
129,Boutique Excellence,Perfectly positioned hotel with small yet very well appointed rooms and great service. I had 36hours in London for pleasure (tacked onto business trip in Ireland ) and was very happy with this luxury boutique hotel .,5,2017,11,19
129,Boutique hotel close to everything in South Kensington,"Set in a lovely neighbourhood and close to museums, shops, transport and Hyde Park, this is a great hotel.  I'd be happy to recommend to others travelling to London.  Easy access from Heathrow on the tube too!  ",5,2017,11,18
129,Good location,"the location was central, very close to tube station, trendy hotel, clean rooms and a nice restaurant for breakfast and dinner, the staff was friendly, plus the hotel is value for money, lot's of restaurants to eat close by",4,2017,11,17
129,Hotel Full of Character,"We had a top floor room which was really cute - we had a balcony that over looked the street which was a nice bonus.  Loved being able to look out over the streets and people watch.

The room was lovely - especially the bathroom.  It was clean but not spotless - but I'm picky.

Really enjoyed the extra large fluffy towels and little features like a loafer and rubber duck :-)

The bed was large and the duvet was super large and soft.  Bed was rather cramped - because we were in a type of attic room almost.  Sloped ceiling over the bed and a wall at the top and bottom of the bed - was a bit of an obstacle course getting in and out.  Stubbed my toes a few times navigating the bed situation.  

Bed was also a little lumpy and saggy.

The staff were amazing - very kind, helpful and polite.  We had a quick check-in and check-out - they also offered to help us arrange a car to take us to the airport when we left.

The complimentary cell phone in the room for us to use and take out and about with us was a nice touch.

Had a night cap in the basement bar - good selection of drinks - nice surroundings - good bar staff.

Good location close to museums, shops, bars, restaurants and a tube station.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay.  Not sure it is five star but definitely a strong 4 stars.",4,2017,11,17
129,Extremely comfortable hotel in great location,"Great location for museums, Hyde Park and Knightsbridge/South Kensington shopping. Extremely polite and welcoming staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Had a very comfortable room. Excellent facilities",5,2017,11,17
129,Consistently excellent!,"I have stayed at the Ampersand on a number of occasions and have thoroughly enjoyed each visit. The location is excellent, the accommodation superb and the staff consistently friendly and efficient! I could not recommend this hotel more highly! ",5,2017,11,17
129,"Lovely hotel, would visit again.","Now I have to admit to normally being a bit picky, but this was a lovely hotel.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The decor is a delight and very charming.  The room was comfortable and of a very reasonable size for London.  The bathroom was fresh and clean with a lovely large walk-in shower. I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat in the hotel. The location was great - near the Tube, and a short walk from the V&A, Natural History & Harrods.  I felt that I got a good deal price-wise (London is so expensive)  on the hotel's website with the 3 for 2 offer.  I would look at this hotel first if I was visiting this part of London again, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",5,2017,11,17
129,Boutique and comfortable,"The Ampersande is a small, boutique hotel in a great location not far from some must visit attractions in London (e.g. national history museum). Very clean, friendly staff and great services that make the experience of travelling internationally easier (e.g. free mobile phone to borrow).",5,2017,11,15
129,Good choice!,"Very nice hotel. All staff are very accommodating and friendly.  Great service & location, beautiful decor, comfortable room.  A bit of street noise if your room is on lower floor. The breakfast at Apero is delicious.  Reasonable price similar to outside cafe. ",5,2017,11,14
129,Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington,"Great location, comfortable hotel, friendly and efficient service.  The Science Afternoon Tea is a must!

Easy walk to museums, galleries, bookstores, the underground, variety of restaurants.  Muriel's good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",5,2017,11,14
129,Good value with some nice refinement in South Kensington,The hotel is less than 100 meters from the Tube and quite bright and friendly. The staff are helpful and the rooms although a tad small have all the amenities one would need for a short or long stay including heated bathroom floors and nice fluffy towels,5,2017,11,13
129,"Exelllent Hotel, fabulous service","Perfect location for a break in West London. We stayed on a birthday break and were made to feel extra special during our stay. Beautiful hotel, facilities and staff. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2017,11,13
129,It is always lovely to come back to the Ampersand,Once go have been in this nice and well situated comfortable hotel you want to come back to South Kensington. This time we had one of the suites on the 5th floor with a little drawing room and a small kitchen. Not for cooking because you have a wonderful restaurant in the hotel in the cellar. We know where to go when we travel to London.,4,2017,11,12
129,Great place. !!,"I stayed in this hotel from 5th November till 12th November while on a business trip to London. The hotel is very conveniently located in South Kensington and is very close to nearby attractions  such as the museum of natural history , Hyde Park Oxford Street and there are some very good restaurants in the vicinity. The staff is very courteous polite and responsive. The rooms are spacious and well appointed.housekeeping services are of a very high standard, and the staff at the reception is very helpful. The breakfast is located at -1 level. However the only thing that I did not like about this place is that they have the same breakfast menu every single day without any new dishes and that was  a bit of a let down considering that you are spending more than a week at this hotel. Rest everything was impeccable and of high standards and I would definitely recommend this hotel as a very good option in central London. ",4,2017,11,12
129,One night stop and shop,"Quiet room top floor, as requested on feedback.
Relaxed friendly staff
Room clean comfortable 
Breakfast again relaxed enjoyable, good coffee.
Helpful check out, hotel looked after luggage which was collected at the end of the day.",5,2017,11,12
129,Our New Favorite,"This lovely hotel was absolutely perfect for our five day stay consisting of business followed by a romantic weekend of lazy mornings followed by seeing the sights in the afternoons. The internet ‚Äúbubble‚Äù serviced our technology needs with very little drama. The team was quick to have our business attire cleaned, pressed and returned in short order. The lounge on the main floor served as a lovely location for casual meetings. The room was large with tall ceilings and plenty of natural light, the bed linens were soft and the pillows were extra fluffy. The location was perfect, across the street from South Kensington, all of London was literally at our doorstep. ",5,2017,11,11
129,Short break,"The 3rd floor room was clean and quiet, the bed very comfortable and an excellent shower. Complimentary mini bar with soft drinks and water and free News paper, staff polite and attentive. Ideally located, yards from the tube and a 20 minute walk from the Museums and Albert Hall.",4,2017,11,11
129,Excellent stay in wonderful place,"Gorgeous boutique style hotel in superb location . Staff wonderful and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you without being formal and stuffy like in some other top end hotels , Choice  at breakfast was excellent . Would definitely stay here again and will highly recommend to anyone visiting London . ",5,2017,11,11
129,Luxury spot in South Kensington,"This is a very nice hotel with a central location and an excellent service. It is a luxury spot but still very cosy and not too fancy. I'm sure I will return. Also, I have already recommended it to a colleague. ",5,2017,11,11
129,Great room but ....,"Great room but shame about the smell in the bathroom and the fact that I had trouble several times with phoning through to reception.  When I checked in I asked for water extra water for my room but was told there was already some in there even though I needed more, approx 1 litre more.  (I was told this again when ordering room service and had to specify I needed at least a litre)Could hear the tube at night.",4,2017,11,10
129,Wonderful boutique hotel,"Third time at this gem of a hotel. Excellent service, lovely decor, small but well equipped  fitness room, very good food and room service, convenient location. Heated floor in bathroom- perfect after a cold and damp day, free and fast wi-fi, the list goes on. This was my third stay and I will be back!",5,2017,11,10
129,The perfect boutique hotel in South Kensington,"Beautiful classic decowith a twist, fabulous bed,  excellent amenities and great service. Perfect location only 2 mins from South Kensington underground station. Definitely gets top the top of our preferred London hotels list.",5,2017,11,09
129,One night stay,"Lovely hotel, well decorated and modern. Only stayed for the one night for a business event and was pleased. Had room service for a late night dinner which was quickly delivered and tasty. The bar in the basement was very good with a good cocktail menu.  Complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar were a nice touch and the bed was very comfortable. Very clean and tidy.

Staff were very friendly and attentive, don‚Äôt be alarmed when they carry your bags for you as many don‚Äôt seem to wear a uniform - we thought it was a random stranger taking our bags from us and didn‚Äôt realise he worked there!!

My only reason for giving 4 stars rather than 5 is down to room size, I felt it was a touch too small and I would have been disappointed if I was sharing as not enough room for two. I struggled for space for my toiletries  in the bathroom (a shelf over the sink would have been handy) and a mirror in the main room would have been handy as the one in the wardrobe was a tricky angle!",4,2017,11,08
129,A fabulous High Tea as part of a Hen Do,"We had booked a science themed high tea in a private room prior to our trip to the Science Museum. 

It was stunning and had a huge range of savoury and sweet treats all with a science theme. We all enjoyed every bit of it.

The staff were helpful and attentive.",5,2017,11,08
129,Very Comfortable - Excellent Location - Excellent Hotel,"We stayed in room 408,  a deluxe studio.

We enjoyed a flawless stay at the Ampersand.
Every one of our details from pre-booking to checking out was handled in a smooth & professional manner. I truly appreciate their quality competent service.

The Ampersand has a classy & tasteful decor.
Bed comfort is unmatched. Lots of hot water. Our room had a spacious feel especially considering London can be cramped and tight. Our room was very clean. (Although I‚Äôm not sure how ofter they clean the carpet).

We used the business centre & gym, both very good.

Reception and door staff were very professional. A couple of errors at check out were handled easily & professionally. Everything was smooth and pleasant.

The location is terrific. We also went to one of their restaurant recommendations which was great!

The only negative‚Ä¶ Ampersand arranged our airport car pick up. The driver was late. The hotel handled it immediately when I phoned, but still an unwelcomed welcome for us, and not consistent with the high quality of the Ampersand. The car stunk of diesel fumes. They may wish to consider a different car transfer company. We hired a different transfer service on our own to take us to the airport which was on time, excellent and 1/2 the price.

I would be pleased to stay at room 408 in this enjoyable hotel again.",5,2017,11,08
129,Great Stay!!,"I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful boutique hotel in South Kensington, only one block away from the tube station. The customer service at the front was great, and I would like to thank the reservations department for accommodating the last minute changes in my schedule. They were very generous, and was able to provide me with a room on the days I needed. Since I was staying seven nights, they recommended I stay in the Superior room which is a little bigger than the Deluxe room I originally reserved so that I could be more comfortable, and I‚Äôm glad I did.  I definitely would not have been happy in a smaller room.  The rooms and lobby were kept clean and neat, which are important factors for me, when choosing a hotel. And I loved that the tube station is less that one block away.  As a woman who loves to travel solo, the proximity to the tube station is key for security and getting around the city faster.  I will definitely return.",5,2017,11,07
129,Just as good as last time,"Only 24 hours in this hotel, but our stay was perfect from the moment our car was taken away to be parked to when we checked out.
Having stayed once before, we knew the drill - cocktails in the cellar were superbly mixed by a charming man who certainly knew how to make them - please do try The Apothacary if you fancy something different but still delicious - flavoured with mushroom extract and Balsalmic vinegar sounded awful but tasted superb!
Our bedroom was immaculate, a good size for central London, with quality furnishings and bathroom toiletries.
Staff throughout the hotel were professional, courteous and friendly.
The location and ambience of this hotel makes it a firm favourite for us - well worth the money.",5,2017,11,07
129,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing service","Beautiful Hotel in South Kensington.  Great location close to tube.  Lovely and beautifully decorated room.  Immaculately clean!  Loved all the little extras - complimentary snacks and drinks in the room, heated bathroom floor, extra large shower, fluffy pillows and towels.  The staff is so friendly and go the extra mile to make you feel at home.  Highly recommend the Ampersand!  ",5,2017,11,07
129,Favourite hotel in London,Stopped here after a week in the Seychelles. We were struggling with jet lag and the cold weather but the Ampersand really warmed to us. Excellent stay. Only wish it had been for longer. Best breakfast in the UK! ,5,2017,11,06
129,good but not as impressed as hoped,Great location but the place was completely quiet and the bar was closed at 10pm on a Sunday night - disappointing - same thing with the lunge.. Rooms small but that is to be expected in central London.,3,2017,11,06
129,A perfect stay,"Everything was upto a very high standard at a hotel that is well situated in London! A very modern afternoon tea as well. The rooms very elegant,clean and comfortable, albeit a bit small. Truly value for money!",5,2017,11,06
129,Anniversary celebration,"For us, it was luxurious. The staff are superb and genuinely solicitous. Great location relative to tube and museums. It was the best 2 nights to end a 10 day trip in UK. Without question, we'd return!",5,2017,11,05
129,Ampersand Hotel,Hotel is very close to the tube line so access to major London attractions is on the doorstep. Our suite was comfortable with an excellent bed. Loved the small balcony. Staff were helpful and pleasant.  Would recommend and am likely to stay again. ,4,2017,11,04
129,Our second stay at The Ampersand ,"This was our second stay at The Ampersand. Again, it was a wonderful experience. After busy days of sightseeing, it was so nice to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù each night to The Ampersand. It is a beautiful and comfy haven in a great location! ",5,2017,11,04
129,Excellent,"Excellent rooms, and small detail which creates a big feeling of warmth and comfort. The nespresso machine, loccitane toileteries, wonderful snacks which are complementary add to the experience. The design of the rooms is great, with quirky details and character in the design of the spaces. The only thing which is a negative is that the smallest room which you have should be a tad bit bigger as it is difficult for 2 people to manoeuvre in such a small room, and there is no space to put the suitcases or clothes for 2. The larger size rooms are perfect. Would also say that price of breakfast should be included in the stay. ",4,2017,11,04
129,What a great find,"I recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a central London location with easy Tube access, superb service and a beautifully decorated and maintained hotel. The proximity to the Victoria and Albert Museum, Royal Albert Hall, etc. and your choice of a billion good restaurants makes this an easy choice. ",5,2017,10,30
129,Wonderfull Weekend,"The Ampersand is a fantastic boutique experience in a wonderful location.  I almost don't want to rave so that there's always room when we look for a stay.  It's our go to London escape. Well priced,  cater to bringing our small dog along and wonderfully located to the museums and restaurants of Kensington.  The rooms are well appointed and the service is terrific. On top of this the rates are great and won't break the bank which simply means we can come more often. Thank you!",5,2017,10,30
129,Great London hotel,"Positioned well for London museums visit. Excellent, small and friendly. Nothing too much trouble for the staff. Lovely continental breakfast and well stocked bar. Superior room was small but had everything a visitor could require.",5,2017,10,30
129,Happy Times,"Enjoyed our stay - as before -  and will definitely come back again.  The location is great and 
the overall experience stressless.   The in-house restaurant is buzzy and serves good food.   The breakfast is all what one could look for  ",5,2017,10,29
129,So cozy ,"The Ampersand is a lovely and cozy hotel in London South Kensington. The location is perfect, next to the station and with lots of caf√©s, shops and restaurants sourrounding the place. Service was great, we even got an upgrade to the next category and the room was amazing. Unfortunately my husband was a bit ill and we had to stay in the room for a day, but at least we could enjoy the room and the most comfortable bed this way! We loved it!!! ",5,2017,10,29
129,Quick light bite meal pre LFF screening,We booked a table here for a light bite before going to Cine Lumiere for a London Film Festival screening.  I called in the morning to book a table and the staff were extremely helpful.  Once we arrived we were shown To a lovely table and had a good meal before seeing a film.  Everything was perfect for a quick stop and we would definitely go back again.,5,2017,10,27
129,Lovely and laid back,"Lovely and laid back. I hate hotels with too much in your face service. This place had it right. A beautiful Victorian building complete with squeaky floorboards - it is not a modern, purpose built boring hotel. The decor is lovely and modern, but very comfortable. I liked the free drinks in the fridge - too many hotels charge for water, juice, Coke etc. A spacious room with a massive bed and a view over the street. Great London ambience. A fantastic location - across from the Tube, taxis outside and within close proximity to all of the museums. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,10,25
129,Good value,"Well located, nice staff, good for the money if you want to stay in South Kensington. Tube is steps away, many options to eat nearby. But the standard rooms are quite small. They offer a smartphone with internet, which is always good if you don't intend to use yours with a prepaid simcard.",4,2017,10,25
129,Home away from home!,Fantastic place to stay:  The Ampersand is ideally located and beautifully decorated.  has quality bathrooms and toiletries and super comfy beds. The service is great and  the staff is very helpful and accommodating! ,5,2017,10,25
129,Wonderfull,"Everything about this hotel was wonderful; the very friendly and helpful staff, the recent remodeled rooms, the warm floor on the bathroom, the linens and towels and the free cel phone, that helped us to not get lost in this beautiful but a bit complicated city. 
The Location is also perfect, with the Metro station (Piccadilly, district and circle lines) very nearby.  Definitely a very good place to stay. Will be back.",5,2017,10,24
129,A hit and a miss,"For a five-star one bedroom suite, this was a disappointment.  The bedroom was too small for the large bed and TV mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed. It made it very difficult to walk through there to get to the bathroom. No place to store luggage in the bedroom, no luggage rack provided and closet was too small to hold suitcase.  Bathroom had a step down between the sink and the toilet that was very dangerous.  It was a ""slip and fall"" waiting to happen. And very squeaky floors throughout-so loud that they awakened the person in the next room.  The positives were a large bathroom, very nice towels, a fully-equipped kitchenette with microwave, min-bar, mini-fridge, Nepresso machine, electric teapot, toaster and dishes and glasses (but no silverware?), very effective temperature controls for both heating and A/C and aside from the squeaky floors, very quiet. Good location, just minutes from the S. Kensington tube stop and many good casual restaurants within walking distance.  Maybe other rooms have a better layout, but for the money, this could have been better.",3,2017,10,23
129,Very spoilt on our anniversary,We checked in on our wedding anniversary and not only were we shown to our room much earlier than the usual check in time but we were upgraded to a truly stunning room and given a bottle of champagne. We are usually here on business but having arrived before the working week had started we decided to give ourselves an anniversary treat - we were not disappointed! ,5,2017,10,23
129,Exquisite!,"What a great pleasure to stay at the Ampersand!
the staff has been amazing during my entire stay, the room was just the right size, nicely equipped. minibar was complimentary, room service affordable and really nice. The location is definitely perfect with the South Kensington station just accross the corner.
I would definitely recommend this lovely hotel and I will be back soon I hope.",5,2017,10,23
129,Drinks after concert at Royal Albert Hall,"The downstairs bar at the Ampersand is a cool hangout spot and an enclave of peacefulness away from the busy streets around these parts.

Try the signature cocktails.

The Gypsy waste favourite with our group.

Pleasant staff. Great cool decor",4,2017,10,22
129,"Great Stay, Highly Recommended","I had a wonderful stay recently at the Ampersand Hotel. From the nice touches like a free mini-bar to wonderful breakfast and tea at the hotel to the comfortable and well appointed rooms, Ampersand is an outstanding choice in South Kensington. It's a quiet area, located just around the corner from the Victoria and Albert, in neighborhoods with houses that look like Mary Poppins might come out any minute. The hotel design was contemporary and well done, and my room was huge - especially by London standards. The staff couldn't be friendlier, and helped me print out tickets after I was having problems with the downstairs computers. I would definitely stay here again and wish they had more locations in Europe and/or the US.",5,2017,10,22
129,Science tea,What a wonderful experience. The combination of interesting novelty tasks with a gorgeous combination of savoury and sweet choices. If you like an English tea with attentive service then book for tea here.,5,2017,10,21
129,Location ‚úîÔ∏è Staffüëç Room/facilitiesü§ó,"Great hotel all around!! Staff was excellent, hotel dining as well as neighborhood restaurants were delightful. Access to tube and the Victoria and Albert museum... so convenient. High five and thumbs up to The &! ",5,2017,10,21
129,Hidden jewel .. brilliant,"Great small luxury hotel .. relatively central..15 min walk to Knightsbridge and Harrods
It is well reformed, well thought out place.. fixtures are new and work to perfection, rooms maybe a bit small (larger rooms are much pricier) but have all the functionality you would expect from a great hotel in London... walk in showers with modern rain forest type of fixtures, l'occidence amenities, free minibar (soft drinks/water/juices), tea/coffee making facilities, comfortable bed and lots of nice touches for a great evening.
Whether for business or romantic trip, this hotel is a good choice in London.
Breakfast is adequate and cosy although selection of items maybe limited. ",5,2017,10,20
129,Perfect stay,"Stayed for two nights. Room was very nice, clean and beautiful, bed comfortable and bath just the right size for me. (166cm) Only complaint is that there was minimal space to put my clothes in. It was okay for one person for two days but really, not even a hook for my coat... 

Otherwise, perfection. ",5,2017,10,19
129,Excellent experience,"Great location, wonderfull room, everything was just perfect. A place to recommend. A beautifull neighbourhood close enough of every important atraction of the city but far enough to stay in a lovely place. Simply excellent",5,2017,10,19
129,Really lovely,I had to come to the UK recently for a very short trip from Sydney. This place was lovely. Right near Sth Ken Station but surprisingly quiet in my room. Extremely clean and beautifully appointed. Staff were amazing and friendly. Thank you. ,5,2017,10,18
129,We loved the Ampersand,"My 12 year old son and I recently stayed at the Ampersand for 5 nights. While the room wasn't ready when we arrived, Corrine at the front desk was very accommodating and worked to keep us comfortable until we could check in. Tracy and Serzie (sp?) also were extremely helpful throughout our stay. We ordered room service frequently and ate in the hotel restaurant -- all were delicious and moderately priced. We loved our room (5th floor) and the layout and general look of the hotel. The location is fantastic (easy walk to bus, Underground, The Natural History Museum and the V&A. While there were a couple of technology issues with the room, they really didn't affect our stay. Highly recommend and can't wait to return.",5,2017,10,17
129,Love this hotel,This hotel is amazing!   Great location!  The staff is wonderful and very helpful  The room was very clean and the beds were so cozy!  Enjoyed our experience and highly recommend this hotel to any traveling to this area.  ,5,2017,10,17
129,An Amazing Hotel with Amazing Location.,"The food, service, and room quality are exceptional. Modern well-appointed bathrooms, 20+ foot high ceilings, and they provide you an android mobile phone pre-loaded for international calls and apps. For a week long stay, we couldn't have asked for more. And the food is delicious.",5,2017,10,16
129,A very good experienceüòÄ,"If you chose to stay around Sth-Ken and it‚Äôs Museum, then The Ampersand has the perfect location (a mn walk from üöá and couples of mn from Museums). 
The building is Victorian style.  Inside it is a good choice of modern decoration especially the Lobby/Bar (perfect for tea time!)/main stairs. 
The restaurant and a second bar (use for breakfast room as well) is to find on the basement. Love the London basement style, lovely lights and even a game room and a private function room makes the basement enjoyable and alive. 
The ROOM based on the one used for a week end of 3 days, was spacious with king size bed very very comfortable. The bathroom is so lovely but tiny. The deco is contemporary and the use of mini bar is included (non-alcohol). Of course coffee or tea can be made in the room. 
Found clean room and all necessary amnesties to make stay comfortable. 
They provide a great new service providing you the use of a smartphone (that you can take with you out) called Handy is fully pre setting to the companion/city guide ! Of course like anyüì± you can make free phone calls and use internet... 
a last word about the staff, the ones encountered (Raquel+Gabriella) reception desk where more than helpful and professional. 

The staff from the restaurant is indeed very friendly, young and international (we‚Äôve spoken Italian). 

It is always tough to find the perfect hotel that fits everyone unless you choose a Palace, but what has been
paid was reasonable (the restaurant is more than reasonably priced) to compare other places. 
Now found the Ampersand to be one of the best in this area/category due to space, perfect location and all services, we feel this place is alive, modern and very comfy! ",5,2017,10,16
129,"Wonderful boutique hotel with excellent service, comfortable rooms, excellent restaurant‚Ä¶ I highly recommend this hotel"," Each staff member was professional and courteous and responded quickly to any questions or issues. The hotel is centrally located for convenience for business and shopping and touring. I would definitely return to the  Ampersand on my next trip to the UK.",5,2017,10,15
129,Perfect location in a perfect environment,"I love the size of this hotel, it is personal, the hotel rooms have everything you wish for, even though some of the rooms are small. And the convenience close to the underground going to Heathrow is just great.",5,2017,10,15
129,"Great location, great stay","I've just booked our stay next summer at the Ampersand Hotel after visiting for the first time in August. (Great special on the website.) As other reviewers have said, the location is brilliant - easy train access from Heathrow, circle line tube to and from all of the London sights, short walk to museums and Royal Albert Hall (Proms time!), and Hyde Park. The room was comfortable, with a luxurious heated floor in the bathroom, and the young men and women at the front desk were friendly and helpful, with great tips for local pubs and restaurants. As others have said, the 'Handi' phone was brilliant for overseas travellers like us. Thank you Ampersand, and see you next year. ",5,2017,10,14

129,Amazing stay,Another fantastic stay at this gorgeous hotel. Rooms are beautiful and stylish with lots of great features. Staff are very friendly and it‚Äôs just a one minute walk to the tube. We will definitely return next time we visit London. ,5,2017,10,11

The location is fantastic for many popaular tourist site but also to get around all of London quickly with South Kensington Underground a few yards away.",5,2017,10,11

Complimentary drinks provided in the room and newspaper delivered for free daily. Room size ok. Bathroom size could have been larger. Excellent position. Close to parks, museums and restaurants.

129,Brilliant Place!,"The Ampersand is a brilliant place to base yourself in London. Literally across the street from the South Kensington tube station, you couldn't be more connected to the city and within walking distance of the tons of great cafes and eateries of the neighborhood. The hotel greeted us with much warmth and provided us with a very comfortable room for our stay. The technology in the room is super modern, including USB outlets for international travelers and complimentary Handy phones to use during your stay. This was a god-sent when we wanted to look things up on the go without incurring roaming charges! Overall, we could not have been happier with our stay.",5,2017,10,08
129,Excellent hotel in a great location,"Just come back from a 2 night stay at this hotel and will definitely return.
We chose it because of the proximity to the V & A museum and were not disappointed with the location. Lots of places to eat nearby and the tube is really close.
The breakfast was excellent.
The staff are friendly and efficient and we loved the decor.
We asked for a room on a lower floor as I'm not keen on lifts. We were given a room on the ground floor but facing the side street and it was really quiet.
We will definitely be back to this fantastic hotel.",5,2017,10,08
129,Happy in London,Great location and service combined with a charming old feel and first rate amenities makes this a very good choice for a London holiday. Near the tube and close to major tourist attractions. The staff is warm and always going out of their way to be helpful. ,5,2017,10,08
129,Really comfortable hotel in a great location.,"Loved this hotel. Very comfortable and Apero restaurant was an easy place to have either a big or small dinner after a busy day in London. The location, right near South Kensington tube is ideal, with an easy walk to the V&A museum, Science Museum, Natural History Museum and lots of nice cafes, restaurants and boutique shops. ",5,2017,10,08
129,Best decision of the trip was to stay at The Ampersand,"Everything was perfect!  Location is amazing, right across the street from the Tube.  Service was wonderful and the rooms were great and the beds very comfortable.  All eight of us that were traveling together, agreed that we'd never stay anywhere else in London!",5,2017,10,08
129,"Stay here if you like great service, accommodations, location, and value!","We stayed three nights at the Ampersand hotel for my birthday, and had an excellent time. The staff provided us with early check-in and a sweet turn down surprise. We highly recommend this boutique hotel!",5,2017,10,08
129,Great Location,"Best location.  Would stay in this area again in London.  Bed was comfortable and toiletries were very nice.  Just an awkward room with hardly any drawers or closet space.  Hard to find a good place to dry your hair in front of a mirror.  And we were here for a week, so it was a bit of work for two people to get ready in the morning. But, it was quiet, so we slept well.  Our house keeping could have had a little higher level of service.",3,2017,10,07
129,Six wonderful days at Ampersand Hotel,"This is an excellent boutique hotel: The room was very comfortable, the bathroom was excellent, the service was friendly and efficient. We used the Apero Restaurant for breakfast (4 days) and dinner (2 nights). The food and the service was quite good. The staff indicated a few good restaurants close by too. We shall, probably, return to this hotel in our next trip to London.",5,2017,10,06
129,Good hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for three days as part of a business trip. The hotel is quite small, which gives it a nice atmosphere. Service was good, as was the food in the breakfast restaurant.

Rooms were good, though nothing out of the ordinary.

Location-wise the hotel is in a great spot, right next to South Kensington station, with central London close by as well.",4,2017,10,06
129,Hotel Certainly Deserves High TA Rating,"Really impressed on many accounts - location, suite, facilities & staff.
Booked 3 nights for 2 pay in advance special for suite on Level 4 which had separate lounge room & kitchenette with micro wave & Espresso machine etc..
Most innovative feature was the Smartphone with ""Handy"" -
free mobile data, local calls & International calls to several countries including Australia.  A great help navigating around London with travel App & Google maps.  Hope other hotels introduce this feature asap.  Just don't lose the phone - it will cost you UK Pounds 170 (we did not!!)
Recommendations for breakfast, lunch & dinner were spot on too.",5,2017,10,06
129,A brief overnight stay,"The room was perfectly clean and comfortable and ideal for a one night stay. My only slight concern was that, as my room was on the ground floor, the gentle rumble of District and Circle Line trains passing below could be heard. Otherwise the room was perfectly quiet.
I did not use any of the dining or other facilities.",4,2017,10,06
129,Fantastic!,"I stayed for 5 nights in the Ampersand and loved everything about ge hotel. The location is perfect - i.e. Close enough to the action of Mayfair and Soho without being in the hub of chaos and noise. The surrounding neighborhood is perfect for a casual start to the day, but the downstairs hotel dinning is yummy and unique on to itself. The staff were very knowledgeable, helpful, and courtesy. I stayed in the superior room which is the perfect size. The bed, sheets, and pilllows were perfect. I didn't have one bad night of sleep, and the rooms are well insulated because I heard no noise or my neighbors. Bathroom is a great size and the shower was modern WITH hot water (praise the Lord! I hate cold/warm water showers). The only negative is the ac's ability to cool the room quickly. It takes some time. Overall, I would stay here again and highly recommend it!",5,2017,10,05
129,Best London hotel we have ever stayed in,"We chose this hotel to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary & it was perfect in every way. Staff were attentive & courteous & always smiling. Room service fast & efficient & the room itself (deluxe studio) was spotless & clean. The most comfortable nights sleep we have had in ages. Thanks to all the staff, we will definitely return again.",5,2017,10,05
129,Everything about this hotel is wonderful. The location is amazing. I wish I had more time to explore the area.,If I am ever in London again I will not stay anywhere elsw! The tube is a 3 min walk away. Tour buses and local buses stop in front of the hotel. Transportation to and from here was amazing. The food is exellent. The staff was excellent and the heated bathroom floors were the best! The staff was very pleasent. Webtraveled as group and used the game room for movie night and games! It was perfect.,5,2017,10,04
129,Great Hotel in Great Location,"This hotel met all of my criteria. I was looking for a boutique hotel near a tube/underground stop in London at a reasonable price and this hotel was perfect for me!  What you see in the pictures is actually what you get. The hotel is pretty, modern (with lovely architectural details), comfortable, and despite the fact that it is a boutique hotel, it has amenities. It has a restaurant, a business center, and a helpful staff. The only downside was that my room was fairly small, but then again I chose a lower rate and the size was properly disclosed. I knew what I was getting. There are a lot of great restaurants and museums with in walking distance. And currently the hotel offers free WiFi and free beverages (water & soft drinks) from the min bar. I love this hotel! This will be my preferred hotel when in London.",4,2017,10,03
129,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed in September through work. The hotel is lovely. My room and bathroom was so clean and looked amazing.
The staff were so friendly. Would 100% recommend this to anyone looking to book and I hope to make it down with my family and not for work next time.",5,2017,10,03
129,Ampersand Hotel London,The Ampersand is a clean and spacious hotel and is conveniently located very near to South Kensington station. Staff were helpful and courteous. The use of a mobile phone (provided by the hotel) was a bonus.  WiFi was free and fast.,5,2017,10,02
129,A Beautiful Property in a Great Locations,"We stayed four nights at this hotel with two other friends.  We were all very pleased.  The hotel is very well cared for and our rooms were clean and roomy (we had deluxe rooms).  Despite the rooms overlooking the street, the place was very quiet (double paned windows with a separate glass panel.  The bathroom was also roomy.  Service at the hotel was excellent in all regards.  The location is perfect, just across the street from South Kensington Station.  You will feel the rumble of the trains but I think that's unavoidable if  you want to be close to a station.  Also, there are scores of good restaurants nearby and it's close to a lot of the sites....",5,2017,10,02
129,Unfortunate Stay,"Hotel not focused on customer service, staff confused about what to do in an emergency, and inconsistent information. I needed to contact reception 3 times and then find out how to get to reception from the 5th floor (which was not clear) to speak to them directly.",3,2017,10,02
129,Wonderful stay,"The perfect place to stay while in London.  Beautiful hotel in a beautiful area on London. A one minute walk to the tube and bus stop. Plenty of places to eat.  Walking distance to the V&A, History Museum, Science Museum, Kensington Park and Hyde Park.",5,2017,10,01
129,Family Holiday,"This Hotel was recommended to us by a friend for its great location and excellent food, which we absolutely agree with. We were delighted by the friendly staff and loved the decor in the rooms and lobby etc. We'll come back!",4,2017,10,01
129,The perfect stay in the perfect location,"From the moment of arrival we were made to feel nothing was too much trouble to make our stay one of quality.  All staff were polite and helpful, even a manager escorted us outside to hail a taxi when other staff were busy.  The decor is beautiful, the location ideal for visiting a number of places, wither on foot or public transport, finally - the bed and pillows were mega-comfortable.",5,2017,09,29
129,Great hotel for families,"While most hotels in London are quite small, the suites at the Ampersand can come with a pull out bed which is very high quality (strong and flat enough for adults). The location is on a quiet main street close to Museums and lots of great restaurants within walking distance. Taxi stand right outside the door and subway/tube within 100M. The staff are eager to help and dealt with the few issues we had promptly and with genuine concern. Specifically Tracy and Raquel made the best of it and we'd return to this hotel without hesitation.",5,2017,09,29
129,Would love to come back here.,"I loved staying here with my mom on our trip to London. The hotel is very chic and hip. Love the decor. The first room we were assigned was pretty small considering we were staying for 6 days and had two big suitcases. They moved us to a bigger room the next day and it was terrific. We just needed a bit more room for our stuff. Both rooms were very comfortable. Loved that the room has a usable refrigerator, and they provide some beverages in it that were complimentary. Who does that!?",5,2017,09,28
129,"Well located, friendly and modern hotel","Excellent location for travelling in from Heathrow on the tube. Very short walk out of the tube station. Located on 3 tube lines so easy to get to all the tourist sites. Local area has several nice coffee shops/snack places and restaurants.
The room had a huge and very comfortable bed. Shower-room was clean and toiletries were nice. Staff at the reception desk were very pleasant and helpful.",4,2017,09,27
129,Luxurious but cozy hotel in the heart of London,"The Ampersand is a fantastic place to stay while in London! With a welcoming, friendly staff, luxurious and comfortable rooms, and a fantastic locale, there's not a lot you can say the hotel lacks. Yes the rates are somewhat high, but hotel's like the Ampersand are not supposed to be for budget travelers, they are for when you feel like treating yourself to a truly comfortable vacation stay. The hotel itself is appointed very nicely without feeling stuffy - bits of fun/modern design mix with traditional or victorian motifs. The Drawing Room is like something out of CS Lewis's parlor, while the rooms mix modern euro vibes, with an antique charm. The beds are soft and huge, the balcony was a gorgeous add-on, and the bathrooms are simultaneously spacious and grande, while also being warm and relaxing. They even provide you with a complimentary smart phone with international service, you can borrow while you're out on the town!

Overall if you're looking for a treat, the Ampersand is a wonderful option to pick, in a great part of London.",5,2017,09,26
129,Best in South Kensington,"A fabulous Victorian Hotel with impressive and modern updates. Comfortable beds, great bathrooms with heated floors and a warm and welcoming staff.The location cannot be beat. Walking distance to the V&A and the South Kensington Tube station. Great breakfasts and a beautiful lounge.",5,2017,09,26
129,Very pleasant,"Small unpretentious hotel that I didn't think I would like, a friend recommended it to us. Bottom line good guest services, pleasant public areas, comfy beds, great towels and linens and superbly accommodating staff, especially the dynamo on the front desk,  
So, bottom line , great value for money, excellent facilities and service,in room facilities outstanding!If you like smaller hotels you'll love it, if you prefer luxury you'll enjoy it,if you want to be in the Chelsea Knightsbridge area you can't go wrong, and it's surrounded by great little bakeries and restaurants,oh and south Ken tubes just steps away",4,2017,09,25
129,A gem in South Ken,"Great location, lovely spotless (but small) room, beautiful bathroom, excellent continental breakfast and just a 15 minute walk from the Albert Hall. Staff couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive. Loved it. ",5,2017,09,25
129,we keep returning to the Ampersand,"The Ampersand hotel is top ! 
Rooms and service are first quality. All staff members are of such a kindness.
Location is perfect (direct underground St Pancras - South Kensington).
For any stay in London we keep coming back to the Ampersand.
",5,2017,09,25
129,A really lovely hotel in a great location,"The Ampersand has become our regular base for weekend trips to London. The location is brilliant for the things we like to do when in town; shopping, Hyde Park, museums, and west end theatres are only a short tube ride / taxi ride away. A lovely boutique hotel with welcoming staff and a great cocktail bar for a night cap.",5,2017,09,25
129,8th stay at The Ampersand,"Wonderful hotel. Great location, just 200 yards from South Kensington tube station. Beautiful rooms. Fabulous staff. We stay every time we visit London. It is very well placed for walks to the museums, Hyde Park, Green park, Harrods, Harvey Nichols. Yesterday I walked from The Shard to the hotel- 4 miles in glorious sunshine. ",5,2017,09,23
129,It was perfect,"So comfortable and amazing beds we loved the location,so close to the tube.  Loved the decor and use of colour, children loved the heated bathroom floors.  Highly recommended by us
Everything including the breakfast was exceptional.
",5,2017,09,23
129,Best hotel in South Kensington!,"This hotel is not to be missed!

- small but very trendy rooms
- drawing room is awesome to hang out and enjoy afternoon tea
- apero restaurant is a great way to start your day w a full English breakfast. ",5,2017,09,21
129,Great hotel in good location,"Small room but loved decor. Lovely bathroom excellent shower, really comfortable bed and pillows. Free soft drink and chocolates great touch. Breakfast was great good variety. Could hear slight rumble of noise from tube as very close, but only in morning not during night. I would definitely stay here again great value",4,2017,09,21
129,Over nighter for work,"Single room was tiny but perfect for a quick overnight stay for work and super comfy bed.  Great bathroom although rain shower didn't work properly but apart from that all good.  Great location, convenient for central london.",5,2017,09,21
129,Wonderful stay,"Had a great 2 night stay at the Ampersand while visiting London for Radio 2 Hyde park concert. Hotel in great location. Very modern and clean. All staff made you feel at ease and very welcome and had time to chat and make sure you had everything you needed. Only had breakfast but couldn't fault it.Bedroom very nice, heated bathroom floor was a very nice as was the shower. Complimentary mini bar with soft drinks also nice touch. Only negative room at back of hotel and you could hear slight humming noise.",5,2017,09,20
129,Chic hotel in South Kensington,Nice stay at the lovely Ampersand. Since I always have a lot of luggages I'll book next time a bigger room. Otherwise everything was fine. The staff is friendly and efficient. The bathrooms with floor heating are very comfortable. ,5,2017,09,20
129,Absolute Perfection,"Every time I stay at the Ampersand, I have a great experience. The rooms are always extremely comfortable and clean, the staff is so friendly, and the location is perfect-- the tube is right across the street, there are lots of restaurants in the area, and a short walk to museums, the park and Harrod's. The best thing about staying at the Ampersand is that the big city and tourist attractions are easily accessible, but the boutique atmosphere and less-crowded neighborhood allow you to feel relaxed and at-home. ",5,2017,09,20
129,3-night stay in the Ampersand,"Generally everything was very good to excellent. The staff was very helpful and efficient. The location of the hotel is very good, convenient with transport and there are plenty of decent restaurants around. However, the lighting in the room is quite dark. Coupled with dark furniture, it was not so great lighting-wise.",5,2017,09,20
129,"Location, Bed, Bar","The location is fantastic, as many reviewers have commented on. Close to the tube, great authentic Italian pizza restaurant not too far of a walk, Starbucks nearby if needed. The king size bed was comfortable. There was a good selection of TV channels to enjoy. Our shower set up was a bit interesting with two large shower heads next to one another in a handicap accessible roll in shower. We had very little usable storage space in our bathroom, the shelving was too shallow to adequately hold our bags of toiletries, and we had only a pedestal sink. This was annoying and led to dropping many bathroom items.  Must give a shout out to Luca? (makes his own Nigroni for the small barrels) at Apero as being fun to talk to and making fantastic cocktails. It is always welcome to have a nice bartender who knows their stuff after enduring a long haul flight!",4,2017,09,19
129,Sadly not more than ok. ,"Stayed three nights with my wife.
Location in South Kensington is superb and many of the best museums in London are located nearby. Hyde Park is just around the corner. 
The hotel itself is ok but nothing spectacular.  We stayed in a Delux Studion that was quite spacious for a city centre hotel. It was crowded with furniture in good old English tradition. Amenities were ample and of good quality. But the building is old and the renovations have only been skin deep. The floor boards are very squeaky when moving around in the room (will wake your partner at night if you get out of bed). 
There is little or no sound insulation from the door into the corridor and all conversations of passing guests was vividly heard in our room. Floor boards in the corridor behave like in the room but even louder. We woke up several times in the nights because of this. A fellow guest in a room down the hall confirmed to have the same problems so it was not limited to our room. 
Reception staff are average at best. The young man who checked us in did not make eye contact even once during the whole procedure. He gave incorrect information regarding our booking and seemed generally uninterested in his job. Daytime staff were better but also seemed strangely detached. 
The breakfast buffet was non-inspiring with dry cheese slices, runny yoghurt and no one seemed to care about refilling or refreshing the dishes as long as we were there. The √° la carte menu is standard for a city hotel. We only ate here once. The rest of the stay we had breakfast outside in some very nice places nearby. 
The restaurant Apero is however very good. Mediterranean inspired tapas style dishes were very fresh and tasty. 
All-in-all : we can only give a three star review. There are just too many issues to warrant anything higher. We go to London three to four times per year and will book another hotel next time. 
",3,2017,09,19
129,Great stay,"Stylish and clean boutique hotel, very well located 2 minutes walk from Piccadilly line. The rooms are not the biggest in London but they're very well appointed. All encounters with staff were positive. Nothing to fault, will return",5,2017,09,18
129,Lovely Stay at Ampersand,"Kudos to Tracey Hewitson for organizing a wonderful stay for my teenage daughter and I during her university tours.
The Deluxe room is beautifully furnished with wonderful amenities such as L'Occitane products, rubber ducky, heated bathroom floor, and complimentary drinks. The location to South Kensington Station is close (although we used Uber for convenience). Have a relaxing walk to Chelsea and the nearby museums!",5,2017,09,18
129,we love coming back to this hotel !! a bijoux !!!,"we love this hotel, third time we stay in this hotel  !! small luxury hotel perfect for a stay in London ! great continental breakfast a lot of choice ! the service is very good always very helpful for anything you need ! I definitely will come back ! ",5,2017,09,18
129,A return stay,"Top location near sev major museums. 2 min walk to picadilly dist circle lines at S Ken station.   Sev bus stops.  Hotel modern rooms, good staff, single rooms small for a longer stay.  Most bathrooms lack counter space, no heated towel rack.   A good value when booked in advance and for 3+ nights.",4,2017,09,18
129,Lovely hotel in a superb location.,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The staff were so helpful, especially after the first night when I asked about changing to a room with a walk in shower as I found the bath with the overhead shower too steep. It was all taken care of seamlessly.
The rooms are small but well stocked. The local phone is very helpful.
The hotel is located in the heart of South Kensington. Couldn't wish for better. Museums, restaurants, shops etc.
Breakfast was a buffet- quite enticing. A la carte was available too.
I would highly recommend this establishment.",5,2017,09,16
129,Superbly cosy & comfortable,"Very cosy room with super comfortable beds. Nice breakfast. Location is excellent, both for business as for leisure. The lobby is a tad cold but the staircase ""light bulb artwork"" makes up for that. Very nicely decorated with beautiful desk lamp in the rooms.",5,2017,09,16
129,Great hotel!,"Beautiful, great location, fab staff and decor! I loved it! The room was beautifully appointed. The bathroom was lovely. The location was perfect. Th hotel amenities were lovely. Gym,Restaraunt,cafe lounge off foyer.",5,2017,09,15
129,Fantastic afternoon tea! ,"My family and I enjoyed a fab Science themed afternoon tea. The restaurant is clean, spacious, well-lit and luxurious. The staff were friendly and helpful and the toilets were amazing! The food was top-notch! Such beautiful presentation. Fresh, delicious ingredients & innovative ideas. Our children loved making their own pink lemonade & squirting coulis into macaroons. Yum! Our only complaint would be that the staff seemed to have forgotten a part of the tea so when I asked what the paintbrush was for they quickly brought out a small box full of chocolate 'soil' & fossils.
If you want to have an unusual afternoon tea this would be a great choice! ",5,2017,09,13
129,Favourite,The Ampersand is fast becoming a personal favourite - excellent location in South Kensington only minutes from the tube and anywhere in London. Stylish and elegant boutique sized hotel. Not cheap but it is central London. Highly recommend ,4,2017,09,13
129,great hotel,"This was a wonderful hotel, well situated in South Kensington.  Very walkable location with a tube station just around the corner.  Close to many Museums.  Room was spacious and the bathroom was the best I have had in many high end hotels.",5,2017,09,13
129,Fine hotel in Kensington area,This hotel has an excellent staff who make you feel welcomed and valued as a customer.  The rooms were nice but not large as many European hotel rooms are on the small side. There is a wonderful but pricey restaurant in the basement.  The good news is there are many restaurants and shops very close in the area.  I liked it enough to want to return on a future visit.  ,5,2017,09,12
129,"Ampersand Hotel, London","Great hotel with fantastic service. Very pleasant personnel. It was a fantastic experience. 
I will come back in the future. Recommend to all who value the service and personal relations and attention.",5,2017,09,11
129,"Keep it quiet,but this is an excellent value for money hotel in London but not without a flaw","My wife and I have stayed at the Ampersand five times between us and we really wanted to keep it quiet.  Its excellent it really is but don't all rush to stay or they will start sticking the prices up!

Handily located about a two minute walk from South Kensington Tube station, which sits on the Piccadilly line, and that means arrive at Heathrow jump on the tube you don't have to change and you arrive at your stop.

It has a lovely design element with bedrooms with all mod cons and a lovely lounge to sit in for drinks etc.

One flaw, breakfast.  They have a buffet breakfast which is a bit uninspiring and they have an a la carte breakfast which is a bit more like it.  However if you order, say the a la carte full english breakfast, you cannot go to the buffet and grab a bowl of cereal, that costs extra.

The staff are very friendly and make us feel very welcome every time we stay.  But don't you start staying here, stay at the Holiday Inn ;)",4,2017,09,11
129,Excellent Location,"The location adjacent to the South Kensington Underground Station couldn't have been more convenient. It allowed us to maximize the time we had to enjoy London. The room was quiet, comfortable, and clean, and the bathroom was spacious and had great water pressure and temperature. This was the perfect hotel.",5,2017,09,11
129,Lovely hotel with extra touches,"We had a lovely one night stay in this hotel for my birthday.  Staff were friendly and helpful and we were given a free upgrade to a small suite.  We ended up with 3 televisions including one in the bathroom, which made my young son very excited.  The room was clean and comfortable, although the sofa bed for my son could have done with a topper to make it a bit more comfy.  We also had a small kitchenette area which was useful, and complimentary soft drinks in the mini fridge.  Afternoon tea was an exciting event, including dry ice as part of the 'science' theme.  A slice of cake was left in the room to mark my birthday which was a nice touch.  Very well placed for visiting the major museums in an attractive area of London.  We all had a good nights sleep and were sorry to leave.",5,2017,09,10
129,Great place to stay in London,"Very happy with my stay in The Ampersand. So close to tube that made it very easy getting around London. The bed was extremely comfortable and room lovely. Also, was thrilled that they offered a gluten free afternoon tea in The Drawing Room. It was a highlight for me.",5,2017,09,09
129,The Best Hotel in London. 5 Stars!!!,"We've always stayed at another boutique hotel in South Kensington, due to their inflated new rates we decided to look elsewhere.  After doing some research we came across The Ampersand Hotel online and booked it. 

They had a ""Three for Two"" (stay three nights for the price of two) special and we decided to book it (chose Pay Now and Save, which is non-refundable). After traveling through Europe for 2 1/2 weeks we had wanted to decompress in London, before heading back to the States.

Once we get off the South Kensington tube station, the hotel was a two minute walk. As we approached the hotel we were greeted by the door man who took our luggage immediately.  The friendly night receptionist checked us in quickly and we were escorted to our room. The room and everything about it was fantastic!

Ampersand Hotel were very detailed orientated that sets them apart.  The status of your room is done by clicking two buttons on a electronic panel, telling staff not to disturb you or have your room serviced.  The room was beautifully decorated with a small balcony overlooking the street. We're not bothered by noise, but for those light sleepers, you may want to choose another room location away from the main street. The bathroom had heated floors and a speaker in the ceiling. We realized seconds later the audio from the TV was coming through into that the bathroom speaker.
The closet lights turned once you opened the doors. They have a complimentary minbar!

Ampersand does have free wifi but you can also enable a private wifi spot by turning on your TV.  Another perk staying there, was the Android phone in the room for you to use. The ""Handy App"" on the phone will give you directions, recommend places to eat, tourist attraction suggestions, etc., etc .  And yes, you can call back to the states or any other country for FREE.
We love visiting London and will be back to this amazing hotel. I can't say enough about them.

 ou won't be disappointed staying here.",5,2017,09,06
129,excellant staff,"The hotel was great. Location was ideal. Train station maybe 1 min from front of hotel. Restaurants all around the location. But I must compliment the staff as being extremely polite, helpful and informative. Not one, not two but all the staff we came in contact with.I would definitely recommend this hotel .",5,2017,09,06
129,Comfortable Stay,"Rooms are very small, but the location is advantageous. Being located in the central part of London, it is close to metro station and other public transport means. Average hospitality and service. Preferred city hotel. ",4,2017,09,05
129,Wonderful place to stay!,"We stayed here for our Honeymoon and loved it! The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. Very close to an underground station, which is helpful. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,09,05
129,Would Highly Recommend,A colleague and I stayed at the Ampersand whilst attending an Exhibition at Olympia.  We were greeted warmly by the porter and reception staff and had an efficient check-in.  The hotel overall was clean and with well designed decor.  The room was clean and confortable.  Of additional note was the basement bar and dining area which was attended by a good number of very helpful and friendly staff.  We had a genuinely enjoyable stay and I will most certainly be returning with my other half for a leisure trip in the not too distant future. ,5,2017,09,05
129,"Perfect, as always","My favourite hotel in London by far. Great size roomsthat are chic and  in good condition (unkike other places I've stayed at). Very friendly and professional staff. Fantastic, central  location - tubes, taxis and busses right on your doorstep.",5,2017,09,04
129,Short Break,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights- the staff were cheery,helpful and efficient . A tapas dinner in the Apero restaurant was very good,as were the breakfasts on both days ( we opted for the buffet,but there was a substantial a la carte available). Our deluxe room was clean and comfortable, although wardrobe space was limited and the bathroom small. We also had a problem operating the air-con, but didn't report it- we simply opened the window. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel- its location is excellent in South Kensington, and only c 50 m from the Tube. ",4,2017,09,03
129,Stylish hotel in lovely South Kensington,"Our family of four throughly enjoyed our recent stay at the Ampersand Hotel.  Our positive experience began with the reservations manager at Ampersand - she was helpful and thoughtful about how we could save money on our booking.  The hotel is elegant and is full of cheerful character.  We found every member of staff professional and helpful.  We also loved the location of the hotel, being so close to the South Kensington subway station, as well as to Kensington Gardens, other attractions.  South Kensington is a very posh, residential neighbourhood, our favourite place to stay in London!",5,2017,09,02
129,Lovely hotel,"Great hotel less than 5 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station.  Clean, fresh appearance.  Very friendly staff throughout.  Breakfast selection is very good.  Had dinner in the Apero restaurant which was lovely and a great atmosphere.",5,2017,09,02
129,Luxurious and contemporary at its best! ,"Couldn't fault our stay! My friend and I treated ourselves to a night in London with a girly shopping trip & afternoon tea! The afternoon tea was fantastic, as was the complimentary glass of champagne we received upon arrival (part of the deal we booked). Very helpful staff, beautiful luxurious rooms, so clean and comfortable yet contemporary.....and I can't help but think that for an interior designer and a personal stylist to be happy with absolutely everything is rather rare!! We normally would comment on at least one thing we were unsure of, but everything was perfect! 
Tube station was less than a five min walk, breakfast was fantastic. The staff made the stay for us too, extremely attentive yet not fussy. 
We even had a complimentary little box of chocolates delivered to our door on a cake stand, fabulous little touches!! 
The beds were huge & so comfortable that we slept and missed most of the morning shopping in London!! 
Won't bother looking at another place to stay in central London again, I'll just keep going back here. in fact I'm thinking of taking my husband next month to continue my shopping trip!! 
",5,2017,09,02
129,Short stay,"The best nights sleep in a hotel bed ever!!!
Across the road to South Kensington station lots of local restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance. Staff great hotel very clean and decor quirky.
We will be back.",5,2017,09,02
129,Heart of South Ken,"Couple ged 30 and 35

we stayed for one night. The evening of my 30th birthday. 

We checked in late (around 11.30PM) the service a d check in news terrible. One of the guys in particular had a very bad attitude and appeared to be looking down on us.

The room was classical modern, huge bed and bed headboard and very comfortable bed. The bathroom had beautiful subway tiles, robes, slippers and l'occitane products. The shower was a big raindrop shower with a smaller hand held shower head too. The underfloor heating was a nice touch.

The hotel is great proximity to South Ken underground.",4,2017,09,02
129,Great hotel find in London!,"The location is very convenient, only a few steps from the South Kensington Underground station and particularly convenient when getting into town using the Underground from Heathrow.  I found the staff to be friendly, helpful and efficient.  My modern nicely decorated room was a very good size, well appointed with a comfortable king size bed and sofa. The room was quiet considering it overlooked the street.  There are lots of nearby shops and eateries and the museums are an easy walk.  This is definitely a hotel I will return to in this fabulous city.

129,Excellent boutique hotel in brilliant location.,"After staying twice a year for 23 years at a nearby competitors hotel, we thought it was time to try somewhere else. We choose the Ampersand because of its location and the fact it was recently renovated. We were not disappointed. The rooms are wonderfully appointed as we're the lobby and drawing room areas.  The service by all staff was of the highest standard. They really made you feel welcomed. 
We have found our new base for our ongoing visits to London. Thank you Ampersand Hotel",5,2017,09,01
129,The Ampersand - gem in South Kensington,My favorite hotel in London - perhaps anywhere. Ideal location. Wonderful staff who go above and beyond to create the best experience.  Excellent tea and breakfast. Lovely decor. Most highly recommended. ,5,2017,09,01
129,What a gem!,"Impeccably decorated with all the comforts you could ask for.  Great location, with the tube across the street, plenty of dining options, within 5 minutes and the most delightful dining room on sight.   Staff working the breakfast were especially great.   Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will be back! ",5,2017,08,31

129,Luxury in South Kensington,"We stayed for 5 nights in a Deluxe Double room. It was really spacious with a comfortable bed and wonderful amenities. It even had a TV in the bath! It was in the perfect location for exploring London, with the underground a 2 minute walk away. The staff were all extremely friendly and very helpful. Will stay there next time.",5,2017,08,30
129,Why look anywhere else....,"Service:
The staff at the Ampersand Hotel is consistently friendly and helpful. My husband and I are always in and out of our Hotel and everyone always provided top service. We arrived to check in around 3pm and we were hurriedly greated by staff as we were getting out of the car. She assited our driver with our bags and walked us to the check in lobby. The staff at check in were very personable. Check in didnt feel like a business transaction but rather than a warm welcome and a getting to know you bit. We were informed of all extra services the hotel can provide and was led to our room. Once we arrived at the room we were toured around and demonstrated functions of lights,thermostat,etc. Throughout our stay the staff was always consistenly friendly and warm.Everyone is very approachable and knowledgable with the area.

Hotel Room:
The hotel room was very spectacular. We could not have asked for anything better. We stayed at one of their surperior rooms. The space was smaller than any standard hotel room in the US but it was enough space for two people. The room was decorated mondernly with an outdoor bird theme. Eventhough it was on the small side, there was still plently of space to move around. The bed was tremendously comfortable. Soft sheets and perfeclty fluffed pillows. We tried not to lay on it too much during the day becasue it was a danger zone for naps. The room consisted of complimentary beverages such as coffee, tea, still and sparkling water, milk,juice, and soda. If for any reason you need more, they are happy to refill your fridge. This alone was a shock because you can never experience that in a standard hotel room in the US without paying sky rocket prices.In addition, you can expect 2 sets of robes/slippers, luxury toiletries, heated bathroom floors, soft towles, and many other grooming necessities. The highlight of the room was the complimentary cellphone that you can use throughout your visit. The phone included unlimited data, preloaded travelling apps and free calls to a handful of countries including the US. You can also utilize it to book reservations for anything at a low cost due to connections with the hotel. This made our stay and visit very stress free since cellphone companys charge ridiculous fees for interantional usage.

Location: 
The Ampersand Hotel is location in the South Kensington district. It is less than a block away from South Kensignton tube station where you can find the Piccadilly and Cirlcle/District line.",5,2017,08,29
129,Stylish and conveniently located but not cheap,"We stayed overnight during a short trip to central London to enjoy the museums, the theatre and to meet up with family.   The hotel was well located within a few metres of the tube but the second floor ""Superior"" room was level with the top floor of buses going by which was somewhat disconcerting! However, the room was well insulated and the very efficient air-con meant that keeping windows closed was an option even on a hot day.  The room was rather small for 2 people given that most of the floor space was occupied by the huge bed and there was very little space for storing luggage or clothes because the wardrobe was partly filled by the safe.  The shower room was spotlessly clean and the underfloor heating made it very pleasant to use.  Our room service breakfast arrived punctually and was varied and included lots of freshly prepared food.  We had booked at a special bargain rate but I think at full rate it would be rather expensive for what it offered.",4,2017,08,29
129,"Lovely Hotel, great location! Will be back ","We are in London for a short break and booked this hotel as it is close to the South Kensington museums. We couldn't have picked a better place. Small luxury hotel, very friendly staff and so close to the V&A, Science and Natural History museums. 2 minutes walk from the Tube station and you can easily get to West End. Sightseeing buses stop just outside the hotel and there are so many restaurants around the area. The staff are very friendly and the place is child friendly. Breakfast is very good too and you can enjoy afternoon tea or relax with a drink. Will be back. Thank you ",5,2017,08,26
129,Very nice hotel,"No complaints at all. It is just that I only give 5 stars to really outstanding places and this didn't quite clear that high hurdle. Well located and helpful, friendly staff.

Cute decorations and themes.",4,2017,08,26
129,Fantastic Hotel!  More Than 5 Stars!!!!,"From check-in to check-out everything about the Ampersand Hotel was extraordinary.  The staff was friendly, helpful & professional.  Our room was well appointed, beautifully decorated & had exactly what you would want for a stay in London.  The extra touches in the room - complimentary mini bar, free Google phone with free phone home internationally& local maps, daily newspaper & the list goes on, really added to the enjoyment of our vacation.  The location is perfect for dining, museums & the Tube.  You can walk to many different restaurants, coffee shops & pubs.  The South Kensington station is a 2 minute walk to the Piccadilly line, Circle line & District line.  You can get anywhere in London on these lines.  If we are lucky enough to be back in London for another vacation, there is ZERO doubt, the only place we will stay is the Ampersand Hotel.",5,2017,08,26
129,Well they always get it right!!!!,"We must have stayed more than a dozen times with the Ampersand Hotel and they always maintain the same standard and ensure their guests get the best. The staff is always helpful and friendly. They offer value for money. Guys keep it up, well done!!!",5,2017,08,24
129,Wonderful stay in London,"Our stay at the Ampersand was wonderful; excellent quality of room, extremely clean, helpful staff and nice breakfast. Good restaurant and nice neighbourhood with plenty oggi good restaurants. I'd definitely choose this hotel again for a London stay ",5,2017,08,23
129,Excellent boutique hotel,"Loved this place! Decor is beautiful and very interesting. Room was on the small side but very luxurious with beautiful toiletries, bath robes etc. Loved the bar area, felt it was a great atmosphere. Staff very attentive and friendly. Breakfast was also very good. Only negative was that we could hear the underground but hotel is so good we could see past this. Will definitely go back.",5,2017,08,23
129,Loved the Ampersand,"Great neighborhood and location.  Our suite with kitchenette and balcony was very comfortable and had everything we needed.  The kitchenette had adequate supply of complimentary non-alcoholic drinks and cutlery, so we were able to have meals as we wanted on the balcony. 
We paid at the time of booking, which make the price more affordable.",5,2017,08,22
129,Amazing Ampersand,"The Ampersand Hotel is very easy to find from the South Kensington station.  It is on the Picadily line which you can get direct from Heathrow.  We arrived just before 11am and was delighted to be told our room was ready which allowed us to freshen up before making the most of our first day in London.  Our room (302) had everything you required, lovely d√©cor.  On the small side but from the photos you could upgrade to a larger room.  It was just right for us, after all we were in London to explore not to stay in our room.  Our ensuite had a wonderful large shower, lovely toiletries and I liked the touches of the bath robes & slippers.  
Breakfast was included in our package and this was a very well presented buffet with a wide selection.  If you wished you could also order a cooked breakfast, we did not feel the need as there was plenty to choice.  
We always found the staff to be very attentive & polite.  There was nothing I can think of to fault our stay and would definitely stay again.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby.  We never ate at the hotel in the evening but the menu was very tempting.  
I would not hesitate to recommend and would love to return.",5,2017,08,22
129,Excellent Boutique Hotel in a wonderful South Kensington location.,"Beautiful rooms, great service, and very convenient location, with easy access to all tourist sights using the underground station located just a few steps from the front door of this hotel. South Kensington is an ideal area to stay, upscale with great restaurants and not as busy as the other areas of the city yet only one or two short underground stops away from all the sights. ",5,2017,08,22
129,Excellent All Round,"I can't thank the team at the Ampersand enough. I chose the hotel as good location and big, comfortable enough room for myself and my bridesmaids to get ready in what I ended up with was amazing customer service. Your porter must've been up to my room about a million times on the morning of the wedding and always with a smile on his face. The team at check-in were great and my whole family who I'd recommended stay there were also impressed and very happy.
Would recommend and I hope to find a reason to stay there again even though it's in my home city! ",5,2017,08,22
129,Ampersand,"Best hotel ever, nice room best service.
Great area, near the subway, easy to get in to picadilly
Fantastic staff, and clean room and free drinks in the mini bar.
We will stay here the next time we are in London",5,2017,08,21
129,Nice place for a leisurely stay.,"We booked as an indulgence for a theatre and museum visit to London and really enjoyed it. The location is perfect for the museums and transport elsewhere, and the hotel decor is a bit eclectic and rather lovely. The service was  a bit hit and miss, they aimed for friendly excellence and mostly achieved it but fell down in a few quite minor ways (didn't seem to read the booking requests, forgot a pre-ordered newspaper etc..). The room we had was described as Superior and was very well appointed and decorated but was quite small, almost entirely taken up by the huge comfortable bed. Not sure if they had any Inferior rooms, there wouldn't have been anywhere to put your bags in anything smaller..? We didn't use the restaurant but did enjoy the ""Science"" themed high tea, planet shaped cakes and dry ice, awesome! We also had a Continental Breakfast in our room and that was actually one of the best selections I've had, almost healthy too. A summary would be that it's a lovely and convenient place to stay, quite expensive but worth it as long as you don't need acres of space in the room.",4,2017,08,21
129,"Amazing botique hotel, great location, outstanding friendly staff",Great hotel well located with amazing staff.  The rooms are very comfortable and a good size.  Well priced for the London market.  Located a two minute walk to Kensington station.  Easy walk to Hyde park and the queens house. ,5,2017,08,20
129,Perfect Design Location in London,"We stayed 5 Nights and loved to be in the Middle of Kensington, being able to get to intersting places very quickly.
Service was really nice and helpfull.
Rooms are nicely designed, clean, Minibar Softdrinks for free. Our son loved ""the Handy"" for free! Good idea!",5,2017,08,20
129,Fantastic place and excellent stay,"Best location, excellent stay, still to recommend after the 2nd experience in London. Price/quality is the best we had. You are very well connected and a lot of choice in case you want to stay in the area

129,Top quality hotel,"Stayed here recently for three nights, and everything was excellent.  Highest quality, luxurious accommodations in one of the nicest parts of London.  Just a few steps from S. Kensington subway stop, very safe area at night with lots of cafes and shops.  Short walk to lovely Hyde Park.  Staff were friendly and extremely helpful.  I couldn't ask for more.",5,2017,08,18
129,"Excellent Hotel, Amazing Staff","We have just returned from a night at the Ampersand. The hotel location was amazing. So close to all museums and Hyde Park. The staff really made our stay comfortable, looking after me and my two young children. Breakfast was lovely and lots to choose from. Would highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2017,08,18

129,Great customer service and location.,"The hotel is lovely, stylish throughout.   All the staff were very helpful, friendly and efficient, they couldn't do enough to ensure our stay was a positive experience. The room was clean and comfortable but a little small for the money. ",4,2017,08,14
129,Lovely place and people,"It's always a risk staying somewhere for the first time, particularly for a holiday. The highly ranked reviews I can more than support. We simply loved this hotel for its location, very high standard of cleanliness, service, decor, maintenance and most welcoming, hospitable staff. The people all appeared to love working at the hotel from the door staff to those servicing the rooms. The level of formality was neither too much or too little. It's also nice to see all staff well presented in their uniforms appropriate to role which had clearly allowed for integration with the hotel's design theme whilst being comfortable and 'en vogue' for the staff. The breakfast buffet is a good selection with some quite special bakes and suppliers amongst them. The routines they have for room servicing are well polished and they do thoroughly clean and tidy your room even when staying multiple nights. 

Can I suggest any improvements? No. This is now our benchmark. We intend to return later in the year. 

Thank you to everyone at the hotel, your hard work, high standards and personable approach to guests are valued and do make a difference.",5,2017,08,13
129,Lovely hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in the South Kensington section of London.  It is very convenient to getting around and also provides some quiet from the crowds. Only one block from the tube, Victoria and Albert, Royal Albert Hall, Harrods and more are a short walk away  Hotel has lovely decor with very nice touches of original artwork.  The restaurant on site has an excellent menu and there are many additional restaurants within a short walk. We would stay here again!",5,2017,08,12

129,Bad week to stay,"We stayed during Wimbledon and prices were high and all London hotels busy.  However we decided to pay the premium because we enjoyed our previous stay.  The hotel is lovely and well located, easy walk to V&A, Harrods and South Kensington Tube.

However we were put in a room lowest level at the back with a view of the aircon units or something equally unattractive. On request we were promptly moved.  But the linen and towels  in the room were tired  and should have been binned.  We gave our feedback and the hotel responded appropriately.  

Not quite what I was expecting, but hopefully this was just very unfortunate.",3,2017,08,12
129,"Nice decoration, great location, lovely people ","I stayed on the top floor suite. Wonderful room! Little balcony for you to look over the roof tops of London. The underfloor heating in the bathroom is a thumbs up! They also got a little kitchenette inside my suite, which got most of the things you would need. Only thing is that the water outlet in the kitchenette tends to fall n spilt out from the sink. Maybe the water outlet is too strong. Overall this is a super nice hotel in a convenient location. I would definitely come to stay at ampersand again. ",5,2017,08,12
129,Wonderful place and great location!,This is a perfect hotel. The location is great and the staff is amazing. We had great meals from recommendations from Beatriz at the front desk. Breakfast is wonderful as is the unique high tea! One interesting perk is the free mini bar (sans alcohol) which is replaced on a daily basis. Room 208 is perfectly situated on the street side with a balcony.,5,2017,08,11
129,High Quality Hotel,"Everything about this hotel was high quality from the location, the congeniality of the staff, and the room itself.  We especially enjoyed the heated floor in the bathroom and the umbrella's available to borrow for rainy London days!",5,2017,08,11
129,The best afternoon tea experience ever!,"The science themed afternoon tea was an absolute delight. It wasn't just gimmick either, everything on those plates tasted absolutely divine. The scones especially - so fluffy and melt in the mouth. The attention to detail on everything was beautiful and the service and settings lovely. I'd highly recommend - well worth the money!",5,2017,08,11
129,Excellent hotel,"Excellent stay in an excellent hotel. Lovely hotel with very good service. Great location nearby shops, restaurants, museums of exhibition road, buses and metro lines. Ten to fifteen minutes walking from Harrods and kensington palace.",5,2017,08,11
129,Trendy Hotel,We stayed for 2 nights.  Rooms were small but comfortable.  Staff was attentive and professional. Restaurant recommendations by staff were great. Location was very close to the Underground and restaurants.,5,2017,08,10
129,Fabulous Hotel!,We stayed here from 4-7 August 2017. It was our second time to stay at the beautiful hotel. We were in a deluxe studio room which was beautiful. There's a nespresso machine & complimentary mini bar which they kept well stocked. The location of the hotel is fabulous. Literally a 3 minute walk from the tube station. The staff were super friendly and very accommodating. We had drinks in the bar and found the selection vast. We asked for a late check out and it was no problem. I would highly recommend this wonderful hotel and look forward to returning when we visit London again.,5,2017,08,08
129,london stay,As usual a friendly staff who receives you and makes your stay as pleasant as possible. A clean room near to the underground and close to several museums. pitty there is no terrace. check-out was ok and correct.,4,2017,08,08
129,disappointed!,overall decreased quality. i had been there a couple of times with my family in the past and was keen to come back but expectations were disappointed. cleanliness and accurancy in decorations in the rooms not worth the price of the rooms!,3,2017,08,08
129,Great Aniverary Trip,"A very romantic trip for our first aniversary. Got a free upgrade & some personalised lovely chocolates during the turndown service

Would definitely visit again, and would recommend it for those wanting to visit South Ken.",5,2017,08,07
129,Mixed Bag,"There were a lot of positives about the hotel, such as the proximity to the South Kensington tube station, the size of the rooms (we had the suite and deluxe studio), that they restock the refrigerator with free water, soda, juice and milk, and the free cell phone for each room.  

However, there were a number of negatives that really outweighed the positives.  First off, the staff were not very friendly or accommodating.  We had booked the rooms months in advance, requesting to be on the same floor.  We were two floors apart, and it was not quick or easy to get to the other room.  We were staying a week, and they did not offer to try to move us -- I had to keep checking every day, until a few days in, they were finally able to move one room so that we could be on the same floor.  

The floors are very creaky, so I heard one set of customers saying they could not stay.  One room's door would not fully close and lock unless it was slammed.  The air conditioning seems to shut off at night, so we got uncomfortably hot each night.  In contrast, in one of the rooms, the water in the shower didn't get very hot at all, so it was not enjoyable to shower there.  The beds were lumpy and the Wi-Fi was really slow.  Strangely in the suite, there was only one sink in the bathroom, while in the studio there were two.  Also, they don't have luggage carts, so it was awkward to watch the porter trying to lug the luggage down the halls one by one.

Perhaps if the service had been more friendly and accommodating, it would've been easier to overlook some of these issues with the rooms.  Considering the price we paid for the rooms, I don't think the positive outweighed the negatives in terms of the worth of the rooms.",3,2017,08,06
129,Group afternoon tea,"I booked an afternoon tea for twenty-five people for my 30th. We were in the Games Room, which was just for our group. Organising the day was very straight-forward, the events team replied to emails promptly and were very helpful, even adding a high chair for my nephew. The afternoon tea itself was lovely- really tasty with plenty of quirky tasty additions. They accidentally brought us the wrong bagels but were quick to change this. We had the room for 4 hours which was more than enough time. I'd definitely recommend them!",5,2017,08,06
129,Non-Functioning Room,"Due to the great reviews I was really looking forward to my stay and was terribly disappointed in receiving a room with a lot of problems (phones, a/c, bathroom fan -- all not working, plus a VERY slippery and dangerous bathtub). Being gone the next day the hotel had 7 HOURS to fix everything (I provided a list) and fixed almost nothing, even though I had been told upon my return that EVERYTHING had been fixed. When I called to say that only the phone had been fixed I got a lot of confused hemming and hawing, and ""we'll talk to the engineer"", etc., forcing me to demand that I receive a new room (the practically non-existent air con was the worst problem, as it was warm and humid outside). Is it really that hard to ensure that things like the telephone and air conditioning are actually functioning? The service was awful and I was offered zero compensation for my time and trouble. Absolutely unacceptable. The decor is beautiful and the hotel is in a great location, but I would never recommend it to anyone. Great service is not just a smile at the front desk. You have to make sure your customers are actually getting what they are paying for and, if they don't get it, offer them something in return. This experience really affected my trip and I truly hope they step up their service so that it doesn't impact other people's stays as well.",2,2017,08,06
129,A Wonderful Stay,"We only stayed three nights but the staff at the Ampersand were helpful, and the room very comfortable.  We found the location perfect with the tube just down the street, and felt safe at all times.  We would definitely stay here again!",4,2017,08,04
129,Comfort and convenience,"We chose this hotel based on many favorable reviews and its location in Kensington.  The hotel was very clean and comfortable with lots of amenities--even had heated floor tiles in the bathroom.  The Hop-On-Hop-Off bus stopped right in front of the hotel and there is an Underground station half a block away.  It was pricey though.  Still, I would recommend the hotel, but look elsewhere for morning coffee and transportation back to the airport.",5,2017,08,02
129,"Delightful hotel experience in South Kensington, London","Quirky, luxurious with attentive and friendly staff and delightful decor! We loved the Ampersand experience, close to Hop on/off bus and other transport. We felt spoilt in our beautiful room. Comfy beds, light-filled with large double-glazed windows, with good block- out curtains. Loved the luxurious toiletries, complete with Ampersand bath duck!",5,2017,08,02
129,July 2017,"Great location. Great hotel, rooms very small but comfortable.  Very clean and in room facilities were great.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Bed was a bit lumpy and may need a new mattress, that is the only fault that I can think of.  Everything was great and definately recommend The Ampersand.",4,2017,08,01
129,Stunning Boutique Hotel,"A beautiful boutique hotel in South Kensington. Nothing was too much trouble for the courteous and vigilant staff, we were made to feel very welcome. 

The room was spacious and clean, whilst there were plentiful amenities for our personal use. There was a free smartphone in the room loaded with apps and useful info, which i believe would be incredibly handy for someone from outside of the UK, for us though it wasn't really necessary.

Very near to South Kensington station, the location is ideal and was only around a 20 min tube journey to Kings Cross. 

Overall, would highly recommend for that extra bit of class and comfort.",5,2017,08,01
129,"Boutique, stylish, personal",A stylish hotel with excellent service and a personal touch. Standard rooms are quite small but we were lucky enough to be given a suite which was spacious and very comfortable. Very near the natural history museum. Great restaurants nearby. ,4,2017,07,31
129,Lovely way to start our trip,"A friend recommended the Ampersand Hotel to us. We did an advance booking/payment to get a better deal since we traveled there during the height of summer. The hotel arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport and also a tour of the city. Both were excellent. The hotel itself was lovely. We really enjoyed the comfortable and well appointed room. The staff was helpful and friendly. And the lobby/cafe were a fun spot to hang out when needed. But the best thing about this hotel is its location. It's right near the Tube, and there are plenty of high quality restaurants to eat at for any meal. We would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again.",5,2017,07,30
129,Work and Play,Staying for a week we enjoyed a great base for exploring the museums whilst also working in central London. Friendly and attentive staff made our small family feel wonderfully at home.  We have stayed before and will definitely be returning. ,5,2017,07,30
129,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"Innovative, delicious and generous food, served with good humour and great attention.  It seems to be customary to add a 12.5% discretionary tip everywhere in London and here we didn't begrudge a penny.  The service was impeccable and the food a delight in every way.  We came across the Ampersand from a Google search sheltering from the rain under the arches of the Brompton Oratory when most other afternoon teas seemed booked out. Our good fortune and we can heartily recommend afternoon tea and the warm welcome at The Ampersand Hotel near South Kensington tube.",5,2017,07,29
129,Ampersand - lovely hotel in a great location,"We recently stayed for 5 nights at the Ampersand.  It is a lovely boutique hotel, conveniently located across the street from the South Kensington tube stop.  The front desk staff was always professional and ready to help, although there was a range of knowledge among the staff about recommending restaurants etc.  They don't have a dedicated concierge so front desk staff fulfills that function.  There is a lovely, cozy bar/restaurant on the lower level and a parlor/tea room off the lobby.  The bathroom in our room was spacious, with two sinks and heated floors (!).  The location is wonderful - easy to walk to V&A museum, Tube stop across the street, many excellent cafes and restaurants in the area, and the fancy shopping area with Harrods etc. only about a mile away.  The only drawbacks:  our room was quite small, with no dresser, which was disappointing, as for 5 nights it would be nice not to live out of a suitcase.  In addition, the air conditioning in the room was tepid at best and we were quite hot at night.  To be fair however, we failed to mention this during our stay and I'm sure they would have dealt with this had we done so.  Overall, a lovely hotel.",4,2017,07,29
129,Wonderful hotel in a wonderful location ,"I booked the Ampersand Hotel through Small Luxury Hotels and was not disappointed. They're attention to details of comfort and service made our stay most enjoyable. So many thoughtful things put into design, master light switch by bed, high-tech temperature control, enough outlets, including accessible ones by bed, heated bathroom floors...all added to our comfort. We loved the location in tony Kensington, surrounded by an array of fabulous restaurants and steps away from the V&A. Harrods is an easy 15 minute walk. The staff is friendly, professional and most helpful. Thank you Ampersand for making our last few days in London so enjoyable. ",5,2017,07,28
129,Class and service combined harmoniously,"Check in was a breeze, but we had arrived early, so the reception took care of our bags for us. 

Arriving back to the hotel later in the afternoon, we collected our keys and found that our bags had already been deposited in our room. This told us everything we needed to know about the service to expect. 

The room was spotless; compact, but we had only paid for a small double room. The standard and finish of the room was immaculate. 

We did not stay for breakfast, so couldn't comment on that - but the experience that we did have was perfect.",5,2017,07,28
129,Great,"Great location. Friendly staff. Deluxe room size is fine. Access to taxi, buses and underground station. Hotelvis surrounded by many restaurants of different cousins and coffee shops.walking distance tn knights bridge street ",5,2017,07,28
129,Our stay at The Ampersand Hotel,"The room was quite small, and our sleep was disturbed when the fire alarm went off at 2am, and we were unable to get back to sleep as we were flying out the next day.
The staff were very friendly and apologised for the alarm disturbance.
The room was quiet and very clean as was the bathroom.",5,2017,07,27
129,Awesome !!,"Great atmosphere, design & details. 
Deluxe room slightly tighted for a couple + additional bed. 
Great location (1 block from tube)
Great rest√≥ Apero, both for breakfast & dinner
And finally & best, the warm attention .. 
It all worth every pound..
I would come back ",5,2017,07,27
129,"Beautiful Design, Comfortable Room",This is a lovely hotel that is very comfortable and quiet with a beautiful sense of design. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent--right next to the So. Kennsington tube stop in a beautiful neighborhood with lots of restaurants. Try Muriel's Kitchen for breakfast.,5,2017,07,26
129,Excellent 5-stars Boutique Hotel,"I love this 5 stars boutique hotel. Friendly staffs, comfortable room and everything is very detail. The location is super, only minutes walk to V&A museum, The Natural History Museum and walking distance to Harrods. I love the neighborhood. Great staying at the hotel.",5,2017,07,25
129,Posh Elegance,"Loved everything about this property! Beautiful large rooms, excellent decor, lots of little extras in the bathroom, great water pressure, plenty of space to hang clothes (would like more drawers, however). Staff was lovely. Restaurant was great. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,07,24
129,First adresse in Kensington,"I cant find a better place to stay ! The staff the room the design just a combination of 5* plus !  They provided me with a lovely upgrade, the minibar is included, the breakfast is outstanding you will not want to leave ",5,2017,07,23
129,Excellent location and very nice staff,"One of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at, I would definitely return to the Ampersand in the future. First, the location is just unbeatable: Right next to South Kensington station, you can practically go anywhere in London using this station. Second, the food scenery around the hotel is incredible: Healthy restaurants, burger joints, hidden cool spots and pubs. Third, the staff is accommodating and helpful. There is a sense of home in this hotel.
On the other hand, while my room had everything I needed, it was relatively small (especially the bathroom). The bed was super comfy and the room pretty clean. The mini-bar is complimentary, which is a huge plus. They also provide you with an umbrella (within the closet), which is of course needed in London. I tried using the gym, but it was so tiny that I couldn't. Not a big deal... Walking around London is a workout in itself.
Sleep quality is good overall. However, since it's an old (modernized) facility, I could hear the stepping noise of the room above mine. Not a big issue for me since I use earplugs when I sleep.
This hotel pays attention to details; and although not perfect, I couldn't imagine myself staying somewhere else.",5,2017,07,23
129,Excellent hotel in great location,A proper 5* hotel with very friendly staff and good services.  My wife and I stayed 3 nights in July and we really enjoyed it and will return. The breakfast restaurant has a fantastic buffet included in the room rate.,5,2017,07,23
129,Nice hotel with great service,"This is definitely a very nice hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. Close to underground station, also with the Natural History Museum and Science Museum nearby. Very convenient for visitors. Will come back and stay at this hotel in the future.",4,2017,07,22
129,"Great hotel & location, small room","This is a beautiful hotel in a great location (near the metro, pedestrian zone w restaurants & bars as well as the Albert & Victoria Museum) with the most impressing and friendly staff - there wasn't a problem or favor they couldn't address or fix! The lobby, public areas and restaurants are beautifully decorated and furnished, as well as the room. However, our room, while beautiful and comfy with a lovely walk-out patio, was unfortunately cramped - but we weren't disappointed enough to bother asking about moving to a different room. The main problem with the rooms was the outlet for the hair dryer, which was bizzarely located inside the wardrobe at the far end of the room, making my morning routine very awkward. We did not eat there so can't comment on that",5,2017,07,21
129,Great hotel with great location,Awesome hotel with a perfect location. Right off the tube and lots of places to eat and shop a rock the street. We had a great stay. The hotel is plush and the staff is great. They arrange excursions for you and have an arrangement with a car service for transportation to the airport. It is very convenient as the price is fixed and reliable.,5,2017,07,20
129,Great Location - Very Small Room...,"Great location, steps from South Kensington metro station. The staff were wonderful - room and hotel were extremely clean and lovely. The reason for giving it three stars is because my room was EXTREMELY small to accommodate the size and amount of furniture - making it literally impossible to move around. Very poor space planning and not what I expected for a five star hotel - even for a room on the low end of their price scale.

",3,2017,07,20
129,Very disappointing,"We booked 2 x rooms back in May and paid in advance.  Very disappointed to therefore arrive at 4pm in afternoon to find our rooms were not ready.  Totally unacceptable and disappointing.  Our time in London was very short and we wasted our precious time soothing out this problem.
The overall ambience of the place is 2nd rate and does not match the price of the hotel.  Have stayed in plenty of places in London and this is not good value for money.",1,2017,07,19
129,Super hotel in great location,"I cannot say enough good things about the Ampersand hotel.   The hotel is located in a great location, really close to the metro station and walking distance to lots of museums and shops. Our room was spacious (deluxe studio), clean, and very well maintained.  The food at the Apero restaurant was great. We dined there every single night.  Excellent hotel and amazing staff.",5,2017,07,19
129,"Very good, nice quieter posh location right next to the underground.","Old building, one of the elevators was a having a repair and had delays getting the room ready; they gave me and my girlfriend a complimentary drink at the lounge which was quite nice.  Once we got to the room it was a good size (the plus sized room) allowing me to feel relaxed and quite at home.  I get the sense rooms are usually smaller, so I was glad to have upgraded.",4,2017,07,18
129,Wimbledon Visit,"Stayed several times now and always excellent. Not cheap but as the saying goes ""you get etc, etc""
Go for the superior room or better if budget allows. Drawing room for tea or drink excellent. Note may have to reserve. Bar etc downstairs very good value.",5,2017,07,18
129,GREAT LOCATION,"Four night stay during London heatwave and we were very comfortable in our air conditioned room. Great location across the street from Sth Kensington tube with V & A and Natural History Museum close by. Lots of good restaurants in the area as well as hotel restaurant which seems popular with locals as well as guests. Good size room for London boutique hotel but found the climb in and out of the shower in the bath a trial, unfortunately no rooms available at the time with walk in shower. Great staff and lovely atmosphere and design. Recommend.",5,2017,07,17
129,London in July,"Hotel is nice, clean and modern and in a great location next to underground. However, the classic double room is too small. A full bed hardly qualifies as a double room. On a positive note, all the cool places in Chelsea, Kensington and Sloan Sq. are within walking distance which is wonderful.",4,2017,07,17
129,Nice location - average hotel,"Nice hotel, but not luxury. Rooms are a little to small. Very nice area. Nice lounge room next to the reception. We had a room towards the backyard which made it quiet. May stay again, but not necessary on top of my list. ",3,2017,07,17
129,"Super location, very good service standards","I always stay at The Amerpsand and have been for at least the past 4 years. The location is excellent, with South Kensington tube station literally a few steps away, and Hyde Park/V&A/Natural History Museum/Harrods all within walking distance. The level of service and friendliness of the staff is superb. The Apero does very good drinks in the evening. The Ampersand is very good value for money considering its location. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room facing away from Harrington Road.",5,2017,07,16
129,Experiencia perfecta,"Lovely hotel with lovely staff.  The train station was just steps away,the bed is perfectly comfortable, and the bathroom has also good size,Attention to detail was fabulous the staff is really involver to the customer. Tracey was so nice with ours explain us every place where we can go, they have a Spanish porter, Javier he was really helpfull with us , Because we can speak with him in our language and he help us since the chek in just in the door with the luggage, and in the chek out the same.

Te food was really lovely too, impressive plates.

We going to come back, sure.",5,2017,07,16
129,Great place yo stay,"The location of this hotel was what attracted us to begin with.  It is right near the South Kensington subway stop.  When we got there we realized what a great choice it was!  Everything about the hotel is outstanding....staff, cleanliness etc.  Many great perks, such as a mobil phone to use while staying there, free water abd soda in mini bar, plush accomodations.  Just perfect!",5,2017,07,15
129,Yet again my favourite!,"How many times have I left a review? Countless I think, despite a rather normal change of staff The Ampersand has yet to fail me on anything.
I think the continental breakfast offered is one of the richest and nicest in London within their cluster.
",5,2017,07,14
129,The Ampersand Hotel. Great hotel in a fabulous location,"Brilliant hotel. In a fabulous location. Lots of cafes, restaurants, shops and a great pub all within a short stroll. Use the underground. It's only 150 meters from the hotel. Brilliant. Taxi rank or buses at the door if you want. Fabulous hotel. Wonderful, courteous staff. Fabulous breakfast in a pleasant room. Wait staff terrific. We had a King bed. Just the best bed and pillows ever. Could not fault this hotel.  ",5,2017,07,14
129,We're back...........,"It has been six months since our last visit to the Ampersand, our third visit this year! I was really looking forward to coming back and wasn't disappointed as this hotel consistently delivers great service and beautiful rooms. As a business trip over eight-days, the stay was comfortable, especially given that we had arrived in the middle of London's heatwave and experienced the hottest day in 40 years. The hotel's air-conditioning service held and offered welcome relief to the relentless heat outdoors. My only feedback to the hotel is not to forget the little details - in this case the teabags. A small issue, I know, but when a hotel of this calibre delivers on all the mandatories, it is easy to be distracted by inconsistencies in the room. Not to worry, every request is promptly handled.",5,2017,07,14
129,"Single female traveler , happy happy, joy joy","The hotel exceeded all expectations.  As a solo female traveler, the hotel staff engaged tours and travel services accommodating my needs. The hotel is within walking distance of several museums and most importantly, Harrods. Black cabs are always in que outside of hotel. If you are a single female traveler, this hotel will meet all of your needs and wants.",5,2017,07,13
129,Escapism at its best,"I had a fantastic time staying at The Ampersand. The location is perfect - just across from the South Kensington tube station and the cluster of shops and eateries on Exhibition Road. What I loved most about the hotel was the attention to detail and the obvious thought that has gone into making sure guests are comfortable in their rooms: L'Occitane shower products, Dragonfly tea and a fully stocked fridge. They also have a quirky tea room on the first floor which I got to sample on the house - yummy sandwiches and tasty treats. A superb stay!",5,2017,07,13
129,Excellent Hotel,"Our room was spacious and comfortable and we did not go for the Deluxe double, just the regular double. Many european hotel rooms can be quite small and this one was surprisingly not.  More importantly to us, was the excellent location of the hotel.  It's close proximity to South Ken tube station made getting around easy and convenient.  There are lots of options for food in the vicinity as well.  I would stay clear of the expensive hotel breakfast ($50 for 2 a la carte breakfasts) when there are so many cheaper nice options just outside.  The tea room is lovely and the service is top notch.  I would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,07,11
129,Excellent Small Hotel,Lovely Hotel in a great location (3 minutes walk from South Kensington Tube) and considering where very quiet - we slept with the window open with no problem. We had a small double which is small but perfectly formed. The bathroom was lovely with L'Occitaine toiletries. TV has all the sports channels on and there is tea / cafetiere / small fridge with water / milk etc in so very well equipped.  We booked through Mr and Mrs Smith website - we got the same price as other websites but also got a free glass of champagne each and a box of petit fours.  For those of you who like middle eastern food (like Ottolenghi) there is an amazing restaurant about 2 minutes walk called Ceru.,5,2017,07,10
129,Watch out for valet parking,"Do not travel by car.  Was given no information about where to leave the car on arrival. There is a bus stop right outside with double yellows before that. We ended up on arrival behind the hotel but with no rear entrance we had to rely on staff to come and collect us and our luggage.
Staff forgot to bring car back to hotel after giving one hour's notice. Then we were told to ge a taxi. The taxi refused to take us. When car eventually was retrieved it had a rusty stain on the boot lid which I had to clean before departure fo Hampton Court (half an hour late!). On check out my car was parked around the corner up against the kerb there by damaging my alloys. Email will be on its way!",2,2017,07,09
129,"Loved, Loved, Loved","our stay at The Ampersand. It was only for one night but it was wonderful, everything was perfect. The staff, the rooms, the breakfast, the attention to every detail is what made our stay special. We will definitely stay here again when we return to London.",5,2017,07,08
129,Excellent in Every Way,"Service, room bed, bath, amenities were all outstanding. We love boutique hotels; this was among the best at which we've stayed. Terrific location in South Kensington near Victoria and Albert, Natural History, and Science Museums, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington and Hyde Park, and an easy walk to Knightsbridge. Would stay here again in s heartbeat. ",5,2017,07,07
129,Wonderful Hotel,Lovely hotel.  Wonder staff - very friendly and helpful.  They were available and efficient for all of our needs.  Comfortable bed and great location.  The drawing room was great for having tea and visiting.  ,5,2017,07,07
129,Great stay,"I had a great time at The Ampersand Hotel. Great staff, beautiful room and a perfect location, 30 seconds from South Kensington station. I can highly recommend this Hotel also for Families and Couples who will enjoy a fantastic time in this SLH Hotel. ",5,2017,07,06
129,Best hotel,I have found my hotel in London . Amazing place and location. Super clean and excellent service. Highly recommended. The Hotel staff is very polite and helpful. This hotel even offers you a mobile phone to take with you. For local callls and internet. ,5,2017,07,06
129,Second visit - still great. ,A return trip to the Ampersand. It's been several years since I first stayed here but it remains a special hotel and a luxe-feeling experience. Young staff were very helpful.  Dining at the downstairs bistro was terrific. My room was quite small but I was traveling solo.  Lovely room amenities and great location. I look forward to a return trip. ,5,2017,07,05
129,Perfect Stay,"We just returned from a lovely 5 night stay at The Ampersand. The location is unbeatable, and the hotel itself is  lovely.

Particularly appreciated the stocked mini fridge!

We stayed in a deluxe double, and didn't find the room to be too small at all (esp. for London!) 

We will return to The Ampersand for future London visits!",5,2017,07,03
129,London hotel,"We loved Ampersand.  The staff were helpful and courteous, the breakfast buffet was excellent and the location is prime.  We had easy access to museums, restaurants, theatre, shopping and the airport.   Couldn't be better!",5,2017,07,03
129,"Beautiful property, great location"," We recently stay for three nights at the gorgeous Ampersand Hotel. The location, just steps from South Kensington's tube station, was ideal for exploring. Staff was all extremely friendly and helpful-- not at all stuffy or distant, but very eager to help.  Collin went out of his way to assist us and give us suggestions. The bathroom was incredible ‚Äì heated floors, wonderful toiletries.  Our first floor (2nd floor to Americans!) room overlooked a school, yet was very quiet, cool, and serene. We enjoyed the coffee, tea, and complementary  soda, juice, and bottled water in the fridge. The Ampersand is so lovely it seems magical, yet the staff makes it accessible in every way. ",5,2017,07,02
129,"Couldn't fault it, a brilliant hotel",Fantastic location just next to South Kensington tube. Quiet rooms. Fantastic staff. Amazing cellar bar. Lovely cocktails. A real gem in the heart of London. Will definitely be back to stay again next time we stay over. ,5,2017,07,02
129,Highly recommend,"First of all the location is good. It's close to south kensington station and there're lots of places to visit like v&a museum, the natural history museum and so on. Design of room amenities are unique and there free mini bar including still water, sparkling water, apple juice, orange juice, milk, coffee, cookies and so on.",5,2017,07,02
129,"Wonderful stay, great staff in a lovely neighborhood!","I can't say enough good things about Ampersand hotel, the staff and its location in South Kensington. The porters and concierge were ever present and made sure every aspect of our stay was comfortable. We really appreciate all of the still and sparkling water that was (for free) in our mini refrigerator. The housekeeping staff was really great too- they noticed how much water we drink (after long days exploring London) and we were always stocked with a few extra bottles. The rooms have a cell phone which makes it easy to make local calls for free and there is free wifi all over the hotel. Bathrooms are nice, new and come with heated floors! The hotel is also very charming with decor based on music and science/astronomy throughout.
My husband really appreciated the technology hook ups located in the desk of our room. It allowed us to stream movies from our laptop on the TV while in bed. We were dealing with some serious jet lag coming from California so this was helpful! Although I have to stay British television is awesome because there are way fewer commercials lol. 
The bar/restaurant in the hotel called Apero has a really lovely food and drink menu. We had some delicious small plates and cocktails. The hotel breakfast, also served at Apero, had a substantial choice of food every morning. 
As for the neighborhood, we found it perfect for all of our needs. Very walkable, great restaurants, gelato everywhere and a short walk to Harrods and other shopping. We even discovered a farmers market on Saturday morning and if you like to run outdoors you will LOVE the location. 
We discovered Ampersand because we like SLH hotels and will be back again.
A big thank you to the brilliant staff that made our stay memorable!",5,2017,07,01
129,Great hotel,"Everything about this hotel is great. Room, service, location, staff. From the moment we entered the hotel, we were made welcome. The staff were all so nice & did it with a smile. Loved this hotel so much, we will definitely return. Location is great. Less than one minute to the underground. ",5,2017,07,01
129,Ampersand,"We received an excellent welcome at check in before being showed to our room and having everything explained. The room was small but immaculate and well equipped, with a comfortable bed and good shower. The staff were all very attentive and we had late night food in the drawing room which was very good.",5,2017,07,01
129,A phenomenal stay!,"We LOVED the Ampersand hotel.  Everyone was so accommodating and friendly and made us feel right at home in London.  One our second day we had a medical issue, and the Ampersand staff arranged for a doctor to come within 30 minutes!  This exemplifies the kind of attention to detail and general care that the Ampersand offered.  Highly recommend and can't wait to return ourselves soon!",5,2017,06,29
129,"3rd stay, consistently good","Our 3rd stay over the last 7 months and we especially enjoy the convenience to the tube, museums and restaurants in the nice South Kensington neighborhood. We have stayed in the same room each time, the hotel makes the effort to accommodate us, room 217 and it is so quiet, we haven't tried others. Towels, sheets and bedding are high quality, room is exceptionally clean and staff always friendly. Ampersand has become our must stay while in London.",5,2017,06,28
129,Perfect for Family Visit to London,"This was our first time bringing our children (ages 9, 8 and 6) to London, and the Ampersand was the perfect place to stay.  We booked a Superior room (with a king bed for myself and my wife) interconnecting with a Deluxe room (with twin beds plus an extra cot for our children), which was an ideal setup for a family of five.  Though not overly large, the rooms offered adequate space and storage, especially by London standards.  

Our rooms overlooked the street, but the double windows ensured that we heard very little noise.  The beds were very comfortable and the decor tasteful, with a bird theme in one room and a music theme in the other.  The spacious walk-in showers had good pressure and had glass doors (seems like a minor detail, but in Europe I all too often find inadequately enclosed showers that spray water all over the bathroom floor).  We especially appreciated that the minibars came stocked with complimentary water and other soft drinks.  

The staff were extremely kind and welcoming, and happy to provide sightseeing and dining advice.  We ate breakfast in Apero each morning and found the buffet well stocked and a good value (especially for the kids, at half price).  Good espresso drinks are made to order and included with the buffet.  We ordered room service for dinner on the night we arrived, and it was also very good and delivered promptly.

Finally, the location of the hotel was hard to beat for our purposes.  The Natural History Museum (a big hit with the kids), various other museums and Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens (especially appealing for runners like me) are all within a short walk, and there are many great restaurants and shops in the neighborhood.  The South Kensington tube stop is just down the block, giving easy access to the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines, and there are a bus stop and a taxi stand right outside the front door, making it extremely easy to get everywhere we wanted to go.  

I'm so glad we chose the Ampersand for this visit--I'd highly recommend it and would be very happy to return.",5,2017,06,28
129,Excellent Hotel,I stayed here twice in June 2017 both in small single and then in Deluxe room. The staff here is very helpful; the tearoom and dining room are lovely; location is the best. I will most definitely recommend this to friends.,5,2017,06,28
129,Ampersand in June 2017,"The hotel is very nice and quiet.  Our room was nice and the bathroom very nice.  Overall the staff was polite and efficient and helpful, though the doormen were not always present and at the door.  The hotel is very convenient to many restaurants and shopping.",4,2017,06,28
129,"Behind V&A, great neighborhood","Within 50m from South Kensington tube station, no switching trains from Heathrow, great neighborhood, 5min walk from V&A and National History museums, and tons of great caf√© and restaurants nearby. Doorman not always near the entrance where there are quite a few flights of stairs.

Matchbox sized room that fits one suitcase but very comfy bed and beddings, decent bathroom and amenities. Early check in wasn't available, but helpful reception staff",4,2017,06,28
129,Another Lovely Stay in London,"The location of this hotel is perfect for us, near the V&A and the tube stop. The room was comfortable, quiet, clean, convenient, and pleasant. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We look forward to staying a third time!",5,2017,06,27
129,Lovely boutique hotel,"Great location just across the road from underground station and wide selection of nearby restaurants.
Staff and service were great, breakfast menu and evening tapas were a refreshing change and offered good value. Expect some noise & vibrations from the nearby underground 
",5,2017,06,27
129,Quirky hotel with very tiny rooms and an strange take on afternoon tea.,"Good location and very nice staff. However the room was too small for two people (had to take turns moving about - and when's the last time you had a room too small for a desk?). Even so, the air conditioning was insufficient to keep the room comfortable. Oddest afternoon tea we've ever had. ",3,2017,06,26
129,This is now my favorite hotel in London.,"This was my seventh visit to London but my first visit to the Ampersand and I can't wait to return!  The entire experience was magical.  The location in South Kensington is excellent as it is close to the tube and there are many excellent restaurants nearby.  We stayed in a deluxe studio overlooking Harrington Road.  The room was clean, roomy and filled with natural light.  My personal treat was a Nespresso machine in the room.  Treat yourself to a stay at this lovely hotel....I'm glad I did. ",5,2017,06,25
129,very nice hotel,"very nice hotel, very close to V+A museum, opposite South Kensington tube station, rooms are comfortable with L'Occitan toiletries, breakfast excellent with very nice coffee and multiple newspapers to choose from",4,2017,06,25
129,Second visit to terrific hotel!,"This was our second stay at The Ampersand. From check-in through check-out every was perfection. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and a beautiful assortment of treats was delivered to the room as a special surprise from the hotel...very nice touch. Check-in was fast and efficient, the bed was very comfortable, and we greatly enjoyed Luca...the most wonderful bartender! We will definitely choose The Ampersand for future London visits and highly recommend this wonderful hotel in a top-notch location.",5,2017,06,24
129,Lovely boutique hotel,The Ampersand is a lovely boutique hotel very near to an underground station and a bus stop in front. The hotel's room was a decent size for London with a very comfortable bed and pillows. Breakfast was delicious with excellent options including omelettes and a very friendly staff. I heartily recommend the hotel if you need to stay in Kensington. I'll be back next year.,5,2017,06,24
129,Boutique Hotel in great location,"Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Our room was a good size, comfortable, modern and clean. The room freebies (refreshments) were a nice touch. Excellent location near South Kensington Tube Station (less than a 5 minute walk). Staff were really helpful and friendly. We were down celebrating my husband's birthday and the hotel provided us with a nice treat as a surprise! Would definitely stay here again. ",4,2017,06,23
129,Great Hotel in South Kensington,"Prior to our arrival I sent an email requesting an early check-in.  I received a response indicating this would be possible upon availability and dependent on when other guests vacate.  Fortunately, a room was available upon arrival.  At first it did not seem to be the most ideal room as it was toward the rear/east side of the building with only a view of the neighbors across the alley.  It was spacious, clean and quiet.  Even on the second floor, one can slightly feel the rumble of the train passing below.  Some reviews don't find this endearing but when you factor in the access of three underground lines just minutes away, it's a small price to pay and didn't bother me in the least.  If/when I return, I'll hold out for a front facing room.  The neighborhood is busy and entertaining itself.  Probably worth watching from the window.  We were in London during a particularly hot spell.  If one leaves a keycard in the slot during the day, the AC will keep the room at comfortable levels.  I heard from guests at other local hotels that didn't have AC and the 30C days lead to hot nights of sleeping.  Our only interaction with staff other than check-in/out was to request an Iron.  This was brought up promptly.  No problems with the service.  We did accidentally leave the do-not-disturb light on one day which resulted in an un-serviced room.  We returned at around 16:30 and were quickly accommodated with a room service.  We took the opportunity to enjoy a glass of champagne in the lounge.  A nice relaxing respite.    Regarding Location.  When I booked this hotel, I thought it maybe a little too far outside of the action.. I was pleasantly surprised at the vibrancy of this area.  Museums, Dining, Pubs and a wonderful neighborhood.  Transportation options via Bus and Train are plentiful.  When I return to London, I won't even bother considering other hotels.  Now for the bad news... and it's not that bad.  The minibar is stocked with milk.  Presumably for the push-pot coffee and/or Tea.  The Ampersand should make sure it's not spoiled.  This happened two mornings of our five.  BTW.  The bubbly water in the minibar is particularly good.",5,2017,06,22
129,My favorite hotel in London,"It is always a pleasure to come back to this hotel. Great location, great building, great staff, great rooms  (a bit small but that's London) and great common areas. The hotel has a great vibe and the design is very nice. As a runner I love being able to be in Hyde Park in just 5 minutes.",5,2017,06,22
129,"Great hotel, great location","When they say it's one minute's walk from South Kensington station, they really mean it.  Hotel clean and comfortable and every member of staff I encountered was just lovely.  Lounge looked nice, although I never had time to stop there...",5,2017,06,21
129,Perfect location and friendly service,"We travelled with our two boys (3 and 5 yrs) and felt very welcome at the hotel. The location is perfect: close to the Science Museum and Museum of Natural History (5 mins walking distance). There are many small restaurants and caf√©s just around the corner as well as Hyde Park. We had a very nice stay, the room was clean and calm (we were on the 4th floor). I definitely recommend the Ampersand Hotel and we will stay there again next time.",5,2017,06,20
129,Excellent,Excellent in every aspect. This is a wonderful hotel.  I would recommend it to family and friends.  The staff and service was superb. I hope that the hotel continues to provide excellent service.  I loved the heated floors in the bathroom.  The beverages were free and there were snacks in the room.  I would come back to the stay at the hotel again.  ,5,2017,06,19
129,Beautiful privately owned little hotel - great staff,"Beautiful privately owned little hotel - great staff.  Easy access to South kensington tube, taxi rank outside and easy walk to V&A Science Natural History and Harrods.  We stayed in a normal twin room. A little small .  Beds were very comfortable.  Toiletries are L'Occitane and great. Bathrobes, slippers, safe, tea & coffee all in room.  Nice touches are - smartphone to use for the duration of your stay - take out and about for London info and calling.  Fridge has complimentary soft drinks and fresh milk for your tea and coffee.

The Drawing Room is beautiful, very relaxing place with loads of comfy chairs, tea coffee cakes and drinks available - great service.  L'Apero restaurant - again great service - tapas style menu but with plenty of choices and reasonably priced wine list.  was a little disappointed with some of the meat dishes - steak and duck were tough and not very tasty -maybe we had a bad night>  There are plenty of little restaurants close by if you don't want to risk it.  Don't miss out on this little gem.",4,2017,06,19
129,Good for business or as a tourist,"This hotel has a great location (less than 5min walk from South Kensington underground). The hotel and staff are fantastic. This was my second time staying at the hotel and it did not disappoint. On both occasions the rooms were beautifully decorated and clean, with the comfiest bed. This trip was for business but on a previous trip I stayed with my husband and 5 year old son, and cannot fault the friendliness and overall service of staff when we were there as a family. Can't wait to come back again.",5,2017,06,18
129,UK,"Lovely hotel. Great location ... bar, restaurant and staff were wonderful. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.  Small, boutique ... clean. Great linens and adequate breakfast. 

Rooms are small but well planned and very nice toiletries.
",4,2017,06,17
129,Fantastic location and terrific staff,"The proximity to The Tube was perfect. Lots of coffee shops, pubs, and restaurants in the are. Airport to hotel was super easy. Nice building and the staff were very welcoming. It was an expensive stay but we will go back whenever we're in London. ",4,2017,06,17
129,London,"Great hotel in every aspect.  We will stay there every trip to London.  Excellent area to experience being in London afoot.  Convenient to museums, great food options and shopping.  Also convenient for travel. ",5,2017,06,16
129,Great place to stay in London!,"We stayed at the Ampersand for 4 nights while in London recently, and we loved it! We would definitely stay there again. The staff was very helpful and friendly at all times. The hotel was very clean and updated, and they had a room in the lobby area (The Drawing Room) that was open at all hours, where you could get tea and delicious treats. They also provided us with a hotel transfer from the airport and to the Eurostar when we left. ",5,2017,06,13
129,Mum Daughter trip to the City,"This boutique hotel was brilliant. The room was immaculate and quiet with inclusive minibar, walki in shower underfloor heating and .....my Fav l'iccataine toileteries!! 
The tablet available to utilise during the stay was a great idea . A complementary Pea cocktail a was superb but made the fruit cocktail a bit tasteless 
We had afternoon Tea which was good , Loved the scones n especially the caramel spread in a toothpaste style tube !  n cakes were a bit too big but presentation great. 
We were so lucky to have found it and will defiantly return. 
The lovely receptionist from Verona was so helpful and gently friendly. We loved our stay and will definitely recommend ",4,2017,06,13
129,Excellent hotel,"Very nice hotel, good location, very good service. We were here for a friends wedding and the staff was more than happy to help us with all of our needs. Nice room, with complementary mini bar. Newspaper every morning. ",5,2017,06,13
129,Great hotel but beware the room you are given  as some are just too small," We have stayed a few times at the Ampersand . We like the hotel very much.
However this stay we were allocated a room that was small and in particular  the bathroom was tiny and the closet a joke.
Luckily we were able to be relocated from 510 to 402.
If we had stayed in 510 , our stay would have been  spoiled .",4,2017,06,12
129,Simply fantastic in every way!,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Great location, incredible staff who make you feel so relaxed. Nothing too much trouble. My favourite hotel in London. Relaxed comfort in a beautiful renovated building. Appreciate the little extras like free minibar, free cell phone, free daily newspaper! Games Room perfect for private family party.",5,2017,06,12
129,"Great staff, great location, but probably could find a cheaper hotel for similar quality.","The beds and pillows were somewhat uncomfortable. The price was a little too high for the quality and does not include breakfast. Great staff and location though. The full English breakfast that I ate was good, but if you have to pay for it, I'm sure you could find it cheaper elsewhere. ",4,2017,06,11
129,Excellent accommodations and customer service!,"Only in town for one day, but this hotel made a great impression. Very pleasantly surprised by the wonderful staff and excellent accommodations - not to mention the very modern technology. Just blocks away from Hyde Park with lots of restaurants nearby. Highly recommend this boutique hotel to anyone looking for comfort and excellent service.",5,2017,06,11
129,Fantastic London hotel!,"I discovered this hotel on my last trip! Fantastic in every way. The location, service and overall ambience is great. Very close to the South Kensington tube , museum shops. The. Food at hotel is very good, large comfortable rooms.",5,2017,06,11
129,High end boutique home away from home,"The Ampersand is a superb hotel, beautifully appointed with interesting pockets of design for you to stumble upon. Wonderful service & a fantastic room service menu supplied by APERO restaurant - which you must eat at (try for the curtained snug if you can get it) as the food is well thought out with interesting flavour combinations in a tapas style menu. The location couldn't be better- a minutes walk from South Kensington station gives you access to three lines so you get to the west end or anywhere else within a few stops. Not far from high street for some shopping, right on the doorsteps of the museums & Hyde Park. Seriously- I can't recommend The Ampersand enough- stay there!!
",5,2017,06,10
129,Luxury boutique stay,"This is such a lovely hotel. Really quirky artwork and furnishings - always something fun to look at - with super comfortable rooms. The rooms are a smidge smaller than some London hotels but for the quality of service, the location we wanted and all the little extras, it's certainly something I was willing to overlook. The bathroom has everything you need and very good use of space. 

We ate in the bar with a few drinks and the staff there couldn't have been more wonderful - knowledgeable, friendly, fun and mega professional.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Absolutely brilliant place. 
",5,2017,06,09
129,Solo trip to the UK,This was my first trip to London and the entire staff at The Ampersand Hotel made my stay in London a pleasant one. I would recommend the hotel to others and plan on staying at the hotel again on my next trip to London. ,4,2017,06,08
129,"Spacious, Great Location + Local Transportation Tip","I chose this hotel from the top picks on Tripadvisor and wanted mostly to have a room with good space, modern amenities, and a good location to things like Harrods which it was. We did travel around the whole city and came to the conclusion this was an excellent location and I would definitely stay here again considering my top three needs. You always hope you get a great bed because we walk a lot on trips and want to get a goods night sleep. The bed, check, and the room was big and comfy. The bonus was the free-standing bath tub in the main room by the window. Our room size was Deluxe Studio for two people, perfect. I do recommend booking through their actual Ampersand website if you want a better chance to get any requests like free standing tub.

The location was right off the South Kensington tube stop. We came via Eurostar (high speed 2 hour ride) from Brussels (bought the Oyster card on the train and added money to it in the station before figuring our transfers to South Kensington). The staff at the St Pancras main station were very helpful as were other employees that helped us with the train in other locations. We walked out of the station at South Kensington, across the street and about 3 doors down and we were there at the Ampersand.

The Ampersand has an excellent young friendly front desk staff, notably Sabrina, great attitude and always tried to help out with everything, and Yassine who has a passion for London: museums, art, just about everything he had something to say and recommendations. He gave us the most invaluable tip which was to download CITYMAPPER. This app allowed us to take the bus and the tube all over London. It gives you a lot of information about where to catch the bus, which buses you need, when they are arriving, alternate routes on the tube, etc. We went to museums, flea markets, the zoo, out of the way recommended restaurants and more. The hotel desk provided us with wi-fi sim cards for our Verizon iphone 7+ so we hooked up which is also an important tip. Get local wi-fi either with the prepaid cards  or through your phone company.  You will do best to navigate yourself with your own wi-fi and more importantly CITYMAPPER which is great in other major cities too. 

The staff had dining recommendations like: nearby Pub, Bumpkin, and very close restaurant Comptoir which is a Lebanese chain and was very good. There were decent chain restaurants nearby, a bank and a contracted Fed Ex office all next to the hotel. It‚Äôs a great base to see London from.

My wish list for Ampersand would be better lighting, more lighting in the room especially when the curtains are closed, kleenex, and if the maid unplugs things, that she make it more obvious and set it on an open space so you can see it was unplugged. Unfortunately my phone(camera) did not get charged all night which was frustrating when I realized the cord had been unplugged and I had no idea. The other thing they really need to fix is the in-room  secured wi-fi connection. The staff tried, but the password could not be accessed through the tv. ?. When you are putting personal and  passport info over unsecured networks when checking in for departing flights is not a good idea. I don‚Äôt think they realized that this was something we really cared about. We actually changed rooms but the room below was the same. The password was provided through a function in the tv and that feature wasn‚Äôt working and strangely there was nothing that could be done about it. 

They had a great meeting room/bar where they have afternoon tea. If you like tea, it looked like a great place. There are other places in the hotel which we did not visit much but they have a game room which is based on availability and a reasonably priced restaurant which we never made it to but would have liked to.

Just a reminder, when you travel to and from and around Europe you should aim to check your bags because they have very strict guidelines on liquids. I can't tell you how many times they threw my stuff away. If you travel a lot these things may seem obvious to you. I personally stood at security and watch family after family upset by this and so I thought I would mention this.
They provide a very small ziploc bag and expect you to only take on board what fits in it. This can include things that you would not even think were liquid, or mascara, etc. Each instance varies but it is always unpleasant.",5,2017,06,08
129,Best little boutique hotel,"The best hotel I have been I travel a lot but to stay in such a nice neighborhood with lots or Restorant, museum, subway 
The service , is better than home they pumper you from breakfast all the way till you come back each day I will came for sure ",5,2017,06,07
129,Great location!,"Great location, close tube station, restaurants, shopping places, museum. Room was quite, clean and confortable. Nice breakfast at hotel or just cross de street an you will find a nice bakery! Would recommend and come back!",5,2017,06,07
129,Wonderful Stay!,"This is a first-rate operation.  Upscale, elegant.   The hotel is ultra clean, fabulous bed mattresses - no exaggeration (and I have trouble with some of them usually), no noise, no one stomps on your ceiling and wakes you up since it's so well built.   Complimentary beverages in the refrigerator - never encountered that before - complimentary newspaper.  AND free phone calls back to the US and other countries.  Got to call our kids.  Again, haven't experienced that before.  Good staff, very helpful and courteous.  Convenient restaurant on site, gym, free computers, etc.  The location is about a block away from the tube at South Kensington station where the Picadilly line will whisk you back off to Heathrow directly if needed, or you can connect to the tube all over London.  Will definitely stay here again - beats the London Hilton by a mile.  Not a shred of commerciality about it.  A+.",5,2017,06,06
129,Perfect location,"We loved this hotel from the time we stepped into the lobby. The staff learned our names , gave us great places to eat and tried so hard to accommodate our every need. My husband left his wallet in a black cab. We were convinced it was gone forever. The boys at the desk called the cab company , found out who our driver was and the dispatcher called our driver who got out and found it on the floor. When we got back from dinner we were greeted with smiles and the wallet. They were so happy and would not accept a tip!! Our appreciation was enough. I can't say enough about the location of the underground though. It was directly across the street with three lines to choose from. We got around London for a week on an 25E Oyster card.",5,2017,06,06
129,London trip,"Spent 6 nights in The Ampersand Hotel excellent location half  block to the underground station, walking distance to museums,  palace and gardens lovely neighborhood walks and restaurants close by.  Would stay here again! ",5,2017,06,05
129,Amazing!!!,"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Ampersand Hotel in January 2017. The hotel was amazing We were placed in a room that was modern and most importantly clean (no flip flops needed). The hotel was located in a quiet area of London and was literally a minute walk from the South Kensington Tube Station. The area is surrounded by restaurants and pubs therefore every night we were able to find something to eat. Museums and parks were near by, we didn't even have to get on the tube or hail a taxi. The Ampersand is going to be the place we will be staying every time we in London. There is not one bad thing we can say bad about this hotel. The Ampersand is highly recommended to anyone going to London.",5,2017,06,04
129,London's Ampersand Hotel has much to offer,The hotel was excellent and the staff was great and very helpful.  We enjoyed our stay there. It is close to many of London;s sights.  There are many restaurants and cafes in the area.  The hotel is able to get a flat rate for taxis to Heathrow  Airport which makes it a better deal than taking a train from Paddington Station.   ,5,2017,06,03
129,Another wonderful stay at a remarkable hotel,"This is one of the only hotels I-ve stayed at where I truly feel all my expectations are met. It is not a cheap stay, but I feel it is worth the cost, and I will certainly stay again. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the decor, location etc are excellent. ",5,2017,06,03
129,Science Afternoon Tea...lovely ,"Beautiful hotel, decoration and surroundings. Staff very lovely and gave us our table early. We waited a while but hadn't really worried too much as we were relaxed and chatting. The science afternoon tea arrived and looked brilliant...goats cheese quiche, roast beef mini bagel, smoked salmon blini etc. followed by scones with toffee sauce  and clotted cream (more if you wanted but we found it was enough) and then dry ice on the chocolate and mint mousse 'planet' and other mini cakes. 
We were offered a free cocktail or glass of champagne due to the wait...a lovely gesture and no real need but we obviously accepted. These too were amazing.
The only downside is that there is no decaf tea..early grey is easy to get hold of...and the option of camomile or fresh mint is not quite the same.
However, this was a small thing.

We would highly recommend this as an afternoon tea spot or even a tea and Fahd stop in The Drawing Rooms. Beautiful place as I say with very friendly and accommodating staff...not stuffy in the slightest. I don't often give five stars but feel it is warranted here . Thank you for memorable afternoon. 
",5,2017,06,03
129,Afternoon tea,My daughter took me here for afternoon tea as a mother's day treat. I have to say  it is a beautiful hotel the food was delicious and the waiters were very attentive making sure you were happy with everything and topping up your food and tea if you wanted more. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,06,03
129,Great accommodations - great staff!,"Memorable beginning to our Griswold Family Heritage Tour.  Lovely
rooms and the food was delish.  Overall environment - GREAT.
We hopped on the ""on and off"" bus at the hotel and returned the same
way for the London City tour.",5,2017,06,02
129,Ampersand Experience,"Overall good except the problem with failure to transfer my luggage.  I really didn't like the food in your restaurant either.  However the hotel is pretty and good and there are other restaurants nearby'  Also if I was to come to London again, I might stay there if I could figure out the bus system and the Tube system.  You should have the maps for both on hand for visitors.",3,2017,06,02
129,"Great setting, but not worth the cost.","We stayed four nights at this hotel. Staff were nice, but very difficult to understand (most seemed to be French). Our room was not serviced properly - toilet not cleaned, only one bath towel provided - but the bed was comfy. The bathroom was tiny, making it difficult to get into and close the door. The location is great with the South Kensington Tube station less than one block away and the Natural History Museum about a 10 minute walk. For almost 400 USD per night, though, it was not worth it.",2,2017,06,02
129,6 Star all the way," One of the best values we have experienced when traveling,and staying in hotels. What an amazing team of people taking pride in their work,and sharing their passions. We found the location to be great the double Decker bus stopped right in front of the hotel. the tube was just down the street and there were tons of choices for bars ,coffee shops, cafes and shopping. There was a weekend green market right across the street and a organic grocery. ",5,2017,06,02
129,London Vacation,Very comfortable room with twin beds for my sister and me. Bathroom newly renovated.I loved the decor. The in room safe was very useful. Also has refrigerator. It was warm in London during our stay but AC worked well.,5,2017,06,01
129,Fab Hotel the Ampersand,"Great hotel especially the decor, ambience, service, attention to
detail re food. Great location for
Museums & places of interest.
Right close to South Kensington
Tube station making getting round combenient",5,2017,06,01
129,Pretty place with rooms sized for a mouse.,"My friends and I Ioved everything about The Ampersand Hotel's public appearance, tea, bar, and dining rooms, very good food, and reliable service, with the one very significant problem of the miniscule rooms.  I can not recommend The Ampersand Hotel to anyone but a young single, who doesn't have claustrophobia, and doesn't mind a tiny tiny, ""turn side-ways to get around"" room.",2,2017,06,01
129,Friendly hotel in great location.,Stayed here for 9 nights. Located 1 minute walk from South Kensington tube station. Had room on 4th floor which was very comfortable. Single room our daughter stayed in on 2nd floor was a bit cramped but still comfortable. Great choices for breakfast with lots of fresh fruit and natural yoghurt plus cooked breakfasts if you wanted them. Staff very friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5,2017,06,01
129,Wonderful boutique hotel in great area,"We thoroughly enjoyed the convenience, staff, and accommodations at this hotel. We don't like cooky cutter accommodations, and this property was originally decorated and very cheerful.The staff were always at our fingertips to help. In fact, when my husband lost his train ticket, they went above and beyond to help us. The location could not have been better, with good restaurants and breakfast locations all around us. Taxis just outside the door made our trip to the airport quick and easy. The train station was just steps away. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,05,30
129,HIDDEN GEM,"The Hotel is a three minute walk from South Kensington Tube Station, the Hotel is lovely and I couldn't fault anything apart from maybe the service charge on each bill I received but maybe this is the case in all London Hotels. The Staff, Rooms and Restaurant were all excellent",5,2017,05,30
129,A touch above,"We have stayed in the Ampersand several times and always been pleased.  They do everything well and with a special touch like washcloths.  Located three blocks from the Victoria and Albert Museum and several well-rated Trip Adviser restaurants, Harrods department store, Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum. ",5,2017,05,29
129,Another Great Stay,"This was our third stay at this hotel. It is not cheap, but the quality of the rooms, friendly staff and great location make it worth the cost. It is literally 2 minutes for South Kensington underground station for the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines making it really easy to get to from Heathrow and then to get in to town. The area feels safe and there are lots of restaurants close by offering everything from Sushi, Tapas to burgers. Would happily stay at this hotel again.",5,2017,05,29
129,BEST LITTLE HOTEL EVER,this was a wonderful hotel. the best boutique hotel I have ever stayed in. the staff were wonderful and very helpful. room service took only minutes and the prices were like a normal restaurant not super expensive like room service in great hotels usually is. the location a few blocks from Harrods and Hyde park was perfect,5,2017,05,29
129,"Good location, excellent hotel","I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to friends.  I'd probably stay here again next time I'm in London.  The staff was quite nice. The hotel feels high-end, even though my room was just ... meh.  Next time, I will ask for a room on a higher floor.",4,2017,05,29
129,great location,"loved this hotel.  the location was perfect , close to tube and close to lots of great cafes and restaurants.
the decor was lovely and the staff very helpful and friendly.
rooms a little on small side but i guess thats typical for London.  
heated floor in bathroom was a nice touch.
nothing bad to say about this hotel, would stay here again.",5,2017,05,28
129,"Superb service, excellent value",Selected this hotel on line and we were pleasantly surprised. Our experience of hotels in London has not been great but this one exceeded expectations. One of the pleasant surprises was the hotel's generosity.,5,2017,05,28
129,A very good hotel and some details to improve,"It is one of my favorite hotels for its location and service. The decoration is nice, breakfast is lovely.
But some details were better the other times I stayed there: the internet speed in the business centre; the tea facilities and free water in the rooms that do not exist anymore. This is easy to improve and expected in a 5 star hotel.
Suggestion - vanity kits should be enough for a 1 night stay. We need 4 cotton pads (2 for the evening and 2 for the morning). An easy and ecologicl improvement!",4,2017,05,27
129,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here for 5 nights. We had read good reviews and crossed our fingers that they were accurate. It was more than we expected, it was fabulous. Our room was fresh, clean, quiet and cosy. The staff were super friendly and always helpful. We had breakfast in the restaurant every day because it was so good. It's a great location, close to the train, cabs and restaurants. We were disappointed that we didn't get time to have high tea because it looked sensational- definitely next time. Thank you Ampersand it was a perfect stay.",5,2017,05,26
129,Beautiful Property,"This is a gorgeous hotel, but what makes it even more amazing is the staff. What a wonderful and personable group of people. We were on a 10-day road-trip through England, and this was our last night before flying back home to the U.S. The only downside was that we could not have stayed longer. Thank you to the staff for their attentive, professional, and friendly service.",5,2017,05,26
129,What a location!,"My daughter and I spent a week exploring London from the Ampersand.  This was her first trip to the UK capital and the hotel helped make it a very special experience.  

The concierge service was good and the staff were friendly.  The downstairs breakfast area was a great place to plan our day.

I occasionally felt that it was looking a little frayed at the corners, but that didn't detract from the overall experience.

The hotel has an imposing Victorian facade which paints the scene and its location is fantastic. It is 3 mins walk away from South Kensington station and 10 mins walk away from the Natural History and Science museums.  We spent some very enjoyable hours walking through Kensington Gardens and then wandering down to a restaurant on the Old Brompton Road for dinner.",5,2017,05,26
129,Great start....,"We were so pleased to be able to check in at 10am after a very early train journey & this boded well for the stay. The hotel foyer & lounge impressed immediately & our room was comfortable & well appointed, though the bathroom lacked storage, the bath was slow to fill and the smooth bath dangerous to stand in when showering. Housekeeping was very disappointing with the promised restock of the water & soft drinks in the minibar not happening & extremely late room make up. The full English breakfast was excellent, perhaps the best we've had, and excellent value for money, but let down by extremely slow service, even though the restaurant didn't seem that busy. We chose the hotel because it looked special - it was a big birthday - & it was close to Chelsea Flower Show & the museum's. Unfortunately,  it didn't really live up to expectations",4,2017,05,26
129,Tea for two at The Ampersand Hotel,"Relax in the beautiful Drawing Room for afternoon tea 
The Ampersand Hotel is located near the V&A and lovely village feel of South Kensington an ideal place to meet up with friends and enjoy delicious tea and cakes
We had the Science Museum Tea served by wonderful staff lots of delicious food beautifully displayed it tadtrd better than it looked
Book early so you won't be disappointed

129,"Great Hotel, Great Location!","We had a great stay at the Ampsersand in early May.  The staff is friendly - the ""porter"" who helped was great and very knowledgeable, even though it was only his first week (Collin I believe?)! We were in room 405 (deluxe double), which is close to the elevators, but not noisy at all.  We loved the free water, juice, and soda provided.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a weekend in London!",5,2017,05,25
129,Very good but with some qualifications,"We had a deluxe room for 3 nights. We booked 3 nights for the price of 2, but the rate (without breakfast) still came out to just about $300 USD and that's expensive to us.

The room was, large, clean, and quiet with large floor to ceiling windows overlooking a balcony to the street.  The inner set of windows were double-glazed panels that slid in front of the outer set of windows, making the room extremely nearly silent.  Front desk personnel were well-informed and friendly, The hotel is about 500 ft. from a major tube station (South Kensington) with access to 3 Underground lines.

There are, however, several problems worth noting. The hotel is housed in an older building and when it was renovated, they didn't deal with the always-squeaking floor boards. As a result, when you walk around your room, you know the people below you can hear you because you hear every step taken by the people above you. (This problem was easy to solve when renovating, but at this point, a fix likely involves removing the wall to wall carpet, screwing down the old flooring, and then screwing and gluing down a new plywood subfloor to tie things together.

Another problem concerns the bathroom. The tub edge is high and there's no grab bar to help you to get in/out over the edge. In addition, the rain shower is set too close to the drain end of the tub (probably because there's a hinged glass screen swing door covering about 2/3rds of the tub edge, rather than a full-glass sliding door) and this forces the user to stand close to the front of the tub, making it very easy to step on the drain plug. The bathroom fixtures are high quality Duravit, but that doesn't remedy the problem.

There's also one other bathroom-related problem - there's a television screen mounted inside the tub, recessed low on the wall above the drain. The television can be watched while soaking in the tub and a normal-type remote control device is provided.  To us, water and television sets don't mix and the plastic delamination on the frame around the television screen attests to that fact. We moved the remote control to a shelf away from water, but after housekeeping cleaned our room, the remote was always put back on the twin sink counter in the bathroom. 

The day after we left the Ampersand, we realized that we had left an article of clothing in one of the small drawers in the closet.  We emailed the hotel about it, hoping that the item could be sent to our hotel in Edinburgh (where we were booked for five days), but we did not receive a response fro the Ampersand for 4 days.

In all. we enjoyed our stay. Aside from the price and the issues noted above, the hotel seemed well-managed, and the location was ideal for our purposes.",4,2017,05,25
129,Great Hotel & Great Location,Our stay at the Ampersand was great! It's location right at the Kensington station was ideal for traveling to all the different places we wanted to see. The staff was friendly and helpful and always a warm greeting when we left and came back. The addition of a cell phone in the room was such a pleasant surprise and we used it a lot. I would definitely recommend this Hotel.,5,2017,05,24
129,Visit to Chelsea Flower Show ,"For our overnight stay in London to visit Chelsea Flower Show, we couldn't have chosen a nicer hotel. A warm friendly greeting on arrival, a spotlessly clean bedroom/bathroom & a delicious breakfast fuelled us up for our day at the show. ",5,2017,05,24
129,Amazing hotel!,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel, nicely decorated rooms and great service! I've stayed here 5 times and the hotel is consistently one of the best. The hotel staff is always very friendly and helpful which makes your stay very comfortable. Can't wait to return!",5,2017,05,24
129,The staff was outstanding,"We needed a place at the last minute in London and wanted a 5 star hotel at a low rate...hard to find. They advertised a ""small"" room on the internet. They did not lie. It was SMALL, not much bigger than the bed. But, the staff was wonderful! Our first night they were completely full, but the second night they were able to put us in a bigger room with their compliments. We also had some other requirements...faxing, early morning transportation, copying...and the staff was helpful, knowledgeable, gracious, and professional. I recommend this hotel enthusiastically. But, remember, when they say SMALL they adhere to ""truth in advertising.""

",4,2017,05,23
129,Gorgeous property in best location,"We stayed here with our family in interconnecting rooms and it was incredible. Loved the decor, the building has been respectfully and tastefully restored. The location is ideal - close access to the museums, Kensington and all amenities. Our girls loved the views over the rooftops 'Mary Poppins style' and the afternoon tea is a must. A huge thank you to the team for histing us - we'll absolutely be back!",5,2017,05,23
129,Great place to stay in London,"This is a lovely hotel with a great location and a friendly,helpful staff.The room was pretty and had everything you needed to be comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to London.",5,2017,05,21
129,Love this hotel and the staff.,"Very clean, great location and you can't hear your neighbors! Downside is the tiny rooms. I was out most of the time sight seeing (there is a lot that is within walking distance.) Victoria and Albert museum, free, Harrods, free but... and the tube station is practically in front of the hotel. Very convenient.  I will be back.",4,2017,05,21
129,Great hotel in a very central location.,The best thing about the hotel was the courtesy and friendliness of the staff team. Great bed too. I had a very restful night. Beautiful rooms. I particularly enjoyed the heated floor in the bathroom! I would choose to stay there again. It was a group trip organised for my husband's 70th birthday. The only issue we had was that I emailed a query regarding my husband's birthday and the hotel does not answer emails over the weekend which I have to say I found odd. But otherwise excellent.,5,2017,05,21
129,"Great location, property and staff","Fun and friendly place to stay - we enjoyed it very much and recommend it!  It is in a great location, parking it a little tight but we were using cabs.  Tube station and great dining/shopping is nearby.",4,2017,05,20
129,Great find,The hotel is very nicely located and near tube. Staff is over the top friendly and helpful. There were special touches that made the hotel even more comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and will return.,5,2017,05,19
129,Stay here!,"The Ampersand is a lovely hotel, with amazing food and service.  The hotel is a delightful oasis in Kensington, and within easy walking distance of the V & A and the Natural History Museum.  It's close to a tube stop, and taxis are easily available.  The Apero restaurant has first class food and service.
",5,2017,05,19
129,Comfortable and Well Situated,"An extremely comfortable and well situated hotel with friendly, helpful staff.  We will visit again and  have no hesitation in recommending to family and friends.  We particularly enjoyed the continental breakfast with the home made bircher muesli.",5,2017,05,18
129,Great location. Lovely Hotel.,"I stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for a week in April in a Deluxe Studio. Our room was huge and beautifully appointed. The bed was really comfy and I loved the bathtub next to the window. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was great, right next to South Kensington Station and close to a lot of great restaurants and cafes. The complimentary mini bar was a nice touch with water, juices and coke replenished daily. There was also a nespresso machine and tea making facilities.
We stayed on the left side of the building and this is next to a school which is rather noisy, if you're wanting to sleep in or nap during the day I would recommend asking for a room on the other side. 
There were a few strange things about our stay; firstly there is no doorman which is not the end of the world but the heavy door and several stairs at the entrance made it difficult sometimes, especially when carrying luggage. Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss, they would call and/or knock on your door every afternoon to check in, it was a bit confusing and disruptive, sometimes cups weren't replaced or clean and my bathrobe disappeared halfway through the stay and wasn't replaced. We ordered room service one night and it was awful, the fruit salad was browned, floury apple and not much else. Also, we asked the hotel to organise us some tickets to a show, which they did, but we were charged over 100 pounds per ticket and printed on our ticket the cost is 78.75. We didn't realise this until afterwards and I have no idea what sort of booking fees there are so this might just be a misunderstanding on my behalf. 
We also ate at their restaurant one night and it was really lovely with great cocktails however we could only sit at the bar, usually I have found that hotel restaurants hold a few tables for hotel guests.",4,2017,05,18
129,Wonderful hotel with excellent staff.,I would recommend the Ampersand to anyone. The location is extremely convenient to South Kennisington tube station and many good restaurants. Hotel staff is excellent. The restaurant/bar downstairs is top notch. There was no room noise at night.,4,2017,05,16
129,Convenient location without having to deal with all the other tourists.,"Right next to South Kensington Underground Station and several museums but feels like living in the neighborhood.  Very attractive decor and excellent, friendly staff.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance.",4,2017,05,15
129,A perfect stay,"Loved absolutely everything about the Ampersand.  The staff was friendly, helpful and gracious.  The decor was a perfect melding of rustic, modern chic.  The food was delicious and the bed so comfortable.  Treat yourself to the Ampersand.  We can't wait to visit again ourselves!",5,2017,05,15
129,Love everything about it!,"We really enjoyed our 4-night stay at the well-appointed, lovely-designed, and super clean hotel with thoughtful details and the most wonderful staff who always greeted us with friendly smiles and helped us with all the questions we had and services we needed. Breakfast was great too! Just want to thank you again for creating a beautiful experience that we will always remember and we wish to go back soon : )",5,2017,05,15
129,A great option in London,"Clean, neat, modern. A little affordable gem in London. The staff could not have been more kind or helpful.
We loved our stay. The hotel is centrally located with restaurant's, shops and sights all within walking distance. ",4,2017,05,13
129,Fantastic London Accomodations,"The Ampersand was exactly what we wanted in a London hotel -- luxury accommodations at affordable prices and top notch service throughout. The hotel is perfectly located in South Kensington, close to the museums, Harrods and the multiple tube lines. I will stay here the next time I visit London.",5,2017,05,12
129,Meeting Venue,"We came as a small group and held a 2 day business meeting. The library is an excellent meeting room and has a games room attached which is great for unwinding and relaxing in the breaks. 
The service was very good indeed, food outstanding and very nice rooms. Strongly recommend and an excellent central London location. ",5,2017,05,09
129,Vey good overall+some flaws,"Very nice stay, friendly and dedicated staff, small but nice rooms.
Don't count on the librairy or the drawing room though, they are always busy with ""corporate events"", or baby showers. Restaurant offers good food and value, though service is sometimes lengthy.",4,2017,05,09
129,South Kensington stay,Quick weekend trip.  Great location and neighborhood.  Cute boutique hotel w modern decor.  I got the second to the smallest room available as I was traveling solo.  Clean and lovely.  Bathroom nicely sized.  Hot pot in room.  Maybe needed a mini bar too.  Otherwise great.,4,2017,05,08
129,Amazing afternoon tea,We had a science themed afternoon tea here.  Staff were very attentive and the tea was wonderful.  A delightful array of food meant we went away very full.  Was also  pleased with the selection of teas available.,4,2017,05,06
129,Efficient and really well run,"Love this hotel and keep coming back. Upgraded on check-in, complimentary glass of champagne, I can still have breakfast for under ¬£10 because the prices are so reasonable, what's not to love. There are space issues in the rooms but everything is well placed for accessibility and you have all you need. The stocked fridge with milk, water and juices is also excellent. Miller Harris toiletries have changed to L'Occitane since my last stay but they're still lovely. My one niggle is no green tea in the tea tray but that's just a personal preference. You'll struggle to find a better place in this part of London for the money. Try it!",4,2017,05,05
129,Great Location,"Nice neighborhood. Easy accessible to South Kensington tube station, bus station and taxi station. Many cafes and restaurants are nearby. Tesco Express and Little Waitrose are within 5-minutes walk from the hotel and in which you can buy groceries and snacks.   ",4,2017,05,04
129,excellent customer service,"Room was clean, neat, bathroom was nice and had heated tile floors, all amenities were excellent and staff were polite, friendly, helpful, and prompt in addressing any needs. Would highly recommend. Location is ideal, just outside the South Kensington station. Will stay again when in London.",5,2017,05,03
129,Wonderful hotel in a perfect location,"Our most recent stay was just as terrific as the previous two. The staff is warm and welcoming. On the busy bank holiday weekend, The Ampersand was serene and a respite from the crowd. The Underground station is just steps away and many museums are within walking distance. Thank you for a great weekend!",5,2017,05,02
129,Not as good as last time,"We stayed there two years ago and thought that it was superb value - we decided to book again for two nights despite the price increasing a lot.  

The common areas are now showing slight signs of wear and tear - nothing to put you off...until you reach the room with the window jammed open and the air conditioning that doesn't work, but more particularly the bathroom where the shower door is off the rail, the plastic edging strip on the glass door is hanging off, the wash basin waste plug needs sorting out as does the loose water faucet.  The bathroom is generally well appointed with nice towels and shampoos, etc but horribly let down by an obvious long term lack of any basic maintenance.

We decided not to spend any more on having breakfast or dinner - there are dozens of modestly-priced eateries within a few minutes walk.

A pity, because attention to a small amount of detail would have made it a good experience and more importantly signalled that the owners had some appreciation for the fact that the customer always has a choice and we chose to stay there - we might even have chosen to eat in the dining room, or have a drink in the bar.

Next time, I suspect that we will give one of the many neighbouring hotels a chance.",3,2017,05,02
129,Outstanding boutique hotel in a lovely area of London,"This is our preferred hotel for London. Rooms are well maintained with excellent amenties. Very comfortable beds and pillows. We have stayed in a number of different rooms and whilst they are all very comfortable we love the extra level of luxury of the deluxe studios. Highly recommend a stay in one of these rooms. The location is perfect for access to many areas of London. The staff are uniformly courteous,professional and helpful. Housekeeping in the rooms and throughout the hotel is exemplary.",5,2017,05,01
129,Very good hotel at good location,"This is my preferred hotel for a stay in London. The rooms are spacious (choose a studio) with perfect beds and well equiped bathrooms with perfect showers. It is located very closely to the South Kensington station and therefore very convenient for all your London activities.
I've stayed here twice already and will definately return.",5,2017,04,30
129,"Top hotel, perfect location","Great place to spend a few days in London ! Easy and quick access to all main site seeings, max 10 min walk to Hyde Park. We could unfortunately not get access to the Game Room during our stay (booked for an event).",5,2017,04,29
129,4 nights stay,"Good staff,friendly staff. You can visit museum,and go shopping in Knightsbridge. Very good staying experience.Only one thing was not good;the floor seems be not flat,I always felt floating........................
But I will go back again next time.",5,2017,04,29
129,Great afternoon tea! ,"We visited yesterday afternoon for the afternoon tea in The Drawing Room. 
It's is great with a science museum theme! 
Perfect amount of food and all so tasty. 
We also had been able to book and offer with a free glass of champagne so that made it extra special. 
",5,2017,04,29
129,"Great staff, great hotel","Excellent location, very nice rooms and a fantastic staff that helped with everything that we asked for.  Highly recommend.  Helped change to a larger room, arranged conference rooms, and were overall very nice as well as efficient.",5,2017,04,28
129,I love the style of the Hotel and its location!,"The Ampersand Hotel feels like home away from home to me and I keep coming back. The staff is excellently friendly and helpful and I love the style of the rooms as much as the all-over style of the Hotel.

The beds are incredibly comfortable, that alone is worth the stay. 
The smaller rooms really are small, but traveling alone it will do for a view days. However, they are extremely pretty and very clean!

",5,2017,04,28
129,lovely boutique hotel...,"the hotel itself is a nice and pretty modern boutique hotel, the location is ideal however, the rooms are extremely small - not bad for a weekend break though! its opposite a pretty awesome eclair shop called Maitre Choux - so check it out if you get the chance!",4,2017,04,28
129,Fantastic hotel ,"My husband and i stayed here last November for a weekend in London and i have to say this hotel is a real gem! The staff were great, room was small but only 2 of us so it was fine for a short stay. 

Bathroom was fab and free branded toiletries- lovely touch!

Would definitely stay again!! We look forward to it!

",5,2017,04,27
129,Brilliant stay at The Ampersand,"Lovely character hotel in a brilliant location.
Would definitely visit next time we're in London. Beautiful character building. Very clean. Great, friendly staff. Lovely breakfast room. Super comfortable beds. Thumbs up!",5,2017,04,25
129,Fabulous stay in South Kensington!,The Ampersand is a lovely boutique hotel with all of the amenities you need. Well appointed bedrooms and bathrooms (heated floors in the bathroom :)) With a fabulous location (2 min walk to the South Ken station) and plenty of restaurants around...although breakfast was lovely downstairs! We will definitely be back! ,5,2017,04,25
129,London Marathon made painless!,"This is a perfect hotel, great location and service. Staff are brilliant and rooms lovely. 
Check in is so easy everything about this place was just so smooth and seamless.
They were really accommodating about a very eary breakfast too.

Rooms are great.
",5,2017,04,25
129,Very nice large bed," Very well located near South Kensington underground station. The room is rather small as is the washroom with shower. The bed is very large and comfortable. Perfect for a city trip with one small luggage. Not for longer stays or business. The ladies at the reception desk are very friendly but could be more service minded. ",4,2017,04,24
129,"Sumptous room, great location","We stayed at the Ampersand for three nights in September 2016.  I pre-paid and got the 3 nights for 2 rate so it was ""relatively"" affordable.  London is expensive!  We had a gorgeous Deluxe room overlooking the street.  The room was gorgeous. Big, big bed, comfy pillows, and soft linens. Long, low bench in front of the bed to sit on while getting dressed. Nice sized bathroom.  Soft robes and slippers. Quality toiletries.  Nescafe coffee maker (loved this!).  And most importantly, it was quiet at night so we slept really well.  

The location was outstanding--just a half block to the South Kensington stop on the Paddington line.  We took the Tube (direct!) from the airport to the hotel and back which saved us lots of moolah.  We went all over the city with our Oyster passes--even to our favorite pubs in the City, late at night.  This was our third time in London and this was my favorite location.

We would definitely stay at the Ampersand on a future trip.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,04,24
129,"Great location, fabulous hotel","Love love love this hotel. Location cannot be beat. Room was impeccable and spacious for me and my husband and ten days of clothing (if staying for more than a night or two, I recommend getting the larger room).  Cannot beat the amenities - free minibar stocked daily, coffee/tea and biscuits in room, high end toiletries, clean workout room, and the best one was the handheld android device with Google, maps, email, cell, photo apps. Calling to some countries was FREE which alone made the cost of the hotel a deal. Everyone on staff that we came into contact with was delightful and knowledgeable and helpful. We will return to this hotel and also have recommended it to friends. ",5,2017,04,24
129,Charming hotel,Love the hotel although some of the rooms are really small.the location is great because in a quiet neighborhood with good restaurants close by. There is a cab stand right when you walk out the door so you never have to wait.,5,2017,04,24

129,Wonderful Accomodations,"My mother and I stayed here for 4 nights while we were visiting London. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous!

129,Lovely stay,"Attending concert at Royal Albert Hall, and booked this place because it was nearby. We travel to London frequently and always stay in 4* hotels. I must say that this place is one of the best we've stayed at. The hotel is spotless, the rooms are really nice, and the staff are very friendly!!!! Worth every penny!!!!
",5,2017,04,22
129,My second time,"Love this hotel...booking it again was a no brainer. In addition to the property being so lovely, I appreciate being close to the tube. The neighborhood is vibrant without being too crowded. 

On this trip I decided to take a small single room. It's definitely on the small side (which they are up front about) but I liked the option to have a less expensive room and still have all the benefits of staying at such a luxe, nice hotel. The bathrooms are wonderful. Towels and sheets are very nice! ",5,2017,04,20
129,Lovely hotel in South Kensington,"We have just spent 6 nights at the Ampersand. Everything is great and beyond the expectations. Very convenient location just across the street from the South Kensington tube station. Room is very clean, stylish and comfortable.

129,Great hotel - great location,Stayed at the Ampersand hotel recently and was very impressed. Stand out for me was the breakfasts - they were amazing. Rooms small (but it's London... all rooms are small) but reasonably priced. Location was brilliant - service was great. The library and games room cute but never got to use. Clean and comfy - would recommend to anyone  ,4,2017,04,18
129,Best Hotel ever.,"I want to go back to London just so I can stay at the Ampersand. Everything about this hotel is divine. The rooms, the food, the location and the impeccable, sincere, caring and attentive service. this was a slice of Heaven",5,2017,04,17
129,Wonderful Stay,The Ampersand Hotel was excellent!  I was in London celebrating my birthday.  The staff was amazing.  The room was comfortable.  The location is great as its near the train station.  You will also find excellent restaurants in the area.,5,2017,04,16
129,Great stay!,"Excellent hotel with perfect location. We had a week stay with 3 kids (4, 10 & 12 years old). Hotel was very nice and staff very helpful and service minded. Not the cheapest in London but worth every penny. We can not comment the hotels restuarant as we never tried it - it looked very nice but the nearby area offered so many good choices of restaurants so we went out in the evenings.",5,2017,04,16
129,Good hotel in a good location,"The hotel is modern and in good condition. All the staff are very helpful and attentive.

The only negative is our room was on the small side but we weren't in it much.

The hotel is a 2-3 min walk from South Kensington underground station and has lots of coffee shops in walking distance. 

Would have loved to have stayed longer and would definitely visit again!",5,2017,04,16
129,I keep coming back,"Excellent staff as always, excellent breakfast. I lover the modern decorations. If you ar visiting London, the hotel is nearby south Kensington tube station and many museums.? Maybe basic rooms are very small, I would suggest to  go for the luxury ones. 
Amenities of excellent quality, everything is consider so one may forget about what to carry.",5,2017,04,15
129,Great Stay,"We found The Ampersand Hotel as one of the options in British Airways holiday packages.  After some research, the Ampersand looked like the best choice for us.  As it turned out it was even better than we could have hoped.  First, the Ampersand is located just across the street from the South Kensington tube station, at which the Piccadilly line from Heathrow stops, so it was about as easy to get to from the airport as could be.  Second, we were able to get to everywhere we wanted to go from the South Kensington station, with no more than one line change.  
The room at the hotel was just great, not very big, but not nearly as small as some other reviews have mentioned.  Room was clean and well appointed.  We did have a housekeeping mishap because we failed to listen carefully to the staff member who showed us to our room as to how to signal for maid service, but it was minor and from then on, everything was great.  Other unique touches to the room include a FREE minibar!  It just contains soft drinks and water, but free is free and it was very nice to have.  The other unique room feature was the FREE use of a smart phone, including international calling.  We did not use this service because we had set-up our personal phones to work in London, but what a great service to provide!  
All of the staff was fantastic, as well, with the minor exception of a front desk person who looked at us funny when we asked her to make a dinner reservation for us, which we were told was a service of the front desk, since they serve as the concierge for the hotel.  
Other than that, the hotel was just great, conveniently located, and a wonderful choice for our first trip to London.",5,2017,04,14
129,Excellent hotel,"The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the was staff helpful. The hotel is in a great location, and near many good restaurants. The street was quite, but there are cabs, and a bus stop right in front of the hotel (a hop on/hop off bus also stops in front). The tube station is very near. Will stay again for sure.",5,2017,04,14
129,Visited for afternoon tea and loved it! Would definitely stay here. ,"For our family of 4 with kids ages 14 and 11, we prefer to rent a flat for the space and amenities; however, after visiting The Ampersand for afternoon tea, we'd definitely stay here if choosing a hotel. We love this neighborhood. While busy, it doesn't have the crowded, frenetic pace of others.  While we didn't see the accommodations, from the charming boutique decor, stylish and impeccably clean restrooms, excellent tea, excellent location a stone's throw from the South Kensington tube station and dozens of restaurants, and incredibly friendly and beyond professional staff, we'd stay here without reservation. Following is the review I wrote for The Drawing Room, the hotel restaurant where tea is offered: 

I hadn't been to London in 20 years, so when planning this trip, I wanted to take my family of four, kids 14 (girl) and 11 (boy), to an afternoon tea. My boy was not thrilled with the idea, as he expected a ""fancy"" experience where he'd be bored stiff, eat bad food, and be starving afterward. I read many reviews of many teas and decided upon this one, as it's science themed, the men in my family are sciencey guys, and it's near the flat we rented for our vacation. Everyone LOVED our experience and raved about it the rest of the day. My husband was happy he could order a beer. 

Located a stone's throw from the South Kensington tube station, we could tell from the exterior The Ampersand is a charming boutique hotel. We entered into the lobby and were greeted immediately and led to The Drawing Room, where tea is served. The hotel is inviting, charming, and adorable, and The Drawing Room is a lovely spot to enjoy the afternoon. My daughter loved the floral-themed restrooms, each stall named a different flower and styled accordingly. It reminded her of the hotel restrooms at The Muse in NYC, which she thinks are very hip. Service from each person with whom we interacted was exceptional. Not knowing if the kids would enjoy the food, we began by ordering tea for two, with the option to order more.  We could choose from the vegetarian science tea or the standard science tea, the only difference being no roast beef, I believe. We received a photo-worthy tower of savories and sweets. I knew my daughter would be happy, and I was thrilled to see my son excited and delighted by the entire experience. Service for two filled our family of four. My son ordered two extra mini roast beef bagel sandwiches.  My kids have semi-adventurous palates and tried everything. If you have chicken nugget-loving kids, they might only opt for the sweets. The sandwiches were crayfish, smoked salmon, roast beef, and there was a mini quiche-like tart with pumpkin, I believe. You can view the menu online. The dry ice smoke presentation really engaged the kids, as did the treat-filled beakers, test tubes, and archeology-like brush and box with dinosaurs and  chocolate ""soil"" to excavate. From start to finish, we had the perfect afternoon. Our bill, including an optional 12.5% gratuity, was approximately 80 lbs. It would have been double had we ordered service for four. That would have been too much food for us. Based upon this experience, we'd definitely return and recommend. For us, it was a perfect afternoon. ",5,2017,04,14
129,beautiful room and fantastic location,"We booked our stay to London at this wonderful boutique hotel and we were not disappointed!  The room was very beautiful and comfortable, the staff courteous and accomodating and the location is just steps from the South Kensington tube station.  The neighborhood is lively, safe and bustling with great restaurants with one-half to two blocks.  There was always a staff member inside the front door and at the desk and we felt secure no matter what time we came and went.  A wonderful experience!",5,2017,04,13

Afternoon tea is a must experience. Clean, beautifully decorated rooms, wonderful beds. Free handy with internet connection and gps maps. Highly recommended!",5,2017,04,13
129,Lovely boutique hotel,"Stayed here for a quick romantic getaway, and came away wishing I could spend a few more nights! The location is absolutely perfect, a minute's walk from South Kensington Tube on the Piccadilly, Circle and District lines. I was welcomed very kindly by the concierge, who apologised for keeping me waiting for a minute or two (it was no bother to wait while he attended to another customer, of course, but it was still a nice professional touch!). The room was really lovely - not a huge space, but really beautifully decorated in a luxurious but not over-the-top way. Everything was in an excellent condition and the bathroom was very large and luxurious. We both slept very well in the king-size bed.
We ate in the restaurant in the basement, Apero, where the cocktails were delicious and the food excellent - particularly memorable was the Octopus starter I had, cooked to perfection. Likewise, breakfast the next morning was a generous buffet affair with lovely fresh pastries.
It'd be a pleasure to come back to the Ampersand one day, I couldn't fault the experience.",5,2017,04,12
129,Excellent location and good service,I stayed for 6 days. Rooms were clean and free still water and soft drink service was good. Especially they provided soya milk for my milk allery!!! Thank you again. I would like to stay on my next visit to London. ,5,2017,04,11
129,Excellent hotel in South Kensington,"Was so pleased with this boutique hotel in South Kensington! The location is perfect since you are literally a one minute walk from the underground which means you are close to everything in London. The rooms are beautiful and they have everything you could think of from a free cell phone to take with you while traveling about (that allows free calls to the US, google maps, internet, etc.) to multiple converters and charging station in the room and free bottled water/coffee/biscuits. Anything we needed, they responded within 5 minutes and extremely pleasant. Will stay here again the next time I am in London!",5,2017,04,10
129,A London stay,"Minutes from South Kensington tube station. 
Plenty of little cafes, bars and restaurants in the area.
The hotel itself was clean, service was great and beds were comfortable. 
The room was small but the bed was large. A little cramped on the first floor but I would stay here again. ",4,2017,04,10
129,Everything excellent!,"Brilliantly located hotel, lovely rooms with much attention to detail, sparkling clean and beautiful decor. Cannot recommend highly enough. We didn't eat here as many restaurants on the doorstep, staff charming and helpful.",5,2017,04,10
129,Birthday break,"Fab boutique hotel in South Kensington, very chic and very friendly. Beautiful decor, great beds, highest quality Linen and towels. Rain flow shower superb. Also ping pong üèì in the games room. This is an SLH hotel and highly recommended by me.",5,2017,04,09
129,Relaxing intimate hotel in great location.,"Nice little hotel in great location.  Very close to South Kensington Tube Station and very handy for the Museums and shopping.  It feels a lot smaller and cozier than the 111 rooms, with a relaxed atmosphere.
Our deluxe room was a good size for London and well appointed.  The bed is huge and extremely comfy.  My wife can find it difficult to sleep away from home but had a sound sleep here.  
The hotel offers inclusive smart phones in each room for guest to have mobile data and make calls for no extra charge.
Drawing room staff were a bit aloof and seemed begrudging to serve us on our first day.  It made the compulsory service charge a bit galling.  The food was very good though and I really enjoyed the banana sorbet.  The other staff were really pleasant, professional and very helpful.
On my birthday, we were left a selection of small cakes in the room as a treat.  A nice surprise.",4,2017,04,08
129,An unforgettable stay in the Ampersand!,"I fell in love with the Ampersand!  Great location and convenience to the tube (3 mins walk). Nice selection of restaurants nearby. I love walking down the streets of South Kensington. Lovely architecture!    

I thoroughly loved the decor of the Ampersand hotel. The room is extremely comfortable. All the amenities were designed with great attention to details.  I often found myself wanting to sleep in as the bed was so comfortable!   

The staff were all so warm and friendly.  They really made guests feel at home. The front desk staff even remembered me telling her I was going to visit Westminster that afternoon which happened to be the day (22 Mar) the attack had taken place. When I returned to the hotel, she saw me and expressed her concern.  A simple word of concern just makes so much difference. 

I highly recommend this boutique hotel to anyone visiting London.  It is also a great location to stay in if you are planning to visit the museums.  
     ",5,2017,04,08
129,Great hotel,"I've stayed in this perfect hotel for 4 nights. 
The location is just amazing, just across the street from South Kensington station, a minute walk to National History museum, Science  and Victoria and Albert museums. 
Taxis just in front of the hotel and also bus station. 
But what makes it perfect is the small details. 
It is very quiet, comfortable, the breakfast is great, shower just perfect with L'occitane toiletries, the smartphone that you get with the a room for your stay with internet. The room is equipped with control system, music library and speaker in the shower. Umbrella and a power converter are in the room if you need them, my colleagues told me that in their hotel they charge them day fee for the converter. Not here. The staff is very friendly. 
One day I forgot to cancel DND and the housekeeping couldn't clean it , so they left a note. 
I went out at 8 pm and when I was back the room was clean, without me calling or asking. Just amazing!!
I enjoyed my stay very much and will be definitely back . 
Thank you

129,Great hotel,"We had come to London (and to the UK) to hear a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. We spent three nights (28-30 March) at The Ampersand and very much enjoyed our stay. Room, breakfast, and a very welcoming atmosphere - probably mostly due to the friendly staff - made us almost feel at home immediately. Will definitely consider The Ampersand for my next visit to London.",5,2017,04,07
129,A few days away with kids,"Great hotel in a great location. Close to museums, South Kensington tube station is on Piccadilly line which easily gets you to any destination in london. A lot of good coffee and dinner spots nearby..... Staff at hotel are very friendly, and would recommend this as a great place as a base! ",5,2017,04,06
129,Urban Oasis in Central London,"This is now my home away from home when in town for business. Love the proximity to shopping and museums. Its right across the road from South Kesington Tube Station. The service from the entire staff is impeccable, one trip on a late arrival - my iPhone charger died & they allowed my a loner portable for the duration of my trip. Food is deliciously and little touches are very much appreciated.",5,2017,04,05
129,A Jewel Hotel in South Kensington,"This hotel is steps from a the South Kensington Tube stop and many small shops, cafes and restaurants, but is surprisingly quiet in its interior.     My room was a small one, but more than pleasant for a five-night stay.    The staff is exceptionally good, and the information and smiles they provide were very welcome.  My room was equipped with every amenity:   complimentary beverages in the mini-fridge;  tea-making kettle with tea and coffee stocked daily; good-quality radio;   good air temperature control;   a window that opened up slightly for fresh air;  good bath products;   fluffy slippers and robes, etc.     A lovely hotel.  ",5,2017,04,05
129,Excellent stay,"My partner and I have stayed here for a couple of two night stays - once in a smaller room (""double"") and once in a superior room. The hotel staff were courteous and friendly, the rooms were excellent and as described, with fixtures and fittings all of a high quality. The location is perfect for exploring South Kensington on foot, and as the tube station is only a 2 minute walk away it is a great base for any London trip. The gym is nicely outfitted and wasn't busy. We enjoyed our stay and would cheerfully stay again.",4,2017,04,04
129,Long weekend in London,"Very convenient location close by underground and buses that fit our plans for the weekend. We combined visiting family living in Fulham with some shopping and sightseeing and enjoyed also being able to walk from and to the hotel. Just nice staff, wonderful room, no noise from street right out our window, nor from neighboring rooms A very pleasant stay.",5,2017,04,03
129,Daughter's 18th birthday trip,"with London as our first stop of our European vacation, we booked the Ampersand Hotel after extended research. We fell in love with its charming and quaint feel in addition to the warm, friendly service we received. Although the room was small, we expected that and our other expectations were more than exceeded. We loved the location (S. Kensington) near many restaurants, bars, and shopping. We felt very safe walking around the area during the day or at night and we really appreciated being right across the street from the nearest metro station. We would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,04,03
129,Perfectly located for The Royal Albert hall and Museuems,"A clean ,friendly and boutique feel to this hotel which we love 
It's location means access to all,of London is easily achieved on the Underground 
And the RAH and museums are all in easy walking distance as is Knightsbridge for shoppers !",4,2017,04,02
129,Great location and very pleasant hotel,"We love the location and the hotel's d√©cor. Excellent mattress, although the bed was too small (determined by the room size). The staff were friendly and efficient. The ""lobby"" is limited, but there is space in the downstairs area. ",5,2017,04,02
129,"Wonderful hotel, staff, and location!","Lovely and stylish hotel.  Very accommodating for families, but also nice for couples. Rooms were comfortable, with great amenities, and quiet. Perfect location, friendly staff, close to great restaurants, transportation and attractions. ",5,2017,04,01
129,This was perfect!,"We were so pleased with this charming hotel. The staff was extremely cordial and helpful. Checking in/out was effortless, the rooms were comfortable and spotlessly clean, the beds were so comfortable and the hotel was perfectly situated. We cannot wait to return!",5,2017,03,31
129,Quiet and Calm Hotel in South Kensington,"This hotel is very close to South Kensington tube station, making it a 40 minutes ride to/from Heathrow Airport on the Piccadilly line. The hotel is nicely renovated and, perhaps because it's an older building was very quiet. The hotel was full the nights I was there but I didn't hear hardly any noise at all when I was in the room. The small double had only a bed and small beside tables - no chair or desk or work surface- but the bathroom was spacious and well-designed. 
The entry area was a bit simple for such a large hotel. I couldn't find any information about the hotel restaurants in the room and had to phone the front desk to ask. I had breakfast at Apero on a Sunday morning and didn't find it particularly tasty or special. There are a lot of places nearby to have breakfast - that serve much better coffee- if you don't mind a short walk. The only thing I didn't particularly like was the very thick dark carpeting in the room. I prefer Scandinavian-style carpets because they just feel fresher. However,the good quality carpeting throughout may have been one of the reasons the hotel was so quiet, The ability to open the window, a bit, was a very nice feature. Overall, a very comfortable hotel",4,2017,03,30
129,Super service,"Outstanding service from a truly great team of people, make you feel valued and welcome.

Restaurant and bar are superb but special thanks to reception and concierge , people make places and everyone you meet here will make you happy you stayed and looking forward to return.

Rooms are small but perfectly formed, has everything you need for a short city break and represents amazing value for this level of comfort and location.

129,Excellent Experience,Hotel is in a good location near the tube and lots of reasonably priced good restaurants near by. Staff is very helpful and friendly.

Be aware that a small double really is a very very small double !  but the staff and general experience of the hotel made up for that.",5,2017,03,27
129,Fabulous boutique hotel,"The location of this hotel is excellent being a few minutes walk from South Kensington tube. Brompton road is easily accessible, and there are many cafes in the area. We ate out yet wished we had eaten at Apero in the hotel as it's a lovely restaurant. We had breakfast the morning of departure which was fresh and delicious. Every single member of staff was exceptional. The service could not be faulted. Our room was beautifully appointed, very modern and a powerful shower with l'occitaine toiletries. The mini bar has complimentary soft drinks that are replenished regularly. Wonderful hotel and we would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,03,26

129,Excellent stay,"Can't fault the hotel, the staff were amazing with accommodating us. Rooms are large comfortable and clean-possibly the best bed we have ever slept in, location was perfect for getting around London with a bus stop and taxi stand directly outside. Although I would recommend walking around as much as possible around Kensington as its such a relaxed neighbourhood.",5,2017,03,25
129,Tiny room,"Stayed 3 nights in March.. extremely small room, noisy air-conditioner which required constant temperature adjustment otherwise it defaulted to pumping out cold air, had to ask 3 times before the tea and coffee making equipment and supplies put in room, reception insisted on seeing a passport even though I had only flown in on a domestic flight and then tried to pre authorise an extra ¬£100.  I asked for the air conditioning to be looked at and reception did send someone up immediately who announced it was just fine. There is no overhead light in the tiny room only lamps which meant there was insufficient light to read at night time.   On the plus side it is very well located with no street noise and staff are very pleasant.  Ladies note that there is no power outlet for the hair dryer in the bathroom so I had to stand in the bathroom doorway so as to use the power outlet by the bed and the mirror in the bathroom at same time.  If you want to be close to the South Kensington museums and are prepared for the inconveniences described,  then this hotel might suit you.",3,2017,03,25
129,In town for a show ,"Very easy checkin and excellent welcome.

129,"Beautiful, but small rooms","The hotel is beautiful, clean and with good service and great location. However the rooms are tiny! We very given a ""returning-guests-discount"" and was therefore given a suite, with the same price as a regular room, however this suite is no bigger than a such a room....

Rooms should be bigger, or price lower!",4,2017,03,22

129,Loved this boutique hotel!!!!,"This is a fabulous hotel in an excellent location. This was my third time to London and The Ampersand was our favorite hotel and we will definitely stay there again. We had a one bedroom with a separate living room that had a little kitchenette and small balcony. Breakfast, tea time, the pastries were all so good. The location is GREAT and only a two minute walk to the tube station. There was even a ping pong table that we were able to use in the evenings. All of the staff members were very friendly and accommodating. I would not hesitate recommending this hotel for a stay in London.",5,2017,03,20
129,Special hotel in GREAT location,"We booked the Ampsersand through credit card miles, and it was worth every point! First of all, the location is perfect. You are a step away from the tube, and in the heart of adorable South Kensington, with bus lines and bike shares right outside your door. For us the location was perfect, as we spent a good amount of time in Chelsea, as well as the Soho-Covent Garden area, so we were right in the middle! The angel check in lady allowed us to check into our room at 9am after an overnight flight. A 2 hour nap is a MUST after a short red-eye. The room was on the ground level, but it was the only one available, so she offered for us to change room to a higher floor the following day, which we declined. The room was fine, though it lacked privacy when the drapes were pulled. The standouts at the Ampersand were the 1) free non-alcoholic mini bar (which was replenished every day!), 2) heated bathroom floors, and 3) the free cell phone they give you to use around the city. The phone itself was a little clunky and slow, but it was great for us, as i had an international plan, but could give the phone to my boyfriend when he would inevitably get lost! We unfortunately didn't get a chance to eat or drink at the hotel, but it will most definitely be our choice next time in London.",5,2017,03,20
129,very great experience,"Excellent service, very good location near subways, shops, restaurants, museum, nice and comfortable rooms.
Hotel with personnality and friendly welcoming

We'll probably choose the same hotel when we come back to London

129,A Birthday Delight,"One of the best locations when visiting London.  Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to the door of the Ampersand is perfect. The hotel is also only a stone's throw from the Natural History Museum and the V&A. 

The welcome at the hotel was genuine and warm and I was met not only with a smile but an upgrade to very comfortable and tastefully decorated room. I was also invited to have a glass of champagne in the cocktail lounge at my convenience - did they know it was my Birthday! The breakfast was more than adequate and the service exemplary. My only disappointment, my stay was too short. Next time I must stay longer.",5,2017,03,20
129,Luxuary,"Wonderful location in central London, very easy to get to a tube station to get anywhere you need. Although check in isn't until afternoon the staff are friendly and offered to store our luggage whilst we went out. The room was beautiful, luxurious bed, romantic looking bath in the window overlooking London, modern ensuite with double shower. Waffle dressing gowns and slippers. Great place to stay in luxury in London.",5,2017,03,20
129,"Very nice, good location..... but","Very nice hotel, spotlessly clean, spacious and modern quirky decor.  The rooms have everything you could need and if you need anything that's not there (iron) ring house keeping and within minutes it appears. Location is great with South Kensington underground literally 2 minutes walk away. 

However, certain staff really need to brush up on customer service. It amazes me why you would go into this industry if up you didn't enjoy it. The service in the drawing room was exceptionally slow and certainly didn't come with a smile, you were served almost begrudgingly. That said not all staff were like that, we ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and the service was excellent as was reception staff/concierge. The breakfast was exceptional. 

It might be just my thing but I love to visit hotels/restaurants and be greeted with a smile and someone who actually looks like they love their job, for me it makes a difference.

I'd definitely stay here again and I would recommend it but don't expect too much from The Drawing Room service wise.  ",4,2017,03,19
129,Great present ,"Yesterday my wife and I spent the night at the Ampersand hotel and had a fantastic time. From the minute that we arrived and upto when we left, nothing was to much trouble . If you luv a cocktail then try the bar in the basement and ask for Luca, superb ü•Çü•Ç",5,2017,03,19
129,I will stay here again!,"The Ampersand was recommended by my sister and her husband. It's conveniently located, clean, comfortable and charming.

I definitely will recommend the Ampersand to friends!",5,2017,03,14
129,Birthday treat ,"We always try to find new hotels for special occasions and this hotel is a gem. 
From the moment we walked in till we left it was great. The staff were first class and service very good. 
We found the hotel very modern but the best thing it had a really calm feel to it and we both found it very quiet and relaxing. 
We look for SLH Hotels generally as we have found them all very good and this was no exception. 
We were upgraded to i believe what was the studio suit without any extra cost, which was spacious, well equipped and with nice little touches. 
We wouldn't hesitate to return as it's location was great and also very close to the tube station. 
Great Hotel and keep up the excellent work. ",5,2017,03,13
129,Special place in a special part of London!,Ampersand Hotel is a special place in a special part of London. I have stayed at the hotel on two occasions while on business and with my family over the Dec / Jan holiday season. On each occasion the quality of the service has been excellent; both friendly and efficient! The rooms are luxurious and the bathrooms elegant and very clean. The hotel in general has tremendous style while not compromising on comfort. After a days work or sightseeing in London it is a pleasure to return to the hotel where you are always met by friendly and engaging staff for whom nothing ever seems to be too much trouble. The hotel's location is fantastic situated in one of London's finest areas and within easy walking distance to some of the world's leading and loved museums. I could go on but suffice to say that the Ampersand is a special place in a special part of London!,5,2017,03,11
129,Great Stay!!,This hotel was perfect. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location was perfect & right next to the tube station. The rooms were very comfortable & offered several free amenities that helped make our stay enjoyable. We will definitely be back! ,5,2017,03,10
129,Two night midweek stay,Once again the service and stay at the Ampersand was excellent. This hotel is in a great location with friendly and efficient staff.

Hotel is cool with great service and excellent rooms. 
I've staying many times now and always look forward to coming back. ",5,2017,03,09
129,Bit of a disappointment ,"Nice hotel, rooms are nice but had to ask multiple times for an iron ( a pretty simple request) and over priced for what it is. 
I would expect better service from a hotel of this level, in terms of pricing, when you are above 200 per night I would expect more attention to detail.

129,The perfect London break,"My girlfriend and I recently spent an evening at The Ampersand. Every aspect of our stay, from check-in to check-out, was exemplary. Our room was spacious and well appointed, with an incredibly comfortable bed. All members of staff we encountered were exceedingly pleasant, personable and very willing to help. The location could not be better with South Ken tube station minutes away on foot. Whether on business or visiting the city as a tourist (the Nat History, Science and V&A museums are just a stones throw away), The Ampersand is the perfect London base. ",5,2017,03,09
129,Perfection!!,"Wonderful hotel, the room was fantastic and the staff was attentive and always social with us. Booked a deluxe studio and the room was very spacious! Great area and many wonderful shops and restaurants within the immediate area. I will be booking this hotel every time I'm in London and recxomendung to anyone I know who comes to London! ",5,2017,03,09
129,Fashionable and Elegant,"Wonderfully located for South Kensington tube station (on the Piccadilly Line) with a good choice of cafes, bars and shops in the vicinity.

The hotel has an impressive exterior and the decor inside is equally as striking.  The lobby is lovely and bright and the staff on hand there extremely welcoming and efficient.

Our check in was swift and we were soon in our Deluxe Double room on the 5th floor with a full run down of how the air-con operates.  We were also given information on the mobile phone in the room which was available to take out of the hotel and included free data and some free international calls.  We didn‚Äôt need to use this facility but thought it was an excellent addition and may really benefit travellers from outwith the UK.

The room itself was compact but adequately sized.  The bed was very large and comfortable.  The bathroom was rather small but well planned and contained all the usual amenities you‚Äôd expect.  Most importantly, everything was spotless.

A few minor gripes although most certainly not deal breakers.  The room itself was rather dark; the lighting is minimal.   There were also limited electrical sockets.  The only place to plug in a hair dryer (bring your own, there isn‚Äôt one in the room) is in front of the wardrobe where the lighting is very poor.  There is also no iron / ironing board in the room.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand and would happily recommend a stay here.",4,2017,03,08
129,Nice hotel and convenient location,"Nice boutique hotel. Very good service, clean, nice room and amenities. Ample staff to assist with your needs. Afternoon tea was delicious.

Normally I would stay with friends in London but it was a special occasion so we thought we would indulge. The rooms are clean, small as per London but perfectly formed.

I was at this hotel 2 years ago on my own, and came back this time with my husband on our anniversary trip. It was just as perfect as the first time, a lot of care goes into the maintenance and upkeep of this property.",5,2017,03,03
129,An outstanding experience,"We couldn't have asked for more. The overall experience exceeded our expectations.
Just wonderful! Amazingly attentive staff, perfect location, and a great bar.
The front desk was also great help in securing exceptional seats to two shows.",5,2017,03,02
129,Small room,"Nice location, a few steps from South Kensington tube station (direct line to Heathrow) and from many museums.
My wife and I had one of the small double rooms, small being the operative word. The room would have been habitable, but there was no space for the luggage, and almost no storage. One of the night stands housed the fridge, and a mini-cupboard contained the safe and the electric kettle. Being winter, we also had a couple of coats, but there was no coat hook, even though they could have easily fit some hooks near the door.
The bathroom was comparatively larger, with a small tub (maybe a shower would have left more space for the bedroom). The glass bathroom door meant that, if one switched on the light during the night, the bed was flooded with light. Another nuisance was that there was no electric plug in the bathroom for the hairdryer, so making noise in the bedroom was the only way to dry one's hair.
Breakfast (not included in our offer), served in the basement, offered the choice between a continental buffet (only cold foods) and hot express plates. Not bad, altogether, but with some quirks, for example juices were included in the buffet price, but had to be ordered from the waiter, whereas coffee was not not included.
All personnel were very kind, helpful and efficient.",4,2017,03,01
129,The best in Kensington so far ,"A very welcoming and professional approach with Mediterranean them and influences. Classic afternoon tea with good quality and an above average restaurant in house delivering great foods. 

My best recommendation to a full on experience! ",4,2017,03,01
129,Everything I hoped for and MORE,"The architecture and interior design were THE details that made me book with Ampersand.  I didn't know enough about the area to know if it was a good neighborhood or not.  I also booked with them because of their prompt replies to email requests for room rates and the ease with which they helped me book my stay.  When we arrived at the hotel and subsequently stayed there for 4 nights, I was THRILLED to know that my gut feeling about the hotel was correct!!  It was amazing and I've already recommended it to friends travelling to London in September.   ",5,2017,02,28
129,The best hotel experience.,"We love South Kensington, and though we enjoyed our stay in 2013 at another property, we wanted to try somewhere else during our honeymoon in October 2016. So very glad we did! We had an amazing experience at the Ampersand, and we now think of it as ""home base"" in London. The rooms are beautifully appointed, the service was extremely friendly and prompt, and the details made it very special (complimentary umbrellas during the rain, helpful in-room local cell phone/city guide device, fantastic shower, great room service food, comfortable beds, etc.). Plus, it is just a hop across the street to the South Kensington tube station and all the businesses in the area you might need, and if you need a black cab, they line up out front. Perfect. We bookended our Europe honeymoon with stays in London, and coming back to the Ampersand after staying elsewhere in France and Spain was a genuine pleasure. We truly can't wait to return.",5,2017,02,28
129,Love The Ampersand,I enjoyed my stay at The Ampersand and will definitely go back. Great location and great staff who are very friendly and service minded and make you feel at home. Had dinner one night in the restaurant which was very good. ,5,2017,02,28
129,Gem of hotel in West Kensington,"Terrific boutique hotel. Super friendly staff, young, professional but without the stuffiness that is suffocating at some hotels in london. Some rooms are very small - ok if you're traveling alone or don't need to work at a desk. Stones throw to V&A museum, Natural History museum. Tiny, tiny gym but if you're a runner, close to Hyde Park.",5,2017,02,26
129,My new home in London - don't tell anyone,"There is not one element (other perhaps, an old building with small rooms/bathrooms) that is not absolutely outstanding. The style is a classic modernism, the staff are really just great, meeting all sorts of strange requests. The basic rooms are so small there really isn't room for a chair in front of the desk (I was traveling alone, so could have lived with it). The bellman with me immediately arranged, on a crowded hotel day, a larger room.
The restaurant/bar is really great. Cozy, bubbling with people. Food very clever and perfect for the setting. And across the street from South Kensington Station",5,2017,02,26
129,Superb hotel in South Kensington,"The hotel itself is very stylish. The Drawing room have lovely sofas and over sized chairs in rich fabrics. They serve cocktails & light snacks in there.  The rooms are beautiful. The deluxe studios have plush headboards, an abundance of pillows and tv's in the bath area.

Apero the restaurant in the basement of the hotel has wonderful pasta dishes as well as interesting & delicious small plates.

The true hallmark of this hotel is the staff, they are the best I've encountered and Intravel a lot.  They are friendly, go out of their way to help, and always do so with a smile. While they are all terrific, Fabio goes above, and beyond to make guests feel welcome.  The hotel is very upscale and so are the people who work there. They manage to pull it off without being stuffy or pretentious.

This was our 2nd business stay in 3 months, and we will be back again.

",5,2017,02,25
129,50th Birthday Big Treat,"We stayed at the Ampersand as part of my 50th birthday celebrations and what a wonderful place it is. The staff, the rooms, the food and the location are all fabulous. I kept thinking of the decor and overall experience as 'Alice in Wonderland for Grown Ups'. This is the most we've ever paid for a hotel but it was still really great value for money for the facilities and service we had.",5,2017,02,25
129,"Lovely hotel, will be returning","I was very impressed with the Ampersand Hotel, it was a great experience staying here. The food was great, the service and staff were brilliant, the room was very comfortable, the breakfast was outstanding. Thank you for such a great stay.",5,2017,02,24
129,Lovely Hotel,"Clean, well appointed but tiny room. It works for a single guest. Very comfortable bed and lovely amenities. The location is very close to the South Kensington Tube station, and the neighborhood is full of restaurants and coffee shops. ",5,2017,02,24
129,"Comfortable, excellently located boutique hotel","We really felt at home and relaxed at this hotel. The room and bathroom, a deluxe double, was a good size and very comfortable. The room was slightly dark and the outlook wasn't great but this did not detract from our experience and it was very quiet. The hotel was stylishly decorated. The location is superb and the staff very friendly. The one breakfast we had was very good although a little pricey. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. ",5,2017,02,22
129,"Great hotel, great location","This is a great hotel.  Wonderful location near the South Kensington tube station, lots of restaurants nearby.  Rooms are small but very nice, bathrooms have large showers and are very pretty.   We stayed here for 5 nights and loved it.",5,2017,02,21
129,Great hotel: old England charm with boutique-y details,"Wonderful hotel with great staff. At check-in they worked hard to get us a room very early, and called (while we were enjoying breakfast in one of the lovely near-by shops) when the room was ready. The near-by museums are incredible, and the location is good. We took the underground from Heathrow -- super easy and exactly 45 minutes. The hotel is one minute from the tube station, with loads of cabs outside. We loved the room - spacious, tasteful, with great books on botany and other British subjects, and charming decor.
Lovely tea service in the afternoon, small but efficient gym, a beautiful game room, and wonderfully friendly staff.",5,2017,02,20
129,Everything we wanted & more...,"The Ampersand was very comfortable, modestly modern and luxurious with some unique, but not unnecessarily flash, decor. Perfectly placed for the V&A and neighbouring galleries and a short walk to The Kings Road and Knightsbridge.

We stayed in a beautifully decorated deluxe studio which was plenty big enough and came with some complimentary nice touches such as fresh milk in the mini-bar for making a decent cuppa and a few free soft drinks. The bathroom toiletries were good enough with a TV over the bath as added inducement to lounge just a bit longer than usual...

The hotel's restaurant, Apero, was small but perfectly formed. My evening meal of Tuna Ni√ßoise was delicious and my wife's Crispy skin Normandy chicken
was equally delicious (I did have a nibble!).

Breakfasts (also served in Apero) were delicious, served with attention to detail the minimum of fuss - Eggs Benedict and a vegetarian breakfast including halloumi were perfect for setting us up for a morning's wander round the V&A.

The perfect finale of our two-night stay was afternoon tea in the hotel's Drawing Room- a cleverly science-themed tea with tiny-planet puddings and spacemen... out of this world!",5,2017,02,20
129,MUCH BETTER THIS TIME,The team at the Ampersand Hotel did a terrific job this visit.  Really appreciate the step up in experience vs my last visit which was pretty shocking.  Will definitely return to this hotel again in the future.  Thank you! ,5,2017,02,19
129,"Modern, tasteful and friendly...","This was a great stopping off point for a stopover in London - having found a deal online it was also a very reasonable one too. It's very handy for South Ken tube (a minute's walk) and therefore all the other attractions that South Ken has to offer. Service was very friendly and efficient, the surroundings are fairly plush, modern and stylish but by far the best thing was the room and in particular the comfort of the bed. Had a top floor room with a view of the Shard, the Eye and other prominent landmarks a couple of miles away which was also very quiet. Didn't eat in the hotel but if the restaurant is as good as the rest of the hotel then I imagine it wold serve a decent meal too. Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,02,19
129,Immaculate and convenient,"This hotel is beautiful. We have two 'favourite' hotels in London and this one may have just topped one of them particularly considering the very reasonable price. The whole building is immaculate, beautifully designed and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful. 

We agree with other reviews that the rooms are a little on the small side but for a two night stay with lots of things planned for the days and evenings, we found it more than adequate for a cup of tea and a rest before heading out again. Our room was on the first floor at the front and we both slept really well - no noise from the road at all and a comfortable bed! The readily replenished soft drinks in the room were a bonus, when other 5 star hotels would charge through the nose for these, and the Anniversary chocolates personally delivered were a nice touch.

We had an amazing and different Valentine's afternoon tea in The Drawing Room which was delicious and lovely environment too. The cocktails in the bar were also lovely in the evening but we tended to venture out to other places for breakfast, lunch and dinner (Muriel's, Gail's and The Oystermen at The Sampler are highly recommended).

We will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,02,19
129,Beautiful and high quality of service,"I will for sure come back to the Ampersand. Everything was perfect except maybe the breakfast room a little too small but it's not really a point... 
The rooms were really nice with a wide bathroom and everything you need. 
The fact that you have a smartphone available to take with you and with internet access and call for free tomant countries is really very useful and appreciated.
",5,2017,02,18
129,Superb boutique hotel ,"Lovely stay! The staff is very welcoming. The hotel is beautifully appointed with great interiors. The location is perfect. Right near a tube station and lots of restaurants and cafes. 

Keep in mind the single rooms are extremely tiny. No real place to put a roller suitcase. I had to use my desk to hold my bag. Hard to walk around the room. Not a real closet and no drawers to store anything. The bed was very comfy though. The bathroom had great fixtures was ok size. Just keep in mind this is definitely a room for one person. All you need if you're just sleeping there. Wifi worked great. And free water, juice and soda is nice touch in mini bar. Overall great stay and can't wait to come back!",4,2017,02,18
129,Lovely hotel & great staff,"We got a good deal on this hotel and it's a fantastic location for visiting the V&A. Just steps from South Kensington High Street, it offers warmth and style with a friendly atmosphere. All staff were remarkably cheerful and went out of their way to help. Our room was modern and cosy with every amenity and was immaculately clean, so a big thanks to the hotel's chambermaids. Tea and coffee were premium brands and the hotel included complimentary soft drinks. The bathroom was beautifully equipped with double sinks, shower and bath , decorated in contemporary style with a nod to the hotel's history. Similar hotels in the area are almost double the price, so it makes a very good base at a reasonable price. Would definitely stay again and a big thank you to all the staff, particularly the bar staff in the evening. Grazie mille",5,2017,02,18
129,Nice boutique hotel,"I booked a one night stay here as I was attending a fair in Chelsea.  It's a good base for the Kensington & Chelsea area with the V&A museum just around the corner.

Whilst an old building, the interior is contemporary with some interesting features such as quirky pictures and music and astronomical themes on the walls.  

Our deluxe room was modern, clean and comfortable.  However, it was quite small and, in particular, the bathroom was tiny with barely enough room to turn around and certainly impossible for two people to be there at the same time.

The basement restaurant serves French/Mediterranean food and is very good indeed.- possibly the local French influence.

Overall, a good base for a short stay.",4,2017,02,17
129,An outstanding experience. Awesome,"I will recommend to anyone a stay at Ampersand Hotel.
Top service, helpful people that work hard to make your stay 
an outstanding experience. 
Fantastic rooms, bathrooms, very clean and spacious. 
A wonderful night sleep experience in a very silent room.
Fantastic location for a London visit.
Go there and let you surprise",5,2017,02,17
129,Perfect stay in London with kids,"We just loved our stay at the Ampersand Hotel, perfectly located for a family stay in London! The staff was super nice and helpfull. The room and amenities were perfect. The bathroom in particular.
We had dinner once at the restaurant and we all really enjoyed it.
The kids, age 12 and 6, felt at home and did not want to go after our 4 nights spent there.
The hotel is very modern and they even offer a mobile phone for free in the room that you can carry around with you in London with free Internet access!
We will come back for sure! 
One thing to be mentionned : you can feel the Tube passing though when in the room at some point during the day even though we were at the second floor. But honestly it really did not bother us. Just a bit strange.",5,2017,02,16
129,Comfortable and Chic Hotel,"Loved our stay at this modern, European boutique hotel. Beautiful spaces, super comfortable! What they don't tell you is the location is Amazing! Lots of shops and small restaurants just outside the doors, And the Underground is right there.

Very accommodating staff. Directions, recommendations, reservations, private car...  I am fussy, and Ampersand hit all the right marks.",5,2017,02,16
129,Long Weekend Stay,"We came down on a Saturday and stayed until Monday, taking in a particular concert at the nearby Cadogan Hall.  The Hotel was really good with easy access from South Kensington tube and near to a lot of good shops and eateries in the vicinity - we're used to walking long distances so it was a pleasure to be based here.  Lovely hotel to return to after a long day and quite a few complimentary drinks in the room too.  Bit strange having the only place to put the kettle in the wardrobe but it wasn't a huge room.  Nice comfy bed, good restaurant (just breakfasts) and a wide choice of dishes.
Very friendly and attentive staff.",5,2017,02,15
129,Great stay,Really enjoyed are stay the room was lovely the front desk was very helpful the bartender luka makes great drinks and was helpful on recommending restaurants on the next leg of are journey to Rome I will be staying here when we return ,5,2017,02,14
129,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"This is a beautiful hotel, which very helpful and friendly staff. The location is excellent as it is close to the tube station and has great places to eat and see nearby. We booked a family room but were disappointed with the available space after the extra bed was added. ",4,2017,02,14
129,Weekend in London and the Ampersand,"My wife and I have had a wonderful weekend in London and at the Ampersand.
From check in to check out has been a joyride. The breakfast bufet and menu has a nice varaity. We also had dinner one night there, wich was a treat. The kitchen and the waiters staff delivers exelent experience from first to las course.
I also have to mention the afternoon tea in the drawing Room. What a treat It is!
We will come back!",5,2017,02,14
129,Excellent,Brilliant staff and a stunning hotel in a central location.  Close to the tube and museums as well as some good eating places close by.  Room might seem small but for a weekend stay its perfect and cozy.  ,5,2017,02,13
129,Good Location is as good as it gets,"Rather mediocre in most respects. Air Con not working so room too hot. Very small rooms.
Reception staff had no knowledge of bus routes and failed to look up correctly.
Reluctant verging on truculent service in bar.",3,2017,02,13
129,A gem hidden away in a beautiful area,"This boutique hotel blends cool decor, and an amazing location with great service, plush rooms and a surprisingly good restaurant for nibbles and drinks. The staff is friendly, and is always keen to assist.",5,2017,02,13
129,Keeps getting better! ,"I love this hotel for so many reasons! It is perfectly located in South Ken just a few minutes walk from the tube station and lots of great food, shops, and attractions. As a business traveler this is a perfect place to stay that makes London feel like a second home and is an easy spot to commute from. The hotel has always had a beautiful interior design but they have really stepped up their service. Helpful, easygoing staff, great food and quality amenities. Enjoy a room service breakfast with a latte that will supercharge your morning at an unbelievably great price. When so many hotels are charging upwards of ¬£30 for breakfast, I enjoyed a quiet start to my day with a delicious omelette, latte and fruit salad with service included for about ¬£17. I also had to send a few things to be cleaned and the prices were shockingly reasonable and for same day service!! They think of everything you might have forgotten and put it all in chic little packages in the bathroom. Toiletries are from L'Occitane. The hotel rooms can be a little noisy during the day but I had no trouble sleeping. The new smart phone service that lets you make free local calls and even can be used outside the hotel is a nice add. My only wish is for a mirror in the room to help with the fact that the UK doesn't permit hairdryers in the bathroom. There is one in the wardrobe but it's dimly lit and a bit awkward to use for getting ready. Can't say enough about how great this hotel is and it will continue to be my preferred place to stay when in London! ",5,2017,02,12
129,Amazing stay!,"I am a tough critic when it comes to hotels so it means a lot for me to say that this has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! We stayed here for four nights and had an amazing stay. 

The location is incredible - across the street from the South Kensington tube stop, a quick walk away from other tourist attractions and near lots of bars/restaurants if you don't want to venture out too far. The hotel is set in a townhouse that is gorgeous. I wish that I took photos of it but the decorations were really cute and it was just a really warm and inviting space. They have quirky furniture and decorations all around the hotel that I just loved.

The rooms were awesome. We had the double deluxe room and it was so lovely. The bed is so comfortable and we loved the free waters and juices in the mini bar, as well as the teas and cookies that were available. The room was spotless. The bathroom is HUGE - it has a really nice shower, amazing amenities and HEATED FLOORS! I have never been to a hotel with heated floors and it was the most amazing thing ever, especially after siteseeing in the cold, rainy weather. 

The customer service here is outstanding. All of the staff are so friendly and welcoming and we felt really taken care of while we were there.

The only thing that I think could be improved was the food. We had room service our first night there and it wasn't great. My husband ordered the croque monsieur and basically got a cheese toastie with ham. The breakfast in the morning was pricey and not really worth it for us. It was good but nothing special. 

I can't say enough good things about this hotel! The price point was great considering the location (we booked on hotels.com since the rate was much lower than booking directly) and the staff were so great. We'll be telling all of our friends to stay here and will definitely be back!",5,2017,02,11
129,"Excellent Location, Service and Facilities","We spent one night at the Ampersand Hotel and it has assured its place as our go-to-hotel in London.  This well appointed boutique hotel is a rocks throw from South Kensington Tube Station - making it perfectly situated for anything you would want to do in London be it shopping, dining, touring the museums etc.  The rooms were very comfortable, albeit not large.  The amenities provided in the room were excellent and best of all the service from the front desk to the concierges was pleasant and helpful.  We arrived at 6:00am in the morning after a 14 hour longhaul flight and were given a room within 5 minutes of walking in the front door.  The common areas of the hotel are lovely and include a games room, a great bar and restaurant and open seating area with computers etc.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",4,2017,02,11
129,Convenient and Comfortable but not Five Star,"Highly rated and we wanted to be close to South Kensington with its museums restaurants and shops, The Ampersand is excellently situated and all the staff were friendly, efficient and keen to please.
Our room was, for the price, small and not totally convenient though it was quiet facing the back; very little drawer space and we had to move the kettle to a bedside table to boil it
The bed was large and comfortable. so was our bathroom.
we only had one breakfast at the hotel. A good choice but for a continental breakfast we thought it expensive even by London standards.
We would probably sty again but only if we could have a rather larger room..
",4,2017,02,11
129,Perfect and impressive accommodation,"Great location close to south Kensington station. All services from check-in, house-keeping, personal problem, and last leaving are nothing but perfect. An excellent Hotel cannot just provide high level amenities, but need to reach dedicated service for each customer. Glad The Ampersand Hotel does. Highly recommended, and must back when in London.  ",5,2017,02,09
129,Nice and cozy hotel,"Nice small hotel very close to South Kensington tube stop. Very nice interiors with home feeling and cozy athmosphere. Room are small but nicely decorated.
Restaurant offers good breakfast. 
Library and games room good location for business meetings in a small group.
Gym is small but offers all the equipment necessary for a quick workout.",4,2017,02,08
129,"Lovely hotel, great location","We loved our time at the Ampersand Hotel! Very comfy room, excellent bed, nice bathtub. Very easy to get around on the Tube from here. We actually walked to the hotel on arrival from Paddington through Kensington Gardens - just under 2 miles and a very nice introduction to London. The most notable feature of the hotel is the mobile phone that comes with the room - really great to have for maps, calling restaurants, etc. Hotel provided umbrellas as well. No meals taken there.",5,2017,02,08
129,Good location and attractive frontage,"Air conditioning was broken and staff could not fix it. My girlfriend was not listened too when she insisted it needed to be fixed.
I felt the room was dark and not competitive when compared to other 5* hotels in London. 
The birthday plate despite being tasty had a poor presentation and I was not overally impressed. ",2,2017,02,07
129,Very nice !!!,"Nice furnishing of the rooms
very friendly staff
good place to stay 
nice retaurants nearby
short way to the Museums and Royal Albert Hall

bathroom a bit tiny
will come back",5,2017,02,07

129,Wonderful time,"Perfect location of the hotel.
The service is really good , the room

was faultless with a lovely atmosphere and the best hotel team I have experienced congratulations to all staff. we were delighted with every aspect of our stay! ",5,2017,02,07
129,Once again a great stay,"We spent 3 nights in a Deluxe Room, thanks to a SLH member upgrade and kindness by the management. 
Room #305 was, as usual, well appointed: the bed incredibly comfy. New L'Occitane vanity products in the bathroom were quite nice. Also I noticed a significant improvement in the continental breakfast, well done. I enjoy each stay more and more. They are my favourite property in London ",4,2017,02,06
129,Lovely hotel with helpful staff,"We stayed for one night last week for my husbands 40 birthday. We booked it same day and got a good rate. In arriving at the hotel we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a deluxe room and were offered a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate - both was a lovely touch. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed overlooking the high street. The bathroom, although small had lots of lovely toiletries and the shower was hot and powerful. We didn't use the restaurant but came back after dinner for a few late drinks and found the bar trendy with good service. All in all we would stay again as the service, cleanliness and proximity to the underground (you can see the station from the hotel) were very good and offered great value for money.",4,2017,02,06
129,¬£50 card fee,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on the 28th January. It was a wedding gift ( Mr and Mrs Smith) voucher. We did enjoy our stay and we are not usually ones to complain which we wouldn't of if the ¬£50 card charge had been put back in my account.... mon 6th February and still nothing! I have called the hotel twice now once last week which I was told it can take 3-4 working days to go back on. And now today I've been told it can be up to 7!! This simply isn't good enough when it makes me overdrawn! Why can't you be like any other hotel and just charge the room for any extras on departure!! 
Was also going to overlook this but I'm so fed up with waiting for my money that I will say that our room was tiny and being on the ground floor we had the droaning sound of the air con units outside our window. For nearly ¬£200 for a night it really wasn't worth the money. As I said it was a wedding gift that we received and having 2 small children we was looking really looking forward to a night away. 
The room was very clean and it's a great location to the station but that's about it!!",2,2017,02,06
129,Great hotel at a great location.,We stayed for 3 nights in a Superior Room (I would not recommend to go for a smaller room). Great beds. Very nice staff. Excellent breakfast. We had also dinner which was also very good. I will stay here the next time!,5,2017,02,06

129,Gorgeous hotel,"Wow! This hotel is perfect for a break in London. Wonderful service, great location next to the tube and in beautiful condition. The room was a great size and breakfast was delicious. We rounded the day off with afternoon tea in the Drawing Rooms which was fabulous. ",5,2017,02,05
129,Newly renovated modern hotel in bustling neighborhood ,"I quite enjoyed my stay at Ampersand.  The staff and level of service were superb at every turn.  The hotel room itself was modern, clean and came with unexpected amenities.  The free mini bar fed my thirst (juices and water) in the middle of the night and the free snacks came in handy when dinner wasn't enough.  

The pillows were extremely comfortable!  So comfy I even asked for the brand and type.

The only deficiency was the size of the room but that's due to the selection of my corporate travel system.  It was certainly more than sufficient for the lone business traveler. 

Will come back for sure! 
",5,2017,02,04
129,Excellent choise,"Lovelly location, rooms very confortable and morden, nice beds, good shower, lovelly staff. the hotel is very nice and clean.

This is my favourite dog friendly hotel, the staff are great & also ensure your dog enjoys their stay too by providing comfy beds for them! A lovely little extra that I didn't expect.",5,2017,02,02
129,Highly recommend,"Our son was studying abroad and this hotel was near his flat.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  The location was terrific, very nice area, close to the tube, restaurants, shopping, really everything.  The rooms were very nice and the bathroom floors are heated!  They also have a small refrigerator in them with amenities and a french press coffee maker.  All around a great experience and I would definitely go back.  I hadn't stayed on this side of London before and we really enjoyed it.",5,2017,02,02
129,Wonderful boutique hotel just steps from the underground ,"This lovely hotel was one of the most enjoyable says anywhere in a long while.  Beautifully decorated, helpful courteous staff, lovely facilities and amenities.
The rooms are well designed and the beds super comfortable .  The handy phone to take out and about with you is really appreciated.
The staff were determined to make the stay memorable and they did.  Every person I encountered was cheerful, helpful and considerate.  From afternoon tea in the Drawings Rooms to 5:30 am coffee and croissant before my flight.
I would recommend this hotel and will stay again. ",4,2017,02,01
129,nice experience,"Hotel close to the subway station, near the restaurant a lot. Employees are nice, service awareness class, a good experience. If there is insufficient, probably near the subway, the subway vibration feeling slightly. ",5,2017,01,31
129,Book this hotel - you will not be disappointed,"Having been to hotels around the world, The Ampersand went beyond my expectations of what a luxury London would be like.
The size, design and quality of this whole hotel will impress you, pairing this with the short distance from the tube, all is great.

My room was a large double with a good bathroom, including a tub and rain forest showerhead. L'occitane soaps and accessories is a great addition. Good noise isolation in all directions, but oddly the people walking in the above room I heard quite clearly.

Went for breakfast at the hotel the first day, smaller portions at greater prices, so decided to eat out the rest of my stay, try to get the breakfast included if possible.

The staff is very polite and helpfull, no language barriers or issues what so ever. My room was cleaned every day as you would expect.

Nothing bad to say about this hotel, will stay here again and recommend to others.",5,2017,01,30
129,Short but lovely stay,"A lovely boutique hotel in heart of South Kensingto.  Staff were friendly, room was comfortable and high tech (beware), heated bathroom floors, small but nicely maintained fitness center, and their restaurant was superb.  ",5,2017,01,29
129,Best hotel in London ,"We've been to the ampersand hotel for several years now and we never get disappointed. Great location, great rooms, friendly and excellent service. And especially big thanks to F√°bio and Jos√© for making our stay better than ever. Coming back soon again. Can recommend this hotel for everyone going to London. ",5,2017,01,29
129,Beautiful boutique,"Great location, tasteful deco, superb service. When I checked in i was given a room with no bathtub, which I was not to happy about but the staff very kindly transferred me to another room. I would recommend you check this point at booking if this is as important to you as it is to me. The porter was very helpful (i had so many carrier bags!). The art collection is interesting with a few nice commissioned pieces. I did not have a chance to try the gym so can not possibly comment on that. Overall I am a fan. I usually don't write reviews but on this particular occasion I reLly think that the ampersand deserves praises. ",5,2017,01,28
129,There is no resisting the Ampersand,"This hotel is really nice, very close to tube. I stayed for business for two nights and the stay was very good. The reception staff were mega friendly and helpful,  the hotel is very clean and tidy.  The elevators are fast. The room is small,  but i guess that is what i reserved: small double room. 
The minibar was free for me,  and it is not just stocked with cheap stuff,  the working area was well equipped,  and wireless free and fast.  I even got a courtesy call from housekeeping as i had left the ""do not disturb"" sign on to enquire if they should come up later that evening. Overall a pleasant stay with pleasant staff. I would stay again ",5,2017,01,26
129,citytrip,"We had a perfect stay at the Ampersand Hotel! Great location, metro just around the corner. Really friendly and helpful  staff. Breakfast was really great and delicious. Rooms are small but clean and bed is ok. 

We would recommend this hotel to family and friends!

Thank you for a lovely stay!!",4,2017,01,26
129,The room,The room was a bit small but the website did say it was.  Great hi tech. You should not ask for so much characters in your feed back. The location to the tube and museums is excellent also restaurants etc,5,2017,01,24
129,Wonderful hotel,"My sister and I stayed at the Ampersand in June. I had done a lot of research online and read reviews in order to arrive at our decision to stay here. Believe me, I was not disappointed! Actually, it was even better than I had imagined. The hotel is beautiful and full of character. It is unique and fun in the decor and you can see there is so much attention to detail. The staff really take care of you, even starting when you book. I received helpful emails and access to a cool app called Porter and Sail. The hotel website is also really well done, lots of good information about great things to do nearby. The location in South Kensington is great. It is very close to amazing museums! Our room was gorgeous, great decor, beautiful headboard, heated bathroom floor, and even an included mini bar. The cookies and tea were lovely, and when we left a note about my sister's nut allergy, they made sure to give us only the cookies that she could eat. They also gave us extra of our favorite tea. There are also really nice facilities like a library, a gym, and a game room. Another nice thing is the restaurants on site. My favorite is the drawing room where they do afternoon tea and serve absolutely beautiful cakes and desserts. I can't say enough great things about this hotel! If I am back in London, I will certainly stay here.",5,2017,01,24
129,"Perfect location, wonderful staff, great food: perfect London hotel","The Ampersand was a nice surprise. We didn't know the hotel beforehand. Everything worked her: the booking, the check-in, the always smiling and helpful staff, the room with all sorts of extras and the wonderful brunch we had Sunday morning. And the price is right!",5,2017,01,23
129,Amazing hotel and staff!,"We stayed at The Ampersand for one night and it was fantastic!! We had informed the hotel we were getting into London early and had requested early check in- not only did we get an early check in but we were upgraded to a suite!!! The suite was beautiful, modern, clean and even had a balcony and complimentary mini bar! The bathroom was spacious, clean and modern. The hotel is a few metres walk from South Kensington station and close to lovely independent bakeries and coffee shops etc. Really lovely area to stay in!

The staff at the hotel are outstanding. Always greet you with a smile and are so helpful! Would just like to thank Phabio and Joseph on reception for being so friendly and welcoming. We have already recommended this hotel to others and will not hesitate to stay here again!",5,2017,01,23
129,Lovely London hotel. Amazing service,"We had a really fabulous stay at the Ampersand Hotel. I booked a Superior Double Room and, having read that some rooms are nicer (and quieter) than others, I called up about a week before to request a quiet room. When we got there we were given a free upgrade, and the hotel even arranged a massage with just a few hours notice. The rooms are smaller side but absolutely beautifully decorated and the bed was really comfy, with an oversize velvet headboard, which was lovely. It is the small touches that really make this a great place to stay, like a handwritten welcome note with a sweet treat in a box left in the room, and the turn down service is great.  Also, L'Occitane toiletries were a bonus. We loved our stay, and will definitely be back.",5,2017,01,23
129,Good location for the Albert Hall,"Room was clean but very dark as it was located at the back of the building.
The service at breakfast was slow and haphazard. The bar staff were very attentive.
Overall a good hotel but not as pleasurable as a previous stay.",4,2017,01,23
129,Highly recommended,"We stayed here for three nights in mid December in a Deluxe room. We were fortunate to be able to avail of a ""three nights for the price of two"" offer which made our stay amazing value for money. The hotel is located less than 5 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station -  particularly useful if coming from Heathrow. 
The room was lovely - high ceilings - great bathroom - very comfortable bed. Good for sleeping after coming off a long flight from Melbourne. 
Staff were pleasant and helpful.
Would stay here again - highly recommended.",5,2017,01,21
129,excellent!!!,We stayed here for our anniversary and the hotel was beautiful! a true hidden gem in the heart of London and we cannot recommend a stay here enough! From the hotel staff and the amenities it was a true delux stay! Thank you for making our weekend incredible!!,5,2017,01,20
129,Top-notch! Will be staying again..and again.,"Everything about the Ampersand was fantastic. I had traveled overnight and arrived early, astonished I was able to get in my room early. The room was gorgeous, the bed comfortable, the toiletries of the best quality. A phone to navigate around the neighborhood and make calls was available too. Room service was the best I've had in any hotel as well as being quick (20 minutes when usually 40+ in other hotels I've stayed in the area). A converter to charge my devices was also handy without having to ask. Afternoon tea was creative and delicious, accompanied by excellent service. Look forward to staying here again. Thank you!",5,2017,01,20
129,Boutique Charm,"The Ampersand remains one of my favourite hotels in London.

This was my second stay at the hotel following my engagement there the previous year! This time my stay was the night before my wedding in Kensington...

I stayed in a suite and I was really impressed at the value for money. It was luxurious as you would expect - it even had a complimentary mobile phone to use out and about during your stay! The centerpiece of the room was a beautiful free standing bath tub and for a small hotel, the room was spacious. 

The service was fantastic and the doorman was so sweet, helping to collect all my luggage for the wedding (there was a lot of it, trust me!) from the car that was parked a few streets away.

I completely took over the hotel on the morning of my wedding; with bridesmaids, family, the photographer, makeup artists, drivers and so the list goes on. The Ampersand however took it all in their stride and they were so friendly and accommodating, making everyone feel welcome. They even loaned us a clean suite for photographs, as you can imagine the state of my room after 9 bridesmaids had ransacked it! 

Thank you to The Ampersand for helping to get my wedding off to a great start. See you on my first anniversary later this year!",5,2017,01,19
129,Impressive,Enjoyed my stay.Rooms were small but very clean..Staff was friendly.Breakfast wasn't great but plenty of options a few steps from the hotel..Great location..Very effecient at check in and check out...,5,2017,01,19
129,Most comfortable bed ever,"Fabulous service, very comfortable beds and a great location. This is a spunky boutique hotel in a very reasonable price range for its quality and location.
We stayed twice. The second stay was in a front room with large windows facing the street which I enjoyed much more than the back room we had during our initial stay.
The staff are amazing. Friendly and knowledgeable and happy to research and book activities/restaurants etc.
One small downside is that I found the room lighting very dark.",4,2017,01,18
129,Lovely stay,"After extensive research about London accommodation options, our family (2 adults, 2 children) decided to stay at The Ampersand for four nights from Dec 31 because it seemed to offer the right mix - relatively reasonably priced (for London), convenient position and beautifully decorated. The hotel did not disappoint - friendly staff, a warm and welcoming lobby area and lovely decor. It is also exceptionally well positioned - right next to South Ken tube station and close to the museums and good restaurants. Will definitely stay there again if we return!",5,2017,01,16
129,a perfect good reachable hideway in London,"Situated at 1' walking for the tube South Kensington, (picadilly line which is direct from St Pancras !)
Friendly and efficient staff from check in, bar, breakfast, check out.
Tastefully decorated rooms with very comfortable beds.
 This charming hotel is just perfect.",5,2017,01,16
129,My new London favourite,"The hotel is easy to find, and excellently located.  Unlike many London hotels which feel like they have taken worn-out-old-world-chic too far, The Ampersand uses the beautiful building to its full advantage, while also being modern and warm.  The Welcome at reception was great, check-in simple.  The room, while small (11m2), was excellent, with the most made of every bit of space.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  I will be back.",5,2017,01,16
129,"Many things to love, but not so great if you're jet lagged....","I hate to not give this hotel a ""5"" because there were so many things to love about it. Service was very professional yet personal. The design was adorable. The room was spotless. The beds were comfortable and the linens and toiletries were luxurious. We had great meals (breakfast and dinner) and enjoyed the Drawing Room for an evening drink. The location was fantastic with easy access to multiple forms of public transportation and museums. My issue was with the noise in the room. We had a room facing the street, and there was a fair amount of street noise, but that's to be expected in a city. It was the noise coming from inside the hotel that was disruptive. And I believe it was due to our room location. We were in a room which shared a small vestibule with the room next door, and was directly across the hallway from the housekeeper's closet. Starting at 8:00 am, the housekeeping door opened and shut every 10 minutes. It was a heavy door and was very loud. Because our room shared a vestibule with the room next door, every time our next door neighbor entered or left, it was as though a door in our room slammed. And when they had room service delivered, we heard every detail, down the the request for extra ketchup. In the hotel's defense, i never brought this to their attention. Their service was attentive enough that I would imagine they would have tried to switch rooms had I brought it up. I would stay here again, but would be sure and request a quieter room.",4,2017,01,15
129,& just brilliant,"The Ampersand is a hotel that we fell in love with and will most certainly be staying at next time we venture to London.

5 things that made the Ampersand great:

15 minute walk to Harrods

Great boutique cafes, restaurants and shops a stroll away

2. Beautiful interior design and common spaces

Modern and contemporary, while respecting the heritage of the building

Interesting art throughout

Lush library and private dining room

3. Gorgeous suites

Super comfy bed with high bed heads

Awesome Mediterranean food at night",5,2017,01,14
129,seriously perfect,"A perfect stay by all means. I travel for business mainly staying overnight and, the Ampersand offered me what I always look for. Quality in service and product. Big thanks to all individual working there, made my short stay very enjoyable. Hotel was great, the room was just what I needed. All my room requests were fulfilled at no time and I just couldn't ask for anything else. 
I am booking as we speak my room for my next trip to London",5,2017,01,13
129,Recommended,"I stayed at the Ampersand in January with my wife and I can highly recommend this hotel. Very stylish interiors coupled with very polite and helpful staff ensured a very comfortable stay. 

The area around the hotel is very pleasant with many local cafes, restaurants and delis (we chose to eat breakfast at Muriel's Kitchen opposite hotel every morning for something a bit different).

The underground station is also located opposite the hotel and just a short 10 minute tube ride on the Piccadilly Line gets you to the major central attractions.

The nightly price of the Ampersand was very reasonable (we paid ¬£180 a night room only) and when compared to some of the more well known hotels, the Ampersand certainly holds it own.

We would definitely stay again and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a sort stay in London.",5,2017,01,13
129,Christmas in London,"Unfortunately, I was sick during my stay in London (in the room for 5 days)  and the hotel staff were very accommodating and attentive. The hotel is lovely and a great location, and the afternoon tea was a delight!",5,2017,01,12
129,Lovely boutique hotel in fab South Kensington location,"Rooms and baths were gracious and luxury quality.  Breakfast was friendly and excellent. Tea room was exquisite. Walked to restaurants, museums and parks. Bus was outside the door and tube station just a block away.",5,2017,01,11
129,Short London trip,"Excellent location. Beautiful hotel. The room could have been a bit too warm at times but everything else was excellent. Very convenient location with very good access to busses, tube, taxis and restaurants.",5,2017,01,11
129,Honest & Lovely Gem,"Beautiful hotel with traditional high quality of service and full of integrity. An honest product that shall not let one down.  The comelette hotel paradigm has been intricately planned and executed, whilst being managed by a very competent General Manager with vast 5 Star experience and effective leadership qualities.  The team are all fantastic, this will be my new place to stay in London! ",5,2017,01,10
129,Superb location; Elegant not stuffy; Clean as a whistle!,"The Ampersand is a lovely  property - full of charm without being stuffy. Location can't be beat; and exceedingly clean. Front desk crew lovely but not expert in advice on getting around town. One small glitch during our 6 night stay - room was not cleaned upon our 4:00pm return, but hotel addressed promptly. Booking was a bit complicated - special offers available but not easily accessible and a bit of bait and switch. Overall positive and would definitely return. ",4,2017,01,10
129,Great hotel in cool area of London,"A true studio hotel, with attention to detail and high standards. Close to London tube and from here easy access to the whole of London. Very good staff that understands your needs and seems to enjoy to work there. Good breakfast also.",5,2017,01,10
129,very good,"good location , very comfortable , helpful stuff ,near knightsbridge , victoria and albert museum , south kensington garden, south kensington underground station , quite area every thing was good at all ",4,2017,01,09
129,My go to in London from now on...,"I booked the Ampersand at the tail end of a five city European trip. It takes a lot to wow a weary traveller who has been city / hotel hopping for over two weeks, but WOW, I loved this establishment! From the hipster vibe (where you actually feel a part of the movement, not some old fogey being left in the dust while young men with ironic beards and purple shoes do their thing) to the funky, yet beautifully done tea room to the comfortable, beautiful, nicely sized rooms, to the fantastic breakfasts (did not care one whit the they were not included, they were worth every penny (about 12 pounds for a full on bfast, that kept me going until dinner). We had bfast there every morning, and I never do that! Addin that the South Ken station is literally two blocks away and the rink at the Museum of Natural history was no more than a five min walk (we actually brought our skates, skated, brought our skates ""home"" and went on with our day) and that all my London friends gave the place a thumbs up...well, its a winner! And a value to boot.... I hate to let everyone in on the secret, but its too good to keep to myself!...",5,2017,01,09
129,Wonderful,"I had a wonderful stay at The Ampersand Hotel. Beautiful place with lovely and friendly people. Elegant,cozy and modern decor  with a beautiful view. Location is great with many wonderful places around. Will be staying there in the future again.Thank you very much",5,2017,01,09
129,Nice new spot!,"We had a suite which was really spacious, and, even more wonderful...we had a small parisian balcony. Small, but still! :)  Very friendly staff, location is perfect as well. Wasn't impressed with breakfast but otherwise all good.",4,2017,01,09
129,"Beautiful hotel, but avoid small, dark rooms","We've stayed here several times over the past two years, but our most recent visit was disappointing. The hotel itself is beautiful and perfectly located for Natural History Museum, V&A and Kensington tube. The staff are usually polite and helpful, and the restaurant (Apero) is great - we've had fabulous breakfasts and evening cocktails there. It is expensive, but no more than similar hotels and the surrounding area. The decor and branding are great and there are some really nice touches - free umbrellas for guest use, lovely toiletries etc

We stayed in a double room for one night before Christmas. The room size is flagged on the website as a 'small double and suitable for 1-2 nights', so we assumed it would be fine for our stay. We don't require much space, but this particular room felt dark, claustrophobic and was really badly designed. There was one small window looking out on to a brick wall and nowhere to put any bags or coats. There was a tiny hanging space over the tea tray which couldn't be used (even for a shirt) unless you moved the tray either to the floor or the small desk - the only available surface. Even then it's not big enough for a jacket or dress. Even a hook on the wall would have been helpful! Also, no mirror near desk or plug socket which is frustrating! However, the room was clean and the bed comfortable.

I assume the room was accessible as it was close to the lift and had a huge, wheelchair user friendly bathroom, which was about the same size as the bedroom. As always, the bathroom had gorgeous decor, heated floor, great showers and lovely cosmetics etc but I would think twice about staying here again unless I could guarantee a better room.",5,2017,01,09
129,This hotel is worth a five star review,"The decor in every inch of this hotel has clearly been carefully thought through, the cocktails, the food, the service and the standard of the room was well worth the money. thank you for a great stay, i have already recommended this hotel to others. ",5,2017,01,08
129,Perfect,"Perfect location (close to major attractions and around the corner from Harrods), perfect bed, great food. Our room was amazing, the bed even more so, we didn't want to leave! The staff was also very helpful in helping us plan.",5,2017,01,08
129,Stunning luxury hotel close to all amenities,"We were pleasantly surprised with the Ampersand during a recent family visit to London. The hotel is in a great location very close to a number of restaurants as well as very close to the South Kensington tube station with easy access to the circle and district lines. The rooms were spacious, quiet and the free minibar was a pleasant surprise. The staff were friendly and courteous and we will have no hesitation in returning. ",5,2017,01,08
129,FABULOUS!!!!!,The Ampersand is a beautiful hotel.  Perfect location. Brilliant staff. My favorite London hotel. Located a block from the Museum of Natural History and the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Directly across from the South Kensington tube station.  Excellent restaurants surrounding. ,5,2017,01,06
129,The went above and beyond. Excellent hotel,"We arrived at 9am on an overnight flight from the US.  Our room wasn't ready, but the staff said they would do their best to get it ready early. We had a lovely breakfast downstairs, took a little walk outside and then had coffee in the very relaxing lobby. By 11:35 our room was ready, more than 2 hours before check in time!

The room was very clean and well-decorated. The bathroom was spotless. We had a room-service dinner that was excellent.

The staff was very nice and efficient. We had to get an early taxi to LHR and they got one for us pronto at an excellent price!

We'll stay there again. Really nice place and great location.",5,2017,01,06
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Great hotel, great service and location. Hotel is clean and stylish, you feel like you are at a luxurious hotel. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, only down side is car parking a bit of a pain and it's very expensive. ",4,2017,01,05
129,Just an all round great hotel (And we are fussy),"Everything about this hotel was great. Modern, great service, quality materials and furniture and great location in London close to the Museum belt, near good restaurants and South Ken Tube station. Also great value for what you get. We stayed there with our two young girls as a family, I would highly recommend this without any reservation... and we are very very fussy ;-)",5,2017,01,05
129,Another fabulous trip to The Ampersand,"We cant recommend this hotel highly enough. For London the room standard and service standard are excellent. Location wise for shopping and entertainment and museums, you are very central but away from the main tourist traps. We will be back again!!!  ",5,2017,01,05
129,Luxury stay in London.,The only hotel I use when I stay in London now. Staff always make you feel special and the rooms are beautiful. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for. Some say the trims are small but the descriptions are clear. Perfect for a trip to the museums or to the high streets of Knightsbridge and Kensington. ,5,2017,01,05
129,"Nice hotel, close to shops and attractions ","We stayed for 3 nights in a deluxe double. Large room for London but so was the price tag. Very convenient and close, walking distance to everything. Great breakfast downstairs. Staff were lovely and helpful. Nice decor inside. ",4,2017,01,05
129,Lovely boutique hotel,"This is our 2nd time staying at The Ampersand.  Still as good as ever. Excellent service, convenient location, super cool interiors.  Rooms are on the small side but works just fine.  Will be coming back for another visit as soon as we can manage.",5,2017,01,04
129,"So comfortable, such good light, so well designed!","Perhaps the hotel rooms at the Ampersand were designed by women, because they are superb. I've stayed in many hotel rooms, including Ritz Carlton, Shangri-La, and other relatively high-end rooms, but this is the best ever. First of all, the room was spacious, despite being right in London. There was a king-size bed and a couch and a desk and . . . and . . . and space to walk around. In the bathroom, there were two showers, each with both a rain shower head and a hand-held. The sink was small enough to lean across to look closely in the mirrror, and the sink was well lit (this is why I think a woman was involved in the design). 
I should mention that our room seemed to be designed for disabled guests and would be wonderful for accessibility. We may have had extra space because of that.
All of the fixtures in the room were very modern. The free Wifi was very fast. 
And the staff members were very friendly and helpful.
The public rooms were as attractive as the guest rooms. Very nice.
Lots to do in the area. Good restaurants nearby too. We did not try the hotel's restaurant.
And the price was quite reasonable for such a good hotel.
The only potential drawback is the Underground trains that pass below the hotel.  We were on the first floor and could feel them. It didn't bother us, but it likely would bother some people. Higher floors may not have the same problem.
I'm looking forward to returning.",5,2017,01,04
129,Great hotel in London,"This is a lovely hotel in London, great location close to the tube.   Our room was fairly large, and had soundproof windows.   The bed was extremely comfortable.   The room was very clean.   The staff was amazing.   We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, we went out for breakfast, but we did have drinks in the restaurant downstairs.   This is a very pleasant stay, and we will try to stay there on our next visit.",5,2017,01,04
129,Lovely hotel,"Loved the beautiful hotel and its closeness to buses, the tube a lovely restaurants. This was one of my favorite hotels during our 3 week stay in England. The room was great, clean and double showers were a great addition.",5,2017,01,03
129,The perfect London hotel,"We stayed at the Ampersand for 3 nights over New Year and loved this place!

First of all, the location is outstanding! South Kensington is a very beautiful part of the city, it's quite and calm and yet very close to the center. The hotel itself is 1 minute away from the South Kensington tube station which brings you to Piccadilly Circus  and the other sightseeings within minutes!

The staff was very friendly and proactively helpful. The first night we arrived we had to hurry for a dinner reservation so the staff hurried up with the check-in and suggested to take all our luggage to the room so we can directly jump into a cab. One night my girlfriend was sick which the guys saw when we came back to the hotel so they stopped by to ask if they can support us in any way...this was at 2 in the morning!! Never had such a great experience with hotel staff.

The breakfast was good. The buffet is not very rich but offers a sufficient choice and everything is fresh and tasty! 

We had a deluxe room on the 3rd floor. It was quite large which is not given for a London hotel! It was very clean and quite nicely furnished. We really enjoyed staying there especially because the bed was super comfortable!!

Overall our experience at the Ampersand was fantastic and we will come back for sure!",5,2017,01,03
129,1st Choice Hotel in London,"This was our second visit to the Ampersand. This time for New Years.   I'd almost like to keep it a secret because it's that special.  Everything from the bellhops to check-in to housekeeping to room service was impeccable.  Would recommend the larger suites with a balcony on the fourth floor.  Much more space to stretch out.  Anytime I would call for ice, an iron or even more soft drinks for the complimentary mini-bar, everything was delivered within minutes.  I started to time them (on a whim) and everything arrived within 5-7 minutes.  Try finding that a large hotel.  The rooms are exceptionally clean and the downstairs breakfast was delicious, reasonable (for London) and the staff was friendly and attentive .  We never wanted to venture out for breakfast.  Could not have been a more pleasant stay.  Shhh....Don't tell anyone.  I don't want the Ampersand to be sold out the next time I want to stay.",5,2017,01,02
129,Great service friendly staff,"Had a great stay on New Year's Eve, lovely hotel, great location, good value and excellent staff. Easy access from tube station a walk out offers plenty of dining options with the Kensington cafe culture on your doorstep.",5,2017,01,02
129,"Great location, wonderful rooms","We have stayed at the Ampersand Hotel three times now and would definitely recommend the larger rooms with the free-standing tub. We love the location - easy walk to Harrods and with two tube lines servicing South Kensington means we can get around London very quickly.
Rooms are furnished with style, housekeeping is impeccable, the beds are very comfortable and the blackout blinds a treat when trying to get over jet lag!
Both the continental and hot English breakfast are delicious - we have been extremely happy with our stay each time and we always come back! ",5,2017,01,02
129,Great South Kensington location (across from tube) and very quiet,"The Ampersand was a very nice, absolutely finely furnished and expertly updated hotel. My superior room 217 was very quiet, across from a school where kids were out only during the day and much nicer than the quirky photos would lead you to think. It was spacious, the bed very comfortable, clean and tidy. Housekeeping did an excellent job. The smaller bathroom was fine and everything worked flawlessly. My best stay of many London hotels over the years, at an unbelievable 3 for 2 promotion of ¬£157/night! (early December, off season... the best time to travel.) Plenty of restaurants outside and around the corner, as well as the tube station, so I did not dine at the hotel (breakfast seemed a little pricey and had a full English out for less than ¬£10). If I had to come up with any complaints it was with check in, but only had to do that once. I'm hard of hearing and the front desk gal did not speak clear English: that's London these days. Planning my return and booking again here, unfortunately not at the same price. Very highly recommend the Ampersand.",5,2017,01,01
129,Fabulous Hotel in beautiful South Kensington,"We loved The Ampersand. Great service and staff. Beautiful rooms ( some rooms are on the small side, for US standards) lovely appointed and very nicely decorated with very comfy beds. Fabulous location near train, restaurants and many sights. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,01
129,Perfect,"We stayed here on New Year's Eve and everything about the hotel was perfect, clean, modern, in a great location. Bed was extremely comfortable and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was divine. Staff were very helpful.  We will definitely be returning !",5,2017,01,01
129,Amazing design boutique with fun features ,"Just about everything about the ampersand is fantastic 

Perfect location in south Kensington just steps from the underground, also only steps from several world class museums. 

Property is beautiful with teal and lavender features, bespoke details and several gorgeous common spaces like the tea room and the gaming center downstairs. 

Rooms are a tad small for a longer stay for 2 people  (where to put all of your things- we got creative with shelving and night stand drawers) but comfortable throughout.  Especially good in that this trip I got a bad cold and held up in the room more than I usually would. 

Desk staff was also incredibly courteous and  happy to assist with an ask.  

If I ever need to be back in the London area I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again ",5,2017,01,01
129,A great little nest,"My husband discovered this hotel during a business trip to London. We have used South Kensington as a base for our European travels for 24 years and for the past four years, the Ampersand has been our choice of hotels. The hotel is beautifully furnished and our choice has been the deluxe room. The afternoon teas and breakfast selection match the quality of the furnishings and attention to detail that is seen throughout the hotel. We were however a little disappointed with our allocation of room during a recent stay that put us on the top floor where low ceilings and small sized rooms made it feel a bit squeezy; especially so with the bathroom where you need to mind the corners of the generous wash basin that dominates the tiny space. On the plus side, the beds are beautiful and more like a nest that makes sleeping extremely comfortable. It is also great to be able to open a window!",5,2016,12,31
129,Perfect in every way,Our second time at The Amphersand was just as great as our first. Wonderful rooms and fantastic staff Quaint basement bar... I could have happily stayed much longer! Great value for such a luxe hotel right in the heart of South Ken. Very central with lots of great French cafes surrounding. Home from home. Highly recommend. Can't wait to return...,5,2016,12,30
129,Amazing hotel!!!,This was an amazing hotel. We had a baby with us and the deluxe room was the perfect size. The staff were very professional and friendly. We had dinner at the aperitif restaurant one night and it was amazing too.,5,2016,12,29
129,A wonderful afternoon tea at Ampersand Hotel!,"My friends and I highly enjoyed our afternoon tea at Ampersand Hotel. The food (with and without gluten) was fresh, well-thought, delicious, and artistically presented,accompanied by wonderfully aromatic loose tea. The staff were welcoming, polite, always with a smile on their face and happy to attend any requests we had. I particularly valued the Christmas decorations and the set-up of the venue where tables were well spaced between them. Overall a highly valued experience which is well-priced. I would recommend it without a second thought!",5,2016,12,29
129,Modern and very comfortable,"We had a fantastic stay. The staff were really friendly and very efficient. The hotel is very modern as well as very clean and my only negative criticism was that the gym was quite small, but had the basics. On the plus side, the bed was so comfy we didn't want to get out of it. 

Overall, an excellent place to stay and highly recommended!",5,2016,12,29
129,Room small but sufficient,"The staff are friendly and there is a pre visit email to establish preferences. Room was small and a bit dark but had reasonable facilities , good toiletries including face wipes and is situated in a busy area with excellent derstaurants nearby. Perfect for a lone business man or woman.",4,2016,12,28
129,Lovely surroundings and great location,I have been here twice for a day meeting. Great location and lovely surroundings. Some great ideas and menu's but the staff while pleasant need a bit more fineness and to put themselves in the customers shoes when they do things.,4,2016,12,28
129,Great hotel in a fantastic location ,"The location I think is the best in London. Accross the road from Sth Kensington tube (on circle, district and Piccadilly lines so easy to travel anywhere in London). So many good restaurants and cafes a few minutes walk away. Walking distance to shops on kings road and Knightsbridge. Rooms are beautiful but our rooms were the small ones but still nice. Really loved the l'occitane toiletries. Breakfast in the restaurant was great. Eggs benedict and full English as good as we remembered from our last stay. Highly recommend. ",5,2016,12,27
129,This place is a gem!,"We spent 6 nights at the Ampersand and loved everything about it. It's a hip, low key place. The staff is very warm and welcoming and they were extra nice to our 8 year-old. Our deluxe room was spacious enough for 3 of us.  It was so great to have the refrigerator stocked with sparkling/still water, juice and soft drinks - free of charge. Everything was nice and clean. The location couldn't be more convenient --just a half block from the South Kensington tube station. We will definitely return!

",5,2016,12,26
129,Excellent South Ken Hotel,"Brilliant location, lovely design and excellent service. One of the few hotels I would recommend without reserve. Couldn't be more convenient for the museums, tube and restaurants. Well-appointed rooms with great showers, underfloor heating in the bathroom.",5,2016,12,26
129,Great place,Great place to stay. Would highly recommend it. Friendly people and great location. The heated bathroom floors was an added treat. I would not hesitate to come back to the Ampersand on a future trip. See you next time!,5,2016,12,25
129,So lovely,"We stayed in this hotel for three nights in October. It was exactly what I prefer in a London hotel - quaint, charming, and clean. The rooms are beautifully decorated, the shower was great (plus speakers in the bathroom for playing music), and the bed was comfortable. It's also located within a stone's throw to the South Kensington subway station, which was perfect for getting everywhere around London. Can't wait to stay here again. ",5,2016,12,25
129,Short Stay,This was the second time I have stayed at the Ampersand and both times have been excellent. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the quality of room is excellent. The only food I had whilst at the hotel was breakfast but this was also very good...a few steps up from your usual hotel breakfast buffet. Choice was good and ingredients excellent. I would happily reccomend a stay at the Ampersand to anyone looking for a high quality but reasonably priced stay in London.,5,2016,12,25
129,Short Trip to London,It was our 3rd time in the Ampersand Hotel and it was excellent as we knew from the former stays...you will not regret!!! We count the days till our next stay. Near Hide Park and some great museums...go and enjoy,5,2016,12,23
129,My new London favourite ,"First time guest at The Ampersand and I will definitely be back.
The size, the service, the location, the rooms, the facilities are great.
Will be back.
If there were any small improvements, the wifi was not great speed in the room even on the room bubble; shower water pressure could be increased.",5,2016,12,23
129,An Excellent Stay in London,"The Ampersand exceeded our expectations and made our stay most pleasant. The staff was friendly and efficient. The room quiet, comfortable, and always very clean. The location‚Äîfor the underground station and restaurants‚Äîwas perfect. We would definitely chose this hotel for our next visit.",5,2016,12,22
129,"Was ok, good situated","Nice hotel but we were on the storey, streetside : too much noice and smoke of people smoking outside came in through the window as this was just a little openend....
Location of hotel was very good, near to tube and busses, museums, Hyde Park...",3,2016,12,21
129,Beautiful hotel in good location,"We loved the Ampersand, lovely interior, both rooms and communal areas. Breakfast was lovely with some nice options on the a la carte menu, not expensive either, the duck hash with duck egg was unusual and delicious. Location  just across the road from South Kensington underground station is ideal. Only gripe we had has that our room was always too hot when we returned to the room, the heating set itself at 27¬∞C and seemed to heat even when we were out? We opened a window and switched it off each time but next time we returned it was 27 again. We did report it but it didn't get fixed, probably too difficult, or they though it was nice and warm? We still loved the hotel anyway.. And the 3 nights for 2 package make it a good deal!!
",5,2016,12,21
129,Exceptional!,"I have not had better hotel experiences than those I've had at The Amersand. The staff is exceptionally friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The location is superb. Rooms are clean, well-decorated, and comfortable. I look forward to returning on my next visit to London. ",5,2016,12,21
129,Lovely boutique hotel,"Stayed for a single night in December. Lovely quiet hotel, brilliant location, out of the centre, but not too far and easy to get to. Wish we could have stayed longer. Very comfortable, relaxing and luxurious.",5,2016,12,20
129,West End Base,"We chose The Ampersand, because of its excellent position close to South Kensington tube, although we only stayed one night and were out and about most of the time, the hotel was to a high standard and the staff were excellent and friendly. Found it an excellent experience and would stay again and recommend. Nice touch with the Christmas Elf presents.",5,2016,12,20
129,Poor value for the money,"As advertised, the room was minute, but (not as advertised) the layout was very poor - the biggest problem being the need to sit in the sink in order to access the shower. Good thing I am still fit. The staff were polite, but not very switched on (eg, directing me to the Library, but not telling me that the room was booked so inaccessible). The instructions in the room were poor so I had to go to reception more than once to ask about eg how to access WiFi (there being no response to a phone call). A customer focused hotel would have warned guests that South Ken Station and the hotel are not step free. I'll stop there. I spend a lot of time in London. This hotel was very poor value for the money.",2,2016,12,19
129,Gets it very right ,"After a nearby hotel cancelled our stay less than 24h before (and poor effort to resolve by the booking company) we were relieved to get a room here which turned out really well for us. The hotel is a 2 min walk from South Kensington tube. Very comfortable room, great bed, little bit tight for getting around the room because of an unnecessary chaise longue at the foot of the bed. From an umbrella in the wardrobe to complimentary soft drinks in the nicely chilled fridge and decent filter coffee, everything is really well thought out. The bathroom is well appointed and decent L'Occitane toiletries are provided. The subtle ornithological decor theme throughout works and the front of house team are superbly professional. The restaurant and bar looked great but this was a flying stay. ",5,2016,12,18
129,Highly recommended,"Great hotel with the friendliest staff. Comfortable beds, an amazing shower and everything was fresh and clean. And minutes from South Ken tube. A real find I'd recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in London ",5,2016,12,18
129,"Peace and quiet, with top class service",This hotel provides a tranquil experience which is so essential after the experience of London and its congestion. The staff are excellent providing all you need and so friendly which is a nice aspect. Good restaurant.,5,2016,12,17
129,Great location,"Ampersand offered us a pleasant stay ! rooms are small but had all the comfort needed bedding is high standards and hygiene is impeccable.
The complimentary concierge that you could carry along all day wherever you are with 24/7 connection to internet was absolutely amazing !! 
The hotel location was fantastic walking distance to many attractions and 2 minutes away from south kensington station.
I do recommend the Ampersand strongly.",5,2016,12,15
129,Great location,"Ideal for a short stay. The rooms are comfortable, our just needed a mirror. The staff were very friendly and efficient, especially the porters. Breakfast was good, we only used the buffet. Excellent location Knightsbridge in walking distance. Taxis and buses are available right outside.",4,2016,12,14
129,Great hotel in great location,"I recommend this hotel as it is in a great location, friendly staff, clean rooms, hot showers and nice bed. 
 
I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to work in the room because it is not really set up for that.  Better for someone on a break or someone with somewhere else to work. 

Room service menu is limited but what they do have is done well.  ",5,2016,12,13
129,Nice Weekend,"My recent stay at the Ampersand Hotel was wonderful albeit short. The hotel is only a few blocks away from the tube making it very accessible. The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood a short distance from the V & A museum. In terms of dining I found the immediate area a bit lackluster. There are some restaurants in the area and there is a bit of a variety but unless you know exactly what you want to eat or where you want to go you may be slightly disappointed. That being said the hotel has a fantastic restaurant and bar. I only ate breakfast here which I had the full English which was phenomenal.   The hotel bar is also incredible. I have to compliment Lucca, our bar tender. He's funny, helpful and has a fantastic knowledge of all sorts of cocktails and if the bar doesn't have a specific liquor or ingredient Lucca knows great substitutes. 
The room I stayed in was nice. It was very comfortable and the heated bathroom tiles certainly made getting up for my very early morning shower more bearable!  The front desk staff was also very helpful and provided great recommendations.",5,2016,12,12
129,Ampersand,"Excellent independent hotel. Good breakfast, good restaurant. Great (de luxe) room. Do t see what else you need to k ow. oh, service is very good, the Reno action is excellent I would suggest booking through Mr and Mrs Smith. We got an upgrade and some extra goodies (glass of fizz and choices) ",5,2016,12,12
129,Dec 16,"IF we go to London again we will stat at the ampersand again, the location is perfect, service great, big nice Roms with tv in the bathroom, you even had a phone in your room that you could take with you when you went out, for calls and free internet",5,2016,12,11
129,We'll be back,"The hotel has and Excellent location, staff and service.
Next time we will ask for bigger rooms, the assigned ones were very small, one of them with no bathtub (121 & 122). The hotel bell service was great and the apero Too.
 we will be back",5,2016,12,11
129,Perfect stay,"Ideally located in the heart of South Kensington (right in front of the tube station). Rooms are nice, cosy. Staff is kind and helpful. The bar is located downstairs and is really nice. We will definitely come back next year!",4,2016,12,11
129,Fantastic boutique hotel! Highly recommended!,"I truly wouldn't be able find anything to fault at this hotel even if I tried. The service is excellent. The staff is friendly yet professional. We travelled with a 7 month old and we had a babycot in the room when we arrived and the lifts operate all levels so there were no problems getting around with the stroller. The room was perfectly tempered, the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. We will definitely stay at the Ampersand next time we visit London.",5,2016,12,10
129,Great location ..and quirky which makes a pleasant change from the chain brands,"Our second stay this year and we continue to enjoy its ideal location for most places in town given its proximity to South Ken tube 
Quirkily decorated its staff are friendly and helpful 
Breakfast is good if a little chaotic at peak times and the lounge is a great spot to relax with a drink 
",5,2016,12,10
129,Holiday trip,"Good hotel, good place (near metro), easy to get Heathrow airport (Piccadilly line).
Safe neigbourhood.
Clean and peacefull rooms, polity staff.
There was nice cofeplaces and supermarkets and other stores nearby. 

",4,2016,12,10
129,Small rooms,"Good price but room was so small if you were in it for long you would kill who you were with. Tiny bothroom, my cat wasn't swung.
Great position clean fantastic staff good value for wher the hotel is.
Will use again.",4,2016,12,10
129,The perfect London hotel!,"Hotel is in a great location near the underground, easy to to get to all points of interest, shopping, restaurants, etc. Nice small boutique hotel - be sure and book a room with a balcony - views of the city are great!",5,2016,12,09
129,Value for money!,"Great stay, really good service, nice room with all facilites you could ask for even if my rather cheap room was a bit small, however well planned. Common areas also very nice and same goes for breakfast!",4,2016,12,09
129,Just the ticket,"Our party of four descended upon The Ampersand hotel for one night in December and had a real treat.
We drove down and our car was immediately taken away by a member of staff and securely parked close by.
The reception was busy but we were swiftly dealt with by smiley, friendly staff.
Initial reactions were that this hotel was stylish, trendy and busy and we weren't mistaken.
Both rooms, on different floors, were extremely clean, comfortable, warm with interesting new electronic lighting switches, and 'handy' smart phone for your personnel use( excellent idea) and top end toiletries....including the rubber ducks!
We all had delicious cocktails, well served and reasonably priced for where we were, both before and after our evening out.
The position of the hotel, just 2 minutes walk from the tube station was another bonus.
An excellent choice and we will return!",5,2016,12,09
129,Fantastic!!!,My daughter and I had 24hrs in London and loved this hotel! The service was just perfect-not at all stuffy and the people were smart and fun. The cocktail bar in the basement was the cutest we've tried in London and the drinks were delicious.,5,2016,12,08
129,pleasat stay,the staff at reception was very professional. once arrived we experienced a plaisant stay in a comfortable room on the third floor. the bed was excellent and the bathroom was foreseen of several accessories. the portable Phone in the rooml is a nice gadget,4,2016,12,08
129,excellent hotel,"located next to S. Kensington tube, easy access everywhere, we bought a daily ticket that can be used on buses as well for ¬£12.10, the no 14 goes strait to Harrods. Loved the hotel with best beds and pillows I have ever had. Clean, modern with super staff, esp at reception, v helpful. Didn,t eat in the hotel but so many lovely eateries for breakfast and lunch on the doorstop. Pauls for baguettes, pastries and cakes is a must.",5,2016,12,08
129,Great Location Near South Kensington/Museums,"Wonderful boutique hotel with chic modern music theme. You will love it!

The rooms are small, but this is London. The beds were comfortable with turn down service offered on the first night.  This mid-size hotel has an excellent location and pleasant staff. The staff was willing to answer questions and made recommendations about restaurants. Do not expect complementary upgrades unless you pay. We had requested a walk-in shower as my husband is rather tall. I emailed my request and was informed they would try to accommodate our request. When we checked-in, we mentioned the email and the young man at the desk, while not rude, just didn't seem to care.  If you are looking for a mid-price option, this is the place. It has a small restaurant and lounge for typical light breakfast and tea/coffee.

FYI:   Our perception is that the hotel was LGBT (gay friendly). We had good interactions, with most of the staff and felt very welcomed. 

Pros-    Modern Decor
             ATM/Cash Point Machine Nat West front of building
             2 minute walk to Tube Stop

129,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel. Wish we could have stayed longer. Rooms were smart, clean, comfortable and cheerful. Shower products were very good quality. Towels and robes were fluffy. Room service very efficient. Very hard to find any fault at all.",5,2016,12,07
129,Gorgeous hotel,"Lovely hotel and brilliant staff. Stayed in the suite on 5th floor which was beautiful and had good space with two small children. Couldn't fault the stay. Breakfast delicious. Location perfect and a small walk to restaurants, bars and museums.",5,2016,12,07
129,Definitely Recommend,We were very happy and satisfied with the quality of service. The location of the hotel is also so convenient with many cafes and shops . The brekfast is so well and the price is not high for what you get served. I highly recommend it. ,5,2016,12,07
129,A Great Time in South Ken.,"The care of our room was excellent with attention given to all relevant items. Service at breakfast and for late drinks was all that was required. A welcome on return and ""enjoy the day"" on leaving added a personal touch which was much appreciated. ",5,2016,12,06
129,Wonderful,"I love this hotel - the rooms & decor are outstanding.  Location brilliant for easy access to top museums & shops, right next to South Kensington tube station.  Rooms very comfortable - smaller rooms are lovely so no need to upgrade ! ",5,2016,12,06
129,vey good!,All was great if you do not mind very small rooms. Its a phantasmic location and overall I can recommend this Hotel. The only complaint I have is the gym: It was not very clean but compared to all the positive sides of the Hotel its really nothing major. ,4,2016,12,05
129,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is truly a wonderful find.  The location is superb being right next to South Kensington tube station, the d√©cor is unusual, quirky and gorgeous and the staff are really friendly (as were the other guests, as a result I think) and helpful.  Best of all is the room itself which, whilst small (there are larger ones available), is one of the only ones in the world which was appointed with everything one could need and was very quiet!  I have long hair and need two towels in a hotel...the Ampersand provided us with huge towels and robes! The bathroom itself had shampoo AND conditioner (win win) as well as  eye make up remover!  The shower was amazing (loved the Ampersand duck!).  The digital 'handy' which you can take out with you is a terrific perk.  All in all a great find and one which I will be visiting again",5,2016,12,05
129,not 5 stars,"We had problems at check in, credit card was blocked. The room was not a deluxe, our view was a building, a small and narrow window. The air in the room was stifling and the air conditioning system noisy.
Only the location was excellent
 ",2,2016,12,05
129,Stay let down by service,"Trip was let down by unhelpful staff at entrance and heating not working in room. We travelled with a baby, and although the website explained there were stairs to entrance, there was no staff to help open door or assist in anyway. 2nd night our heating broke and we were offered a portable radiator. Not the kind of thing I would expect for a room at this price. Food was good",2,2016,12,05
129,Lived up to its rating....I highly recommend.,"The hotel is easy to get to from Heathrow. You jump on the subway at Heathrow and take the Piccadilly line to South Kensington. (Take BA to Terminal 5 if you can, as you can get on the subway right there without the 20 minute underground walk from the other terminals). The hotel is about 2 minutes from South Kensington subway station. 

The staff are friendly and excellent. We landed in London at 5 AM from the US, and got to the hotel at 7 AM. The staff said they had a room so we could check in now, many hours before the official check in time. This was much appreciated and allowed us to get a nap before we ventured out. 

The location could not be better. It's very easy to get around from South Ken station via the Piccadilly or District and Circle lines. For those that don't know, South Kensington is a central, safe and upmarket area so it's a fine choice for location. 

The hotel was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. They also had soft pillows instead of the often hard and lumpy ones you get at hotels. Also, the bed was a real King size bed (which is something you have to be wary of in Europe because many times the bed is not that big). The room was a little on the small size, but perfectly fine....and you are not in London to stay in your hotel room. 

I also thought the price was good value for money. I would highly recommend this hotel. 

Try and get a high floor. We were on the top floor and did not have any street noise. But it's a busy city so you probably would not want to be on the ground floor. 

*Can't comment on the food as I did not have it.",5,2016,12,04
129,Wonderful little gem,"Will return.  Friendly, stylish, comfy with great food at breakfast, and main meal and gorgeous cocktails.  Unusually good for a hotel as I'd normally just eat out somewhere.  Quick and easy location near South Ken tube.  Wonderful beds.  Clean rooms.  Lovely atmosphere.",5,2016,12,04
129,Relaxing City break,Fantastic family suite stay - one night Great access to nearby undergroundÔºåmuseums and restaurants. Staff very helpful and attentiveÔºåwhilst retaining a relaxed atmosphere.

129,Home away from home,Perfect location and perfect hotel. Trendy bit warm   Great value.  This is our fourth stay at the hotel and we are never disappointed.  We are planning on returning next year.  Every year the hotel has met or exceeded our expectations,5,2016,11,30
129,Great hotel and location,"Location, the best! Very nice technology perks, like they provide a cell phone with data for your use during your stay and whole room is digitally controlled. Very nice bathrooms and comfortable pillows too. Bedroom space was very tight but was nicely decorated. Just wish the room had a mirrored area where you could plug in to do hair as the bathroom had no electric outlets",4,2016,11,30
129,Not a Black Weekend,"We arrived on Black Friday for a weekend stay - We had a great weekend, the hotel is amazing, the staff are first class.  Definitely stay here if you get the chance and your visit to London will be all the more special.",5,2016,11,30
129,Gem of a find,"My daughter recommended this hotel and we're glad she did. The hotel is in a lovely location. Walking distance for Knightsbridge, royal Albert hall and other attractions. All the staff were friendly and efficient. The room was small but beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The best thing was the bed!! One if the most comfy beds we've ever slept in. We could have stayed there all day!!! We definitely return. ",5,2016,11,30
129,Excellent experience!,"The hotel was absolutely delightful. Very convenient location with the South Kensington tube station only a black away as well as the Natural History Museum within a five minute walk. Great restaurants nearby, both sit down and to go, fun coffee shops and a great area to walk around and experience London. 

The hotel itself is fantastic. Very comfortable bed, charming room with character and personality, and an incredibly friendly staff. We are looking forward to a repeat visit to London and will definitely revisit this hotel when we do! ",5,2016,11,29

129,Great location in London,"Convenient, quirky and with a bustling atmosphere. I have stayed here a few times now and I love the place as it brings me into the heart of S. Kensington, its a beautifully artistic hotel but busy with an international clientele with a cosmopolitan buzz. The lounge can get extremely busy with people meeting up, but the location id=s fabulous for the museums and numerous coffee bars. Love it.",5,2016,11,28
129,Disappointing room in a beautiful hotel!,Having stayed here before I was really disappointed by the size of my room! It was tiny with a large shower room that looked like a disabled toilet! The room was so small that I had to store one of my cases in the bathroom! There was hardly any hanging space and making a cuppa was very difficult!,4,2016,11,26
129,A hidden Gem,"Great location has everything you need in the area, south ken tube next door.
Would highly recommend it as i love the area that we were in and I wished i had more time to look around and stay in the area for dinner .
make sure you Get the rooms at the back its much quieter .
Breakfast was just simple high quality product just what was needed .  ",5,2016,11,26
129,Nice hotel in a great location,"The Ampersand is a good choice in South Kensington near Piccadilly line - easy Access to anywhere in London.

129,City break ,"Fifth time in london, great hotel in means of location, facilities and rooms.
From the minute you turn up you realise that the staff have been trained to ensure you have the warmest welcome.

 the rooms are really great with amazing bedding , proper coffee machine , mini bar thats all inclusive ,  great breakfast as in food quality  but staff at breakfast restaurant need more training on service and smiling. ",5,2016,11,25
129,Wonderful stay!,"Probably the best hotel in which I have ever stayed. Everything was so nice, shiny, comfy, staff is super helpful and friendly. Even if my room was really small I found it extremely cozy and with special touch to details. How I love heated floor in the bathroom and the possibility to turn the lights off in the bathroom right from the bed! 
And the breakfast was absolutely brilliant! Wide selection of high quality food. I really hope to come back one day and stay longer in your property! Great job The Ampersand hotel Team!",5,2016,11,23
129,A wonderful stylish little gem of a hotel in an excellent location,"We had read some reviews of this hotel saying that the small rooms were tiny, so i was a little concerned when booking. However, we were only staying one night so took the plunge.
The staff at check in were charming and personable, and actually engaged in conversation with us, which was a nice surprise in London! 
The room itself certainly wasn't massive, but by London standards I was actually pleasantly surprised, and it was immaculately turned out and in excellent condition- it all looked very new and shiny! Beautiful products in the bathroom, lovely fluffy towels and lots of complimentary treats- a turn down service, Times newspaper and soft drinks mini bar- were all an addition to the experience.
We had also booked through Mr & Mrs Smith, so received a free glass of champagne which we ordered through room service and was delivered within 5 minutes, and free petit fours which we found in our room after an afternoon excursion to the Natural History Museum (less than 5 minutes down the road!)
Restaurant downstairs was great for a casual tapas style lunch on the day of check in- delicious and delicate food- though we didn't bother with breakfast and took advantage of the midday check out and rolled out the door as late as possible!
Overall, excellent staff, stylish decor, and a faultless stay for us.",5,2016,11,22
129,Hidden boutique,"Excellent hotel, in a great location, right next to S Ken tube and walking distance to major sites... only the food neeeded improving but you have many dining choices in the area. The bar serves great martinis though üòâ",4,2016,11,21
129,Beautifu hotel in a great location,"The room was beautiful, the bed extremely comfortable and I appreciated the Miller Harris products of the bathroom. The staff at the reception was very kind and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient, close to the shops and South Kensington tube station.",4,2016,11,20
129,Great place to stay,"Fabulous location next to museums, subway, shops and restaurants. . Great staff, helpful, smart. Excellent dining options in restaurant, bar and drawing room.Best bed. Small room. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.",5,2016,11,20
129,Luxurious (but reasonably priced) hotel in convenient location,My husband and I had a wonderful 4 night stay at the Ampersand Hotel. The rooms and the hotel in general are beautifully presented. The bed was really comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located a 2 minute walk to South Kensington tube station (which is on two different tube lines so it's easy to get where you need to go) and it's also only a few blocks from the natural history and science museums. South Kensington is a lovely area with beautiful architecture and nice cafes and restaurants. Staff were very helpful and always on hand to answer questions. We will definitely be back to stay at the Ampersand Hotel next time we are in London.,5,2016,11,18
129,Exceeded all expectations,"This wonderful hotel with very efficient, professional staff exceeded all of our our expectations.  The location is fantastic, the hotel is beautiful and well maintained, the room we had was beautiful and thoughtfully arranged and decorated. ",5,2016,11,18
129,Beautiful luxury hotel,"The staff at The Ampersand are wonderful and very helpful.  Room amenities are restocked on a daily basis (tea, water, juice, toiletries).  It is conveniently located near South Ken underground station as well as many coffee shops, upscale restaurants, pubs, and museums.  ",5,2016,11,17
129,Ampersand Again!,We love this hotel - fantastic location for getting around London.  We were attending the Remembrance Festival so Royal Albert Hall a 10 minute walk away.  You can hear rumblings from the tubes but we slept until 9.20 so did not affect our sleep! Great rooms with fantastic housekeeping and discreet staff.  ,5,2016,11,16
129,Excellent overnight stay,"We have stayed at The Ampersand Hotel before a couple of years ago and enjoyed it so much that we decided to stay here again.  We were not disappointed; the, room, ambience and location are all excellent and the staff are extremely helpful; nothing was too much trouble.   We had a suite, which was lovely, with a kitchen and lounge area, separate bedroom and large luxurious bathroom. The hotel is very close to the museums, just a stroll away, and Knightsbridge is within easy walking distance (approx 10 mins).  South Kensington tube station is just across the road and there are lots of pubs, cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity.",5,2016,11,16
129,Excellent stay in London,"We had an excellent stay in London in the Ampersand Hotel, near Hyde Park & Chelsea. Nice staff, restaurant and science afternoon tea! We loved the availability of the umbrellas of the hotel on a rainy day. ",5,2016,11,16
129,Constantly outperforming the perfection,Ampersand has become my one and only choice once in London. The athmo that the team has created is simply second to none and it is amassing that there is not a single flaw or a failed tune they hit. Constantly outperforming the perfection,5,2016,11,16
129,Charming and modern hotel,"This is definitely a Small Luxury Hotel kind of hotel. It's boutique, charming and the service was great.  I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the small size of the room.  We booked a superior room because it was the only category that was available at the time. Otherwise, the room was very charming and the staff were very helpful.  We got to use the gym a couple of times during our stay. It's well equipped but it's also very small. South Kensington is also a great area.",4,2016,11,14
129,"Nice hotel, great location - but small room for the price","A great location if you want to stay in Kensington. Directly at South Ken tube station gives you easy access to everything. Hotel was nice, friendly staff. Good bed, but very small room. Breakfast was good, but not very attentive staff, especially a ""fight"" to get attention for ordering additional coffee/juice. Had a late snack in the restaurant/bar, very friendly and attentive waiter staff then. All in all a good experience, but rather high price for such a small room. A plus for complimentary water/soft drink in the mini bar.",4,2016,11,14
129,Luxury night in London,2 minutes from South Kensington station with lots of restaurants and small shops nearby.  We liked the unusual and pretty decor inside the hotel.  Our deluxe bedroom had a very comfortable bed( the mattress had a supersoft topper!) and a chaiselongue at the bottom of the bed.  As for the bathroom well equipped and with underfloor heating which was lovely.   Lots of furniture but a little tight on space.  We had a room at the back which was very quiet. However on the first floor you could just about hear a faint rumble of the tube below.  Overall a very nice hotel with friendly staff.,4,2016,11,13
129,& another good alternative to stay in Kensington,"Nice ambience, very gentle people, I have the only serious remark that the default double bed is small. I am used to bigger size ones when traveling with my family and we had to upgrade the two rooms. 
Very conveniently located, close to the tube station and in the heart of South Kensington.",4,2016,11,13
129,Another good stay,"A good hotel in a good location close to all amenities and tube station.
Our room 508 was amazing thank you to all staff who were really friendly.
Breakfast good choice plenty to choose from and relaxing too.",4,2016,11,13
129,Weekend stay,"Perfect location for starting your shopping, walks in Hyde Park and sightseeing. The hotel is close to the NHM, V&A and South Kensington station. Friendly staff and nice,  quiet area. Dinner, afternoon tea and breakfast were nice but not fantastic. The bar had some fun and really nice drinks.",5,2016,11,12
129,"Ampersand, Amazing as Always","Thank you to all of the staff at the Ampersand for another flawless stay. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is second to none (especially for someone taking the tube from Heathrow). The value is great - heated floors in the bathroom, neat amenity sets, lovely staff, great food. ",5,2016,11,11
129,Great start for your trip in London,"If it's your first time visiting London, this is the right place to start with! Warm welcoming and cozy atmosphere. Strongly recommended for every aspect. Room space is a bit small for long stays.....",5,2016,11,11
129,Excellent stay,"The hotel is very well located, the rooms are very comfortable, and the hotel staff is very responsive. The restaurant next door, which is also attached to the hotel, served unique food in a very charming atmosphere. ",5,2016,11,10
129,Friendly and service minded,"We had a great time at Ampersand! We visited London in November and had never stayed at this hotel before. It was easy using the subway, and The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2016,11,09
129,Perfect place to stay,The hotel was simply perfect. The location is so convenient to the tube and the bus. So. Kensington station is across the street. The restaurant downstairs was excellent. I had the chef's choice sharing menu. The appetizers were delish and the main course of salmon and then pork was wonderful. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but the bed is so comfortable and the bathrooms are well appointed. I loved the little special touches. I highly recommend and would stay there time and again.,5,2016,11,08
129,Another excellent stay,"Having decided after 20 years to move from our usual hotel in South Kensington to another, we have been delighted to have done so. The Ampersand is simply superb - a traditional hotel with a modern twist, the staff could not be more pleasant and efficient - friendly but discreet. Food and beverage also excellent and The Ampersand is very well positioned for transport and local facilities. I can't recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2016,11,08
129,Great place to stay,Lovely boutique hotel situated in a good spot. Food and service was excellent. The only negative we're the size of the rooms but I suppose that is standard in London. It is right beside the tube which was handy for getting out and about. ,5,2016,11,08
129,A wonderful stay,"What a great stay at the Ampersand! I was allotted a Superior room on the larger side of the spectrum, which pleasantly surprised me with its size. Bed was utterly luxurious, and there were many mornings when sleeping in was much more appealing than exploring, and that says a lot for a city like London! There are a lot of charming touches to the hotel, from the little blue Ampersand rubber duckies to the library and games room -- all of which I loved. As for the location, it can't be beat if you are looking for something close to some of the city's major museums. South Ken tube stop and bus stops are steps away, which means all of London is easily accessible. Tons of restaurants and amenities (laundry, post office, groceries, pharmacies, etc.) are nearby as well. I am never one to eat somewhere ""just because it's close to the hotel,"" but if you are that kind of a person, you would do well to stay at the Ampersand. You'd be spoilt for choice.

But I'm a firm believer that what sets a hotel apart is really its staff. The staff at the Ampersand go above and beyond to be accommodating. They get accustomed to your face, greet you sincerely, and are willing to take on more than just ""I need a recommendation for a good curry."" For example, my call asking for a good suggestion for somewhere to mend a zipper turned into them sending someone to my room to fetch my dress, rush to the alterations shop, and convey my issue to the tailor in great detail -- all within 15 minutes of my call. I know this for a fact because I walked by the alterations shop on my way to the tube and saw the hotel staff with my dress explain what was wrong with the zipper. I was in a rush so I waved and left it to her, and by the time I arrived home after my day the dress was ready. From that dress to late-night wine to where to get my hair blown-out for a wedding ASAP to ideas on where to best have dinner for one, the kind staff at the Ampersand life made so much easier!

I wouldn't hesitate to book again next time I'm in London.",5,2016,11,07
129,Beautiful Hotel!,"The Ampersand is a gorgeous hotel with great service. The location is wonderful, the decor is exceptional, and the whole place is just incredible pleasant. The staff was very nice. We had a great stay!",5,2016,11,07
129,My #1 Hotel Choice in London,"I've stayed at The Ampersand for about 3 years now whenever I'm in London, and I never regret it. Fantastic service and excellent location. It's literally about 150 paces from South Kensington tube station, and a stone's throw from the Natual History Museum, V&A, Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park. For me the standout feature of the hotel is the service standard - it's excellent and consistent.",5,2016,11,06
129,good hotel but lacking something,"Well located, nice clean rooms - granted, a bit small - but overall a nice property. The issue i found was with the staff not communicating well, and the hotel closing its main door at night and having to wait a couple minutes for someone to come and open the door for you. Shouldn't be the case for a hotel of this size and stature. The staff failed to let me know there was ""Apero"" or breakfast options, etc. Felt the reception as a bit cold. Not as friendly and elegant as the Kensington Hotel down the street. ",4,2016,11,06
129,weekday visit,If can get a decent size room then stay as everything else is good and staff keen to help. Breakfast is good.If take a car and valet park then make sure ask for it 30mins before departure. Modern boutique hotel.,3,2016,11,05
129,"Well-located, well-run hotel","A perfect location, a lovely old building with modern touches inside, and a very courteous staff. We were permitted to check in early after an all-night flight. We took a forty-minute walk while the room was being readied and cleaned, and when we returned, not only was the room ready but our luggage had already been taken up to it: a nice touch. We had chosen one of the least expensive rooms in the hotel--it was indisputably small and looked at a brick wall--but it was nicely decorated and the bathroom was well-designed and well-appointed. I'd take a small room in the Ampersand over a large room in a less good hotel any day.",5,2016,11,02
129,Fantastic Location - Wonderful Staff.,"Loved every minute of my stay at the Ampersand Hotel. Best location in London - right across from the South Kensington tube and close to museums, shops, restaurants etc. Staff were amazing - rooms lovely. Had a great time.",5,2016,11,02
129,Excellent stay.,"We had the most wonderful stay at the Ampersand. It was a great location, right next to the tube,and is a beautiful hotel. The service was excellent too. It Couldn't have been more a more perfect trip to London!",5,2016,11,02
129,charming hotel,"The price(prize) of our stay is very high, knowing that the breakfast was not included and that it never varies.
The hotel is very charming end very well located in  the town.
Troubbles with the noise and vibrations in the room.",4,2016,11,02
129,Can't Wait to Return,We had a great stay at the Ampersand. The room was compact but comfortable. The staff met our every need - almost before we had the request our of our mouths. The location was convenient - one block from the Underground and in a neighborhood with tasty restaurants. Will definitely come back.,5,2016,11,02
129,Wonderful!,"Everything about this hotel is magnificent!  It is a beautiful property.  The hotel is immaculate and the service is superb.  Could not improve a thing!!!!!!
Afternoon tea is a special treat.  A great place to indulge yourself...

\",5,2016,11,01
129,Perfect for Prime Museums and Classic London Shopping,"Great hotel in the perfect central London location, just steps away from South Kensington tube.  Hotel backs onto the Cromwell Road, which houses all the great London museums, a short walk to Harrods and Harvey Nichols and a very easy tube ride to Covent Garden and theater land.  
My room was small with a queen size bed but very well appointed, extremely clean and modern inside.  The public areas of the hotel are superb, lovely tea room, great bar with total all round service.
This was my second stay here and will be back.",5,2016,11,01
129,Mother daughter trip to London looking for schools,"The Ampersand Hotel is a gorgeous boutique hotel in South Kensington.  It is close to everything!  Pubs, restaurants, Harrods, museums, parks, transportation and more. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and if you have never been to London, I highly recommend staying at this wonderful hotel.",5,2016,11,01
129,Fantastic Customer Service,"Stayed one night on 28th October 2016. Booked a suite and prior to arrival I made enquiries that our little boy would have his own sleeping  arrangements - he was delighted when we arrived in our Room to have been left an activity pack and some little toys as gifts, as well as his own little robe to wear.

The staff throughout our stay were fantastic as were the room amenities- I'd definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,01
129,Stylish hotel in great neighborhood,"The Ampersand is steps from the South Kensington metro stop.  It is beautifully designed.  Our Superior room was not large, but very comfortable and pretty, with good lighting, a nice big window, extremely comfortable bed, and well-designed bathroom.  The staff was unfailingly helpful and friendly.  I have a fond memory of tea and a perfect scone in the lovely Drawing Room.   Many wonderful eating and shopping opportunities nearby, as well as the V&A Museum.  The ""3 nights for the price of 2"" promotion was an excellent value.  ",5,2016,11,01
129,Great stay,"Very nice hotel with friendly receptionists and nice rooms. Nice breakfast hall, and good roomservice.
Stayed there for 3 nights and was well taken care of during our stay.
Would recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2016,11,01
129,The best location,This hotel was great. The location allowed easy access to numerous restaurants. Only 50m from South Kensington station. Walking distance to Victoria and Albert museum and Harrods. The rooms are reasonable size for London and service was good.,4,2016,11,01
129,"Great location, great hotel.",This hotel was recommended to me and would recommend it again to anyway. It's a block from the S. Ken tube station and a few blocks from the V&A museum. Plenty of cool places to eat on Exhibition Road too. ,5,2016,10,28
129,Wonderful stay.," A lovely stay at this great hotel.  Great location. Beautiful big room.  The hotel provide free soft drinks mini bar, (  something i've not came across  before ) AND they also provide a FREE moblie phone for guests to use during their stay..  What a wonderful bonus.    All staff that we encountered were very friendly and very professional !! ",5,2016,10,28
129,Sophistication meets luxury in the heart of South Kensington,"Spent three nights (10/6-10/9) in a deluxe double room.
I like the small details like getting a welcoming email ahead of our stay welcoming us and asking me for any special requests.
We checked in late at night and we felt welcomed by a friendly staff member,
The room was elegant, nicely decorated, and very clean. Good quality linens, toiletries, a comfortable bed, slippers, and matching robes.
The fridge contained courtesy water bottles, orange juice, and apple juice replaced every day. An optional free newspaper delivery to the door every morning was also a nice touch.
Our room (215) located on the second floor facing Harrington road was very quiet. There‚Äôs a bus stop in front of the hotel and the South Kensington tube station just across the street. Just remember the three golden rules in real estate.
We tried to have a continental breakfast at the Apero restaurant but every single table was taken. It felt like a very crowded basement and quite claustrophobic. We decided to have our cappuccinos and pastries at the Drawing Rooms in a more relaxing setting every morning instead.
We will definitely",5,2016,10,28
129,Great Stay,"Great hotel for the week we spent in London. The location was perfect. The tube, museums, restaurants & Hyde park are all walking distance. The hotel was in great condition. Room was very clean and the staff was helpful in every way. There are many hotels in town but would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2016,10,27
129,Very Good Experience,"I spent 7 days in London with my family. The Ampersand is a very well located hotel (close to the subway and some good restaurants) with top friendly service, good and very clean rooms and modern decoration. I definetly reccomend it!
  ",5,2016,10,27
129,Love this hotel...,"This was my 3rd stay at this hotel and this time it was with my young son. You cant fault this hotel, free minibar and wifi. We were given a larger small room which was fantastic plenty of room on the ground floor - no.3 at the end of the corridor - so quiet - love the heated floors - service is excellent and fantastic location - Although not the cheapest hotel in my opinion it is worth every penny based on location, service, rooms etc",5,2016,10,27
129,Pleasant stay,"Lovely staff, and nice room. It was even a mobile phone in the room with 4G, that we could take with us, visiting the city. Perfect for us, since it is expencive to use 4G in an other country. We did not try the restaurant at the hotel. There is a lot of nice places to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner not far from the hotel.",4,2016,10,26
129,Great stay in a terrific location!,"We travel to London quite a bit. This was our first stay at The Ampersand Hotel but will not be our last. From check-in to check-out...everything was terrific. My husband said, ""This is a 10-star hotel!"". Friendly staff at check-in, extremely comfortable bed, great bar (thank you, Luca!), and a really terrific location. Cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2016,10,25
129,Overall a nice place,"We stayed in a larger room and we're glad we did as we had heard their cheaper rooms are extremely small.  

Overall it was a pleasant stay with friendly staff, nice d√©cor and everything you could want for a short stay in London.

For us, it just lacked a few basic things which were style over substance and it was obvious the management hadn't stayed in the room and noticed the shortcomings.  For example, there was no mirror in the bedroom apart from the back of the wardrobe door in a dark corner.  If your partner is in the bathroom, you need to do hair / makeup etc in the dim light coming from the wardrobe which keeps switching off.

The lighting was a flashy touch system with lots of buttons which worked intermittently and the light above the tea tray - in another dark corner didn't always seem to work no matter which button you pressed.  Hence making a drink with boiling water could be dangerous.  It was nice to have some complimentary soft drinks and fresh milk as standard in the fridge though.

There was a speaker for the TV in the bathroom but a TV screen itself would be a nice touch and add a luxury feel.  Everywhere was very clean though and with lots of shiny and chrome surfaces this isn't easy.

Overall though there was nothing that would stop us returning but a few tweaks would make this place great.  They had thought about lots of little things like astro-turfing the flat roof and haviong window boxes to make the dull view a little more interesting though.
",4,2016,10,25
129,Very good and friendly hotel,"Great hotel and great location will be back staff very willing to help and made my journey easy, location great for touring London so close to the tube and on the line from heathrow and Kings cross food awesome cool space walking distance Kensington town center was a bonus ",5,2016,10,24
129,looking forward to stay again!!!,"Practical hotel location, near the underground station,  walking distance to good restaurants hyde park, Albert Hall and many other interesting places. Very kind staff always there to help you, clean and comfortable room, loved the bathroom heated floor. Delicious breakfast with plenty of choices, fresh fruit, good expresso. Stylish and cosy deco.",5,2016,10,24
129,Wonderful!,"It was an amazing week in a wonderful hotel with an excellent service.
Beautiful and clean rooms, friendly staff.
I think we will be back soon for our next London trip!
All thumbs up for this lovely place.

129,South Kensington Hideaway,"We were so pleased with staying at the Ampersand Hotel at the start of our honeymoon, that we booked a few more nights at the end of the trip. We love the South Kensington neighborhood, the helpful staff, and well-appointed rooms. Yes, the rooms are on the small side by American standards, but comfort is exceptional in every other way.",5,2016,10,22
129,Good stay,Comfort with helpful staff. A good location where we could use subway or walk to the places we wanted to visit. We are used to a big bed and the bed was a little bit to small for us. Overall a very good hotel. We mabye come back again.,4,2016,10,22
129,Not to repeated,"Reception desk and door staff need more training.   I booked valet parking and when we arrive I was told that there was no driver available. When I said I had booked this with Tracey the girl on the desk said she would check, in the meantime my husband had to drive a round the block twice whilst the driver eventually came out.  he did not have any hotel uniform on so we did not know who he was.  Reception staff and door staff need more training, they were not friendly at all, rather odd, owner should install cameras to keep a check on quality of service or not. We would not recommend this hotel despite it being close to the museums etc.",1,2016,10,20
129,Recommended,"As a Hotelier I am difficult to please, but overall I really enjoyed my stay. A few niggles room cold and air con not working as it should on my first night, staff very helpful and did everything they could. The chief engineer came the following day problem sorted, great guy polite and helpful. Room not cleaned whilst out, but a quick call and housekeeping came straight away, polite and well trained. Internet excellent but had to call down for instructions, nothing in the room info. Great breakfast, great free soft drinks. Excellent for the tube so easy to get around. The squeaky floorboards in my room drop me mad, but not in a bad way, just wanted to take the carpet up and sort them out. Hopefully the room under mine (512) does not get disturbed by them. Would I return, like a shot.",4,2016,10,20
129,Fabulous,"Fabulous stay for an extremely reasonable price through a secret escapes deal.  I would highly recommend on service and luxury.  Great decor, extremely clean.  Great service and excellent inclusive continental breakfast.  Amazing location a stone's throw from South Ken.",5,2016,10,19
129,review,service was good although at times it seemed that they needed more staff to eliminate waiting.  first room was excellent but second was a slight disappointment at the tiny bathroom. also i did not realize at the time of the second booking that i was pre-paying to get a reduced rate.  all in all though I would return and recommend the hotel.,4,2016,10,18
129,Beautiful little hotel with the best hotel bar in London!,"I absolutely loved this quirky little London hotel. The location is fantastic, I walked everywhere I wanted to go; the service is impeccable, the rooms are cozy and thoughtfully laid out, but the absolute best part is the wonderful basement bar! Inventive and delicious drinks served up by kind and knowledgeable bartenders who listen to what you want and keep you happy and hydrated all night. So much fun!",5,2016,10,17
129,Wonderful gem in Kensington,"We stopped here for one night while attending an event at the Royal Albert Hall. My thoughts in chronological order for a change to my approach in writing reviews:
 
Reception
Small but lovely lobby with a reception desk with room for 2. Staff were lovely, courteous and professional. Bags were taken to the room and the concierge man was polite, informative and didn't hang around for a tip which was a relief since I had no cash! 

Basement Bar
Once again excellent staff, friendly and professional with great cocktail knowledge! The bar itself (doubles up as an informal restaurant) was industrial in style but still welcoming and comfortable.

The Room
Our room was in a classical theme, I believe the rooms are of differing themes. The rooms are typical London size but luxuriously appointed. Super king sized bed, luxury bedding and very comfy pillows.
The room is hi-tech with touchpad controls for aircon and DND notices. The lights are  labeled next to the bed which is simple genius and you can play a joke on your partner by controlling then with the TV remoteüòÅ
The wardrobe is just about adequate and my only criticism, fine for one night but not sufficient for a few days. 
Finally, the bathroom was beautiful and finished to a very high level.

Breakfast
What a joy! For once we did not walk out the hotel for breakfast. Full English was ¬£11, plus coffee and juice costs but still, great value and made to order too; no buffet grease pools here thank goodness.

Summary
Excellent boutique hotel with friendly, professional staff coupled with high standard of rooms, facilities and an excellent value breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel for Kensington visitors especially.",5,2016,10,17
129,Nice modern place ,"I had the small double room. Very well kitted out with above average mod cons. Lovely bathroom in that there are speakers linked to the tv or music centre. 
Worth staying in just for the comedy of the room includes a ruubber duck in the bath.
",4,2016,10,17
129,Stylish wonderful groovy friendly place,"Beautiful hotel in Kensington. Greeted warmly on arrival by a very friendly young woman on reception - couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Very clean comfortable room. Wouldn't want a small double though if there's 2 of you as they are compact. Gorgeous bedding and a very ""expensive"" feel throughout. Great coffee, superb hot chocolate and fantastic breakfasts. We've stayed at the best hotels in london and this was up there as it was just so enjoyable. Great vibe so do give it a go.",5,2016,10,16
129,Great location great hotel,"I always enjoy my stays in the Ampersand, everything about the hotel is great. 
Very close to South Kensington tube with excellent links across London. 

Staff are always very friendly and make you feel at home. Great restaurants in the area too. 
",5,2016,10,16
129,A real treat to myself!,"After an arduous few months, I needed some 'me-time/ R&R'. I picked The Ampersand as it was in the area of London I wanted to visit. I was very glad to pick the Ampersand - an innovative yet classic hotel - a real treat!",5,2016,10,16
129,Wonderful hotel!,This is the second time I've stayed at the Ampersand and it's a lovely peaceful hotel in a great location. Having stayed in a variety of London hotels recently this is by far my favourite. So the rooms aren't large but most hotel rooms in London are on the small side. It is however luxurious and comfortable and you get a good night's sleep on the very comfy beds. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. I've booked again for my next trip.,5,2016,10,15
129,Great Hotel-great location-great service,"This hotel is excellent, with the subway station just steps away and the bus station infront of the building, we were capable of moving around London very easily. It's located near the Natural History Museum and other great museums! 
Their customer service is great, they provide us a cellphone with Google maps and free calls to the US and Canada so we stayed connected when we were out and about. Since we didn't like the room they initially gave us, they offered to change our luggage to a better room inmediately. 
The  room was really clean, comfortable and has beautiful decoration. the bathroom products were sensational (L'occitane). Super friendly staff, we highly recomend this place.",5,2016,10,15
129,Perfect hotel in a great location!,"The Ampersand Hotel was was the perfect base for our visit to London. Situated in lovely South Kensington close to some nice shops, cafe's and restaurants and only 50m from the Underground. The hotel was spotless, staff fantastic and our room was great. A nice touch is the complimentary water and soft drinks in the mini bar which were replenished every day. We've stayed in lots of London Hotels, The Ampersand is up there with the best of them! ",5,2016,10,14
129,"Beautiful, Wonderful Hotel in Kensington","We liked absolutely everything about The Ampersand. The hotel is beautiful, service is great, location wonderful. Restaurant and bar within the hotel are both very good, with many other places to explore within easy walking distance. There is also great public transportation with tube stop literally steps away. We will definitely stay here during any future trips to London.",5,2016,10,13
129,Posh but not pretentious,"We had high expectations based on website and reviews. Ampersand met all of them and beyond. Lovely, beautifully-appointed furnishings and very friendly staff. Had very good late dinner at Apero one night when we were tired and didn't  feel like going out. Charming and delicious - so nice to have a wonderful, unique dining option in hotel with extended hours. Not your usual hotel fare, but this is not your usual hotel. Loved our stay!",5,2016,10,13
129,Brilliant Hotel in a great location,"This hotel was a great find! We loved everything about it - clearly recently refurbed, everything was new and of great design and quality - the hotel is really beautiful with a 'botanical' theme throughout which is gorgeous! Every aspect of our stay was good - staff were lovely and uber helpful before, during and after our stay (kindly returning a left charger to me!), the rooms were beautifully furnished, very comfortable, spacious and very well equipped. The free soft drinks mini bar was appreciated and the L'Occitane '&' themed toiletries gorgeous. I honestly cannot fault this super hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in central London. Thank you to everyone who made our stay comfortable and a real pleasure.",5,2016,10,13
129,Great hotel and so comfortable!,"The Ampersand, from the check in experience to the beautifully appointed rooms, provides a wonderful experience.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and amenities first class. The recent addition of the ""phone for your stay"" adds to the experience. Being able to use the internet and make calls when outside the hotel without the additional international roaming experience was really appreciated.",5,2016,10,12
129,Stay for Royal Parks Half Marathon,"Excellent stay, requested room with a bath which we got - very grateful as the legs were sore after all the running. First time staying and already we have booked the next. Thanks to all the staff too, really friendly and encouraging! ",5,2016,10,12
129,What a boutique hotel should be!,"My wife and I got to the hotel at 6:00am and they were able to get us our room.  Given the overnight flight, it was amazing to have a room ready to lay down.  The hotel is kept up well and up to date.  Our room was small, but it was very nicely done.  

Breakfast at the hotel was the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel.  Amazing selection and well prepared.  There were great cafes around, but we always wanted to eat in.

South Kensington is excellent neighborhood and very close to everything London.  We felt very safe getting of the tube late at night and were able to find excellent local restaurants for dinner.",5,2016,10,12
129,Great hotel in a great area of london,"I selected Ampersand primarily because of location. I expected a nice hotel with reasonably nice amenities. It was, in fact, far better. Best I've stayed in in London. Great staff, beautiful lobby, convenient restaurant and really nice rooms. Did I say great location? Right across the street from South Kensington Tube station and a wonderful neighborhood in and of itself. Will definitely go back next trip to Blighty!",5,2016,10,11
129,Modern Comfort in Vibrant Neighbourhood,"This was our second stay at this hotel. It continues to delight. Our de luxe studio was both spacious and very well appointed. For a lively neighbourhood, our room was also very quiet. The staff were universally pleasant, anxious to assist and competent. We took advantage of the hotel's offer to arrange a limo to take us from and to Heathrow. That proved a great convenience and was very reasonably priced. The continental breakfast had a very generous  ranges of offerings. We also ate in the restaurant ""Apero"" one evening and the food was of a high quality - streak for me and pasta for my wife. The bar also offered an interesting range of wines by the glass and was staffed by knowledgeable and enthusiastic bar tenders. The hotel is well located - very close to the V&A and Natural History Museum as well as the South Kensington Tube Station around which there are stops for a wide variety of bus routes. We will return. It is exactly what we require in London.",5,2016,10,11
129,Fantastic!! Best ever stay for years!!,"Three best nights in London. Best beds we have ever slept in. Nice and quiet. Perfect location next to tube station. Fantastic food, everything home made and of top notch quality. Looking forward to going back!",5,2016,10,09
129,awesome boutique hotel,"Great location, clean, quiet hotel, mid range price (for london) but luxury value.  Great bed and bedding, nice size room, everything was perfect.  Service was great.  Staff super friendly unpretentious and helpful.  My wife and I travel extensively and this hotel is exceptionally good in every respect.  We will never stay anywhere else in London.  Great Job Ampersand!!",5,2016,10,08
129,Brilliant location,"A good stay at a well located and comfortable, stylish hotel.
Room was small but well appointed and quiet.
Service was friendly and helpful.w
Noticed a lot of maintenance was being done to keep the hotel in good shape",5,2016,10,08
129,Modern boutique hotel in South Kensington,"We booked this hotel through Amex because of the deal they were able to offer us.   The location worked out as it was close to museums, restaurants, shopping and there was a nearby stop for the tour bus too.  

The rooms were ok in size but they were nice.  The bed was comfortable.  Bathroom was modern and it had a heated floor.  There was a refrigerator and they also provided some waters.  
 
We had breakfast at the hotel which was ok (and expensive) but we enjoyed having drinks downstairs in the evening.  The bartender Lucca was great.  He knows his stuff and introduced us to some new cocktails.   We enjoyed spending some time down there with him and learning a few things too.   Bravo!",4,2016,10,07
129,Very similar to a Royalton or W Hotels ,"Ampersand is located in a great location in south Kensington. The vibe is young, hip and modern and that is reflected in the clientele as well as the rooms. We opted for a superior room as we will only be here overnight. The room is small with little space for your suitcases. If you order room service (we did), expect to eating on the bed if you are a couple. The food is quite good and the service is excellent. I deducted a star because upon arrival, there were no bellmen at the lobby and we ended up lugging our large suitcases to reception and even to our room. I'd still rate the Amperand above the W hotels as it is more tastefully adorned. ",4,2016,10,07
129,A NY Business Woman Traveling Alone,"I was very, very pleased with the service and quality of the hotel in general.  I have already recommended the hotel to my daughter and her children, who stayed there in June and were very pleased.  One day I accidentally left the Do Not Disturb sign on so my room was not made up, but when I went out to dinner and came back it was magically cleaned that evening.  A lovely surprise.",5,2016,10,07
129,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights before heading to Paris for a week and I actually wish we had stayed longer in London because this hotel was so wonderful.

Upon arrival after an overnight international flight, it was easy to make our way from Heathrow to Kensington on the underground which dropped us within steps of the hotel.  The location is perfect because the South Kensington station is so close that traveling anywhere in London from that neighborhood is very efficient.  

The room was lovely and felt luxurious with so many complimentary amenities that are normally an extra charge at other hotels.  Some of these included complimentary beverages in the mini fridge which were replenished every day, a coffee and tea station, and extra vanity amenities that one does not normally find in most hotels.

The decor is elegant, yet quirky and the staff is incredibly helpful.  This is hands-down the favorite of the hotels I've experienced in Europe over the years.  

The area is also great because there are many shops and restaurants and several things to do within walking distance - we walked to Harrod's from the hotel one evening and it was a lovely 20 minute walk.

My only regret is that we didn't have time to experience afternoon tea at the Ampersand -  it looked like a fantastic experience that I will definitely be sure to include in my next trip!",5,2016,10,06
129,Lovely Boutique Hotel In South Kensington.,"I actually stayed at this hotel twice in the month of September. The first night was an unplanned and last minute stay. My room was tiny (which I was told before taking it). I was only there for one night so it was perfect. The bed was super comfortable, and although the room was small, it had everything I needed. I returned the next week so I stayed in a deluxe room which was much larger. Once again, the bed was so comfy. My room had all the amenities that I needed. Plus the hotel is in a great location in South Kensington. It has easy access to the tube, museums, and lots of restaurants. There was not a doorman but as soon as I walked in, someone rushed to help me with my luggage. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,06
129,After noon tea time,"In only wish that after a hard day of sight seeing, you offered free tea, coffee, beer and some cookies and pastries.  Or perhaps a small happy hour before dining would be nice.  Something free and refreshing to show your appreciation of staying at your hotel",5,2016,10,06
129,Wonderful!,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at this charming hotel last week.  The staff were helpful.  Printed tickets for us and left in our room as well as helped us with numerous questions.  Rooms were cozy and the amenities were nice.  They left us a ""handy"" to help get around town.  Free drinks in the minibar, nice bath products, robes, and a cute little rubber ducky.  The location is PERFECT!  Right outside South Kensington station which has many underground route choices...so convienient!  Many restaurants around the block.  Fabulous!  Thank you Ampersand staff!",5,2016,10,05
129,Ampersand London,Great location close to underground. Good restaurants nearby. Friendly staff and rooms very comfortable especially the beds & loved the heated bathroom floor.Museums and parks nearby easy to walk to. We would definitely stay at the Ampersand again. ,5,2016,10,05
129,"Perfect location, friendly and helpful staff","The location is really great for a short trip to London as it is a stones throw away from the South Kensington tube station and within walking distance to the museums, Harrods and Hyde Park. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes in the area, so we were really spoilt for choice.
The hotel is very clean, the decor lovely and the bed very comfortable. We really appreciated the complimentary drinks in our room. The staff were very helpful. I will definitely stay at The Ampersand again when I come to London.",4,2016,10,05
129,Charming hotel.,"Felt like staying at a chic house.  The bed was unbelievably comfortable. I slept so well. The Miller Harris bath products were lovely. The complementary water, soft drinks and such were a nice extra touch. ",5,2016,10,04
129,Great hotel,"Ideal location,  very close to tube. Walking distance to museums and Royal Albert Hall, also Hyde Park.
Hotel itself was excellent. Friendly staff, beautiful room with free soft drinks from mini bar.spotlessly clean. 
Will definitely be using the Ampersand again.",5,2016,10,04
129,Great experience,"Our experience in the hotel was very good. We came in family and were at a junior suite. Our resume is simple: The Ampersand hotel is a great hotel, has got an excellent service, room and localitation. We would repeat surely!!",5,2016,10,04
129,Serious security issue here,We had cash stolen from our room and while the management reimbursed us they have still not resolved how it occurred.  The room was so small you couldn't walk around if you had two suitcases.  Clean and high tech but that doesn't matter if the technology can't protect your security.,1,2016,10,03
129,Fantastic but not quite 5*,"Distinctive and individualistic, the building is beautifully appointed with a luxurious twist of contemporary chic. We stayed in a suite with plenty of space, comfortable bed and capacious bath/wet room with cosy underfloor heating. Spotless and fresh. The hotel was lively but the room was quiet and relaxed. Spent time in the restaurant and lounge areas - again well appointed with real character. Staff really friendly and helpful. I echo many of the comments made already but felt attention to detail was lacking in a couple of areas. No-one working the door to greet guests/help with luggage - though reception staff were willing to assist. No valet parking available despite booking in advance. Room service requests went unanswered, newspaper requested but not delivered, had to request a room tidy and removal of room service tray late afternoon and only one turn-down service on a two night stay. Great atmosphere throughout but shortcomings leave it a star short of 5.",4,2016,10,03
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Great location, close to museums, Hyde Park, Harrods etc. Excellent staff, always friendly and helpful. Stylish and comfortable hotel, classy without being brash. Rooms very comfortable. Rare to provide free soft drinks in the mini bar - kids loved it.",5,2016,10,03
129,"Very good base to ""feel"" and explore West London ","We stayed at the Ampersand over a week-end, just looking for a 4star+ still affordable base in West London to enjoy the museums, shopping and foodie places around. 

By and large the stay was excellent.

Warm welcome upon arrival, easy to park around at the week-end, nice big clean room (deluxe studio) with views over a busy but not too noisy typical red brick London Street, gave us the feel we were looking for. 

You can even get your croissants from Paul if you walk across the road for breakfast and take them back to eat with the provided coffee from the Nespresso Machine.

We appreciated the free bed for our child when other luxury places charge an unnecessary 60GBP+. That alone helped us making our mind up and booking there. ",5,2016,10,02
129,SuzyB,The bedroom:too many cushions &very little drawer space. It would be very cramped for two people. The bed was very comfortable. The en-suite was luxurious. The staff were very polite & attentive. The d√©cor was very attractive.,4,2016,10,02
129,Accessibility problem,"The walk-in shower is dangerous.  The floor is slick to the point of unusability.   Hotel would be excellent in every respect for people without accessibility issues.  As friends who aren't a couple, we didn't like the single beds arranged with no space between them.  Every member of the hotel staff was knowledgeable, helpful, and efficient.  I would definitely recommend the Ampersand to able-bodied guests, but warn others of the bathroom problems. ",4,2016,10,01
129,London Hotel,We enjoyed it all. Staff were all friendly. Breakfast was included and there were lots of choices. The lounge was friendly and always open. The whole experience was wonderful. Altogether a wonderful time.,5,2016,10,01
129,"Exceptional, apart from the bathroom becoming a paddling pool","Location ‚Äì excellent, 100m from South Kensington Station so very convenient for Museums and Royal Albert Hall, and on direct tube from Heathrow.

Bedroom ‚Äì excellent, we paid for a superior room but based on the info on the website I think we were upgraded to a de luxe.  It was large and had a massive, very comfortable bed.  (A niggle was that the distance from the mirror to the nearest power socket was further than the length of the cable on the hair dryer.  When I said this on feedback direct to the hotel they said they would provide a portable mirror next time we stayed ‚Äì and I believe they will.)  Despite being beside a busy road and by a bus stop we were not disturbed by outside noise.

Bathroom - a (very) wet room, also large with an excellent double shower but the drainage and area of sloped floor could not cope with the amount of water so the whole room became a paddling pool which stayed flooded well after taking a shower.  This is the only reason I have not given an overall rating of exceptional.

Breakfast ‚Äì the buffet was not cheap at ¬£15 plus 12.5% service but the range and quality were well above typical standards.

Staff ‚Äì all we came in contact with were excellent.",4,2016,10,01
129,a delightful surprise,"location unbeatable right next to south kensington tube st. in the best part of london, right next to v&a museum, kings street and hyde park. 
staff were helpful, courteous and friendly. 
top food and drinks, room was perfect and the bed is heavenly! 
100% recommended!!",5,2016,10,01
129,A modern and beautiful hotel in South Kensington,"Very nice and clean British hotel with a modern touch. Lately refurbished, double windows keep the noise and cold air outside. Small but beautiful rooms. Too soft beds. Good service! Location next to South Kensington underground.",4,2016,09,30
129,Great stay,"Location was perfect for us, very close to metro, museums, even hyde park.
Hotel itself is very nice, rooms very well appointed. Check-in and checkout were extremely fast.
Staff was very helpful in answering different questions we had or in solving our minor issues during the stay.
Would definitely return on my next stay in London. ",5,2016,09,29
129,Coming back for sure!,"Great location in South Ken right next to the tube and lots of cafes pubs, shops and museums. The barmen know their craft preparing delicious cocktails. The rooms very well equipped and very friendly staff. ",5,2016,09,29
129,Remarkable Stay,"We arrived to find our room upgraded to a Suite and it was fabulous. We weren‚Äôt sure that our first room could have been topped but this room was beyond our expectations. Small rooftop balcony, full equipped kitchen, huge comfortable bed, wide range of toiletries and bathroom accessories and complimentary mini bar making our stay a truly memorable. My husband and I absolutely loved our stay. Thanks again for everything, we will be back!",5,2016,09,29
129,Fantastic Stay!,"Had a wonderful stay @ the '&'. Large, clean, stylish and comfortable room. Great location with easy access to transport options. Apero was perfect for breakfast and 'London reasonable' price wise. By far, though, the best part of our stay was the staff - unpretentious, pleasant and helpful to a fault - kudos to the management for developing such a high level of commitment to excellence among the whole team! We'll be back!",5,2016,09,27
129,Great hitel,"Well positioned for transport and attractions, great value for money, the best of the four hotels we stayed in during our trip in Europe.  Loved our stay, the staff were very welcoming and accommodating.",5,2016,09,27
129,Simply perfect!,"Our stay was once again truly wonderful! The Ampersand is a beautiful, very friendly and perfectly situated hotel. A quiet heaven in busy London. Check-in is super efficient and remembers the preferences from the last stays. Breakfast is very fresh, delicious and generous. The Nespresso machine in the room is such an added value. We enjoy the easiness of the drawing room. We look forward to visiting again, for us it is the perfect place. ",5,2016,09,27
129,Good experience,"Very courteous and helpful staff. Very clean and stylish hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent - right across from the tube station, so you can get anywhere. Also very close to fine museums. Would stay here again.",5,2016,09,26
129,A WONDERFUL Eperience,This is a wonderful hotel located in a great location surrounded by a myriad of great places to eat!  The attention to detail is rare and the size of the room was great for London standards.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  Would do it agin in a heartbeat ,5,2016,09,26
129,Great Property in South Kensington,"What a great find in the South Kensington area of London.  Perfect location 5 minutes from the Tube stop, very close to many museums, quick walk to Kensington Park and surrounded by a wonderful neighborhood full of shops and great restaurants.  Our room was comfortable and quiet.  Staff could not have been more helpful with great suggestions for restaurants, shops and always helpful navigating the city of London.  Will definitely stay at The Ampersand on future visits.",5,2016,09,26
129,Best South Kensington Spot ,"I have been at The Ampersand twice, LOVE The hotel. Beautiful rooms, delicious tea time, incredible staff.
Just 1 minute walking distance from tube Station. With walking distance to nice places for breakfast and lunch.
Walking distance from incredible museums as Victoria and Albert museum, natural history museum. Nice shopping like Harrod's, really centric in a London posh area.
LOVE room service for breakfast, best scoones.

129,London Mini Break,"Great hotel in fabulous location.
Quirky and well styled.
Staff very efficient and friendly.
Very close to Harrods and lots to do and see in the vicinity.
Evening meal was amazing.
The drawing room offers an amazing array of delicious cakes.
Dogs welcome which was lovely to see.",5,2016,09,25
129,The best choice in London,"There is nothing to say about my stay at The Ampersand. Once again it was just excellent. All Ampersand team delivered an incredible service to us. Our room was always extremely clean and well organized. The front desk team was always ready to help us with our needs. Finally, the Apero team once again was fantastic giving us a very enjoyable experience every single day.",5,2016,09,25
129,Great location and very clean,"We stayed three nights at The Ampersand. The location of the hotel is excellent right next to South Kensington underground and lots of shops and cafes nearby. 

Hotel is very clean but the room we stayed in was very small. We were on the fifth level and didn't get much natural light. 

We weren't greeted at the door and no one helped with our luggage but this seems to be the new norm with hotels in Europe. 

The staff are a bit strange. Sometimes it felt like a group of kids were running the place. They didn't have uniforms on but did try hard to help out. 

Overall it's still a great clean hotel in a great location at an OK price. ",4,2016,09,25
129,"Excelent Hotel, wonderful stay","This is an excellent hotel in a wonderful neighborhood, South Kensington. Walking distance from the best museums and the Royal Albert Hall, very close to the tube. Great staff, made us feel at home. Excellent service, great breakfast... we loved it and recommend for sure. Will make the Ampersand Hotel our place in London.",5,2016,09,25
129,My favorite choice in London,"Tasteful, comfortable & most convenient location for a hotel. Most rooms are a bit small, but because of the excellent service, my family and I tend to overlook this shortcoming. The breakfast at Apero is excellent.",5,2016,09,25
129,Great stay!,"We had an excellent time at The Ampersand Hotel in London. I emailed them 1 week before arrival to see if early checking was a possibility and received an email within 24 hrs saying they were going to do their best. We arrived at noon and the room was almost ready, they also upgraded us to a suite. The room was fantastic, great views, extremely comfortable and very modern. All the amenities were great, from the free minibar to the shower and the bed. We will definitely be back.",5,2016,09,24
129,Fantastic Few Days In London!,"Wonder hotel in a perfect, quiet neighborhood. Very reasonable price for what you get. The hotel is super clean and the staff is very friendly. Room was a great size- especially for a city like London. Usually rooms are very small. Our kids (age 9 and 14) loved it. The neighborhood has many nice restaurants within a quick walk from the hotel. The hotel is neatly decorated. There is a nice bar that my husband and I visited in the evening and left the kids in the room! We would definitely stay here on future visits to London.",5,2016,09,24
129,Great Hotel,"Great hotel Great location Great staff. I would recommend this hotel to anybody, The decor is great and the furnishings above average. It is right in the middle of a busy Kensington scene with plenty of cafes and bars ",4,2016,09,23
129,Fabulous,"5 Star all the way. Excellent service from all staff. Food in the downstairs restaurant was the best we had eaten in London.
The location is great for the Tube and the Albert and Victoria Museum.
We have been to London twice now and each we have stayed at The Ampersand.",5,2016,09,23
129,Excellent hotel in a prime location,"We spent 5 nights at the hotel. First -- the location is excellent, 2 min walk to the tube and close to museums and shopping. The place is beautiful, clean, lux all around. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The Apero restaurant turned out to be superb. ",5,2016,09,23
129,& quite good!,"Had a great stay here! The staff for the most part were friendly. The room was tight in space but that seems to be a London thing. They did not really have any draws to unpack your closes as they were all used for the safe, fridge and hair dryer and such. The bed was extremely comfortable and had great night sleeps which is what is needed to hit the city the following day. The rooms were very clean and had aircon as well as windows that opened. The location is great! Walking distance to 2 major museums, close to many restaurants and 2 tube stations. Really the location could not have been better! I would stay there again without and hesitation if we went back to London!",4,2016,09,22
129,Great hotel in a great hotel,"We really liked this hotel. The people, room and service were all great. It's located in a very nice part of town, within walking distance to at least three popular shopping destinations as well as great restaurants and the Victoria and Albert museum.",5,2016,09,21
129,Perfect place to stay!,"Starting with location and ending with comfort, this was the perfect place to stay for our 3-night trip to London. Steps from the South Kensington tube station, in a relatively quiet neighbourhood, we found the hotel to be excellently located for travel from Heathrow or Gatwick, and for trips into the City during the day. The room was much larger than expected, and very quiet and dark for sleeping. The bathroom was gorgeous and a double sink! What a luxury!! Shower was hot and powerful. Staff are very friendly and courteous without being constantly in your face with pleasantries. Check out Cafe Floris across the street for a fantastic and value-priced breakfast!",5,2016,09,21
129,@ the &,"Upsides: Great location, spotlessly clean hotel with well appointed but quite compact rooms.  Standard of finish in rooms was excellent, service was polite and efficient.  People not prepared for the usual London price shock may find it compares less well with other large cities but when compared with other hotels in the capital this is a gem.

Downsides:Room was a bit noisy as I think we were near some aircon units on the fifth floor, but not too intrusive once you got used to it. Bed could have been a bit softer too.

Overall would recommend, get a room that isn't on the top floor if you want to avoid the aircon noise.",4,2016,09,21
129,Worst Night Ever,Smoke detector/carbon monoxide detector battery on low and beeped all night. No fix plan from front desk and no option to move. No refund or make good offered. Stayed here many times but won't do so again.,1,2016,09,19
129,Excellent and Inviting,"This hotel does a remarkable job in providing a safe, clean, convenient, and exemplary stay while in London. Will be returning. My wife and I absolutely loved our stay. We upgraded from the smallest room to next level up and it was well worth it. ",5,2016,09,18
129,a haven,"We simply loved this place - funky, fashionable and comfortable venue that was luxurious without being imposing. Staff all friendly, approachable and efficient. Rooms were fabulous - bathrooms a little squeezy but shower was great. Complimentary mini bar was a treat. Fabulous location for local restaurants, South Kensington tube and Glouster Road restaurants/pubs and the museums are a 2 min walk. Will stay here again without hesitation",5,2016,09,17
129,"Great hotel, great location!","We loved this hotel. Clean, spacious beautifully decorated rooms...particularly loved the double shower in the huge bathroom. 
Great location, less than a minutes walk from South Kensington tube station and plenty of restaurants etc within a 100m radius. 
Would definitely highly recommend & would stay again next time we're in London",5,2016,09,16
129,"Perfectly pitched service, great value for great hotel","Just returned for brief 36 hours away, booked Ampersand from reviews on this site and it totally lived up to reputation. Smiley and efficient concierge and reception welcome, with all staff going out of their way to help without being annoying. Lovely room, a little on small side they had warned helpfully, but totally reasonable for a central location so we were delighted. Definitely would recommend.",5,2016,09,16
129,Beautiful hotel in great London neighborhood,"My two week stay in London ended beautifully at the Ampersand where I spent two nights in May.  Check in was early, the staff were more than kind, and my small Double room on 4th floor was very comfortable with a distant view of museum towers.  The hotel looks brand new, and I really appreciated that staff only come to clean when you indicate you are out with snazzy door light.  The South Kensington neighborhood is so convenient to shops, cafes, and popular mueums including the Natural History, Science, and Victoria and Albert.  Staying once again in October and looking forward to it!",5,2016,09,16
129,London love,We have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 3 years and are delighted to see the standard hasn't slipped. Great hotel in a great location. We love the rooms and are not bothered by the smallness of some as they have used the available space very well.,4,2016,09,16
129,Love this hotel,"I stayed here 3 yrs ago, going by the shots on my phone....The decor hasnt changed, but its still sharp and clean. Staff super helpfull as always and I had the gym to myself for 3 days. I love the fact the juice and water in the fridge are now free, this is a trend Ive seen in a number of high end hotels. 

The buffet brekky is gorg if you are a carnivore but as a vegan its a lot smaller. I partook of the amazing fruit platters, and breads plenty but they could chip in a tofu scramble or the like. 
We were served soy milk with decaff  tea which was nice and should now be a given in all eatries.

As an aside, my wife had one of her dresses ruined in a restaurant after a red wine spill. We put this into cleaning and the result was amazing so thanks for that! 

Gripe 1, whilst waiting for a slot to put in my toast into the filled toaster......a waitress replied' I m sorry its for room service'.......!!  Guys  get another toaster! and put it in the kitchen, and dont hold up customers trying to cook their own toast so they can get to work!!!!! 
Gripe 2 , My wife only ordered tea and toast each day ( alacarte) we were there and  was asked just to make it in the  ONE toaster at the buffet..which resulted in us being billed ¬£15 for her brekky on the bill...worth thinking this one through guys..  I argued it one day and just lost the will to argue it with the poor girlsl run of their feet for the  other two as our server was trying hard. You can give me the ¬£30 next time im down

Still a sharp place to sleep and eat. Ill probably be back, just stay sharp.",5,2016,09,15
129,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous, comfortable gem of a hotel in South Kensington, conveniently located near the underground and the bus stop.   Staff was very welcoming and accommodating.  Amenities were superb--L'Occitane soap and even makeup removing wipes.  Many nice details about this hotel.  Our room was on the ground floor and even though it overlooked a bus stop where a lot of school kids congregated in the afternoon, with the window closed we couldn't hear a thing.  The only negative I have to say is that that there was no grab bar in the very deep bathtub/shower combination and it would have been quite easy to slip.",5,2016,09,14
129,Excellence in South Kensington,"Fantastic accommodation in the heart of South Kensington. Close to lovely options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Easy tube access into central London shopping areas. The staff and service is excellent. They booked dinners for us and arranged complimentary bubbly when we arrived. Will definitely return. ",5,2016,09,14
129,Excellent London hotel,"The Ampersand is one of my favourite London hotels. The staff are attentive and helpful. The rooms are well equiped and although some can be small, they everything needed. It is well located and convenient for getting around.",5,2016,09,14
129,Blissful Stay,"Tremendous hotel - everything perfect from the gorgeous comfy bed to the trendy rubber ducky in the bathroom. The ideal spot to stay when ""landing"" in London. Especially appreciated the availability of our room upon early arrival - well done!",5,2016,09,14
129,The perfect place for a London visit,"We stayed at this hotel several times and always enjoyed our stay. The rooms to the front are more airy only sleeping with the windows open might be a little noisy in the mornings. The stuff is lovely and most helpful, all rooms we had so far were well furbished, clean and very comfortable. The beds are gerat, wish I would have one at home! The place is perfect for visiting the nearby museums and one can reach the centre by tube in a few minutes. But it is also lovely taking the buses to have some kind of a city tour. There are many places to eat just a few footsteps away. And the Piccadilly line takes you within 40 minutes to Heathrow airport, that's perfect too. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,09,14
129,Four Star Service,"Very nice hotel, great location and friendly staff. I wouldn't say it was five star quality but a good deal for the location. Some staff didn't understand English but were pleasant and polite. We stayed in a small double room but it met our needs and was sufficient for our stay.",3,2016,09,13
129,Can't wait to go back.,"Booked through Secret Escapes and very impressed with the Ampersand Hotel from the moment we arrived. Location very close to South Kensington Tube station was excellent. Staff were helpful and friendly and very switched on. Our 2 rooms were next to each other as we had previously requested. Rooms were quite small, but beautifully decorated and themed. Bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and despite being on the ground floor we heard no outside noise at any time. We had booked one small double room and one Superior room, strangely the latter had less wardrobe space. 

Didn't get a chance to experience afternoon tea unfortunately, but did get to the basement bar in the evening. Again great staff in the bar and a lovely atmosphere. Mostly for wine drinkers but there was a limited selection of beer and lots of cocktails. We enjoyed our complementary champagne courtesy of Secret Escapes! 

Over bath shower was very good although I found it quite high to reach to adjust the water flow and there was no shelving to place shampoo and shower gel etc. Also could have done with a handrail to avoid slipping up when getting out. 

Continental breakfast had a large selection of goodies, the option for a cooked breakfast was there for an extra charge. 

Checkout was quick and painless. 

Some minor negatives, especially as this was a five star hotel was the lack of a well-lit mirror and putting electrical sockets for hairdryers in the right place. There is a heated bathroom mirror here and although lit was not bright enough to apply makeup and the only other mirror was on the front of the wardrobe, but with no socket near to plug in the hairdryer! I ended up plugging it inside the wardrobe, where the kettle is and then having to half close a wardrobe door to use the mirror! 
Talking of sockets, I'm amazed that seeing such a great finish in the room, that the sockets couldn't have been straightened up!!

We loved our stay here, our adult sons even managed a late night game of table tennis in the Games Room.  The free mini bar for soft drinks  and the touch of umbrellas being available for use were great ideas.
Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,09,13
129,Great decor and location,"Stayed in a superior double for my daughters birthday (music themed room). The room was spotless with a good selection of drinks/toiletries/amenities. 

The bathroom was great and allowed us to pipe through the TV sound so I couldn't listen to the news or some music whilst getting ready for the day or in the bath. The bathroom had no natural light but this didn't bother us too much as we had no plans to doll up, it may not be great for those who want to put on full make-up in there though.

Towels were white and fluffy and a bathrobe/slippers were provided.

The interior of he hotel is fabulously decorated in a classic contemporary style. Staff were polite and helpful and the hotel is located right behind the natural history museum so that is only a two minute walk away. Very close to tube station too.

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,09,13
129,excellent value,"not ultra luxury but for a place to stay just a bit below luxury for a great price - this is it!!
good location across the street from an amazing breakfast place.  in the lower level of the hotel there is ping pong as well as table games for late night wind down time.  staff is very helpful and does it with a smile??",4,2016,09,12
129,Amazing interior design and breakfast!,"Art Hotel, beautifully styled with unique furniture and fantastic colours. Descending to breakfast was such a surprise. So many options and so yummy! Centrally located with lots of things to do nearby. ",5,2016,09,12

129,A wonderful experience at the Ampersand Hotel,"I found this hotel online & what a great find it turned out to be!  The hotel is beautiful & clean and the location can't be beat - just a short walk to the tube and wonderful restaurants.  Even though it is in the middle of a busy area, when you're in your room, you don't hear any noise from the outside world.  We wound up staying longer than anticipated (unfortunately because I became too sick to travel on the day we were supposed to leave) and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful to us as we had to cancel and reschedule plans.  We will definitely be coming back to stay at the Ampersand Hotel!!",5,2016,09,11
129,A short walk,"This hotel is less than 100m from South Kensington tube station.
The staff are pleasant to deal with and will help with any needs.

The rooms are quiet from street noise and a decent size for 2.
This place is recommended if you would like a close proximity to shopping and entertainment.",5,2016,09,11
129,One of the best hotel during my travel experience,"Excellent location
Great staff. Can feel they like their job there.
Excellent room. Same as what u saw in internet.
Unlimited drinks in room(free). I even request refill after the second day.
Worth for price. As my most expensive stay in London but I still feel it is worth for price.",5,2016,09,10
129,Mss abeer ,"The experience is not encouraging me to come back    I was looking for hotel in the same line of farmedale. And asked ms&msr smith and they recommended this ine which is a way from the knightsbridge or  16 hotel   
The front desk has no ability to build connection  with customer.  The room is 2 small and 2 dusty 
  ",2,2016,09,10
129,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"Great decor, great service & great food. An excellent afternoon tea.

We had the Science afternoon tea and the food was extremely tasty and very well thought out (petrie dishes of jelly, test tubes of various treats, even a spectacular chemical reaction). 

Can't fault the service given by the very personable staff.

The hotel has had a very imaginative interior designer bring lots of fun elements to the rooms. The winged lightbulb chandelier the full height of the hotel is amazing. Even the loos have names.

Would highly recommend.",5,2016,09,10

129,Stylish and central London hotel,"I'd recommend this hotel for its stylsih decor, charming service and quirkiness. The decor is very attractive and there is a real buzz about the place. I would just add a desk lamp to the bedroom as my room needed more light.",4,2016,09,09
129,Stunning Hotel in South Kensington ,"This hotel is a beautiful place to stay - my favourite in the area. Expansive ground floor areas make it feel massive - a true luxury in London.
The interiors are beautiful, luxe & elegant. 
Breakfast is served in the basement - which is cleverly designed & well lit. All of the papers are available to read. There's a buffet as well as a huge selection of a la carter breakfast items from porridge to eggs, with modern sides including chorizo, and Avacado. 
The omelette with mushrooms & chorizo is outstanding & served with little home made multi grain bread loaves. Great coffee. 
A gorgeous high tea is served in the afternoons. 
Hotel rooms are large & modern and beautifully decorated. Excellent staff. 
I love this hotel. ",5,2016,09,07

Staff were really helpful and happy. Fantastic location 1 minute walk to the tube and shops. We'll be going back.",5,2016,09,06
129,Great location and helpful staff,"Great location, staff go out of their way to be helpful and offer tips depending on what your daily plan was. The room was lovely- only downside was the heated bathroom floor- London was 30 degrees when we were there so it made the room hotter- I'm sure very mice in the colder weather.
Would highly recommend.",5,2016,09,06
129,New first choice hotel in London,"This was our first try of The Ampersand as a change from our normal choice. All aspects of the hotel were excellent, room spot on and the Apero restaurant was excellent for tapas, wine and atmosphere. This is now our new first choice location.",5,2016,09,06
129,A true 5 Star in the heart of London," A pleasant surprise in London, large suite, comfortable beds, clean and service with a smile.
The hotel's decor is a mix of modern with English traditional mixed in.  The suite had a balcony with a great view.  So close to South Kensington subway station and many coffees and restaurant.  Walking to Harrods and all the key museums.  Best location for a family stay or a couple.

",5,2016,09,06
129,Still wonderful,"The Ampersand is still wonderful. The quality of the hotel, amenities/services and care from the team is the best. South Kensington is one of the best neighborhoods in London and the Ampersand is one of the best hotels in London. ",5,2016,09,05
129,Love this hotel,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and once again I had a great stay.  The rooms are small but very well appointed and very comfortable.  The bar/restaurant downstairs is a great place to have an after dinner drink.  The staff are also very pleasant and efficient and took very good care of us.

But the best thing about this hotel is its proximity to the South Kensington tube stop and numerous great points of interest.  It was so incredibly convenient to get anywhere in the city.

I've recommended this place to friends in the past and I would do so again!",5,2016,09,05
129,Wonderful stay,The staff is very attentive and the hotel is adorable. It's very close to museums and Hyde Park. Hop on and off bus can pick you up at the hotel entrance and South Kensington station is also very close,5,2016,09,05
129,Great hotel,"We had a lovely stay. I stay in London a lot on business and I am continually disappointed at the standard of London hotels. This though is a gem and this hotel ranks as one of the quietest, friendliest I have stayed in coupled with things that all hotels should offer such as good standard of room. Free wifi, efficient staff and great location for a trip that included a day at Kew, time at the museums and hanging out in Chelsea. ",5,2016,09,04
129,Great hotel! ,"My husband and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary. It was a fabulous stay and we would certainly return here! Our room was large with a lovely freestanding bath in the room itself with a large rainfall shower in the bathroom. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The bed was so comfortable, I slept really well. Can't wait to go back! 
",5,2016,09,04
129,"Great hotel, gloomy room","Pros:
Location, friendliness and professionalism of staff, shower and bed were great.
Cons:
Room was cosy but that's fine.  However it was on the ground floor and looked onto some kind of courtyard service area - meaning there was absolutely no natural daylight, even in the middle of the day.  Made for a somewhat gloomy feel, shame as the weather outside was lovely.",4,2016,09,04
129,Great Location and Beautiful Decor,"This was my first trip to London along with mom's we had such a pleasant stay at the Ampersand. The hotel is in a wonderful location in Kensington with plenty of restaurants near by, museums, Hyde Park, and very close to the tube station. 

I especially loved the decor of the hotel. From my room to the tea room to the restaurant it's designed perfectly. When I returned to London I won't be staying any where else.

Plus, the bed was so cozy and comfy!",5,2016,09,03
129,Superb Hotel,I cannot praise the staff at The Ampersand enough the service was excellent !!!  Our room was superb with lots of little extras.  What a refreshing change to have a bar fridge with complimentary soft drinks and also a kettle and a Nespresso machine.  Cant wait to visit again.  Location excellent only a minute away from nearest tube station,5,2016,09,03
129,Wonderful hotel,My husband and I stayed at this hotel with our teenage daughter for a week while seeing London sights. Hotel was clean. Staff were excellent. Minibar was free of charge. Location was great. We will back as soon as we can!,5,2016,09,02
129,Great locatiob,"We stayed here for the bank holiday weekend for our fifth wedding anniversary. Our room was lovely, only issue was the noise from the cocktail bar across the road which went on until the early hours. We booked through Mr & Mrs Smith, we had petit fours in our room on arrival and complementary champagne. We were not disappointed, and would definitely recommend this hotel. We didn't have breakfast here. ",4,2016,09,02
129,"Excellent hotel, fantastic location","Had a fantastic stay, planning next trip to London! Food fab in the Apero restaurant and the restaurant staff were very pleasant.  Room is lovely but was just a bit small, excellent standard and very clean.  Overall fantastic hotel in a great location ... Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,08,31
129,Bad experience,"This hotel was very good on previous trips but standard are slipping. Would think twice before booking again. The first room smell was not acceptable. The smell was musty and damp and the room was very dusty. On moving to another room it looked fine but turned out to be very noise with banging and pouring of glass bottles from below. We had the same bar of soar for 4 days. Very soggy by second day but not replaced. Shower gel not replenished which meant getting out of shower to contact housekeeping. Very inconvenient.
On check out the receptionist didn't seem to care about my complaint. Would appreciate feedback.",2,2016,08,31
129,One night stay,"I booked the Anpersand after seeing the hotel on Mr & Mrs Smith. Like all the other hotels on there we weren't disappointed. Staff were lovely and the room was exquisite. Great location too, with the hotel being located close to South Kensington tube station and some excellent museums!",5,2016,08,31
129,Exceptional hotel in a very convenient location,"We have stayed here a few times now and have not been disappointed.

129,Beautiful honeymoon venue!!!,"My husband and I spent the first part of our honeymoon at The Ampersand in London and were really impressed with the outstanding level of customer service, beautiful room (complete with free - standing bath in the window) and the delicious continental breakfast each morning. 

We were also touched that a plate with ""happy honeymoon"" and mini cakes had been left on our bed courtesy of the hotel. ",5,2016,08,30
129,A gem in busy South Ken,"Our first stay and already planning our next pre Xmas 
The hotel was clean and stylish 
It's location is perfect for anyone staying in London for business or leisure
Our room was at the front of the hotel but the double glazing was very effective in keeping things quiet overnight 
The staff are excellent ",5,2016,08,30
129,"Great location, great service, great hotel!","This place was outstanding in every way. The location is awesome--just a hundred feet from the South Kensington station--and the service was outstanding. The grounds were immaculate, and the rooms were very modern, chic, and clean. We even got room service at 2am because nothing in the area was open and the food was actually quite good! Highly recommended. ",5,2016,08,29
129,Great Hotel ,"Super cool, We loved it.
They were incredibly accomodating with our requests. The bathroom was large, and heated flooring was a bonus. 
Location was really good with a number of good restaurants and cafes nearby.",5,2016,08,29
129,Excelent Hotel,"Excelent Hotel, Friendly Staff, Good Location, Nice Room and a very convenient Restaurant. Everything was fine at The Ampersand and I recommend it as a good value hotel in London for a family trip. We really enjoyed.",5,2016,08,29
129,Incredible Hotel - We Will Stay Here Again,"We absolutely loved the Ampersand. We had one (major) issue that I'll explain below, but the staff worked hard to rectify it and everything turned out great in the end.

The positives.

1) The staff here are great. Very friendly. Always happy to help. Courteous. Thoughtful. Just delightful.

2) The location is perfect. Just a 2 minute walk to the South Kensington tube station which has three major lines so you can get pretty much anywhere in about 20 minutes (45 minutes to Heathrow).

Also, South Kensington isn't super busy like Trafalgar Square. Once you get out of the tube station it's pretty quiet. Not to mention there are local pubs within walking distance.

3) The tea service in the drawing rooms is wonderful. We did the science themed tea and it was absolutely fantastic. Very well done. Very tasty.

4) The rooms are great. We ended up in two rooms (more on that below). Our first room (510) was on the top floor and looked west, over the Charles de Gaulle school next door. Since it is still summer break there weren't any kids, so it was very tranquil. The sunsets were gorgeous.

Our second room (404) was equally quiet, but located on the front of the building looking out over the street. Since it was so quiet, however, you could hear (faintly) the sound of the tube as it came into the station. My guess is the lower you go the louder that gets. But, you really couldn't hear it in 404 unless it was dead quiet in your room.

All rooms had complimentary refreshments in them (coca-cola, juice, water, and milk) that were replenished every day. The staff were more than happy to bring you extras at any point, too.

5) The cost. For a five star hotel with free refreshments, great rooms, and an unbeatable location you can't beat the price.

The negatives:

1) The air conditioner in our first room (510) didn't work. We mentioned the uncomfortable warmth of our room to the staff three times before they determined the unit was broken.

Each time we spoke to them they were very responsive and quick to try to determine what was wrong. We never felt ignored or brushed off. Quite the opposite actually.  But, it would have been nice if they could have determined it was broken earlier as we spent two nights and three days sleeping on top of our blankets.

Ultimately they moved us to a new room (which was bigger and maybe an upgrade) on our 3rd night (of 4). Very pleased with how they handled it in the end and would not hesitate to recommend this incredible hotel!",5,2016,08,29
129,Unbelievable,"The staff here were fantastic and so helpful and absolutely professional.
As was the location for hop on/ off bus and tube
From check in, laundry to check out and booking my car to St Panceas station.
Restaurant and bar staff amazing, thanks to everyone, Rob.",5,2016,08,27
129,Beautiful hotel with great staff BUT....,"Overall the hotel is beautiful from friendly staff to delicious pastries and cakes, not to mention tucked away in the basement their restaurant, small and cosy with scrumptious food.... Having said all this I was taken aback when one of the members of staff kept looking over while I was using a computer who then came over and reprimanded me about leaving my hand bag unattended which I had put literally on the floor few steps away from me but I didn't appreciate being told off for that. The staff member who was dressed in some sort of dark grey uniform then went on to carry on talking and laughing with other staff (a lady and another guy) which made me feel uncomfortable being there! For such a nice hotel and staff I would suggest that staff are trained on how they interact and speak with guests perhaps with little more respect as it put a real downer on my experience of the hotel which started of so well but shame it ended badly.",3,2016,08,27
129,cool ambience warm service,"I found cool furnishings and a clean ambient. The employres were smart, very kind and warm. 
I want to come back there. Just to consider that the breakfast menu was good, but  in other hotels it is huge.

",5,2016,08,27
129,Science Afternoon Tea,"Took my 7 yr old to the Ampersand for the science afternoon tea. 
From the minute we arrived staff were very attentive & friendly offering us a choice of tables to sit at. 
The interior is beautifully decorated, very clean and has a calm relaxed ambience. 
The savoury food offerings were excellent: crab bonbon, chicken in Parmesan basket, crayfish on toast & mini quiche. 
Lovely soft scones, mint chocolate mousse planet, macaron, delicious iced lemon sponge crescent, passionfruit jelly in Petrie dish, spaceman biscuit, chocolate covered dinosaur fossils to uncover. 
A great tea, would thoroughly recommend. ",5,2016,08,26
129,"A Nice clean hotel, well-situated with nice breakfast.","We stayed in this hotel with 17 family members, and the cost was very reasonable for the multiple rooms in a well situated and located hotel. The staff was very accommodating, helpful, and did whatever we needed. The rooms are of adequate size, and very comfortable. The beds were comfortable and clean. Housekeeping made certain that the rooms were cleaned early. The breakfast was more than adequate, and, infact, has everything you might want. The hotel is situated at a bus stop, and a three minute walk to the underground. Multiple restaurants and coffee shops are around, so you can get whatever you need. The walk to Hyde Park corner is about 30-45 minutes.",4,2016,08,26
129,Marvelous!,I can highly recommend The Ampersand Hotel. The staff were very friendly and housekeeping did a great job. I have booked the Superior Room and slept like a baby. It was overall a great experience. The location is brilliant and very close to South Kensington tube station. To have complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar was such a nice treat.,5,2016,08,26
129,Family loved the hotel,"The location is excellent - right next to south Kensington tube station. We stayed twice in 10 days for two nights each, as a family of four. The staff were all extremely personable and friendly, and the hotel extremely comfortable. Recommend it.",5,2016,08,26
129,"High-class, Very Central, close to tube station",Fantastic stay. Great for business and holiday travel alike. It is very central to Covent Garden and easy to travel to Central London on the tube as the station is 2 minutes walk from the hotel. We stayed a couple of nights and had a great time. Breakfast is good in the hotel and there are a number of places to eat within walking distance. ,4,2016,08,25
129,Comfortable hotel and fabulous staff,"The only negative with the Ampersand is room size. They are not silly little cramped rooms but they are on the small side for the money paid. The rooms are well appointed, the public areas are great and above all the staff are friendly and helpful almost to a fault.
Great position opposite South Kensington station and near all the museums.",4,2016,08,25
129,a proms weekend home from home,Having previously used the Ampersand we were not surprised at the high level of service but our experience was enhanced by an exceptional room and  exceptional service in the Drawing Room. We will be back whenever we need to stay in South Ken.,5,2016,08,25
129,Wonderful Visit To London,"We spent a week in London and stayed the entire time at the Ampersand.  The location of the hotel could not have been better.  It was up the street from the tube, near restaurants and museums, and a reasonable walk to Harrods.  The hotel staff was helpful and made some excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants.  The hotel offers an excellent version of an English High Tea.

Since we were traveling with a 12 year old, we opted for a one bedroom suite that came with a convertible sofa in the living room.  The room(s) were nicely decorated and came with a mini kitchen and free mini bar.  The only disappointment was there was little to no space for us to unpack our suitcases.  This would be OK for a couple of nights but since we were three staying for a week, we had to live out of our suitcases which was a pain.

This summer the hotel was offering a special if you purchased two nights, you received a third night for free.  We took advantage of this deal.  We would highly recommend The Ampersand Hotel while visiting London.  Its location, alone, would be enough but for s small hotel, the staff makes you feel welcome.",5,2016,08,24
129,Nice hotel but size of room brought our rating down give the price we paid.,"Room way too small and bathroom was equally small. once you got into bathroom all was okay just as long as you did not open the door.
Front desk staff was very good and extremely helpful on check-in and check-out.",3,2016,08,24
129,Feels like home,"The Hotel is very comfortable, quiet; the staff is very friendly, helpful and professional, but not cold and stiff; the restaurant is excellent. The location is perfect for shopping, walking through a nice and safe area; many shops and small restaurants around. ",5,2016,08,24
129,Felt Like Home,"We read tripadvisor reviews for months before selecting The Ampersand for our one-week London vacation.  We can fully attest it is worthy of all the wonderful reviews it receives.  We were so happy with our choice.  Very quickly it felt like home.  We appreciated being able to move about and enter and exit without without always having to see staff.  A doorman milled about, but he was not in our face all the time. Our room (#211, middle front of hotel) was perfectly comfortable, sound-proof, bright, clean and serviced twice a day, with plenty of complimentary refreshments re-stocked in the fridge (still and sparkling waters, Cola's, orange and apple juices, milk for the tea station in the room).  Big, fluffy towels were refreshed morning and evening.  We could occasionally hear the teensy, tiny rumble of an underground train, but we actually loved it and thought it as an authentic part of visiting this vibrant city.  It never disturbed our sleep.  Looking out of our beautiful window each day was a perfect way to start and end our day - we really felt like were a part of the community..  Ampersand's location cannot be beat.  Mere steps from the South Kensington Station (Tube), with Cental/District and Piccadilly Lines you can get anywhere within minutes.  And it's such a pretty station with flowers and open-air.  Surrounding the station are plenty of wonderful restaurants, again just steps from Ampersand.  Perfect for breakfast or lunches (our favourite was Muriel's Kitchen). We also enjoyed our tea and massive meringue in the hotel's beautiful tea room.  The entire area feels safe and welcoming. The staff is pleasant and professional.  We left The Ampersand fully satisfied, missing it terribly, and looking forward to when we will be back.  ",5,2016,08,24
129,Weekend stay,"We (a couple) spent a weekend in this hotel. Fantastic location in South Kensington, small luxury hotel (small rooms, gym, etc.), but well equipped, friendly, efficient staff and very clean. Can be recommended, if you look for a hassle-free hub in the center of town, want to do the V&A or any of the nearby museums.",5,2016,08,24
129,"Friendly,convenient","I was In two minds when I  I checked into this hotel. It was quite busy on my arrival and though efficient,a bit cold. Got to my room and although lovely ,a bit small. It's is very well connected by bus and underground, which will get you to most the sights really quickly.If you want to do the museums,great location,all within walking distance.Lovely places to eat close by. After spending the afternoon and evening in town returned to a quieter hotel, more welcoming staff. The next day ,after enquiringly,was upgraded to another room. This one was bigger, felt more comfortable. The other thing I enjoyed about this place was the free minibar. This was the second hotel  in  uk which offered this service During this trip.Hopefully this trend will catch on.My rate included breakfast,which provided a good selection and great coffee and very efficient staff. After the initial feeling( which I think was just bad timing,people checking in/out) I really enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend staying here .",5,2016,08,24
129,Beautiful hotel,Overnight stay for theatre trip . Cannot fault this hotel fabulous location beautiful clean rooms and amazingly helpful friendly and efficient staff . Had breakfast and brunch in the dining room both were faultless. Will def be returning . ,5,2016,08,24
129,"Quite simply, my new favourite hotel in London","Cool, chic, outstanding service, amazing room .... The hotel was even better than I expected and would highly recommend it to any traveller. It's location near to shops, bars and restaurants, along with South Kensignton tube being two minutes walk away, with the Natural History Museum only 5 minutes made our weekend away with our five year old daughter incredibly easy and the area around the hotel had a really bustley, but safe ambiance. We couldn't fault anything with our stay, it was simply first class.",5,2016,08,24
129,Great Boutique Hotel,"Stayed there for 5 nights for a girls trip to London. Loved everything about the place except their preparedness for check-in.  We specifically requested two beds and confirmed many times prior to our arrival.  Of course, when we got there after long international flights our room was not ready. After returning post 2pm check-in time we waited and were led to a room that did not have 2 beds.  We then had to wait another 30 minutes to move rooms.  By this point we were exhausted and just wanted a shower and nap but instead had to schlep our luggage again. So arrival was not easy or great, but after that everything was delightful. Comfy beds, complimentary beverages in mini-fridge, and heated bathroom floors were a hit!",4,2016,08,23
129,Nice Hotel with great service!,"This hotel is charming and well located near Metro, bus and walk tours. The personal is very kind and ready to help. The room was little bit small (like others in London) but very well organized and very clean. ",5,2016,08,23
129,"Excellent service. Lovely, well located hotel.","Excellent service, starting from the web search until the check out. Very well located hotel, just a few steps from South Kesingston tube station. Beautifully decorated spacious room and bathroom (deluxe room). Amazing experience!",5,2016,08,22
129,Out of this world,Incredible. Everything about our stay was perfect. The staff were attentive and went the extra mile providing birthday chocolates for us which was completely unexpected. The room was just out of this world! If we could stay forever we would have. ,5,2016,08,22
129,Family Trip to London,We stayed in connecting rooms (503 and 504) which was perfect for our family of five. We would highly recommend this hotel. The location is within walking distance to multiple sightseeing locations and is adjacent to the South Kensington tube stop. Plenty of dining options and tea at the hotel was great although we didn't eat at the main restaurant.,5,2016,08,22
129,Amazing hotel and location,"We had the best stay at this hotel celebrating my husbands 30th birthday!!! We had a studio room with bathtub next to the window and it was huge, for London we were expecting a smaller room
We loved the free champagne, soft drinks and little cakes in our room. The shower was so good and turn down service really lovely. Towels and linen all so nice. We will definitely be back!!
Ps: location about 1 min walk from the tube so it's great ",5,2016,08,22
129,GREAT LOCATION,"The Ampersand is in a great location. South Kensington tube is a 2 minute walk away. There are plenty of cafes, pubs and restaurants close by should you choose to dine out.
We didn't eat at the hotel but had a drink in the bar downstairs where the staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel is close to lots of museums. Our room had wheelchair access ( although we did require this) so it was large with a large bathroom which had 2 rain showers and a seat if required. It was very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. I will definitely stay here again .",5,2016,08,22
129,"Nice night stay, great location","Very nice and clean hotel, location is excellent close to a lot of restaurants and shops. Staff were helpful at check in and room service was fast. 
Only comment would be the size of the standard room, it was too small
",4,2016,08,22
129,Brilliant as always,"We stay at the Ampersand every time we come to London and every time they have been excellent. The staff are always very friendly and helpful.

The rooms are always very clean and perfect size for a few days away.

The breakfast is very tasty as is the afternoon tea and priced accordingly for South Kensington.

A perfect hotel for the Royal Albert Hall/museums or just simply as a base to explore London and only 30 seconds from the underground.
",5,2016,08,19
129,Fabulous hotel in great location,"This has to be one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. I travel on business globally, so stay in many hotels, some 5 ampersand 6 star; this one is exceptional. From the warm and genuine welcome given by the receptionist, to the decor and lots of little individual touches; all were lovely. We had 3 rooms, all were very nice. We will definitely stay again.",5,2016,08,19
129,Beautiful hotel,"The Hotel is very nice, tastefully decorated and the location excellent. Picadilly Station is right Acrobat the street with many restaurants near by. Breakfast very good and a little different every day.  ",5,2016,08,18
129,Lovely small luxury hotel in Kensington ,"It didn't start well. We arrived at the hotel from an overnight flight and were exhausted. We figured we wouldn't be able to get into our room right away and we were right, so we sat in the salon off the lobby until it was ready. The bad news: the lifts were being repaired so we had to walk up three flights of steps. Then we were shown into our ""superior"" room, which was quite small and had only one chair. There was really no place to put our luggage and the closet was too small to hold our clothes if we unpacked. And the closet drove us crazy. When you open the door, the light goes on, but goes off again a few seconds later; every time you move, the light goes on or off. We couldn't move to another room because the hotel was fully booked, but luckily after one night, a larger (""deluxe"") room became available for the rest of our stay and they moved our things for us while we were out sightseeing. And the lifts were both working fine. The hotel has very nice facilities and a very helpful and accommodating staff. Breakfast is not included, but we had the continental breakfast buffet and it was quite good, varied, and generous. ",4,2016,08,17
129,The best location in the city!,"My question is... either if you are in London for work of holidays... is there anything better than Kensington?

Its so well connected, charming, classy and lively...as the Ampersand hotel itself is.

The room was a double superior and it still felt a bit tight... but one must always remember that this is London and not L.A. so size here is what it is...!

The decor was nice. Perhaps in the common areas a bit too coulourful... to the point that some things looked a bit childish... but it does make sense in a city where grey skies are almost perpetual.

Anyway, my room was very classy. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was well equiped and had great toiletries.

Their restaurant in the basement was very cozy. I actually didn't intend to dine there... but I'm glad I did, and I totally recommend it for casual dinner.

No doubts that I will return... for the 4th time!  ;)

The toiletries",4,2016,08,17
129,Wonderful long-term stay with our dog during our move!,"We stayed at the Ampersand for 4 weeks during our overseas move from Canada to England.  Our suite was perfect for our family (my husband and I, our teenage son, and our dog).  It was large enough, with a sizeable bathroom, and extremely clean.  The staff was both kind and helpful, from the front desk to room service, to the cleaning personnel.  We appreciated their kindness and patience towards our anxious travelling dog (Jango) and their attentiveness to our needs.  If you are looking for an lovely afternoon tea, you must try their drawing room.  The chef's special science themed tea was particularly delightful!  We hope to have the pleasure to stay again soon at this wonderful hotel and will highly recommend it.  Thank you!  Jango and I will try to walk by for a little visit!",5,2016,08,17
129,Convenient location,"The Ampersand is located in an upmarket area (south Kensington) very close to public transport (subway!!), and it was an easy walking distance to museums and restaurants. There was a food market set up in a mew close to the hotel on Saturday.  The hotel was very clean, the bed linens crisp and comfortable, the washrooms very clean as well.",4,2016,08,17
129,Ampersand in London,"We loved our stay at the Ampersand. It was a nice, very well-appointed hotel and we loved the location.  It is literally across the street from the South Kensington tube station and there are lots of great shops and restaurants on the street, as well as the V&A Museum about a block away. I will definitely stay there next time I am in London. I would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2016,08,16
129,Ampersand & Excellence!,Stayed here at the beginning and end of a Europe trip.  Could not have asked for better bookends - every aspect of the stay was excellent!  The jewel in the crown was the basement restaurant Apero with delicious cocktails and an amazing brunch.  I will definitely be back!!!,5,2016,08,16
129,Excellent hotel! ,"The ratings on this place are high and for good reason! The location can't be beat in the heart of south Kensington just across from south Kensington tube station (serving circle, district and Piccadilly lines) an easy walk with luggage! The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. My friend and I booked a ""small"" room which we were warned about both on the booking site and a follow up email from the hotel, but it was fine I don't know what all the fuss was about, it was a small room true, but this is London! The staff also went out of their way to help us scan and email some important documents during the trip which was very appreciated. The rooms were immaculately clean and had nice sheets/towels and amenities! Would definitely recommend and stay again! ",5,2016,08,16
129,Great Boutique Hotel,"Really friendly and efficient Hotel with lovely Rooms at a sensible Price for London.

The location is right next to South Kensington Tube and is a short pleasant walk to Harrods.

We have stayed here 4 times and it has never failed us.",5,2016,08,16
129,City trip,"Service incredible, very friendly and attentive staff. Rooms good and very clean but mattress a little soft. Excellent breakfast at Apero. Tube station across the street. Hop-on-hop-off bus stop outside hotel. ",4,2016,08,16

129,Definitely Returning!,"Loved our stay in this quirkyily and tastefully decorated hotel. Service was excellent with helpul, welcoming staff. Rooms beautiful and extremely comfortable. Only ate breakfast, but it was excellent with good choice of high quality ingredients. We are looking forward to returning soon, The Ampersand was a real find. ",5,2016,08,16
129,Elegant and Funky,"The ambiance and decor of the Ampersand won us over right away. From the welcoming staff, to the majorly comfortable bed, and the eclectic design, the Ampersand was great on so many levels. One of the great perks after a long day of sightseeing, was free water and treats from the minibar, just one of the nice touches that put the Ampersand above the rest. A beautiful and fun place to stay. ",5,2016,08,15
129,Terrible Experience,"As This hotel is a member of Small Luxury Hotels, and as i am a member of a certain card that offers the card holder an upgrade of the room, and late check-out Subject to availability, so i booked this hotel through my card agent for five nights hoping for a pleasant stay, (I was wrong). 
 At the check-in they told me they were fully booked so they cant upgrade us (At the same time there website was showing availability of the room i was entitled to be upgraded).
And also as my flight was late i requested for a late check-out, but they said they are fully booked so they cant give a late check-out, at the same time they offered me a late check-out with a fee.
Never had this kind of a terrible experience before.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.",1,2016,08,15
129,Definitely again,"Stay at The Ampersand; the pictures don't lie, and the staff is ever so helpful and nice. The tube is just across the street and it's within a short walking distance to museums and Harrods. The tube goes straight to Heathrow Airport in just 40 min. for just a few ¬£.",5,2016,08,15
129,Good value,"I have stayed twice this year, first with my daughters in April and now in July with my partner. I had a lovely stay both times! Rooms are nice and good value, service is excellent and the location is good. It might not be quite as posh as some of the more well known boutique hotels but it is elegant and  a bargain for the money, the staff is really nice and helpful. Can certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,15
129,An Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel in August for 3 days with our 17 year old twin kids and everyone thought the hotel was wonderfull. Check in for one of the kids rooms was a bit late, but it had a maintenance problem, these things happen. Would easily stay again at this hotel.
All staff super friendly and the bar downstairs very cosy.",5,2016,08,15
129,Boutique hotel,Quirky gem of a hotel in South Kensington with plenty of character & great relaxed atmosphere. Stayed with a girlfriend as had tickets to see the Proms at the  Royal Albert Hall. Afternoon tea delightful as was breakfast & room very comfortable although small but it was ok for one night. Staff great! ,5,2016,08,15
129,Shopping Trip to Knightsbridge,"The Ampersand Hotel was truly amazing - it is a perfect location if you want to be close to excellent shopping areas, some fabulous restaurants and some of London's amazing tourist attractions & museums.",5,2016,08,14
129,The Ampersand Hotel,"Our 5 night stay was excellent.  Hotel is lovely and everything is high-tech! Even the elevator speaks politely!.  Excellent location with plenty of good restaurants in neighborhood.  The natural history museum is just around the corner!  Close  to South Kensington Tube Station. So easy to get around London!

129,Boutique-ish Kensington gem,"Very nice boutique-ish hotel in great location near museums, Kensington shopping areas etc.  Great surprise for me that on arrival the & turned out to be a revamp of the old Norfolk where I used to stay years back on my first business trips to London.  Good rooms, friendly service, great breakfast in wonderfully repurposed cellars/downstairs floor.",4,2016,08,13
129,Imaginative menu beautifully presented,"A basement restaurant in a beautiful hotel deservedly popular with our friends from USA.The menu is based around a tasting menu at about ¬£35 per person for several small dishes.However we had a small portion at ¬£7 each,(or you could have had a large at ¬£14) of their seafood saffron rissotto.Not a large portion thank goodness as very rich but perfect.For once the rice was neither rock hard nor soggy which is so often the problem with rissotto here in UK.Service was attentive and friendly.If you have trouble finding this slightly hidden delight look for the sheep painting by the door.There is also disabled access.The wine choice is also excellent.If you judge a restaurant by the loos then you will be very pleased indeed!",5,2016,08,13
129,Make this beautiful hotel your base,"This was our first time in London we weren't sure what to expect or where to stay and picked the Ampersand from outstanding online reviews. It didn't disappoint and was a wonderful location to come back to after each busy day. The rooms are beautiful and always spotless, the staff are accommodating and friendly. The ambience of the hotel is wonderful and we can't find fault with anything! We would highly recommend and wouldn't hesitate to return when we next visit the UK.",5,2016,08,12
129,Lovely design hotel in a great spot.,"We stayed for 2 nights in a Superior Room. We opted for the Superior Room based on other comments left on Tripadvisor about the size of the standard rooms and are glad we did as it wasn't overly generous in size. However, the room was beautifully appointed, as is the whole of the hotel, and very well equipped. We particularly appreciated the complimentary soft drinks in the minibar. The bed was large and extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. The hotel is in a brilliant location and the staff were very friendly. We ate out but had drinks in the bar. Again we loved the decor. We also made use of the Games room. 

A great stay, thank you!
",5,2016,08,12
129,Gorgeous hotel with great staff and perfect location,"From the moment we arrived the people in the hotel made us welcome and at ease. Keeping cases till check in was no problem and the closeness to South Kensington Tube was so handy. Genuinely a minute or two across one road. 

The deluxe studio was well decorated and had a huge comfortable bed with luxurious mattress and linens. Fabulous. 

Even bring close to a road and sometimes hearing a distant murmur of the underground does not hamper sleep. Well sound proofed rooms and air conditioned.

The drawing room is great for tea and cake and has a great atmosphere and ambience. 

We loved our time at The Ampersand and will definitely be back. Thoroughly recommend ",5,2016,08,12
129,"Lovely place to stay, I would definitely return.","We stayed at the Ampersand in London during August of 2015 (I'm slow to review things).  It was a beautiful hotel, not too big not too small. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when needed. The location was perfect. In walking distance of shops and dining. Also just blocks away from the tube.",5,2016,08,11
129,Second visit and it just got better,"I stayed earlier this year on a girls weekend and booked a return trip with my husband as we had such a lovely experience first time round.

The hotel didn't disappoint, the room was great, staff were friendly and attentive and the overall ambience of the hotel is perfect.

Close to South Kensington tube station makes it perfectly placed to visit anywhere in London",5,2016,08,11
129,A great place to stay in London,"Close to the South Kensington Tube station, museums, restaurants.  A great place to walk to various London highlights. The hotel was clean.  The room was modern and updated.  The bathroom was modern and clean.",5,2016,08,10
129,Noisy (London Underground),"Initial room was nice but noisy (London Underground), changed room but got a cramped, inferior one where the WiFi didn't work (and could not be fixed) and where we could still hear the trains! The hotel spontaneously covered the cost of our afternoon tea.",2,2016,08,10
129,Excellent London boutique hotel,"Excellent we have stayed many times and it never disappoints. The hotel is in a great location, we love to have some tea in the Drawing rooms or a drink in the bar. Staff are always very friendly and helpful",5,2016,08,10
129,Highly Recommended,"Stayed in a single room for one night. Check in was quick and efficient. I was taken to the room by a gentleman who showed me how the air con, tv and wi fi worked. 
The room was lovely and clean, I had a double bed, a large shower (no bath) and added extras included fresh milk and fruit juice in the fridge. The wifi, air con and TV were all working fine. The only slight issue I would note was that I was in room 481 (next to the lift) and the motor of the lift could be heard from the room - it was minimal but if you are sensitive to noise at night it might be better to ask for a different room.
As indicated on the hotel's website the wardrobe was small so not ideal if you were going to stay for a longer period but fine for 1 or 2 nights.
Breakfast was very nice, a good selection of food in the continental section and a variety of cooked items are available to order.
I had afternoon tea at the hotel, which was in a lovely, relaxing room.
The hotel is very close to South Kensington tube station and is in walking distance of the Victoria and Albert museum, Natural History museum and Harrods, Hyde park is about a 10-15min walk away.
The area has lots of shops and restaurants to explore.
I would recommend this hotel and would stop there again.",5,2016,08,10
129,Excelent experience,"The service is great, stuff very friendly, lovely decor, full with unexpected touches that makes you very special, location in faboulous, walking distance to main attractions.

129,I could live in this hotel!,"Excellent hotel! I did not want to leave. The room was charming with adequate closet space.  The bathroom was superb! Best shower head and the rubber ducky was a charming touch.  The staff was fantastic and hospitable! Breakfast in the restaurant Apero was delicious--best English porridge and berries, ever! Two minutes from the tube and the area is chock-full of eating options.  A week was not enough to try them all.  ",5,2016,08,09
129,Ready in 20 minutes,"We travelled to stay just one night.  On arrival we were told our room would be ready in 20 minutes. TWO HOURS later we were finally checked into our room.  One gentleman was obviously unhappy when we arrived because he had also waited and was given a ground floor room which he refused.  He was then given another room (maybe ours). We were then offered a ground floor room ( patter emerging) which we also refused because of past reviews. We were then told the delay was our fault because we refused that room. At this point we were already one hour and twenty minutes over.  However saying that, the hotel is just lovely, the lady in the drawing room is a natural and an asset, the room was beautiful and we felt like we just melted into the bed it was that comfortable.  Just a pity about the reception staff and maybe should employ more housekeepers.",3,2016,08,08
129,a staff destroyed my stay,"I stayed in the deluxe studio room. The rooms are clean and charming. Facilities are also excellent, during the stay was spent comfortably. Subway station nearby through which the Piccadilly line. Most of the staff was friendly and helpful. However, staff corresponding to the time of check-out was very rude. I was upset and felt very bad feeling when I left the hotel,because of one rude staff. My comfortable stay, was destroyed by one staff. The end was very regret.",3,2016,08,08
129,Nice boutique hotel,Tasteful boutique hotel at a perfect location. Underground station just 3 minutes away and very close to V&A Museum and Natural History Museum. Lots of restaurants around. Staff is friendly and respond promptly to requests.,4,2016,08,08
129,Ampersand Hotel review,"Excellent hotel with exceptional service.

129,Great location and love the decoration,"Loved the way each room was decorated - very chic! Brilliant location - just across the road from South Kensington tube station, lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Lovely comfy beds and nice bathrooms with lovely range of smellies. Friendly staff, complimentary soft drinks in fridge, nice coffee and tea, and good free wifi. 

Our room was an hour late being ready or I would have given it a five star rating. Otherwise brilliant. ",4,2016,08,07
129,Delightful hotel,"Excellent hotel - only 110 rooms but it felt very personal.  Definitely going to stay again.  Loved complimentary soft drinks in mini bar - and fresh milk for the tea & coffee.

129,Wonderful boutique hotel in a great neighborhood,"Ampersand is located in a great neighborhood (museums, shopping, restaurants, you name it).

129,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here November, 2015 for 6 nights.  The hotel is very nice - clean rooms, high ceilings, top-notch toiletries, heated bathroom floor, excellent shower.  We had tea and pastries here and everything was lovely.
The tube is a three minute walk and there is an abundance of restaurants and pubs close by.  My wife and I walked everywhere we could and the area is extremely safe.  
Close to museums.  
Will stay here again next time we are in London.",5,2016,08,06
129,Great spot just seconds from the Tube,"Despite the small room and lack of view , service is top notch and the quality of amenities is very good. Very easy to get to Heathrow with no transfer. Lots of shops and places to eat nearby. Would stay there again.",5,2016,08,05
129,London Mini Break for Anniversary,"I cannot rate this hotel highly enough. Absolutely everything was spot on.

129,Great find ,"Boutique hotel in the heart of South Ken. Quirky & interesting. young and friendly staff and luxe rooms. Rubber ducks for our children and a gorgeous claw foot tub. Housekeeping were always eager to please and painstaking in their cleaning -very unusual in London. 

My only critique: Please have staggered check-in for those of us coming from far away. The staff being young and European have no concept of what it's like to have come off a 12 hour flight with young children.  The housekeeping were unable to have a single room ready before 2 pm, despite a lobby full of exhausted travellers. With 141 rooms in the hotel, that is just poor management of the process and something a professionally run hotel should be able to handle. 

",4,2016,08,05
129,What a gem!!,A friend told me about this hotel as a gem among London hotels. The Marriott I was going to stay at was almost twice the price and half the charm. This hotel has everything you want in London. Great bar too. Strong WIFI made messaging photos easy. Tube across the street. Beds made me not want to get out of them and wanting to come in early to snuggle and watch big flat screen TV. Showers divine. I had a room over looking Harrington with picture window taller than me. Room service took less than 30 minutes. Great workout room to work off the best high tea I've had. Just lovely.,5,2016,08,04
129,"Best location, nice place and excellent service!","We spent 4 days in London at The Ampersand Hotel... Everything was perfect!  We are a party of five, so we took one luxury doubble for the kids and a superior doubble for me and my wife. The hotel is located in South Kensington near the Underground and it's just perfect!",5,2016,08,04
129,Excellent service,"Fabulous hotel.  Excellent staff and service.  Lovely.  Family of 4 traveling together - treated well. We stayed only one night, but were given adjoining rooms which served our family well.  The South Kensington tube stop is steps away.  Very convenient.   Service wonderful.",5,2016,08,04
129,Excellent hotel,"I chose this hotel after reading the great reviews. I was not disappointed. Travelling with 2 small children, I wanted a clean room in a great location. The hotel is 2 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station - which was perfect. It is in the museum district and full of restaurants. 

Our bedroom was immaculate and incredibly quiet. Fantastic sized bed, and large bathroom.
Reception staff were probably the friendliest I've ever encountered - making a fuss of the children and showing an interest in their London experience.
We had one continental breakfast one morning - and there was plenty of food for all 3 of us - which was delicious. 
I can't imagine ever staying anywhere else in London. ",5,2016,08,04
129,Best stay ever,The experience was top notch from the reservation process through check and our stay itself. Every detail was excellent and we just could not fault this hotel. We have stayed in many hotels around the world and this was the best....well done to the team.,5,2016,08,04
129,Beautiful hotel in south Kensington ,We enjoyed our stay at the ampersand. We were traveling with two teenagers. The hotel is very nice and has a great location minutes from the TUbe station and seconds from the bus. As with  most European hotels the rooms are modestly sized so we needed two rooms to accommodate 4 people. The bed and pillows were above average. Complimentary basic mini bar and daily newspaper. They have a breakfast buffet which is reasonably priced for the location. Friendly staff. ,5,2016,08,02
129,boutique hotel experience at its finest,"I had to force myself at time to leave room at times. Stayed at their Superior Room where bed and toiletries were just divine! Overall, this stay at The Ampersand made my London experience truly unforgettable",5,2016,08,01
129,Great hotel in an excellent location,"This is a wonderful hotel in a great location to visit many off the museums in South Kensington and Chelsea.  Friendly and helpful staff and the rooms are roomy and very clean.  The South Kensington underground station is only half a block from the hotel, so getting around London is a breeze.",5,2016,07,31
129,Outstanding Hotel in London,"After 45 years in the Hotel business we decided to start our 30 day stay in Europe with a 3 night stay in London.  We selected the South Kensington area of London for its  proximity to major museums and the Ampersand Hotel after reviewing Trip Adviser.

After two nights, I put the Ampersand up against any of the fine hotels I've stayed  at including Four Seasons and Fairmont. The area the hotel is quiet and away from the London rush.  Many fine restaurants within walking distance.

The staff is outstanding and the actual guest room and public areas exceed what is viewed on the Website. The room is spacious. The bathroom large with walk in shower. Housekeeping is immaculate. The bed, pillows, bed and bath linens exceptional.  Turn-down service perfect.  The in room refrigerator is stocked with water, juice and soda which are complimentary and replenished twice daily.

The restaurant is wonderful and very fairly priced.  All pastries are made on site.  It is a popular locals spot at dinner.  Afternoon tea is available in the lobby and is a treat,

The workout room is small but has the best equipment.

My wife and I will never stay anywhere else when returning to London.  Major kudos to General Manager Roberto Pajares and Asst. Manager Tracey Hewitson and the entire team.",5,2016,07,30
129,"Very pleasant hotel, wonderfully located","The location is great for experienced tourists: almost next to the South Kensington tube stop, very close to the museums and Hyde Park, and short walks to Chelsea and Knightsbridge.  It's in the ""French Quarter"" of Kensington, with many good restaurants and little shops all around.  A very high-end neighborhood in general, with a Lamborghini dealership and many embassies.

The hotel is certainly an upscale, sophisticated place, quite expensive (like so many good London hotels) so worth looking for deals.

We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant (not included in our rate), which was quite good, with many choices in the Continental+ buffet.  We also had dinner there one night, and it was good.

The hotel has a nice lounge on the ground floor, very light and welcoming, serving drinks and some snacks.

We had a ""deluxe"" room for the two of us, which was a reasonable nice, not too small.    It was modern, clean, and functioned well.  And air-conditioned, which was nice in unusually hot weather for England (80s F).",5,2016,07,29
129,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff, excellent stay","I stayed here for two nights with my husband and daughter. The location is excellent and just steps from South Kensington station; there are also a large number of cafes and restaurants. Within walking distance is the Natural History, Science and V&A museums and Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. 
The hotel is beautifully decorated in a boutique style. Staff on the front desk were friendly and welcoming. The only problem we encountered was a difficulty with our air conditioning but this was resolved within ten minutes.
Included in our stay was a continental breakfast which is served in the chic restaurant. Breakfast was a superb spread of meats, pastries, cereals, fruit etc. 
I'd stay here again without a doubt, lovely hotel.",5,2016,07,29
129,Excellent hotel,"Nice hotel, great staff and convenient location. 
Get the upgraded room if not traveling alone.  
We stayed here two different weekends with a week of travel in between. 
An upgraded room was not available for our second weekend and we found the standard room with a double bed tight for two people. It would have been fine if you are traveling alone. 
Very clean, super friendly staff, convenient in and out of London and Heathrow. ",5,2016,07,28
129,Nice location,"Nice location. Museums, places to eat as well as the Kensington rail station were close by. The hotel boasts modern interior decor. The bathroom floor heats up. Our room was supposedly an upgrade but it was on the first floor where you can hear the rail traveling underground and handicap accessible which for my fianc√© who is 6'3 had quite a ways to bend. Maybe the front desk didn't see him when we both checked in... We tried the hotel restaurant before catching a show. Turned out to be a casual place so we only tried the tapas and bottle of wine. It was decent, looks like locals come there for happy hour. Wish there was a nicer restaurant considering the price you pay to stay at the hotel. Overall, a pleasant, stay for 3 nights in London. Just make sure to get a room on a higher floor and make reservations at a nicer restaurant for a special night out.",4,2016,07,27
129,Great hotel in a great location!,"Hotel and staff are excellent!
The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially for two first time visitors to London.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The location is great as well.  It's a two minute walk to the tube station, and you can get to central London with a 10-15 minute train ride. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,07,27
129,Out of the blue,"During a meeting of friends for drinks the waitress was told it was my birthday.
Next minute- look what arrived. How thoughtful. It made my day.
Highly recommend the friendliness  and thoughtfulness of the staff at the Ampersand",5,2016,07,25
129,Excellent suite for a young family short-stay,"We stayed in one of the suites on the top floor for one night with our 3-year old son to explore the museums in London. The staff were very friendly and an excellent location to explore west London. Within walking distance is: Harrods, The Science Museum, The Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace. I recommend going to the Princess Diana Memorial Playground on a nice day. There are lots of lovely restaurants around too. The eating options in the hotel are not the best for young children, but the staff offered to bring up afternoon tea to our room. I would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,07,25
129,Perfect Stay,"I booked the hotel because of its location, there was a summer offer rate so the prices were very reasonable, very friendly staff, perfect location next to South Ken Station, got a free upgrade, will definitely stay there on my next trip",5,2016,07,25
129,Best little hotel in south Kensington,"Most comfortable bed I've slept in. Very clean rooms with lovely decor. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. 
Location to tube is excellent. 
Room service very fast. 
Small quiet boutique style hotel. 
Balconies an extra bonus. ",5,2016,07,23
129,"Excellent boutique hotel, perfectly located","This hotel is cozy, classy and personable. It is also conveniently located a minute's walk from South Kensington station, and is easy to get to from Heathrow on the Piccadilly line. There is a great restaurant in the basement, and the staff is warm and helpful. The neighborhood is full of restaurants, the V&A is a 10 minute walk, Harrod's maybe 20? ",5,2016,07,22
129,Ampersand,"We had an amazing time exploring London, and absolutely loved the location. Afternoon tea is a must and the drinks in the downstairs bar had the best drinks! The room was great and the bathroom was impeccable. We will be back. ",5,2016,07,22
129,Great Expectations - Not Realised,"After reading the excellent reviews of the Ampersand and staring lovingly at the pictures, I decided that this was going to be my base for a 1 night stay to visit the Royal Albert Hall. Sadly the hotel didn‚Äôt really live up to expectations!

Firstly the location of the hotel is perfect for those wanting to visit the local museums with the V&A a short walk away as well as the Royal Albert Hall about 10 minutes‚Äô walk too. The area itself is nice enough and it‚Äôs directly opposite South Kensington Tube too which is very handy. It‚Äôs even a 15 minute stroll to Harrods should your wallet be crying out to be emptied.

First impressions of the hotel were good. Its frontage stands out on the street and looks modern and inviting. Inside though is where it gets a little stranger. Firstly I did find it odd that the check-in desk and area was tiny. I don‚Äôt know the capacity of the hotel but with a few people checking in and out, it soon became crowded. Secondly I had booked to stay in a superior double room so I, maybe incorrectly, had assumed that this would be off the ground floor‚Ä¶ seemingly I was wrong as the receptionist showed me to a room directly around the corner from reception and the sitting room. My room was literally 5 metres from the busy reception area and not what I expected from booking a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù room at all. Inside the room it was a little gloomy as it was at the side of the building (surrounded by a tall building next door) with a great view of the barred windows opposite. Again, not exactly a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù experience. The room was spacious though with a nice bathroom and great rainfall shower which was very good. I was told about the complimentary mini-bar which would be restocked regularly but sadly it only contained a few fruit juices (and by few I mean 3) which were not restocked as promised. Big shout-out for the packet of ginger biscuits though which were awesome.

Breakfast wasn‚Äôt included in the room (¬£300 well spent‚Ä¶) and again the experience there was underwhelming. Breakfast is served at the adjoining restaurant which, to be honest, is a little small. Now imagine a lot of hotel guests and families trying to squeeze into a restaurant that really only had about 15 tables and you can see the issue. I had to wait for a table for some time just to get some water and cornflakes which made me think that room service could well be the preferred option.

Overall the visit to the Ampersand promised much but my experience left me wondering if I would ever return if I was in the area. It didn‚Äôt help that the receptionist made a sarcastic remark upon check-out when I mentioned the location of the superior room. They‚Äôre obviously not that bothered about repeat custom.",3,2016,07,22
129,Pure heaven,"I decided to treat myself recently and what a treat The Ampersand was. 

The staff are polite and helpful, it's barely a minutes walk from South Kensington tube and the bedroom was amazing!! I booked a Deluxe Studio (my only disappointment was I didn't get a bath by the bed). The bed was huge and very comfortable, the bedding divine and the constant top of Nespresso was brilliant. I loved having a bath and getting to watch TV whilst relaxing after a long day sightseeing. 

I was travelling on my own but felt very safe. The decor of the hotel is unique and individual. Loved the light feature on the staircase. Everywhere was clean it's so much more interesting than some hotels. 

One point the breakfast was very good although I feel the continental is a little over priced and more coffee with breakfast would have been nice. 

Overall I recommend The Ampersand highly and will be saving up to go again. ",4,2016,07,21
129,Perfect location for London,"Like always a perfect stay in London.
Perfect location for London.
A short step from South Kensington station and the V&A museum.
The service and the stuff is extremely friendly and nice.
Breakfast and room service is perfect.
There is also a small but well equipped gym.",4,2016,07,21
129,"Excellent location, nice hotel, friendly staff","Liked the closeness to the tube station, nearby restaurants and Museums, hotel itself expensive as all hotels in London, but considering that worth the money. Bathroom was very good, room itself rather small, but good enough for a weekend stay.",4,2016,07,21
129,Hidden Jewel in best location,"I stayed here with a friend for 3 nights over the weekend. The Hotel is having an amazing service, standard and quality. Location is superb - everything in walking distance. We enjoyed very much the room (in specific the amazingly comfortable beds) and the dinner and cocktails at the APERO restaurant. Staff in general was extremely welcoming & friendly. I will be back.",5,2016,07,21
129,"Great location, friendly staff ","I stayed here for five nights on business. Location is perfect, only 5 mins from South Kensington tube and walking distance to loads of restaurants. 
The hotel was clean, staff are very friendly and the service is excellent. 
My room was a little in the small size but nothing I couldn't cope with. Breakfast menu was varied and delicious. 
I loved the funky decor and quirky touches including the umbrella. 
I'd definitely stay again. Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,07,20
129,Great stay at the Ampersand Hotel,"     We had a deluxe double room at the Ampersand Hotel.  The room was very quiet and comfortable.  The bathroom was a good size and the shower was great.   

     The Porter and Sail app they give you access to for your stay at the hotel was a perfect concierge.  It had great tips on where to eat no matter where we were in London.  We ate at many of the recommendations and they were very good.

     The hotel was very convenient to the South Kensington tube station.  And there were very tasty restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.   ",5,2016,07,20
129,Queens Tennis stayover,Chose this hotel as a convenient option to get into the centre of London for shopping/dinner as well as being close to the Queens Club for the tennis. Really good choice for both as well as having comfortable and well appointed rooms. Most likely more suited for couples seeking a short break than a family stay in my opinion. Excellent breakfast on offer in the bar dining room - did not try dinner but seemed to offer a good selection of dishes.,4,2016,07,20
129,Chilled and cool,"A lovely break from the heat. Light lunch and Tea. Very pleasant drawing room. Staff very efficient. The goats cheese on walnut bread sandwich is lovely. Great place to get some work done in the quiet, or to catch up with friends. Very stylish without being pretentious. ",5,2016,07,20
129,my stay in Kensington,"  The staff was professional and  very friendly  . The hotel very clean,the loby inviting  and the property  most convient to many  museums. I was especially gratful to a lady named Bharati  and her manager named  Tracey  who helped staighten out my mistake in a reservation  I would highly reccommend  this property it and stay again  .   ",5,2016,07,19
129,Great place and great location,The Ampersand is a very comfortable and convenient place to stay when visiting London.  Near the South Kensington tube station it is ideal for getting throughout greater London.  We enjoyed our time there immensely.,4,2016,07,19
129,A wonderful stay,Travelled to London with my 4 year old to visit the Natural History Museum and the location of the hotel was perfect. Just a 5 min walk. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who was engaging with my son. The room although not particularly large was lovely with excellent amenities and a very comfortable bed. I had requested a quiet room and being on the 5th floor this was perfect. I would recommend the hotel and look forward to returning. ,5,2016,07,19
129,"Excellent, well located, boutique type hotel.","This hotel is very well located if you want to walk out into the streets of Kensington. 

Nice bar, tearoom area, where you can have your classical British tea with all sorts of pastries.

Very good dining options at walking distance.

It is nicely decorated (modern). 

The service provided by the hotel staff is extremely friendly and personalised.",5,2016,07,18
129,Our stay,"I think the stay was really good. I have not been to London before therefore i think my experience from the Hotel was good. The staff offered a lot of service and the location of the hotel was central to the metro, museums etc.",4,2016,07,18
129,"Ideally located, impeccable room and service","A great hotel offering an ideal location in London. Close to V&A museum and Hyde Park. Easy for running, including the fitness room. High quality service and very clean and comfortable rooms. Delightful breakfast.",5,2016,07,17
129,"Ampersand Hotel, London","This was a lovely hotel and in a very convenient place for exhibitions.  Buses were very convenient as was the underground.   It is in a very good area to eat out as well, with some very good restaurants within easy walking distance.  Staff were excellent and very helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,07,17
129,Superb Ampersand,"A perfectly located traditional townhouse property with a modern twist. Dining facilities excellent, service in all aspects of the hotel friendly and efficient and overall a thoroughly comfortable experience. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,07,17
129,Ampersand Stay,"Except for small rooms with little space for luggage and hanging clothes, everything about
the hotel is excellent:  wonderful staff, excellent group facilities - sitting areas, little library,
nice restaurant, and great location for subway and museums and other restaurants.",4,2016,07,16
129,Location and class.,"A beautiful boutique hotel in a fantastic location. It's not cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for. Wonderful staff, who immediately dealt with any request or enquiry. Room was beautiful and one of the best beds I've ever slept in. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,07,15
129,London Suite,"Very helpful staff. We pre-paid for three nights in  one-bedroom suite with a balcony. By U.S. standards the suite was tiny, and the balcony miniscule. On the flip side, the bath was huge in comparison to the parlor and bedroom. 'Big soaking tub and a ceiling mounted rainfall shower. The hotel has been re-fitted with the latest in electronics for security and convenience matters.  Big flat-screen TV's in the bedroom and parlor; even a smaller one for tub viewing. Appreciated the Nespresso machine, electric kettle, microwave, and mini-fridge stocked daily. Very good experience.",4,2016,07,13
129,Rooms far too small for double occupancy,"The room provided was far too small and appear more spacious on the hotel photos, not a 5 star room and certainly not a 5 star experience having to haggle for another room with the reception staff, the other room provided was also too small for 2 persons, probably the smallest room I have ever stayed in and the worst 5 star experience EVER. Totally unacceptable for a so called 5 star hotel. THIS ROOM WAS NOT EVEN SUITABLE FOR SINGLE OCCUPANCY LET ALONE 2 PERSONS. ",2,2016,07,13
129,Luxury in south Kensington,"Beautiful hotel in a fun neighborhood. Excellent service from all staff, great breakfast and coffee, easy underground access, fun to walk about each evening choosing restaurants. Museums down the street.",5,2016,07,12
129,A very special family visit,"Me, my husband and our two small children (4 and 18mnths) spent two night at The Ampersand to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This is the first time we have taken them to London and we were a little anxious but had no need to be. The hotel was amazing from booking until we left. 
The staff were very helpful in advising us on a room to suit our needs and they were spot on. The room offered everything we needed, with a huge king size bed, a single and a cot but with ample room to play too! There was a bath in the window of the room which was a luxury appreciated by myself and the children. (We were in a deluxe studio by the way). The staff at the hotel made every effort to make us feel welcome whenever they had the opportunity. Always acknowledging and chatting with the children and making sure they were having a nice time. 
The location was perfect for us as it was opposite the tube station, a bus stop directly outside and the 'Dinosaur Museum' a short walk away. 
My only complaint, and it is so very minor, was that the breakfast situation was unclear and slow when ordered from the a la carte menu. This did not tarnish the stay in any way at all but is more of a constructive criticism for the hotel. 
The kids had the best weekend and so did we. The hotel offered the luxury that we wanted with the informality and practicality we needed for the children. PERFECT! We cant wait to come back (maybe without the children!!)",5,2016,07,12
129,Superb room and a great location,"Rather than staying in one of the larger, more expensive central London chains, the Ampersand in Chelsea is just perfect. It's more of a boutique hotel with clearly a great deal of time and money gone into getting the decor just right. 

The breakfast was a touch shambolic and the room was a bit compact but other than that I could not fault it.

And Chelsea as a base is surprisingly inexpensive - certainly cheaper than central London.",4,2016,07,11
129,Gem of a hotel in a great location,"Loved loved loved this hotel. Perfect spot near bars, cafes and restaurants. Opposite tube station and taxi rank. Great staff, delicious food and a super comfy room. Walking distance to many museums and with lots of shopping nearby. Could not fault!",5,2016,07,10
129,The perfect London hotel,"This is a great hotel in a perfect location.  South Kensington is a quiet, safe, semi residential, high end area of London with good shops and restaurants that is also very centrally located.  The hotel is located across the street from the South Kensington Tube station.  From that station, you can access several lines and get where ever you want in minutes!  You can also walk to Hyde Park, Harrods and Kensington Palace in minutes.  There are a lot of take out food places around the station where you can grab a quick bite early or late or pick up something to eat on the go.  We also found a very good Indian restaurant across the street from the hotel.  The hotel itself is small, but elegant.  The staff get to know you quickly and are very friendly.  The public spaces are inviting, and altho we didn't have a chance to have bfast or afternoon tea there, from the number of people who did, the food must be excellent.  My daughter and I shared a rather large, quiet room overlooking a french school.  The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were noticeably high end.  We couldn't wait to crawl in after our long days of pounding the pavement!  The bathroom floor was heated, the bathrobes were soft and the minibar was free and restocked every morning.  It was nice to have a chilled, bottled water ready to take with us on our daily outings.  When we decided at the last moment to try to get tix for a show, the concierge found us unbelievable seats and offered them to us at a discount.  I was preparing to pay a premium, so I was really thrilled!  In sum, altho the hotel isn't cheap, given the premium location and the quality of the amenities and service of the hotel, it was money well-spent.  If this hotel is in your budget, I can't think of any reason to stay anywhere else. ",5,2016,07,09
129,Fantastic stay,We were on a family vacation with 6 kids 12 and under. The hotel was incredibly comfortable and extremely child-friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other families. The location was also perfect.,5,2016,07,09
129,Really great hotel and thoughtful touches,Had a lovely stay - super hotel and staff. Bright colourful rooms and spaces.  Great location near many funky places.  A birthday present for a friend. Thanks for a good time. We will certainly come back many times more.  ,5,2016,07,09
129,Second stay better than the first!,"We stayed at the Ampersand in June for the second time and liked it even better this time. The room was ready for us when we arrived after our transAtlantic flight, and it was almost too luxurious. The bed was heavenly, and the big bathtub in the room was a welcome restorative after long days of sight seeing in London. We're looking forward to our next stay.",5,2016,07,06
129,A perfect little hotel for female solo travellers,"Faultless.  Enjoyed every minute of my stay.  Excellent location.  Used to live in London and the South Kensington area has changed significantly. The Ampersand is most definitely a welcome addition to the area.  Even if you don't stay, just pop in for tea.  ",5,2016,07,06
129,Another wonderful stay!,"Our experience started with an email that arrived before our flight to London asking if we needed anything that might make our stay better. Reservations, car service etc. WOW! What a great service since we do not live in the UK and are not familiar with the area. When we arrived, our check in was a breeze. The bellman/ doorman and front desk staff were very attentive and friendly and had us in our room very quickly. Our room was spotless, the bed was very comfortable. There is a complimentary mini bar for your use. Our bathroom was rather small but had a very roomy shower with a rain head and a heated bathroom floor. There is a separate area for blow drying your hair outside the bathroom. The area around this hotel has many fine restaurants. There is a Tube station nearby. There are several museums in walking distance as well. This was our second stay at the Ampersand Hotel and I won't hesitate to stay here again!!",5,2016,07,05
129,London Hotel,"Overall is good.  I will recommend it to my friends.  But I will tell them not to book the type of room I stayed, as it's really way too small, especially if you have a big luggage.  Otherwise, everything else is good.",4,2016,07,04
129,Definitely 5 star üëç,Stayed here July 2014.  Beautiful hotel.  Super luxury. Great location.  Worth the extra money.  Didn't have any noise issues with underground whatsoever.  Close to everything. Also stayed at Washington Mayfair this trip but the Ampersand pips it at the post. ,5,2016,07,04
129,Great English Boutique Hotel with fantastic location,"Beautiful hotel with very nice staff in an unbeatable location. 
Rooms are expensive, but have good size and are very nicely decorated. 
Bed was comfortable, however you could hear and feel the tube running early in the morning (i had a 4th floor room, so can't imagine how the lower ones felt it).
I would definitely come back. ",4,2016,07,04
129,Nice Boutique Hotel,"Great location within walking distance to the tube. The hotel is very charming and the decor is beautiful. The front desk reception is very knowledgable and were very helpful in getting us tickets for the double decker bus, as a matter of fact one of the stops is right in front of he hotel. It is within walking distance to Harrahs and lots of restaurants. The neighborhood is very safe. Our room was spacious and clean, the bed was comfy. My only complaint is the location of our room...it was very noisy, our view being that if some sort of heating system...it buzzed all night long. Oh also, the lights in the room were controlled by a single controller which we never really figured out. There is a Chinese restaurant accross the street that I highly recommend...it was very authentic. They also serve an assortment of teas and pastries in their lobby that are delicious. I would return again. ",4,2016,07,03
129,South Kensington stay,"Excellent hotel.  Great Location, close to south Kensington tube station and surrounds by fabulous eating places. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, bedrooms were as described. All in all we were very happy with our stay. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay in London. ",5,2016,06,30
129,A keeper!,"A great hotel in an excellent location. The staff were friendly, polite and very helpful. A lovely bonus was a nespresso coffee machine in the room. The  complimentary wifi and mini bar completed the feeling of being well taken care of. ",5,2016,06,30
129,Lovely stay even though it was a biz trip,Wonderful little chic boutique hotel in heart of south kennsington walking distance from tube. I moved from the Royal Garden Hotel and would highly recommend this boutique hotel if you are looking for a more London experience/,5,2016,06,28
129,Great Trip to London!,The hotel is in a great location--there are plenty of restaurants nearby and the South Kensington tube station is literally across the street. The staff were also incredibly friendly and super helpful about providing restaurants in the area or answering overall questions about London. The rooms/bathroom in the hotel are quite small but are decoratively nicely.,4,2016,06,28
129,5 star comfort with 3 star service ,"
Nicely located hotel and comfortable rooms in this boutique hotel. The restaurant is really interesting with fine small dishes. 
Service needs to improve to match the standard of the hotel. We stayed two days and room was not made despite the turn on service light. Back before lunch, I mentioned it to the staff and ask them to do the room while we were having lunch. Maid was in the middle of cleaning the room when we were back from lunch over one hour later. 
Moreover, the mixer faucet was not working which I asked the staff to fix. Next day, it was still broken with either super cold of super hot water. 
Not one word or one question at check out.
It may be tough to find a good hotel with great service in London. ",3,2016,06,27
129,Still the Best,"I've stayed at the Ampersand five times over the past several years. With so many accolades, I was worried the hotel would become complacent and rest on its laurels: not so! If anything, the Ampersand keeps improving. The staff goes out of their way before you arrive and throughout your stay, making certain your every comfort and request are satisfied. The welcome is always warm, the rooms are handsome, and the bathroom and beds are super comfortable. Apero restaurant serves outstanding cocktails and yummy small plates in a relaxed but chic setting. I love the Ampersand and cannot wait to return!",5,2016,06,27

The breakfast really excellent. The little conference center offers two iMacs, always accessible.",4,2016,06,26
129,An oasis in a busy city,Another stay and another enjoyable experience! Also used the business facilities on this visit and again the organisation and overall experience was excellent. Nothing ever seems to be an issue and the hotel even when busy is always calm.,5,2016,06,26
129,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location","Great boutique hotel, with all amenities, including a chilled drawing room for relaxing, only a stone's throw from South Kenz tube station. Small rooms, but to be expected in this part of the world. Wonderful friendly staff and service, the perfect choice for a slightly posh London location. ",5,2016,06,25
129,Good stay,"Our stay in mid-June was delightful.  The staff were particularly helpful, both with the routine questions about directions to the Underground and the like, but also in sorting out an internet problem for us.  The room was a decent size for London, and very clean.  The bathroom organization was a bit peculiar, but by moving a couple of towels around we did OK with that.  We would certainly return.",4,2016,06,25

129,Hidden jewel.,"Behind the doors of the Ampersand on a bustling street lies an oasis of calm and refinement. You won't be disappointed when you enter the hotel and receive a genuinely warm welcome nor when you arrive in your well appointed room. 
The Drawing Room is cool, chic place for a morning coffee or better still an afternoon tea - the Wimbeldon special is a work of art!",4,2016,06,24
129,Sophisticated and fun,"Excellent location near underground in posh neighborhood.  Bed was incredibly comfortable and staff extremely helpful.  Lots of amenities, including business center and connected to restaurant.  Staff acts as an effective concierge.",5,2016,06,23
129,Fabulous Stay at our favorite London hotel (our 6th time),"This is our 6th time staying at the Ampersand! The service is outstanding, the beds are so comfortable and the heated bathroom floor is extra special. The location is lovely, quiet and very nice, with easy tube access at South Kensington station, museums near by, parks near by and great places to grab a pint or a bite! We love the decor and extra special touches- it's stylish yet comfortable and everyone is welcomed with a smile! Plus they have the best and cutest umbrellas!",5,2016,06,23
129,Beautiful boutique hotel in a perfect location.,"Couldn't fault this hotel, perfect from check-in to check-out. Very comfortable bed, stylish bathroom and lovely common areas with beautiful decor. Very helpful staff too! Would recommend wholeheartedly!",5,2016,06,23
129,London adventure at The Ampersand,"We decided on the Ampersand for a few factors - namely the location being near to the parks and The Natural History Museum and also the excellent reviews it had received. As we were traveling with two young children we wanted somewhere that was easy to get to and also walk to the attractions. The hotel is perfectly situated near to The Underground as well as a plethora of local shops, restaurants and cafe's. 

The hotel is really lovely in the flesh, with some thoughtful design and presentation flourishes that makes it feel like (In my opinion at least) somewhere much more expensive as it is. We opted for the deluxe room which featured possibly the best hotel bed I've ever slept in. In fact, it would have easily accommodated the four of us (admittedly our kids are 4 & 2 so they are pretty compact) The room, whilst not overly big, had everything we needed including a complimentary mini bar and heated floor in the bathroom (always a nice feature)

As it was fathers day I got to enjoy a lovely (and quiet :D ) breakfast of eggs benedict in Apero, the Hotel's mediterranean themed restaurant. The service and quality of food was really top notch - I could have stayed here at least a few more hours reading the paper and enjoying the excellent coffee.

To sum up - I'd highly recommend this gem of a hotel. The staff are really lovely and helpful and couldn't do enough to make sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. We'll definitely be paying a visit to The Ampersand on our next trip to London.

129,A Small Luxury Hotel,"Location, Location, Location! Underground around the corner - A great little Parisian Bakery, PAUL, for coffee & a danish. Just one little flaw for this jewel in that sometimes you can feel the Underground train vibrations. Other than that, it is a perfect hotel",5,2016,06,20
129,EXCELLENT ON ALL LEVELS !,"My partner and I just made a return visit to The Ampersand . As part of a travelling vacation in England , our stay was restricted to only two nights on this occasion . We will be back . The location is perfect for exploring , shopping and for enjoying many of the museums and art-galleries that contribute to London's magnificent reputation . Walking is easy , flat and interesting. The South Kensington Tube Station is just two minutes away . Buses and taxis are all readily available. 
The hand-picked staff make every effort to ensure that your needs are met .Several of them recognised us from our previous visit , and greeted us warmly.
Afternoon tea in the lounge is a relaxing and very pleasant experience . Breakfast on the lower level is a healthy, gourmet delight, accompanied by a worthwhile serving of humour from the staff.
We recall that on our previous visit we mentioned that expanded closet space would be welcome. It appears that everyone listens, because this time our room boasted a much larger space for storing the excessive amount of clothes with which we travel !
Thank you all for that , and for looking after us with genuine warmth. Undoubtedly the owners appreciate that it is the attitude of the staff that creates return guests. Without exception, in our eyes , they all more than fulfilled their duties . We will be back . Thank you all again , Ron and Peter, Port Hope , Ontario, Canada .",5,2016,06,20
129,They Keep it up!,We stay quit a few times  in Ampersand hotel since opening and they maintain a high standard at all time and offer value for money. The staff and management are always helpful no matter what the request may be.,5,2016,06,19
129,Excellent choice,"The location is so perfect.  You can walk to wonderful sites and restaurants.  Lovely for access to Kensington and Hyde Park. 
The hotel is darling. The staff is the best we have ever experienced.  After only a day, we felt we were family and well taken care of.  ",5,2016,06,19
129,Still Top Notch,"Spent a week here in early June. We had connecting rooms, and an extra family member stay with us for part of the trip. Location, amenities, quality of the rooms, linens, toiletries all first rate. The place is a stones throw to the South Kensington station, which services several popular tube lines, including the Piccadilly line from Heathrow. There's a bus stop right outside the door. Plenty of convenient dining, cultural, shopping opportunities right in the neighborhood. This was our second time staying here, first was several years ago. Can't see staying anywhere else. The staff are casual but professional, and can help with anything you need.",5,2016,06,18
129,Amperand South Kensington,Great location - right near the South Kensington tube stop.  Lots of good restaurants and walks in the area. Great service at the hotel - smoothest check in and check out possible.  Plus they made transportation arrangements. Great rooms and beds.,5,2016,06,17
129,Lovely Hotel,"Beautiful hotel and exceptional service.  Rooms are very comfortable.  Staff is amazing and so helpful organizing your travels around London.  Room service is also very good.  It's a little pricey, but the comfy room and staff make up for it.",5,2016,06,16
129,Highly recommended.,"The Ampersand is a great place to stay - friendly and efficient service and the location is excellent particularly for the V&A and the Science and Natural History museums. There is a bus stop at the front door, the tube is a couple of minutes walk. We had a superior room which was very pleasant and very clean. I would definitely go back.",5,2016,06,16
129,Fresh five star in ideal location,"Stayed at the Ampersand for a weekend with my wife. The hotel is immaculately presented and the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel has a quirky feel with bright eclectic furnishings in the dining room/lobby area. The room was smaller than expected (deluxe room) but perfectly laid out with modern bathroom, sofa, stylish decor. Breakfast is a small buffet with great selection along with a-la-carte options. Location was ideal for us; in leafy South Kensington within walking distance of museums, Hyde Park, etc. but also only 100 yards from the tube station with quick access to central London.",5,2016,06,15
129,"Beautiful hotel, great location, fantastic service","Room was beautiful, heated floor in the bathroom, complimentary soft drinks, wondeful restaurant right in the basement. The staff very friendly and helpful, they even stored our rental bicycles for 3 days. This hotel is 100m from the south kensington train station, very convenient.",5,2016,06,12
129,Meets every expectation and more,"Location near tube and museums and Harrods was expected, but the nearby patiseries, restaurants etc were not. Try Jeff de Bruges for excellent chocolates.  Trendy but laid back. The hotel staff went above and beyond with personal service. We had two visits in a week, two nights either end. Both rooms comfy, beautifully apointed and spotless. All luxury products and linens. Restaurant and lounge very good. Again, great service. Thw hotel was completly remodeled a couple of years ago, and is a stunning boutique hotel, with design details throughout. An absolute gem. The only place to stay in this area. Worth every penny, and financially competitive to anything else-- but n8cer.",5,2016,06,12
129,Good location,"Very well placed for South Kensington, Kings road and Sloane Square.
Good places to eat nearby. Hotel room was large with nice on suite. This was a superior room though. Cannot comment on the cheaper rooms. The staff were very friendly and always available. There was a nice lounge to sit and have a coffee, although this was very busy at lunch times. I think it is open to the public. 
At ca. ¬£300 a night I would have expected to receive complimentary coffee in the lounge though. 
Overall very pleased and will stay again",4,2016,06,12
129,"Good location, large room, large bathroom, friendly service - positive surprise!!","Spent here one night. Just 2 minutes walk from SouthKen station, in the middle of a very lively neighborhood, this hotel did surprise me - positively, that is. 

Check-in, despite done at an extremely small counter with only two desk stations available, was very quick and done by a very friendly lady. Porter was available in case of heavy luggage - which I did not have. 

Room 115 is a room facing the street, King-Size Bed, large flat screen, dark carpet, a ""spacious feeling"" of the entire room - all good. Noise from the street does not bother you, unless you open the window. Air conditioning worked fine. 

Bathroom is huge - because suitable for the handicapped guest, open shower with two shower heads, only remark: the sink is too small. Tiles are old, so is the equipment, but all works well. Door-lock from the outside responds to magnetic key card - I don¬¥t like these technical gimmicks, but it worked well. 

Coffee-maker is available in the room, too. WIFI worked without fail. 

Had a late night drink after dinner at the bar downstairs - very friendly service, efficient - no complaints. 

Breakfast in the basement at 15 pounds is limited, but fair and quality is fine. 

Checking-out at noon was as swift as checking in, could store my luggage there for a few hours, so in essence all good. 

Remark: at 8 in the morning some workers started working outside my window - a note by the reception BEFOREHAND would have been nice.",4,2016,06,11
129,Godefroy review,"A fabulous hotel with exquisite interior and service. The hotel seems to have that magic ingredient of unobtrusive yet welcoming and efficient service. The room was perfect, the downstairs tea and coffee room is a must see visit whether you are staying in the hotel or not.",5,2016,06,11
129,Location and Service,Close to Underground and several food options.  Fitness center was clean.  Tea room is over the top. Onsite restaurant is great for small dishes and wines.  Wonderful restaurants to choose from outside the hotel.  Excellent French pastries and coffees right outside hotel.  Fantastic location - will stay here again next trip to London.,5,2016,06,10
129,Bad to Great,"A perfect location, a beautiful hotel (design is serene and exciting at the same time), some great staff persons like Beatrice and Indira. After a tough start, bad room (Suite - wouldn't recommend these rooms) we downgraded to a Deluxe Suite which truly seem to be the best rooms - we loved our room and remainder of the stay for 5 nights.",4,2016,06,10
129,"Friendly helpful staff and beautiful, comfortable hotel!",We stayed at The Ampersand for 8 days. The staff was beyond helpful and friendly. The hotel is posh but comfortable. The beds were wonderful and bathroom floor is heated. Sodas and water complimentary in the room along with wifi. The restaurant in the hotel is a must...the food was outstanding!  The tube stop is literally across the street and museums are truly just a block or 2 away. The location is excellent!  We will definitely stay there again and look forward to it!! ,5,2016,06,09
129,Superb Ampersand,"This was easily the BEST hotel that I have stayed in for a long time. It scores extremely high on cleanliness, comfort, reception, warmth, friendliness, centrality of location, attention to detail and helpfulness towards the guests. The dining experience in her Drawing Room was memorable.",5,2016,06,08
129,Daughter's Birthday,Trip with my Daughter. Wonderful welcome & nice trip to visit London for first time. Everybody was Kind and it was a well place to be cause South Kensington is in the centre of all visits we wanted to do.,4,2016,06,08
129,Cool London,What an excellent location! Funky style hotel with rooms to match. I really enjoyed everything about this hotel. The rooms are clean and cosy with plenty of style. A stones throw from Kensington station made getting around very easy.  Do yourself a favour and escape!,5,2016,06,07
129,Great place to stay in London,"Beautiful and comfortable rooms with free drinks from the in room refrigerator along with free tea and coffee.  Knowledgable staff who were friendly and very helpful.  
Great location close to buses and underground.  Highly recommend!",5,2016,06,06
129,"Good hotel, great location - a few things could make it outstanding","The price was about average for a hotel at this level (somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, in my opinion).    Location is great, right next to the South Kensington tube and a number of good restaurants.  Here are my pro's and con's:
PROS:
* Good and friendly service
* Location, location, location
* Modern bathrooms
* Quiet (double windows)
* Small, but comfortable rooms, with air conditioning that works
CONS:
* Loud, creaky floors - worse than Bailey's Hotel even!  This didn't bother us on the top floor, but who knows about the ones below.  You'd think in the renovation that they would have addressed this.
* Breakfast only offered for 1 hour (10am-11am) on Sunday? - maybe I misheard!
* There should be baffles to keep the air conditioning from blowing right at the head of the bed.
* Tiny room, but I guess you're paying for S Kens location",4,2016,06,06
129,Amspersand,"Excellent service, would stay here again anytime and recommend it , staff were very welcoming, efficient and helpful,  food excellent was excellent if an little pricy ..  bed was comfy  rooms clean, facilities in the room very good",5,2016,06,06
129,A real find in London,"This boutique hotel superbly located in South Kensington wins on all levels.    Up to the minute rooms, a wonderful brasserie, a lounge in which to relax all day and most of all the staff - each of whom is delightful, friendly and obviously keen to be help.    The area affords many opportunities to try restaurants - apart from the hotel's own brasserie - and with the Tube and busses only metres away, getting around London is easy.",5,2016,06,05
129,Delightful,"This is a lovely boutique hotel across the road from South Kensington station. The hotel is spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. It is run by a professional, courteous and helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant offered a variety of fresh foods prepared in an imaginative and tantalising way. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ampersand. They made my first visit to London in 40 years a truly memorable one.",5,2016,06,05
129,Lovely Hotel - unsure if it's a 5*,"We only stayed for the one night in the Ampersand so more time may have convinced me this is a 5* hotel. We stayed in an executive double and the bed was huge and comfy. The room whilst not being that big had most things you would expect but I personally thought it lacked that 5* flare. Free mini bar (but no alcohol...is that a bar?) big TV with sports channels (but no on demand films).  The WiFi was an open network which I liked, no faffing with passwords. No annoying staff knocking on the door before the 12 o'clock check out. The service on arrival was ok but again lacked that charm that really high quality places somehow foster.

We were surprised (considering the price) there was no breakfast included but having had a relaxing morning we ventured to Apero for brunch. Unfortunately brunch is only on weekends (which it didn't say on any of the promo material) anyway we decided to go for lunch instead. Food was inconsistent. The Croquettas were average but the sauce was unfortunately unpleasant. However the meatballs were divine. My partner had the meat platter and Sea bass which was tasty and surprisingly on the 2 courses for ¬£12 special menu and was probably a much better option than my 2 courses which were double the price. The restaurant was nicely decorated but the basement nature made it a less attractive space than the 'drawing room' on the ground floor where you can get tea and coffee and lite bites.

The location of the hotel is great and right by the tube. There are also lots of small good value restaurants in the area - 5 mins away. The building's facade is beautiful and really stands out.

Overall, like my title states, this is a lovely hotel with many strengths but the big price tag creates big expectations and for me the Ampersand has a 4* feel.",4,2016,06,04
129,Wonderful five days,"Location perfect fot Royal Albert hall . V and A , and Chelsea flower show. Staff  very friendly also helpful . Room was 4 star , spotless too , all you would want in the bathroom . Beautifully decorated entrance the day we left for Chelsea .",5,2016,06,01
129,Still on our vacation,"We have been here for 5 nights and have 5 nights to go!!!  Our stay is fantastic so far and dinner tonight in the hotel restaurant ""Apero"" was terrific. The room and staff have been top notch so far and we expect the 2nd half of our stay to be just as wonderful as the first half.  ",5,2016,05,31
129,Consistently good,"My third stay so I can probably call myself a regular! This was my smallest room yet and a bit of a squeeze to be honest but everything in the room is in the right place so I managed perfectly well for my one night here. This hotel has so many good qualities and represents real value in an expensive city. Location is great opposite South Kensington tube station and in walking distance to shops, restaurants, museums and the Royal Albert Hall (I attended a concert on the night of my stay). Prices of the 'extras' are reasonable- no silly additional charges, room service breakfast cost about ¬£10, was of excellent quality and arrived 15 minutes after I ordered it. Tea and cake in the pretty lounge is no more expensive than in a local cafe. Tea/coffee and complimentary fruit juices are available in the room, toiletries are Miller Harris, towels are fluffy and the beds are fab. Staff are helpful and it's just a nice place to be. I'd happily stay here a week. Hard to beat in my view....",5,2016,05,30
129,Good choice in Kensington,"Very good location if you are after Imperial College, Victoria&Albert or Natural History Museum. Stone throw from South Kensington tube station. Very nice athmosphere, excellent service. Nice room, spacious shower, good bed and very good wifi. Delicious breakfast. I can warmly recommend it!",4,2016,05,29
129,The best experience in South Kensington,"I stayed with my wife at the Ampersand hotel for a couple of day. It's the best experience we've ever had in South Kensington. A very cosy hotel, with wonderful and pleasant room and an excellent service. And the position is perfect, with the tube and the  buses so close.",5,2016,05,28
129,Very Satisfied Guest,"The staff are consistently friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and go out of their way to ensure our stay is comfortable.  This is my sixth stay with hotel, I am glad to see the same friendly faces and their enthusiastic attitude towards providing a high standard of service.  This is appreciated for visitors to London.",5,2016,05,28
129,Mother and daughter meet up,"Great position for an Albert hall event,restaurant fantastic food value and service- try the set ¬£30 sharing menu and you'll be amazed. Beds huge and comfy and you are certainly paying that bit extra. If only it was around ¬£250 not ¬£300 I would be there more often . Thanks",5,2016,05,27
129,South Kensington Gem,"Fantastic hotel in a central location with all the facilities you need.
Cool vibe to this place from the staff in jeans and waistcoats to the gorgeous rooms with complimentary mini bar.
The hotel is very quiet despite it's central location and road position. ( I was on level 1 road side)
They don't have annoying Service knocking at doors to clean rooms or service the rooms or clattering around the corridor outside while you're trying to sleep! It is all taken care of while you're out and no matter what time you leave.
Sumptuous beds and beautiful linen in immaculately kept rooms.
Helpful staff from reception to the guys on the door.
Great wifi at no charge.
Have gladly dumped the overpriced Sofitel St james to stay here in future!",5,2016,05,27
129,Always excellent,"This is the third time I've stayed here and it's always a great experience. Single rooms are a bit small but well equipped and are perfectly adequate for a couple of nights. I've also been here as a couple and their larger rooms are excellent. The level of cleanliness is very high throughout. Friendly, efficient staff and a good location make it a perfect choice. ",5,2016,05,26
129,Amazing location with personalized attention and excellent rooms and service,"I have stayed at The Ampersand 6 times and 3 of these were for 7 nights. It is an exceptional experience for a London stay full of comfort, pampering and superior service. Cannot recommend this boutique luxury hotel highly enough!! ",5,2016,05,25
129,Expectations exceeded,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I think that to date, I have never had such a small gap between expectations and reality. I would go so far as to say our expectations were exceeded. The room was lovely, as was the decor and ambiance throughout the hotel. Service impeccable and food of a high standard. ",5,2016,05,25
129,My new favourite hotel,"So many things about this hotel make me want to stay there again, most particularly the service which was friendly, helpful and attention without being invasive. The room had everything you would want in a room, the bed was comfortable, it was clean, and the shower was lovely. My excitement at the free minibar was tempered when I found there was only coke, water,fruit juice and milk (yes real milk for your coffee/tea!), but even this is much superior to other hotels in the capital. Free wifi, was speedy and reliable.
Breakfast was excellent, with a wide choice of the usual suspects and others such as spinach and feta croissants. How I appreciated our waiter remembering my order for breakfast the following day.
Yes some things could have been better, the hair dryer malfunctioned, and the bathroom was a tiny bit on the bijou side, (not being the slimmest, i found negotiating the door slightly challenging, but managed it without significant mishap!). Am only sorry I didn't have time to try afternoon tea.",5,2016,05,24
129,Lovely hotel in a great location,Very friendly and efficient service. Room (executive) are spotless with thoughtful touches like free minbar (soft drinks) and real coffe and fresh milk. Bed really comfortable and despite central location room was quiet. Perfect location for museums and quick stroll to shops. Will definitely visit again ,5,2016,05,23
129,Ampersand,Lovely hotel and great location for South Kensington tube station etc. The staff are fantastic. Restaurant is very good. The rooms we had small were very small with no room whatsoever to move around or unpack clothes.,4,2016,05,22
129,excellent hotel with personal service,"We have spent a weekend in a deluxe room taking the offer:  stay three nights-pay for two: 
perfect location near tube but silent in the night; selected ambiance and room interiors, everything held perfect clean; very helpful staff, taking breakfast is recommendable; good value ",5,2016,05,22
129,Close to everything!,"The Ampersand Hotel is a first-class boutique hotel.  The bedrooms are small but efficient, with high tech features like temperature and lighting controls, and electronic ""Do not disturb"" and room maintenance icons that can be switched on or off from inside the room (and are displayed outside in the hallway).  The hotel supplies power adapters, hair dryer, the regular complimentary sundry items, coffee press & coffee, and tea.  The refrigerator is stocked with complimentary milk, orange and apple juices, sparkling and ""still"" water.  The beds and pillows are SO comfy!  The bathrooms are roomy & spotless with state of the art heated tiles (nice!).  Rooms were spotless, service was excellent, employees were very courteous and accommodating.  Downstairs is a wonderful seating area in the lobby for gathering with your party, and the -1 floor has a workout room and computers with a printer so you can check in for flights and print boarding passes.  
The Drawing Room at the lobby-level is a very comfy place to have morning coffee/tea, breakfast/lunch/dinner/afternoon tea, read the newspaper, or just flop on a couch and recover from your day with something refreshing.  Downstairs is the Apero where we had a dinner and a couple of breakfasts...very good place to eat:) 
The location is a block from the tube - which takes you everywhere in London and is very easy to use...get an ""Oyster"" card for the duration of your stay to cruise in and out of the Underground seamlessly!  The card is also good for buses and (I think) the train.  Museums, Galleries, House Tours, Hyde Park, and restaurants are within walking distance or a short ride on the Underground.  Once you're familiar with how the ""tube"" (Underground) works, London is at your beck' and call!  Transportation is so easy in London - be it by boat, train, bus, or tube!
Fantastic Experience!",5,2016,05,21
129,Great space in South Kensington,"We booked a couple of rooms as a recovery day on a recent trip to Europe -  mostly for the kids but for the parents as well! The Ampersand was a great spot - close to the Natural History Museum, Harrods, Selfridges and lots of other great attractions which helped to get the kids on Europe time and keep them awake to minimize jet lag!
Staff were great - after seeing all of us and how much stuff we had they moved us to a larger room and we crashed on a very comfortable bed! The breakfast downstairs was great as well as the first floor lounge - definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2016,05,21
129,A night away from home,"We live in London but I booked this hotel for the night for my husbands 30th birthday. It's a beautifully boutique hotel with really spacious rooms. I booked the deluxe studio and it was really big and had a lovely little Victorian bathtub in the room which was the perfect!

The breakfast at the Apero restaurant was absolutely delicious! The food was amazing! I would definitely go back here! ",5,2016,05,21
129,Not god,"I and my wife were in room # 9 in their hotel, there was very much food smell from the kitchen so we had to change our clothes because of food odor, we took detet up personel at the hotel but it was not done anything with there, they said that technicians will look at this, but it was not done anything until we leave the hotel, I think this is not good when you have a 5 star hotel",1,2016,05,21
129,Worth returning to again... and again,"I've stayed at the Ampersand Hotel 3 times, and I hope that there will be many more stays in the future.  The things I love about this elegant, warm and comfortable hotel include the great reservation experience which adds to your anticipation of a great stay before you even arrive!  A warm welcome upon check in, I loved that I was acknowledged as a returning guest, how lovely is that!  Oh,the joy of heated floors in the bathroom, the blissful comfort of the marshmallow soft beds and the great room service that allows you to discuss your tastes and have fabulous recommendations for food and wine when you just need an evening resting in the lovely rooms.  Then of course there is the delightful breakfast in Apero, perfect for early business meetings, the proximity to the super museums and just over the road from The Tube, everything adds up to a really super place to stay for a very good price, whether for pleasure or business.",4,2016,05,21
129,BEST HOTEL EVER,"This hotel is simply fantastic. The room (a suite) was huge, with a gorgeous deep clawfoot tub, and a cute rubber ducky included. If you forgot anything to bring, they have it! The minibar comes stocked with free goodies, and the Nespresso machine is perfection. To top it off the location couldn't be better and the hotel is beautiful. STEPS away from cafes, and shops. I will be back. Thank you Ampersand!",5,2016,05,20
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Great location, wonderful staff, very comfortable rooms.  The front desk was very helpful in advising, and we look forward to returning on an annual basis.  Museums, galleries, gardens, and the Tube only steps away.",5,2016,05,20
129,Excellent business meeting,"Third time here, second time as organiser.  Lovely hotel, fab meeting rooms conducive to good meetings. Most people loved their rooms but some don't have baths.  Only gripe - second day... the 'buzzer' wasn't there and the soft drink cabinet was locked... and no-one fixed it. Apart from that all perfect, we'll be back.",4,2016,05,19
129,"Great location, service and food!","Spent five nights here on business and it is always a pleasure to be in London especially in a stylish, modern hotel with terrific style, helpful and caring European staff (mostly Italian), nice room with high ceilings, small but updated bathroom, meeting rooms (very handy) and great food. Best breakfast!   2 min walk to South Kensington tube stop.  Center of everything.  ",5,2016,05,19
129,Superb Service,"Loved the Ampersand.  But especially the service of the staff.  From a friendly greeting every morning and every return, to running into the street to get us a cab, to fancy cocktails, to excellent dinner and transportation recommendations--everything was done with a smile and warmth of character.  We especially appreciated the great assistance from Beatrice. The rooms were very clean, and the hotel was well appointed.  Another of the most high ranking positives was the location.  Being right across from a Tube station made getting around so easy.  Great place to stay.  ",5,2016,05,19
129,Good Stay in a Handy Location,"Enjoyed our stay, location is good, staff friendly and knowledgeable, restaurant very goo, and room was  clean tidy and comfortable. Altogether satisfactory, would not hesitate to go again, or to recommend.",5,2016,05,19
129,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"A beautiful hotel, with stunning decor. It was very quiet and the beds were incredibly comfortable.
The heated floor in the bathroom, free mini bar, service and position made the Ampersand one of the best hotels I have stayed in.",5,2016,05,19
129,Lovely comfortable bed,"Lovely room with big very comfortable bed, fabulous shower room everything was just perfect.  Only one slight problem, not really anywhere to do make up and hair, there was a hairdryer but no dressing table with a plug to use had to use the bedside plug which was ok but no mirror to hand.  Had a first class meal in the hotel, but lots of places to eat nearby.  We had breakfast in Murials  Kitchen just 100 yards from the hotel  which is well worth a visit.",5,2016,05,18
129,Love it!,"The Ampersand Hotel is a gem hidden in South Kensington. Walking distance from the South Kensington Tube station and surrounded by excellent dining options. 
I traveled with my coworker (we're girls) and they accommodated us with two separate beds (two twin beds next to each other). 
Though I'll just suggest to those traveling with their non-SO that it's probably better to just take the king bed instead of the ""two twin beds"" because the twin beds are just smashed next to eachother. It's better to just get the kind bed and put a little pillow divider between the two of you :) 

Other than that, I had the most comfortable stay.

129,Very nice hotel,"The overall experience was very good. 
Great location, super close to South Ken tube station. 
The room was fairly large (for London‚Äôs standards) and very nicely appointed. Good bed, superb bed linen and towels. Miller Harris toiletries (which I do not particularly like).  Coffee/tea machine (good selection of teas and coffees), complimentary water (sparkling and still) in the fridge. You can hear the street, you can feel the vibrations from the undergrounds every time a train passes, and we could hear the guests in the room above us when they walk. The third bed (for my son) was far too soft (not at all comfortable). 
The lobby area is small, but functional. Afternoon tea at the Drawing Rooms not special and quite overrated. 
All staff were extremely polite and efficient.",4,2016,05,18
129,South Kensington Gem,"Ampersand is conveniently located to the tube as well as the museums and Kensington Garden. There are multiple nearby choices for eating, both take away and restaurants. I was in  a comfortable, quiet suite  on third floor. This was my second visit and staff welcomed me back.",5,2016,05,17
129,perfect ,"My favorite hotel ever. Always stay here and don't want to change. Decoration in the room, stuff qualification, everything is at the highest level. Nothing is missed. Apero restaurant is good for any meal of the day. Perfect place for perfect stay London.  ",5,2016,05,17
129,Ampersand stay,"Very good hotel, excellent beds and pillows.   In room service is also excellent, rapid, and not costing a fortune.  Next time we really want to try out the breakfast we are sure it must be worthwhile.  Client is king.",4,2016,05,17
129,Wonderful experience,"Found a deal on Trip Advisor and got a great price. Small room but very clean and stylish. Great location - close to museums, Harrods, across the street from bus and underground. Staff was very friendly and accommodating when subway workers went on strike for a day. Easy and inexpensive ride via subway to the airport.",4,2016,05,16
129,Wonderful hotel for our family vacation in London,What a beautiful hotel in the heart of South Kensington!  The hotel is a hundred yards from the Tube station.  Makes it so convenient to get to all the destinations we went to on our trip.  The rooms were quite lovely as is the rest of the hotel.  The hotel staff is very attentive and will assist with everything we needed.  The bar at this hotel had great service and Joseph and Luka took great care to see that we were well taken care of while in their bar!  We will definitely stay here again!  Thank you Ampersand Hotel for a wonderful stay during our trip to London! ,5,2016,05,13
129,Nice Hotel!,"Good location, near transport restaurants gallery and shops. Very nice and helpfull staff.
We love the d√©coration chic & cosy. We choose a little room but it was very confortable with all amenities. the breakfast was also good. 
",5,2016,05,12
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Beautiful, nice breakfast, clean, very quiet, create stuff in reception and restaurant; great location right close to restaurants, museums, park and metro. Interior design was unique and great stay for couples.",5,2016,05,12
129,Great find in South Ken,"This hotel is in an ideal location two minutes from South Ken, Museums, 5 minutes to Harrods. 

It's staffing is slightly weird but they get away with it because staff are charming.  

Unexpectedly good restaurant in a cellar like restaurant with a ""tapas"" style interesting menu. 

Really good find...",5,2016,05,11
129,The best hotel I've ever stayed at,"Let me preface this review by saying that I've stayed at all manner of 5 star hotels - Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, Shangri La, Waldorf, as well as your garden variety Marriots, Hiltons, Renaissances.

This is by far the best hotel I have ever been in.  Why? Because the staff were fantastic and the unexpected extras were incredible (free mini bar replenished every night???? who does that???) We stayed 4 nights with my wife and little toddler and can't say enough about how much that means to us.  My daughter needed milk, my wife needed Coke, and I needed Diet Coke (all in minibar).  The convenience of having it available is fantastic.  This is in sharp contrast to the Renaissance Amsterdam that charged us $8 for a glass of milk delivered to our room that was not even 5 ounces.

The location is fantastic, half a block away from the South Kensington stop.  We took the Gatwick express from the airport to Victoria and switched to the Circle/District to South Kensington.  The rooms are small but par for the course in Europe.  Do try Moti Mahal indian restaurant about 2 blocks away.  Their food is so good we had it two nights in a row.  And they're open late.  The Ampersand was very well designed and we loved the lounge area.  For the rest of our 3 week trip, my 3-year old kept talking about the hotel with the little birdie in a teacup! It was her favorite hotel.

I'll always stay here every time I'm in London.",5,2016,05,11
129,"Good service, Good staff, Good location","I stayed in for a few nights in this hotel when I stayed in London to explore the city. I chose this hotel because it's just one train line (Picadilly) away from Heathrow airport, and is located 15 - 20 minutes away from the famous tourist sites. The area in which the hotel is located is also clean and safe. Would definitely book again in this hotel in the future.",5,2016,05,11
129,Great location. Tiny room. ,"Just checked out and wanted to put up a quick review. I stayed two nights. 

The location of the hotel is great - neighborhood, close to tube, etc. 

The major disappointment was the size of the room - smallest I'd ever been in. I booked as a single but it wasn't even big enough for one person. 

I asked to switch but due to an early arrival nothing else was ready.  So bonus points for having a room ready at 8am but the short term win turned into an annoying stay. 

Having to move furniture or climb over the bed to be able to move around room, storing luggage on the desk since there is no room for it otherwise, having a tiny closet that isn't long enough for shirts to hang without resting on the (complimentary) tea set, etc. 

Everything else about the hotel seemed perfectly fine. I ate at Apero and it was good (albeit oddly empty on a Monday night at 7:30). 

Staff was ok. 

Biggest takeaway - don't book room 418!!",3,2016,05,11
129,A gem in South Kensington,"The location is fantastic - in the heart of South Kensington, close to museums and parks. The staff are brilliant and the rooms are stylish and comfortable. Apero is great for drinks in the evening (complimentary champagne if you book through Mr and Mrs Smith), and the Sunday brunch is divine. Afternoon tea in the Drawing Room is a must! ",4,2016,05,10
129,Perfect stay in London,"We stood in the Ampersand as a family with two Kids for 3 nights. we booked 2 interconnecting rooms which was perfect for us. Lovely staff, always helpful and friendly. Loved the breakfast.
The location, next to South Kensington Subway is perfect - Hyde Park and the Museums are a short walk away. Returning to London, we definitely would choose the Ampersand again. 
",5,2016,05,10
129,Exceptional service,"What a wonderful stay I had.  Exceptional service and that makes a huge difference.  It was my birthday and they went above and beyond in terms of the service they provided.  Huge comfy bed, rain fall shower and the food in the restaurant was exception compared to chain hotels. ",5,2016,05,09
129,Excellent all round especially customer service,"Really great hotel with wonderful staff and great rooms. Gym is great and bar is intimate. Quite pricey but I guess it is London. Really  enjoyed our stay. GAmes room available and main reception areas are large and spacious. You could argue decor is ott but it works

very good

enjoyed",5,2016,05,08
129,Small room but excellent location,Staff were attentive however the room and bathroom were a little small for two people. The location is extremely convinent and just right opposite the South Kensington underground station. I would consider to come back if I stay at the suite.,4,2016,05,08
129,Another lovely stay,"Hotel continues to impress. Very clean, nice staff, excellent breakfast, great location. Rooms are definitely small, but very well appointed. There are some rooms on the ground floor, off the lobby, which I do not like. Staff was able to move me to another room.",5,2016,05,08
129,"Great location, excellent service.","I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Underground station in South Kensington. The hotel is very well maintained with attentive, well trained staff. Service in the restaurant and bar is also very good. My only complaint is that even by London standards the hotel room was very small. It had probably the fastest internet I have had in a hotel.",4,2016,05,03
129,Ampersand  - a good choice,"Overall, this was a lovely stay in a clean, welcoming hotel. The location is simply superb for the museums and galleries of London, transport and general pootling about. The staff are excellent, our only negative comment being how long it took for drink to arrive. Breakfast is on the pricey side, but well done and again, very good staff. You can get better value for money, but you'd be hard pressed to get a better location or nicer staff.",4,2016,05,03
129,One word.....'Amazing',"Definitely one of the best hotels we've stayed at in London. Not only was it beautifully decorated it was immaculate throughout. The Drawing Room is outstanding, we enjoyed a lovely lazy brunch there one morning. 

The room was also very spacious for central London and the bed was soooooo comfy! There was also a complimentary mini bar, heated flooring in the bathroom, luxury toiletries and lots of touch screen blue gadgety light and air con controls :) 

The location was excellent, South Ken tube station was just over the road as well as bars and restaurants within walking distance, would recommend Bumkins for dinner, lovely atmosphere, good wine and great food. 

We had such a fantastic weekend we will definitely stay again soon, can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

There wasn't anything we didn't like. Although, we did have an unexpected window cleaner peer through our third floor room one morning, could have been quite embarrassing, a heads up may have been good! Other than that we can't fault one single thing 5* luxury boutique at its best!
",5,2016,05,02
129,excellent experience!,"gorgeous hotel, lovely staff.  excellent value. we loved it  and will definitely be back.  would be great for work our play in the area.  stylish but friendly.  please don't raise your prices even though you could!",5,2016,05,02
129,An Exceptional Stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Ampersand during our honeymoon and it was incredible! There were petit fours awaiting us upon our arrival and the staff was friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable, the hotel charming, and our stay was absolutely perfect. We can't wait to go back!",5,2016,05,02
129,Fantastic Hotel Near Museums,"Outstanding on all levels from free upgrade, to luxury bed, to exceptional staff to the most delicious full spread freshly made breakfast.  Couldn't recommend this more highly.  Outstanding spot across from the South Ken tube station and near great museums and Hyde Park!",5,2016,05,02
129,Boutique service,"The staff were, without exception, gracious and helpful.  Steps away from the South Kensington station made it convenient.  Around the corner were charming cafes and  a great market shop. Rooms were very clean and there was evening turn down service that refreshed the room beautifully.  ",5,2016,05,02
129,Highly recommended ,"Well what can i say ... Quirky / quaint  , excellent service , friendly and would most definitely come back again. Our room was a little smaller than i would have hoped for an upgrade ... But great gadgets, very comfortable bed, complimentary mini bar and best of all ... Real milk for my tea / coffee. 
Whilst breakfast included only a continental ... For a small charge you could have a cooked breakfast .. Wow one of the best i have ever had .... And the coffee i can still savour in my mouth and hour later ! ",5,2016,05,02
129,Beautiful rooms and great location,We couldn't have been more pleased with the Ampersand. It is very close to the South Kensington tube station which is convenient coming in from Heathrow and for easy access around the city. The rooms are lovely and we especially appreciated the heated floor in the bathroom. The common areas in the hotel are attractive and the service is good but not intrusive. I would definitely stay here again. For once the photos and the reviews were completely representative of the reality!,5,2016,05,01
129,"Cool design, great location, tiny rooms and average service","The good, The hotel is new and the rooms are very elegantly and creatively designed, and well refurbished, that is a great plus for most hotels in London. The location is fantastic 2 minutes walk from South Kensington. 
The bad, Rooms are tiny, you can hadrly walk in the room if you have a small suitcase like me, and I don't want to imagine if you have a large one. The desk where I wanted to work could barely host my laptop after moving every other stuff there over the bed. I ordered a sandwich and I was forced to eat on the bed because it was the only place left. Embarrassingly small.
Service is average, not from the heart. 
There are much better places nearby for the same price like Number Sixteen just across two roads.",3,2016,05,01
129,"Nice Room, Staff and Food‚Ä¶..But Avoid Noisy Room!","Room was very nicely furnished and the staff great.
We had a fantastic tapas meal in the restaurant.
The only drawback was our room on the ground floor was too noisy! The water pipes from next door/above could be heard constantly from early in the morning. Also noise and talking from staff and customers at reception did not help with a lie in!",4,2016,05,01
129,Very good,"Would definitely recommend to others. Can't wait to visit again! Great location, professional staff that we're all very helpful and central location. 
Could use more closet space. A little difficult to get the room cool enough, but overall a great experience ",5,2016,04,29
129,Decent hotel,Arrived for one evening and was shown to a very small room on he ground floor (I have a preference not to be on the ground floor) so I asked to upgrade for more space and a higher floor. The staff were accommodating and whilst the room was still a touch small it had everything I needed. Mini bar had soft drinks only but all complimentary which is a nice touch and the breakfast was very nice. Solid hotel in a good location.,4,2016,04,28
129,Our Stay at The Ampersand Hotel,"We loved the workout room.  The Location was excellent.  Many restaurants in the area, reasonably priced.  The staff was outstanding. we needed 2 rooms and were able to get adjoining rooms.  I would strongly recommend to families. ",5,2016,04,27
129,A nice weekend in London,Well located friendly staff good amenities in the heart of South Kensington. Rooms were a bit small but comfortable and full of great amenities. Love the little rubber duck in the shower too. Tons of restaurants and stores in the area 30 secs to the Tube too,5,2016,04,27
129,"Classy chic, comfortable, and convienient","Was perfect location to start our London vacation.  Would be good for a business stay as well.  Proximity to south Kensington could not have been better.  Would definitely recommend and stay there again myself.

 ",5,2016,04,27
129,Excellent service,"Stayed once again at the Ampersand, the staff were great and couldn't do enough for us. I had a number of meetings and the location and facilities were just perfect for that, we were able to slip away with a coffee and cake! I was initially there for business related matters but my wife joined for the weekend. The hotel fits well in both camps.",5,2016,04,27
129,great place and what a fab location,"get off the tube at south kensington and your there, what a brilliant location , always buzzing around south kensington , bars and places to eat , this was the first time i have stayed here and i will be staying again ,i stayed in a studio suite which was immaculate , great tasteful room , was shown up to the room and shown controls .
i eat downstairs in the basement and the food was really good casual atmosphere and good service to go with that , great reception staff well done , also so friendly , i will be staying again , but its the location that is brilliant , for me to get everywhere from the hotel ,",5,2016,04,26
129,Charming luxury in South Kensington,The Ampersand hotel is lovely. The rooms are clean and well decorated. The overall appearance is charming. The staff were friendly and went out of their way to provide excellent service. We were very happy with our stay.,5,2016,04,26
129,fine hotel with a wonderful secret in the basement,Really liked the hotel. Fresh design and friendly and good service at all time. The area has many offers of both fine end less expensiv dining. We tested the Apero restaurant in the basement. Wow for excellent food and service a saturday evening. loved the mediterranean crossover Kitchen.,4,2016,04,25
129,"Love this hotel, would definitely go back","This hotel has some of the warmest, efficient staff & is new, very clean and room service is excellent and fast! Have been there twice and would definitely go again. Love that it is within walking distance to Hyde Park and also Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Sloane Street etc In the immediate neighborhood there is Starbucks, adorable cafes and shops. Super-close to Metro.",5,2016,04,25
129,Gorgeous Hotel,We stayed at this lovely hotel one weekend.  From the moment we arrived they could not have been more helpful.  Our room was gorgeous as was the bathroom.  It was quiet and the beds were so comfortable.  Coffee and Afternoon tea were served in a beautifully appointed room.   Supper downstairs was cosy with delicious food.  A very charming hotel run by very charming staff.  Thank you.,5,2016,04,25
129,A good 4 star perhaps,"I booked this hotel by mistake and only realised on arrival. Not what I had expected but that was my fault. The location is fantastic in South Kensington. You could not get closer to the Tube without the noise. 

Every single one of the staff in the hotel were fantastic, no exceptions. We were upgraded to a superior room from a double on arrival which was a really good start. They said the superior room was ""bigger"" and honestly it was really small. You would open a bathroom door and could not stand in front of a closet or open a closet door at the same time.

The level of d√©cor is very nice. Looks recently refurbished and seems very well maintained. The climate control in our room would not adjust or stay at the temperature we wanted- it always seemed too hot. We could not turn off the underfloor heating in the bathroom so it seemed like you would break into a sweat when getting ready after having had a shower. Windows had to stay open the entire time.

Bar and restaurant in the basement were very good. I loved the location but I would rather have spent ¬£100 more for another hotel with bigger rooms and closer to 5 star.",4,2016,04,25
129,Strike up the Band for The Ampersand,"The other week, in London, I had three consecutive days of private business to attend to - all in the littoral of Chelsea Bridge. Having researched candidate hotels in the broad geographical area, I figured that South Kensington would prove to be the location of choice. Accordingly, I homed-in on a boutique property, The Ampersand:   it came up trumps - on all fronts. A daily walk of some 1.5 miles each way, from hotel to meetings, had all sorts of obvious benefits - not least some world class window shopping and head clearing.

I had pre-booked & registered via the hotel's website and, on arrival, this made for a quick and easy check-in ... to Room 402 ... one of a little over 100. Modern/chic in style, this Deluxe Double was situated to the rear of this late 19th/early 20th Century town house and thus, was particularly quiet. (Previous occupants may have considered it to be a bit on the small side for a double but for my single occupancy, it was perfect). Extremely well designed with a high-class fit-out. Tremendous attention to detail, exampled by: the weighty, stainless steel, door levers to the solid & thick doors both to and within the room; state-of-the art wall-mounted television screen; free Wi-Fi and (soft) drinks mini bar which was re-stocked daily; in-room Internet access; up-market tea & coffee making facilities; Miller Harris bathroom  amenities. The key-card, touch- entry system to the room, worked brilliantly - on each and every occasion.  

On investigating the property's variety of public rooms and niche areas, I was hugely impressed with each and every one of them. The Drawing Room, for instance, on the Harrington Road side, is large, bright, comfortable, and ideal for chilling-out & for rendezvousing with visitors.

The ""Apero"" bar/brasserie, at lower ground floor level, both  harmonises and complements the mainstream operation. (I have reviewed this separately).  

Everything at this place works like a 'well-oiled machine' and staff, to a person, are genuinely happy to see and to help you. I never came across anyone from House Keeping but when I returned to my room, early each evening, it had been serviced impeccably with enormous attention-to-detail:   phenomenal  continuity.

The Ampersand is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World consortium and that's just what it is.  As far as I can fathom, ownership is something of a mystery.
Whoever it is, they certainly maintain a low profile.         

My meetings extended for two more days and frankly, it was a bonus to stay on at
The Ampersand. From here on in, it will be my 'London home away from home'.",5,2016,04,25
129,"Convenient, luxurious, well priced",Can't believe we've never stayed at this hotel before. So well priced compared to other luxury hotels in London. Staff amazingly cheerful and polite. Room absolutely spotless and extremely smart. Bathroom enormous and wonderful shower. Apero was great for dinner and the breakfast they put on was also fab. Can't recommend it highly enough!,5,2016,04,25
129,Great location!,"The stay was great n staff were friendly n helpful. The location was great, walking distance to V&A and National history museum n the underground. Nice and safe neighborhood. The only thing was that the bed was a little too soft for us and we had to request for toothbrush n tooth paste.",4,2016,04,25
129,"Beautiful, funky hotel - great service","We stayed here for a friend's wedding in Oct, 2014, and were very pleased with all the hotel had to offer.

Our suite was beautiful and very nicely decorated.  Bathroom was on the smaller side but it's London and that's what we expected in a big city.

We had breakfast daily in the downstairs restaurant and it was great.  We also had cocktails there a few evenings and thought the service and drinks were great.

Location in South Kensington is very handy.  It's close to the Tube station and within walking distance (20 mins) of Harrods and other shops.

We had an overnight flight and they weren't able to accommodate an early check-in which wasn't a surprise as it's always hit or miss at any hotel.  

We would definitely stay here again when/if our travels bring us to London!",5,2016,04,24
129,"Nice hotel, close to the tube and many attractions","My Husband and I stayed in a deluxe double room for 2 nights in November 2015. We were attending a performance at the Royal Albert hall, which is an easy 10 minute walk away.

Our room was perfectly adequate and I loved all the unique design touches around the communal spaces. 

The hotel is literally a stone's throw from South Kensington station and there are plenty of decent places to eat along Fulham Rd. 

Would return if in the area.",4,2016,04,22
129,"Top level service, great location, beautiful property","Such a warm welcome upon arrival, and then every time we passed reception thereafter.  Each and every member of staff, all levels and all roles, stopped what they were doing to sincerely greet us each time we passed - - which is impressive.  This is a very beautiful property with upgraded amenities in the rooms (so upgraded, that figuring out how to work the lights on the first night was comedy!).  Understand that the rooms are small, just as described on their web site, so choose according to your needs.  With that in mind, our room could not have been cleaner or more efficiently arranged in order to maximize what was offered in the space.  Gotta love a top quality establishment that finds a way to make room for a rubber ducky in the shower, right?!",5,2016,04,17
129,"Nice hotell, but very small rooms","Nice hotel, but very small rooms. Pleasant tea room next to the reception, good for relaxing. Restaurant downstairs. Very smiling and helpful staff, but a little inexperienced.Some mix-up with bills and payments.",3,2016,04,17
129,Splendid location in South Kensington,"So convenient - minutes from the underground; minutes from the Natural History Museum and minutes from the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Room small, but clean and tidy.  View of Natural History Museum from end of our corridor was great.  View from window was just of roofs, but no road noise.  Beware of leaving carrier bags on the floor- ours got thrown away as thought empty - but they weren't.  Reception confirmed that it was hotel policy to dispose of carrier bags left on floor and there was nothing that they could do - much better if they kept them until guests checked out in case of errors.  That did cast a blight on our stay, which was otherwise great.  The biological wallpaper was a bonus.",3,2016,04,16
129,Very Satisfied Customer,"This was my first time in London.  We were there on business so we only had two days of pleasure.  This was the perfect hotel and I wish I could have stayed longer.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  The location was close to the underground tube.  The hotel and the room was very clean and well decorated.  If I ever have a chance to visit London again, I will definitely stay here.  ",5,2016,04,15
129,"Great location, great service, very clean and comfortable","This was our second time at The Ampersand. It is clearly above average for London hotels. The staff are excellent and the location could not be better (a minute from the South Kensington tube). The overall quality and cleanliness of the hotel are also excellent. Breakfast is good, with both a continental buffet and 'a la carte' hot dishes.",5,2016,04,15
129,Excellent,"Worth recommending to everyone - great service, clean rooms, perfect beds, and good location - right in front of the tube station. Wifi available at fair speed, fitness facilities and good food at the restaurant - all you need when on business trip.",5,2016,04,14
129,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed overnight. Very comfortable hotel, friendly helpful staff - nothing is too much trouble. Short walk from South Kensington tube station, the museums & the Albert Hall. Would definitely recommend it.",5,2016,04,14
129,A great new hotel experience for us.,On previous trips to London we have traditionally stayed in the South Kensington area and wanted a change from our former choice of hotel. We are extremely happy with the Ampersand - housed in a traditional building but with a lovely modern twist. Excellent service and we will happily recommend to friends coming to London.,5,2016,04,13
129,Fantastic Hotel,Maximise your London visit by staying in this fantastic centrally located hotel. Brilliant location right next to South Kensington tube. Beautifully appointed and spacious rooms. Friendly helpful staff. Always my first choice London hotel which never disappoints,5,2016,04,12
129,a quaint boutique-style hotel in a great location,Stayed here for a weekend trip with my girlfriends.  The Ampersand offers the best from beautifully appointed rooms to the quality staff that uphold the Ampersand standards.  Location is perfect with the tube just a few steps away.,5,2016,04,12
129,"Comfortable, chic, great location",We were just passing through London and had to catch an international flight the next morning. The Ampersand was close enough to Heathrow and allowed us to feel like we were properly in London (vs. at the airport) and to easily hop the Underground to catch some dinner and theater. The room was cozy (but fine by London standards) and the bathroom was spacious and luxurious. All the usual nice amenities and efficient service.,4,2016,04,11
129,Great London Hotel,"My sister and I stayed at The Ampersand as a birthday treat recently.  I had mentioned our birthdays when I booked (via Mr & Mrs Smith) and it was mentioned when we checked in, a nice touch.  The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and we were shown to our room on the third floor by a lovely lady who explained various features of the room.  We had a superior twin which, though not massive, was a reasonable size for our needs, and well appointed with lovely d√©cor. The free soft drinks is a nice touch, as is the wee bottle of milk you get for your tea/coffee. One slight downside was the lack of a decent mirror near a plug socket, an all too common issue!  A full length or even small mirror on the wall would have been appreciated.  It was also too warm and seemingly the temperature controls didn't do a whole lot! Chocolates were brought to our room on my birthday, another lovely touch, and we also got some on arrival as part of the Mr & Mrs Smith deal.  Despite the fact we had checked out, we also enjoyed our free glass of bubby in The Drawing Room which is a nice spot to chill out.  Others have mentioned the location, which is perfect.  The tube is across the street and there are a lot of great museums within walking distance, plus some lovely cafes and restaurants nearby too.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, it has the personality and service level that is often lacking in some London hotels.",5,2016,04,11
129,Great hotel in an excellent location,"The Ampersand provides a lot of value. To begin with, the staff was incredibly pleasant and helpful. Then there are the add-ons included in the rate such as
complimentary beverages (juice, water, coffee, tea) in the room and complimentary newspapers delivered to the room. On the morning of my departure, I was offered coffee on the house, which was perfect because I needed one and any coffee shops near the hotel were closed. 

The location of The Ampersand goes an extremely long way. The hotel is fairly centrally located and is only a block from the South Kensington stop on the Piccadilly line, which is what you take to get to and from Heathrow. That same station is also a stop for the Circle and District lines, meaning that a lot more of London becomes easily accessible while staying at The Ampersand. 

In terms of the area itself around the hotel, there are plenty of restaurants, pubs, cafes, and shops within an extremely short to medium walk. There are also a handful of excellent museums nearby. And, finally, Hyde Park is a 10 minute walk away. 

All-in-all, to me, these attributes make The Ampersand an extremely good value. Sure, you'll probably find somewhere cheaper but it may not provide the same level of benefits. ",5,2016,04,11
129,Excellent Hotel,"Perfect for 5* service, luxury and location. 
This is our favourite hotel as the feel of the hotel is very welcoming and informal. 
Can take dogs! Provided basket and dog bowls. No annoying extra charges. ",5,2016,04,11
129,Excellent Experience,"I loved everything about this hotel - the staff, location, facilities, cleanliness, interior design and value for money.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly from the second we arrived - smiling and happy making them very approachable. It was nice to be shown to our room and given an overview of the room and hotel's facilities.

We loved the room's facilities - very modern and slick - we particularly loved our massive bed, tv, shower, cafetiere and the doggie bed. We tried the drawing room (lovely staff, ambience, cakes and tea!), the games room (we loved the fact that we could play ping pong, board games and enjoy a read from the selection of great books. The only thing missing was Scrabble! :-)) The communal toilets downstairs are beautiful too and so clean. 

The location was also perfect for us - you are in walking distance to Kings Road, Fulham Road, Harrods, Sloane Square, Whole Foods, the Saatchi Gallery etc. Also, the South Kensington tube stop is right across the road from the hotel and there is a bus stop right on the hotel's door step where you can get a bus through Chelsea to Wandsworth and Clapham Common. Our room was on the ground floor and we didn't hear any noise from the underground at all.

We stayed the previous 2 nights at another 5 star hotel during our London visit but feel that this was much better value for money (we loved the complimentary fresh milk for tea, water, orange juice etc in the mini bar). Also, we loved that there was no extra charge for bringing our wee dog. 

We will definitely stay here the next time we are in London and look forward to enjoying more of the facilities such as the room service and the Apero restaurant.",5,2016,04,10
129,Great hotel for a sexy getaway.,Great location. Lovely decor. Helpful friendly staff. Sexy big bedrooms with baths in them. Lush big beds. We only spent one night as we had theatre tickets in the west end. We were upgraded to a suite and had a lush room which we made the most of. Rooms are made for sleeping and so much more. We did not waste our time in our big sexy room. ,5,2016,04,10
129,Fabulous location near great neighbourhood and train station,"Ampersand is a block away from South Kensington tube station and bus stop is right out front; great transportation spot. Great base for exploring London and finishing day in local area for dinner. Staff is polite and respectfully present, provide great recommendations for nearby dining and shopping. Rooms are well appointed and clean, great housekeeping staff. Nice sitting area for coffee or tea all day in Drawing Room. Good gym. ",5,2016,04,10
129,"Elegant, cosy and convenient","We spent 3 nights in London catching up with friends and family, seeing shows and visiting museums and the Ampersand was an ideal base for this. Enjoyed the proximity to Kensington Gardens, Knightsbridge shopping and great local cafes, and of course the tube. You can hear the tube running under the hotel ( well this is central London) but apart from that the room was very quiet and a welcoming cocoon after running around in the city. Interiors were expertly finished and imaginative. Great bed. Huge TV at end of bed not really our cup of tea but some would love it. We will certainly consider staying here next time we are in London. ",5,2016,04,09
129,Lovely small hotel & great location!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand.  While the room was small, it was comfortable and had all that we needed.  The location is ideal, with the tube steps away and the V&A around the corner.  We walked to the Tate Britain, Royal Academy and Kensington Gardens.  Also, the hotel staff were very nice and helpful.",4,2016,04,09
129,we keep coming back,"For every trip to London (family, business, culture,...) we keep coming back to the Ampersand hotel --> says it all ! Hotel quality, staff efficiency, hotel location, breakfast quality, friendly staff everywhere (reception, drawing room, breakfast, house keeping,....)",5,2016,04,09
129,Excellent  once again!,"My friend & I stayed here 18 months & we're so impressed that we thought we would return on our annual meet up in London. We were not disappointed - it has retained its very high standards. The staff are warm& welcoming and very helpful. The rooms are very comfortable & clean - amazing beds & linen. We used the restaurant again in the evening & found this to be just as good.  Great food and service. The atmosphere is bright and warm, resulting in one not really wanting to leave the hotel!  However it is in a great location. We will be returning again.",5,2016,04,09
129,Wonderful,"Stay like you are, dear Ampersand.
Thanks for all the effort, the hotel and the staff is absolutely always trying to give best possible Service.

129,Great hotel in a great location,"Just steps from the Piccadilly line, you can't beat the location of this fabulous boutique hotel!  Everyone is helpful and friendly and the room is spacious and comfortable.  And there's a rubber ducky in the bathtub!  How can you beat that?",5,2016,04,07
129,Another stay at this boutique hotel,"We love this place, and will try and get our company to add it to their corporate list. Always a friendly welcome. The location is superb. The rooms are very comfortable, with great beds. We tried. Apero their restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. Fresh ingredients well cooked, only ¬£60 for two, and that included two very imaginative cocktails, but no wine. Highly recommend this place.",5,2016,04,07
129,Location,"Luxury boutique hotel at the best location we could hope for. Very clean and modern, yet classy. The room was as expected and the bed perfect. Very polite young staff. Easy to reach from Heathrow, very close to South Kensington tube station. ",5,2016,04,06
129,"Lovely hotel, great location","My husband and I stayed here March 2016 for one week.  The hotel is very nice and very well decorated.  FANTASTIC location, walking distance to museums and Tube station. 
My only complaints are the size of the room and the electric plugs, which both could be attributed to UK standards.  The room was very tiny and we paid to upgrade the room.  That was a little disappointing.  I was expecting more for what I paid.
There is no plug in the bathroom so that means if you need to blow dry or curl your hair, you need to do it at the desk with NO MIRROR.  This was extremely frustrating and had I known I honestly would have stayed elsewhere.  If these things don't bother you then by all means, book it today :)",4,2016,04,06
129,"Fabulous hotel, great staff, service, food and location - can't wait to return",I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is fantastic - the staff are friendly and very accommodating. We needed an iron and ironing board and they appeared within minutes of our request. The rooms are not huge but are beautifully decorated and perfectly equipped - free non-alcoholic drinks in the minibar - fab shower and very quiet. No complaints whatsoever - we will be back!!!,5,2016,04,06
129,Perfect......,"The Ampersand is in great area close to the subway, museums and Harrods. This is by far my favorite hotel in London. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. The rooms are clean and the general vibe is AWESOME. Free items in the mini bar is a great touch......",5,2016,04,05
129,A great place to stay!,"Arrived at 1.30 p.m.and dealt with immediately. Was told that the room woyuld be ready by 2.00 p.m. so we relaxed in the lounge with a nice glass of white wine. Room ready before 2.00 p.m. aken to the room with all facilities clearly explained. 
Staff very efficient and exceptionally pleasant. The two night stay was very enjoyable.",5,2016,04,05
129,Excellent location,"I stayed at The Ampersand following a suggestion from a friend. The hotel is really nice and very clean. I booked a deluxe suite that was fantastic. Hotel staff very friendly. And the best was the excellent location, so close to the South Kensington tuve station",5,2016,04,04
129,Great find,"We stayed here for 2 nights in April 2016 and it was a great hotel in every way.
Very good and helpful staff, rooms were clean and had everything you needed.
We used the restaurant and it was excellent.
Breakfast was really nice too.
Am coming back in July and looking forward to it!!!",5,2016,04,04
129,A boutique hotel in a wonderful location,"Wonderful hotel in an excellent location. Rooms are not huge but the high ceilings give you an impression of being in a larger space. Tube stop a few meters away. Buses (including hop on/off) in front of hotel.  Flexibility to add a bed to double rooms (we had two rooms for two adults and four children). All was perfect; we only had one problem with the request to book a separate breakfast room to celebrate a birthday, as the request was not passed on to the management and the room was not available ( we were given other tables until the room freed up). Ensure any such request is made to one of the managers rather than the waiters. We highly recommend it.",5,2016,03,30
129,What a find....,"The Ampersand is a beautiful boutique style hotel in a great location, easy check in, complimentary umbrellas as the rain was torrential, they recommended Muriel's Kitchen for lunch & that was great food. A short walk to Harrods & easy tube access. The room was very clean, very well decorated & I will def stay again next time I'm visiting London. ",5,2016,03,30
129,Great experience,"Was a great experience for the quality and kind of staff, the location very good for us with a lot of services, restaurants, underground, near museums and Hyde park, the room is very insonorized and great bath room, the staff from reception always friendly and happy when we required something or information.",5,2016,03,30

129,A trip to London,"Room service was as to be expected i.e. excellent. Breakfast being continental was ample with an expansive selection of meats, bread, cereals etc enough to keep you going through the morning. . Bed was large, comfortable giving a sumptuous sleep. Only disappointment was the layout of the shower room which was quite different to our previous stay but we did manage to indulge in showering !!! A very enjoyable stay. ",5,2016,03,29
129,Perfect hotel in wonderful location,"A few blocks from Museums, Park, Harrods, and excellent restaurants and .Tube. Staff warm responsive and very attentive and helpful. Price  more than reasonable for a hotel of this quality. Bathrooms excellent too. ",5,2016,03,29
129,Fantastic!,"I was a solo traveler and felt safe while staying at the Ampersand. The staff was extremely helpful and kind. I had a single/small double room and it really was just comfortable enough for one person. I wouldn't recommend it for two as there isn't any storage for large suitcases or room to move. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Overall, it was such a great experience and I would definitely stay here again in the future!",5,2016,03,29
129,Lovely boutique hotel,Third time we've stayed and as always an excellent experience. Superb location literally metres from South Kensington tube; stylishly decorated; very friendly and helpful staff; great room and bed. Make sure you sample their afternoon tea too...!,5,2016,03,29
129,AS,"Excellent location and experience; service was friendly, but uneven at times.  The play rooms make it a family dream, with ping pong and games galore.  The restaurant is lovely for breakfast, with delicious egg dishes.  The drawing room is very special, providing quiet in the middle of such a busy part of town.  Access to tube and to local restaurants all around enhanced an already ideal stay.",5,2016,03,28
129,One of the best hotels I've stayed at in a longtime.,"Fantastic hotel and services. Very professional staff, the hotel was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. It's so nice to comme to a hotel where the basics drinks are free. For me Tracy was one of the nicest receptionist I've met in a long time.",5,2016,03,28
129,Excellence,"the service from a diverse team was second to none. everything was made easier for us, we truly enjoyed our four night stay due to the lovely staff. When we had a difficulty with a tour the staff were incredibly helpful, we are very pleased we chose the Ampersand and highly recommend it to other travellers. Thanks so much.
",5,2016,03,28
129,Another great stay at The Ampersand,The Ampersand is ideally located in South Kensington close to the tube station. Plenty of shops and restaurants in the immediate area.. The hotel is excellent and the staff without exception friendly and attentive. We have stayed at The Ampersand on several occasions and it is our hotel of choice when visiting London. The rooms are very comfortable as are the public areas and everything is done to a very high standard. An Oasis in Central London!,5,2016,03,27
129,London City Family holiday,"Very nice Boutique Hotel with very good service staff. Easy to reach by Underground from Heathrow airport. 
Rooms are in good quality but wardrobe much too small.
Very nice restaurant 'Apero' with very good food.",5,2016,03,27
129,Great hotel,"Great location, and even better service. Plus little touches like internet available everywhere and drinking water in the fridge. The room is large enough but not huge.  Perfect for business since there is very good connection. No negatives about this hotel",5,2016,03,25
129,Perfect &,"If you like friendly, professional and helpful staff and a comfortable place to rest and recuperate in stylish surroundings with a warm atmosphere look no farther. We did not eat in the restaurant in the evening as we were out and about but breakfast was excellent. The Hotel is a stones throw from South Kensington Underground which makes it easy to get about London. Nearby are many local coffee shops and restaurants including an excellent Thai restaurant called Patara.  There are numerous interesting places to visit within easy travelling distance including Kensington Palace and Gardens, the V&A , loads more museums and Hyde Park. We were in London to go to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and again it is within easy travelling distance. A  5-10 minute car or taxi journey is also worthwhile making, to visit a somewhat hidden jewel called Leighton House Museum at 12 Holland Park Rd. It was the home and studio of Lord Frederic Leighton a significant Victorian Artist.",5,2016,03,25
129,Perfect stay!,"What a hotel - just great in so many ways, I couldn't recommend it highly enough!
location:
South Kensington.  Literally less than 1 minute walk to the tube, 10-15 mins to Harrods & Knightsbridge walking. 5 mins walk to v&a museum. 10 min walk to Hyde park!
hotel: I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't like this hotel - what a gorgeous place, very chic, comfortable and well done with great staff who would do anything to help.
Absolutely perfectly places for trips into town but equally you feel like you're in a village with all the local shops and amenities - the best of both worlds.
Dining:
We didn't eat in the restaurant but had the most fabulous afternoon tea which was just delightful!
I would definite stay here again and again on future trips to London!
Well done Ampersand,just brilliant!",5,2016,03,25
129,Londons best kept secret,"I have now been twice to this hotel and I just love it. It's stylish, immaculate and so comfy. It feels like a home from home. Great innovation in the rooms with the technology, heated bathroom floor and the food from room service is exceptional. All this and great value for money.",5,2016,03,24
129,Simply Perfect,"The Ampersand is definitely a spectacular place to stay in London. A very gentleness staff, a well located hotel and nice accomodations makes the experience at The Ampersand somehing unique and very special.",5,2016,03,24
129,Excellent service/great rooms,"Hotel staff is very nice, polite and helpful. Location is excellent with only a few meter walk from taxi, bus or tube. 
Very relaxed atmosphere in the hotel except in the downstairs cocktail bar/pub which should of course be lively. So good balance between floors. 
Rooms were very nice. Beds very comfortable. Bathroom clean. Minibar was free; soda, water, juice and milk. Newspaper on the door every morning, great with that morning cup of tea.

Overall a perfect stay. Will definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.",5,2016,03,24
129,Super location in South Kensington,"Lovely hotel, just 20 metres from South Kensington tube station, across the road on a quieter street. We felt this was a safe area, ideally located for walking to museums, restaurants, Harrods etc. Modern decor, friendly and helpful staff, bedroom sizes adequate( it is South Ken!) with lovely bathrooms and toiletries. We will return on our next London visit
 ",5,2016,03,23
129,Two visits to London in two weeks,The first stay at the ampersand was for 5 nights. On check in we were informed we had been upgraded- lovely surprise!! Room 120 was spacious and had a huge bathroom- easy to get in and out of the hotel via the stairs. The second visit was for just 2 nights and we were on the fourth floor with no upgrade this time. The room 401 was small but perfect for a couple nights - it would feel a little cramped if it was for longer with 2 people. On the fourth floor you cannot hear the tube rumbling but that did not bother me- it's central London what do you expect. The room amenities were perfect from nice teas to bathroom products. Service was lovely and very friendly. Proximity to the tube and restaurants was perfect. We will definitely stay here again. ,5,2016,03,23
129,Amazing hotel in fantastic location,Stayed for four nights at the Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington.  The hotel itself is wonderful.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and the heated floor in the bathroom was a lovely surprise.  The afternoon tea in the Drawing Room was delicious and they even provide a gluten free option which is hard to find.  We took advantage of the three for two offer which made it more affordable.  Staff are very efficient and take care of all your needs.  Will definitley stay again when I am next in London.  First class hotel in fabulous area with tons of restaurants and cafes close by.  You can even see the tube station from the hotel.,5,2016,03,22
129,Perfect Nest!,"I love this hotel.  Every little details is comfortable and cozy-- from the beautifully appointed tea room to the rubber duckie by the tub.  The staff is just perfect-- I am a bit of a worrier, but they helped me with all my little problems.  I lost my kindle on the airplane and they kept calling the airline until it was recovered.  I just love this place, really.  I wish I lived here.",5,2016,03,19
129,Fabulous Boutique Hotel in a great area,"Stayed here for honeymoon in London.  (Our stay was actually before April 2015 but it wasn't offered in the drop down menu) Lovely lovely hotel!  The staff was courteous and helpful during our entire stay.  The first room we were assigned to were bit small and the window was facing into another room in a building next door so we asked for another room and were promptly moved to higher ground.  The rooms are richly furnished and decorated as one can see my pictures.  

The bathroom was very clean and all the amenities offered were very nice.  The hotel has a great restaurant and tea room.  We had a breakfast at Apero on our last day and thoroughly enjoyed it.  So sad we didn't get to try the tea at The Drawing Rooms. 

The location of the hotel is the best!  Walking distance to all the major museums (Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum).  It's also walking distance to Kensington Palace and Park.  The bus stops literally right in front of the hotel and the South Kensington station is maybe 100 steps away.  

We are planning a trip to UK again this spring and will definitely be staying here!",5,2016,03,16
129,Brilliant hotel,"Very comfortable, fantastic decor, highly recommended.

The hotel is a great location with easy access to the local underground station.

The bar staff in the hotel were very friendly and great for making recommendations.",5,2016,03,16
129,Great cozy hotel.,"This is not my first time in this hotel and each time i feel cozy and like at home, partly because this is not hotel from commercial chain, instead small one. Also it's located just near South Kensington tube station. And they have tasty breakfast, very soft bed, clean rooms.",5,2016,03,15
129,"Nice, friendly and pleasant hotel to stay for a view nights in London",A had a very comfortable stay in March '16. The hotel is located close to the underground and has nice meeting facilities and friendly staff. It's also nice to have a walk around in the area e.g. towards Hyde Park.  ,5,2016,03,15
129,Terrible stay for kids,Really not desirable as it pretends to be for kids and there is no TVs working in your room and the games room is out of action the whole weekend for functions. Really not great at all and looking to see if the manager is able to put this right. ¬£600 for a night is way too much.,1,2016,03,14
129,Great smart boutique hotel at the doorstep of Museumland,"Great hotel, buzzy and beautiful interiors, good friendly staff always helpful. Room was lovely and nice bathroom, it was wonderful to walk out to the V and A within 10 minuted and on the Sunday we had a lovely walk to Kensington Palace, it was an intimate quirky hotel with all the services needed.",5,2016,03,14
129,A calm oasis of friendly efficiency in attractive surroundings,"I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and its superb staff. Uniformly young, they are professional and attentive at all times. My husband and I love staying here. It's proximity to the South Kensington Museums is its chief draw for us but the hotel is a real home from home too with its contemporary chic and comfortable Drawing Room. The rooms are beautifully appointed, comfortable and clean and the continental breakfast is beautifully presented and delicious. ",5,2016,03,13
129,The perfect mix of classic and modern,Really enjoyed my overnight stay at The Ampersand.  Set in a nice area of London the welcome and room were all above my expectations.  Visiting with work so didn't get a chance to sample the wider facilities but I was more than impressed with everything that I saw.,4,2016,03,10
129,Lovely stay ,"Had a lovely stay over valentines weekend. The staff were lovely. The reception staff were so friendly and helpful.  The room was clean, the bed was lovely, the only slightly bad thing, there was a horrible smell in the drains in the bathroom, that was the only issue! Every time the shower was used or the toilets were flushed we could smell it. 
The hotel was brilliant and the resturant was also amazing. Well worth the booking. ",4,2016,03,08
129,Mother and Daughter weekend,"Mum and I make a trip every year to London and have stayed in a number of different hotels - this was by far the best. The d√©cor, the atmosphere, the staff, the cosiness and cleanliness of the room, all the added extras, the late check out and breakfast times, the sumptuous drawing room, the plentiful breakfasts in the rustic chic Apero restaurant, the location and proximity to South Kensington tube all made for a perfect, relaxing, luxury stay - and we can't wait to return. We have only good things to say about the fabulous Ampersand hotel and would highly recommend. ",5,2016,03,08
129,Fab 1 night stay,"Hotel is minutes from south Ken so easy to get to. On entering staff were attentive and efficient, nothing too much trouble. We were upgraded to a deluxe studio which was beautiful. We had cocktails in Apero and the bar man was extremely knowledgable and helpful. 
I never sleep that well but the beds were amazingly comfortable, so much so that we enquired about staying a second night so we could relax and enjoy the room and hotel facilities but sadly was fully booked. We will definitely be returning ASAP.
",5,2016,03,07
129,Great location,"The Ampersand Hotel is in a great location, with easy access to transportation. My husband and I stayed in a deluxe double room. It had ample room and bathroom space and was impeccably clean. However, the bathroom was poorly lit with no outlet for a hair dryer or flat iron. I found it difficult to do my hair standing in a, again, poorly lit hallway looking in a mirror in a closet door with the outlet located in the closet. The staff, on the whole, were very helpful and pleasant. The king size bed was very comfortable. There was a soft, fluffy duvet on the bed with no top sheet or blanket. It proved to be very warm. Every night we turned the heat way down in the room and still woke up during the night because we were too hot. We did get room service one night for dinner and it was excellent. The food in the Apero restaurant downstairs is average. ",4,2016,03,07
129,A great hotel in a wonderful location.  Top class staff.  Highly recommended,"Highly recommended...staff and hotel was first class.  Nothing was too much trouble and a slight problem through my own fault was solved immediately.
Great location for theatre, shopping and generally having a mini break.
",5,2016,03,07
129,A little gem!,"Great staff, beautiful hotel and very good food. I stop regularly and can't fault it. 
If you like complete silence then sometimes you can feel the tube below if on a lower floor but generally not a problem.",5,2016,03,02
129,The reality is exactly as the advertising,"Third time in London, first enchanted by accommodation, after unpleasant experience as HH member. With the offer of ""pay 2, stay 3 nights "" was a good choice, otherwise the price is a bit higher. Nice design, everything looks like new, good location. In my opinion the bed is not comfortable , I prefer hard mattress. First night the temperature was lower than I'm comfortable, a cause could be the windows that are not modern system and  the wind and noise are not stopped. We didn't have nice view , in the back, at first floor at all, but silent. The staff was kind, helpful, except the brunette (asian) lady which was very cold even she is very polite but false. It's her loss.. ",5,2016,02,29
129,"Above and beyond, great hotel","What a great hotel, every detail seems to be in place. Excelent service in all departments, great food, fantastic art and decorations. Good location with lots of bars and restaurants in the nice area South Ken and with the tube across the road the city centre and airport are easy to reach.

I would recommend the Ampersand to everyone and I'm looking forward to my next stay.",5,2016,02,28
129,Excellent mini moon,"Fab hotel with great service and also great location. Stunning decor and loved our delux room. Would highly recommend not just for a romantic break , but as a regular visitor to London I will be back. ",5,2016,02,28
129,Lovely Modern Hotel in a great location,"We recently stayed for 3 nights  and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is literally next to South Kensington tube station so very convenient for getting around the city and perfect for The Royal Albert Hall and the museums.  The room was very nice with excellent decor and the heated floor in the bathroom was a nice touch. All the staff were welcoming and professional, from the receptionists to the cleaning staff, they were very willing to help and advise. The bar area was very nice and the cocktails were tasty and inventive. We had a lovely few days and will definitely be visiting again!!",5,2016,02,27
129,Wonderful position with beautiful original public rooms.,"Great hotel, friendly happy staff and very helpful. Super comfy beds and lovely bathroom. Only minus is slightly dull decoration in bedroom compared to lovely bright colourful public rooms. Change the dull curtains and it will make all the difference. ",4,2016,02,26
129,A stunning place to stay,"We were very happy with our stay. The staff were kind and helped us to our room which was beautiful. The best room we have experienced in london. For one night, it wasn't cheap, but for a special occasion, it was worth it.",5,2016,02,25
129,Superb hotel !,"Location is great, right next to south kensington station, staff are super nice, room was very clean and modren.  The only thing is the size of the room- it was small for us and we took the superior one. ",5,2016,02,24
129,Nice but a bit over-priced,"We came here for Valentines evening. The hotel is pretty and sweet and has lovely decor. 
The room was modern and clean, but quite cold - the air conditioning didn't seem to warm the room. The 'freestanding bath' advertised was in the bathroom and not, as advertised by the images, in the bedroom. Service was fine but I felt the whole thing was a little over-priced for what we received and I had expected a bit more - we had even treated ourselves to a fancy suite which was, we felt - a tad disappointing for what we paid. Breakfast wasn't included ‚Äì and the ¬£15 breakfast buffet was a little underwhelming. Bed was SUPER comfortable though. :)",4,2016,02,23
129,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is lovely and very nicely decorated. All staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed for two nights and had breakfast in bed both mornings, which was really nice. The rooms are a tad small but its really not a problem as they have everything you need. Would definitely recommend and stay again!",5,2016,02,23
129,Wonderful service and delightful stay,"Checkin was wonderful although we were initially shown to a room without a bath (despite a request to have one). No problem. Staff offered to find us a new room while we were out for the day (as nothing else suitable was available when we arrived).

When we arrived back late evening our bag was in our new room (317) which was wonderful. Underfloor heating in bathroom, plenty of towels and well appointed room.

All staff we met were wonderful - including 2 from housekeeping the following morning. 

We only stayed one night and didn't eat in the hotel. Location is superb, 2 mins from South Ken station and only 5 mins from V&A and Natural History museums",5,2016,02,22
129,Lovely hotel,"Great location just steps away from the station. Ideal for The Royal Albert hall and the museums. 
Room was good (we stayed level 3 and could just hear a faint rumble from the tube). Staff was excellent - just wished we could of stayed longer and enjoyed more of the hotels services.",5,2016,02,22
129,Another excellent stay.,"This was our second visit to the Ampersand, we paid a little extra for the room but we were very pleased indeed with the result. A spacious room, extremely well serviced, comfortable and clean. We'll be back!",5,2016,02,21
129,good but expensive and the parkering is also very expensive,"We got the stay at reasonable prices, and want to come back four days from Monday, June 13 to Friday 17 we want two double rooms superior but the price of 1009, - pund
is the excessive, because we can easily find 5 star hotels in the same area to about 700, - for 4 days so unfortunately we do not get more. sorry.",4,2016,02,21
129,Perfect Stay!!,"This hotel was perfect! We stayed over this past valentines weekend. It was near the tube, which we took to get to all the major attractions. It's so easy after you take it once. The room was large and clean and the staff was very nice. We stayed in the Deluxe Double with a King Size bed. Seems like a great hotel for couples. Would definitely stay again!",5,2016,02,19
129,"Perfect location, excellent staff!","Amazing stay! The Ampersand Hotel was in a wonderful location; right in the heart of South Kensington, close to the Knightsbridge area and near the best sights in the city! In addition to the location, the rooms were modern and beautiful with great amenities including coffee, tea, water, juice, bathrobes and slippers. The floors in the bathrooms were heated and the towel rack was also heated. It felt luxurious! 

Finally, and most importantly, the staff was incredible. After checking-in and getting to my room on a non-smoking floor, the bathroom reeked of smoke. With a strong sensitivity to smoke, I called the desk to ask about another room. They did not have another available at the level I paid, but graciously upgraded me so I would not have that bothersome experience. The front desk staff also helped with dinner recommendations, calling a car to the get me to the airport, and even getting me a coffee to go. Again, amazing staff! 

I would recommend Ampersand for any type of traveler. This is definitely a place I will return!

129,A gem in central London,"For the price, attention to detail and extremely helpful service, this hotel offers the best you can expect out of central London in the quiet and beautiful South Ken neighbourhood. All my requests were accommodated in a friendly and professional manner and I enjoyed all the services and amenities this beautiful boutique hotel has to offer. For luxury in London, it is relatively rare to have had such an experience. ",5,2016,02,17
129,Coming back to a nice hotel,"This time the room had the quality I expected. This did not happen last October, as 1st floor rooms have a lot of noise from the underground and I could not sleep well. Thus, if you are sensitive to noise during your sleep, avoid 1st floor rooms.
The hotel is very close to museums and the tube station, which is very convenient.
Breakfast is delicious.",4,2016,02,16
129,stayed several times and will be back,"This is an excellent hotel - the staff are great - the restaurant is great - the rooms for the most part are excellent - yes, there's some rumbling from the tube trains but it's not an issue for me - yes, with the bus stops directly outside pulling up to the hotel can be a problem - but it's 5 star all the way, at a reasonable price for London, and in a good, if not completely central, location - as I've said above I'll be back",5,2016,02,15
129,Delightful!,"This is a gorgeous hotel. The staff were very friendly, the room (we upgraded to Deluxe) was spacious, clean and modern with an incredibly comfortable bed, the reception/bar area beautiful. We requested to be at the back of the building and didn't hear a peep from outside; total silence. Location is perfect. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,02,15
129,Great South Kensington hotel,"Very convenient location close to the tube.  Nicely appointed hotel; I had no issues with noise or traffic.  Friendly staff, and the restaurant's food was good.  My only issue was that, during a heavy rainstorm, my room started leaking from water pooling on a balcony or overhang above my room.  The hotel did move me to a different, non-leaking room.",4,2016,02,14
129,The Epitome of Excellence,"Ampersand is perfect - the staff, the breakfast, the rooms, the decor, the style, the location......in fact, I would sooner this were not widely known as the more popular it gets the pricier it will probably get and it is already a bit over the top - worth it but limits the number of visits",5,2016,02,14
129,Birthday weekend,"My wife and I booked this hotel as a base for her birthday celebrations, and to meet family.
The location and the facilities of the hotel were excellent in every way, on arrival made to feel very welcome.
We will certainly return and recommend to friends and family.",5,2016,02,11
129,"Great bed, bathroom and location!","A nice stay at a nice place. Got upgraded (which is good service) to a double room. Tiny room which smelt of mildew (I recommend changing the carpet) with a fantastic! bathroom - that was top five on my list! Amazing bed/mattress and pillows! Clean room.

Reception area is elegant, buth breakfast room a bit dark and gloomy, especially around the food area. Could hardly see what was there. Good breakfast thoughüòä.

Great laundry service! 

Great location just across the street from South Kensington tube station.",4,2016,02,09
129,hotel,"small rooms.lot of nose outside front room.you can feel the underground metro or de busses
passing.hotel was ok very friendly ,very young staff .de desk very compact. but ok nice setting room. good for visiting the museum",4,2016,02,09
129,You will Love your Stay Here!,"My daughter and I stayed here for several days as part of our european vacation. The location in South Kensington was perfect  for walking to museums  and many many restauraunts.The front desk staff is very welcoming, personable and very helpful with suggestions and directions. We were able to have tea upon arrival, breakfast in the restauraunt downstairs, which was delicious, and room service which was prompt and delicious as well. The room was clean, the bathroom was updated and attractive and the bed was very comfortable. There was construction going on outside our window but we couldn't hear any noise unless the window was open. We loved this Hotel so much we are returning this summer for another visit!",5,2016,02,08
129,Nice boutique hotel in South Kensington,"The hotel looks very new, but it is quite cosy and has an atmosphere. Everything is marked with ""something"" & ""something"" (i.e. ""warm & dry"", ""needle & thread"", etc.) And the umbrellas they have for their guests have cats & dogs prints on them :)
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The location is very good - a lot of shops and restaurants around, and the South Kensington tube station is 1 minute walk away. within 5 minutes walk you will also find 3 of the biggest and most famous London museums - Natural History, Sciencs and V&A",5,2016,02,08
129,Excellent,"Very good hotel near South Kengsington. Good service, good rooms and very good breakfast. When I come in London I always choose the Ampersand. Good position and very comfortable beds. Service excellent",5,2016,02,08
129,Excellent hotel.,"Had a wonderful time with my partner on her fortieth birthday. The room was clean, comfortable and well laid out. The food was excellent and the staff, attentive, efficient and very pleasant. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,02,08
129,Excellent small luxury hotel,"From now on this is my first option hotel in London without kids. Small luxury hotel, great service, decoration and food. Walking distance to amazing restaurants, metro, harrods, museums, and so on. The only downside is the limited size of some rooms. We felt very unconfortable the first time we were there, so in the next time we got a better and more expensive one. Sizes changes in the same category, check before reserving.",4,2016,02,06
129,Once again a great place where to be,"Here I am again praising The Ampersand: the warm welcoming, the nice and clean rooms, the Victorian-style bathrooms to kill for (to me the showers are best one can have away from home)

For the first time I came with my partner and he also enjoyed it, he focuses more and the location, the rich continental breakfast and the super comfortable beds.

What to say more? Oh yes, try to go for the back rooms are quieter.",5,2016,02,06
129,"They define ""Boutique""","After almost 5 weeks of travelling around Iceland and Scotland, we were in the final days before heading back to Australia and were at this point frankly buggered. Reception and check-in at the Ampersand was without fuss. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Upon being shown to our room, we took in the great view of Harrington road and my wife commented on all the nice goodies in the bathroom. It was a touch on the small side (the bathroom), but was of an exceptional standard. Name a hotel than gives you a rubber duck for the bath? The bed was one of the best I've slept in. Breakfast is downstairs in the basement and was very good, if not a touch expensive (but if you can afford this place you can afford breakfast). The real reason to stay here is that you are pretty much close to everything. The Science Museum, the V&A and the tube system. Drinks in the bar downstairs is a must and just sit back and watch the world go by outside. Cabs are easy to get and it's only a 10 minute ride to Paddington station for Heathrow. I promise to come back guys!",5,2016,02,05
129,Great hotel,"We received a warm welcome from reception staff who offered to provide information on the local area.  We stayed in a music themed room which was comfortable, light and airy. The bathroom had under-floor heating which was appreciated on a cold January weekend!   Other nice touches included Eric Clapton's autobiography on the bedside table and a rubber duck in the bathroom!!  There were a number of complimentary soft drinks available in the room together with tea and coffee.  The hotel is very close to South Kensington tube station and a short walk from the Natural History, Science and V&A museums.  It is also close to the Royal Albert Hall.  There is also a wide choice of restaurants in the immediate vicinity.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,02,05
129,My favorite london hotel,"This was my 6th stay here, and the staff are fantastic, the rooms delightful (but very small), impeccably clean and comfortable.  A gem of a place to stay.  For business or for fun, zi love the locale and the quiet.
",5,2016,02,05
129,Amazing boutique hotel in an unbeatable loaction,I recently stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for three nights. I had booked a superior room and had asked for a high floor. I got a very quiet room facing the back of the hotel which was perfect. From the heated bathroom floor to the large walk in shower and King size bed I could not ask for more. The location of the hotel and the proximity to public transportation are a huge plus. There is a taxi rank just outside the hotel. The only downside is there is very limited space to hang your clothes and there are no drawers. Apart from that it was an extremely pleasant experience.,5,2016,02,04
129,Great Hotel,"Wonderful hotel in South Kensington, great location right near a Underground Station.  The included water and soft drinks in the room as made our six day stay so much more pleasant without having to buy and carry the water and soda.  Staff incredibly helpful and nice.  Highly recommend for a nice stay in London.",5,2016,02,03
129,our stay at the ampersand,"don't go to room 203 if you are claustrophobic. all you will see is a wall of next door building through the window. But we are not and in light of the rest of the stay all is forgiven. The bathroom is wonderful. underfloor heating. the stuff are very courteous, efficient, helpful (they told us about existence of valet service when asked about parking). All was ready for our daughter to sleep when we came and the beds were sooo comfortable. breakfast - if you like conoisseur French breakfast, that's the place for you. every thing on the extremely rich menu will want to make you stay for dinner too. certainly will come again. real pamper.",5,2016,02,02
129,Just stay here,"3rd visit to the Ampersand last weekend and as usual, it's just top class.  Nice hotels in nice parts of London are hard to find without spending an absolute fortune, and while this isn't cheap, it definitely provides value.  Location is excellent beside South Ken tube, staff are just the nicest and the room is a decent size with a massive, comfortable bed.  Free snacks and soft drinks are a welcome bonus.

The food is really good, the barman makes the best Manhattan north of the Thames and no one annoys you trying to carry your bag or show you how the light switches work (I find that kind of thing annoying).

If you are looking for what is a 5 star hotel without the unnecessary 'services' (and cost) then this is undoubtedly the place for you.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2016,02,02
129,Beautiful rooms and impeccable service,"We returned for a birthday celebration.  A warm welcome and lovely surprise they had upgraded us to a suite.
Room was on top floor with balcony so you can see the rooftops across town and look down to the street.
The room was immaculate, very tastefully done in a contemporary design. Huge super comfy bed and the sitting room was lovely with kitchenette and patio doors to balcony.
Bathroom was spacious, open plan shower, TV, rubber ducks and all!
Breakfast was very good, the continental buffet offered a lot of choice with freshly baked pastries, breads, frittata, cheeses and cold meats.  Apart from the young children sticking their fingers into everything it was perfect.
The service is faultless across the board, all the staff cannot do enough for you but in a friendly unpretentious manner. Undoubtedly they are the hotel's best asset.",5,2016,02,02
129,New favourite,"Very good, comfortable and quiet will make this my preferred hotel of choice when I am in London again.  Perfect for business courteous and helpful staff everything went very smoothly and efficiently well done.",5,2016,02,01
129,amazing stay,"stayed here for 4 nights for work.  My room was amazing, from breakfast to lunch to dinner the food was really good.  The meeting rooms and facilities were great.  Cocktails in the bar were lovely too. 

The best part of this hotel are the staff.  I can not recommend it enough.
",5,2016,02,01
129,Unbelievably good. A real joy,"I'll keep it short & sweet. 

I stay in central London 2 or 3 nights a week on business. You get used to a level of ok service. 

This was a pleasure trip (rather than business) that was booked for a stay in Dec. Our little girl was unwell and we had to cancel. The hotel (unlike most others) said no problem, we will rearrange for Jan. We were offered an upgrade for a further ¬£60 which mean freestanding bath in the window",5,2016,02,01
129,An utterly gorgeous hotel,"The rooms are beautifully appointed with lots of thoughtful touches, such as complimentary mini bar, books and magazines in the room, gorgeously comfy beds and big, fluffy towels. The rooms have a surprising amount of space for a London hotel. I booked direct and was thrilled to discover on check-in that I'd received a room upgrade. The hotel has a really warm welcome with staff that appear to genuinely care about you as a guest and the quality of your stay. Best of all, it's completely unpretentious, giving a really relaxed, fun atmosphere with the kind of attention to detail you just don't expect for a hotel at this price. Even after I had checked out, the receptionist asked if I would like to leave my bags with them to explore the area, which I felt was a really thoughtful touch. This was my first visit to The Ampersand Hotel and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great location, too!",5,2016,01,31
129,Perfect ,"We stayed two nights in this perfectly located hotel. Amazing design, incredibly nice staff and a warm welcome.
The high tea in the afternoon is highly recommended.
The location for exploring London is just perfect, and the V&A in walking distance.
We definitely will book the Ampersand next time we are in London. ",5,2016,01,30
129,"Location, Service and the Underground","This is a great location if you are predominantly accessing west or central London, not if you have lots of meetings or want to explore the city.  The hotel is perfectly located near South Ken tube station (my favourite part of Kensington) with so many restaurants and bars close by. The National History museum and V&A are a stones throw away as is Harrods and Hyde Park.

The service, as others have mentioned is very good. Everyone is friendly and goes out of their way to help you. The rooms are small (i.e. London size) but beautifully decorated. 

The bar downstairs is again friendly but a little claustrophobic, I think its fair to say there are better options in the area. 

Only real criticism of this hotel was the noise and vibrations from the underground. I know its not their fault but I have never experienced this in any other London hotel. 

Its a good place and I got a great deal (3 nights for the price of 2) so I wont complain. I will be back, it is certainly one of Londons better hotels.",4,2016,01,30
129,Excellent hotel and great location,An excellent hotel with impeccable staff.  Made to feel very welcome.  The club sandwiches were the best we had ever tasted and breakfast was amazing.  The bar could have been a bit more comfortable.  Our bed was extremely comfortable and was enormous which meant there was not much space to walk around the room.  Bathroom was lovely. Fantastic location in South Kensington - just minutes walk from the Tube station.,5,2016,01,28
129,Next Time the same place,"The location is great, the staff kind and efficient. The hotel interior design is excellent. the breakfast is good and the bar is very nice. I Strongly recommend and I will come back next time in London.",5,2016,01,28
129,Can`t go wrong with the Ampersand Hotel,"Another fabulous stay at the Ampersand. We upgraded to a Deluxe Suite and it was well worth it. Wow, what a lovely room. Everything is very well kept.

Very well designed, nice color scheme, romantic bathtub in the room. Love the black and white bathroom with the large walk in shower.
And who doesn`t enjoy the Miller Harris cosmetics?

I love the coffee and TV station. You don`t even have to fill up on water and turn the machine on. It comes on with the light. 

The people who work here are really interested in making your stay as comfortable as possible. Everyone. This creates a really nice atmosphere. The Ampersand belongs to The Small Luxury Hotel label. So the interiour really pleases the eye. 

Honestly, I would not want to stay anywhere else. It could not be any more perfect. You jump into the Picadilly Line at Heathrow Airport and the tube spits you out in from of the Ampersand. The jogging at Hyde Park is a great start in the morning. And then breakfast at Muriels Kitchen. Love the Victoria&Albert Museum nearby. 

We will be back for sure.",5,2016,01,26
129,Sand went to gold,"Familyfeelinghotel with a tasty freshness and comfy beds.
Decoration feels modern and wifi works satisfying.
Location perfect in many aspekts. 
Close to many museums and hyde park.
Royal Albert Hall around the corner.",5,2016,01,25
129,Amperdand LONDON,"This very nice hotel with impecable service is extremely well located. just a few meters away from conveninent South Kensington Underground station. Rooms are very well presented and spacious. Amemities, perfect. One bad thing, the NOISE and vibrations the tube (I asume) makes every 15 minutes or so is a torture. Feels like an eartquake 24/7... ",4,2016,01,24
129,Contemporary Boutique hotel in the heart of South Kensington,"Well designed, well located boutique hotel in South Kensington. Thoughtful welcoming staff committed to ensuring you have a relaxing stay. Beautiful decor and with excellent food options whether it is afternoon tea in the salon or a high end dining experience in the Drawing Room. Highly recommend we are returning in a week!",5,2016,01,24
129,Highly recommended,"Great location just next to South Kensington station, walk to Harrods is just 10 mins. Services of all staffs are excellent, staffs help carry your luggage from the entrance. Bed is comfy and cleanliness with all good bathroom amenities. Shower with strong water pressure. All decoration is cosy but modern. Highly recommended for all.",5,2016,01,24
129,Really friendly,The staff were extremely nice and friendly . The rooms were comfortable and the whole experience easy and enjoyable . Right next to the underground station made commuting from the hotel easy . Would rate this hotel as excellent ,5,2016,01,24
129,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"I couldn't fault this place- staff, room, location were all great 
Will definitely return and would recommend to anyone wanting a treat in London 
The beds are amazing and the rooms are the most comfortable yet ",5,2016,01,22
129,Well worth a stay ,"Just checked out of The Ampersand after a 2 night stay. The staff are what make this  place worthy of it's 5 stars. Service was impeccable during our stay & the team deserve recognition. The rooms & interior are what would you expect from this standard of hotel & little extras such as under floor heating in the bathroom were a nice touch. We didn't eat in the hotel, however we did have a few drinks in the bar - again fantastic service! The hotel location is ideal, less than a minute from South Kensington tube station and some nice little places to eat around it. Highly recommended! ",5,2016,01,20
129,Book,Very nice hotel with great location!! All the staffs were very friendly and helpful. The room was nicely decorated and equipped with all the things you need. House keeping was very fast and quite neat. They keep your room tidy all the time even when you mess it up after they already clean up on that day. The bed was comfortable. Only downside was there were dust in the bed overhead. ,4,2016,01,19
129,"Great location, comfortable stay","The location is close to many restuarants, store and the tube. What I liked about this boutique hotel was the staff was extremely pleasant and always willing to help. The restuarant was amazing, and since I'm gluten and vegan, it's usually tough to find food where I can eat. But the chef was accommodating and I think I gain a few pounds. The room was nice and clean. Simple tasteful decor, the best was the heated bathroom floor. Since it was cold outside, coming back to the room and putting my feet on the floor was amazing. The bed and pillows were extreme comfortable. I would have given this five stars if it weren't for the nearby trains that caused a constant rumble throughout the room every time it passed by. Lucky they stop at night. However with earplugs I was still able to sleep pretty good. I would return to this hotel and recommend it.",4,2016,01,18
129,Business trip to London,"The location of the hotel is excellent.  The room was comfortable, although difficult to work in as there was no room for a chair between the bed and the desk.  The bed was heavenly and the room quite quiet.  ",5,2016,01,18
129,Consistently good,"I have stayed here many times, it is always really good, nice rooms and a well run hotel. The rooms range from quite small to large, the small rooms are OK for a short stay but if staying longer a larger room would be worth the price difference. ",5,2016,01,17
129,Didn't want to leave,"Amazing way to start the New Year.
What a beautiful hotel, amazing interior design, great food and fantastic service.
I would highly recommend this hotel, the bed was incredibly comfortable, the sheets lovely and crisp - super fluffy towels in the bathroom... and a rubber duckie!
Luxury personified.",5,2016,01,15
129,Excellent hotel,The trip was important to me & I wished to stay somewhere nice. The staff were excellent. Completed requests for extra services with out hesitation. Made bookings for transfers. Spoke to company on my behalf when they where late. The room was comfortable with lovely ensuite. The afternoon tea I had in the lounge was great. I would give them 6 stars if I could.,5,2016,01,15
129,Amazing boutique hotel,"The Ampersand is a darling boutique hotel in South Kensington in London. It is convenient to Harrod's the V&A, The Natural History Museum and Kensington Palace.   There are tons of great restaurants and shops in the neighborhood.     The rooms are well appointed with a complimentary mini bar and perfect mattresses and high thread count linens.    Everything is clean as a pin and the decor is really very adorable and whimsical.  I stayed there for a week alone trying to enjoy some solitude and culture, and it really felt like my home away from home.  Each day around 5 pm I would have tea in their tea room and would watch the rain or catch up on reading.    Their restaurant Apero is also fantastic with great specialty cocktails.   The staff is super friendly and just everything about this hotel felt right for a great vacation.   It is above a tube stop so you do feel some rumbling of the trains, but other than that, NO complaints.  I highly recommend this for a welcoming experience in London.",5,2016,01,14
129,Great place for you and your fury friends,We booked through Mr&Mrs Smith and enjoyed our time there. We especially loved the dog beds and bowls provided for our two fury friends that came with us to explore London. The service was very friendly and the complementary champagne reception was lovely.,5,2016,01,14
129,Comfort and position,"The Ampersand Hotel is one of my favourites Hotels in London.
I have stayed there several times and always left with good feelings and satisfaction.
The position is ideal, two minutes walk from South Kensington metro station. Fulham Rd, Harrods the Museum area, Hyde Park are all within walking distance.
There is a little restaurant within the Hotel that offers good food and delicious breakfasts, fantastic toasts!
The rooms are comfortable and warm, the service professional and fast. I feel at home in London!
The tea room is comfortable, and the cake choices are always very tempting.
The theme of the Hotel is nature and birds in particular. Little cute plastic ducks will meet you in the bathrooms!
There is love for details.
The Hotel is not cheap, but the money is well spent and often you can find offers and discounts.",5,2016,01,14
129,A very comfortable stay,"We stayed at the Ampersand over the weekend and had a great stay. The staff here made a difference, lovely smiley people, always ready to help, this included everyone from reception, bar to housekeeping, well done to the team!

129,Excellent room; Comforting interior; Best location!,"It was a place we could call home at the end of a long winter's day out.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was well-appointed.

I booked in advance for a busy year end period and felt that there was good value in my stay. My partner & I enjoyed it very much!",5,2016,01,10
129,"Great hotel, location & price!","Fully recommended, we will most definitley be returning! 
Restaurants, patisseries, cafes & bars surround this beautifully located hotel- just a stones throw away from Harrods and London's hustle and bustle.

Makes for a great weekend!",5,2016,01,08
129,Great Location.,"I found the hotel to be a pleasant surprise. I booked on line and the images were a good representation of the hotel. The room was comfortable and larger than most small hotels I've stayed in in London. The location was very convenient to shopping and museums and the tube. The staff was helpful with efficient check in and out. 
The only downside was our room faced the street and while you did no hear the traffic noise you could hear the tube rumbling. It was more distracting than disturbing.",4,2016,01,07
129,Pre Christmas visit 2015,"Second visit to the hotel and the continuing warm friendly good service from the hotel team makes for such an enjoyable stay. Will certainly be back again. Nothing is too much trouble. Such a good location for the tube, eating out, Museums and the city centre all within walking distance.",5,2016,01,06
129,Brilliant hotel,"Love this hotel so much! well worth a visit. The staff are very helpful and the location is the best! very beautiful deor. the food is lovely and they even put a cake in the bedroom for our return for my boyfriends birthday. I recommend going for the brekkie! its amazing.
Staff are so helpful and knowledge. ",5,2016,01,06
129,WEEKEND IN LONDON,"The hotel is excellently located just opposite South Kensington station and was ideal for our trips to the Albert Hall, Kensington Palace ,Victoria & Albert Museum and Harrods.We stayed in a deluxe room on the second floor. No noise from the underground. The beds are extremely comfortable,staff excellent..We did not eat at the hotel as there were many excellent cafes and restaurants within walking distance and we didn't think the breakfast room/restaurant had much ambience..",4,2016,01,06
129,Excellent hotel in perfect location,A little gem next to a tube station and taxi rank. The hotel is simply lovely with friendly and efficient staff. The bedroom was lovely with a massive shower and both the Apero restaurant and the Drawing Room for afternoon tea were excellent. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,01,06
129,Perfect place to stay in London!,"Loved this place!
Food was great at the hotel resturant. Bar staff was very knowledgable. Super comfy beds!
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, they made Christmas away from home very special!  
Great location. Walking distance to bars, shops and food. Also very close to the tube. ",5,2016,01,04
129,The Perfect Hotel for a Stay in London,"I really researched this Hotel. I have stayed in London 4 times in the last 7 months and was driving past the Ampersand on a summers day with its windows open and guests sipping coffees in the lounges and I thought it looked lovely.
It is a little more expensive than my previous Hotels but ticked all the boxes.
Location , Service , Rooms, excellent restaurant and great value.
For this stay I needed somewhere very close to a tube as my daughter was arriving late from Heathrow and we would be walking back late with bags, it's literally 3 mins walk from South Kensington tube and in a very safe area.
We had 3 days to do a lot and it's position definitely allowed for that. A short walk to the V & A Museum and National History Museum that just happened to have an outdoor ice skating rink.
As my daughter had flown in from Australia she was tired so we really didn't want to spend a lot of time on tubes or walking great distances and the Ampersand is perfect for this. Straight on the Piccadilly line to Covent Garden, Knightsbridge and Heathrow . We ate at the wonderful downstairs restaurant for breakfast and dinner and it was lovely. Do book as it can be popular in the summer with outside guests but we had no problem. The Continental Breakfast is amazing and great value for money but the a la carte is great too. Dinner was lovely and the waiter was very good suggesting the perfect share platter for 2 ladies who were not really hungry. Reception staff were very friendly and professional, with one gentleman writing a list of restaurants he suggested we visit in Paris. I really liked the feel of this Hotel 5 star in my book without the stuffiness. Large clean comfortable and Quiet Rooms. Would highly recommend and would love to go back.",5,2016,01,04
129,"very nice hotel, location is perfect, looks good and calm, but the front desk staff is not ucceptable.","..location is perfect,. looks good and calm, feels nice, food is good, restaurant is nice, clam, and staff really nice, rooms are very small but okish, but... then front desk staff, day time, is not ucceptable. Out of context, to say the least. ",3,2016,01,04
129,"Comfortable base, friendly staff, great location","We've stayed at the Ampersand on three occasions so far (Jun 2014, Nov 2014 and Oct 2015.) Each time, we've booked a Deluxe double room, and have enjoyed every stay.

The hotel is located across the road from South Kensington underground station, making it easily accessible from the rest of London. There is also a bus stop outside the hotel. It's a 5 minute walk to the Natural History Museum or the V&A, and therefore a couple of minutes more to the Science Museum. It's not much further beyond the museums to the Royal Albert Hall. The surrounding neighbourhood has some pleasant independent restaurants and bars, as well as some chain options like Carluccio. 

There are also a few bakeries/patisseries around the station, which offer good options for a breakfast on the go.

The communal areas of the hotel are very stylish, modern and welcoming. The reception is up a few steps, and shares a floor with a little restaurant (which hosts afternoon tea) and a number of guest rooms. Lifts and a grand central stairway (with a great, multi-storey chandelier) then take you to other levels in the hotel.

In the basement you have the gym, accessible to guests, and the bar/restaurant areas. We've used the bar multiple times, and find the cocktails to be quite pleasant and interesting. The service, however, has always been slow late at night, and invariably involves quite a lot of work to attract the attention of staff, who tend to congregate down one end of the bar. The bar offers limited snacks outside restaurant hours (extremely expensive but very pleasant salted crisps, olives, etc.) so try not to bring an appetite back from a night out.

The rooms we've stayed in have all had the same grey and plum-coloured decor, with deep-pile carpet and king-sized beds. The room sizes have varied considerably, despite all being the same room category and price. We've had a large, accessible room on the street level (not great for privacy, as you need to draw the curtains to avoid being visible to all who pass or wait for buses outside) a fairly small room on the first or second floor, with a very small, enclosed en suite, and a very well-proportioned room on a high floor, with a good-sized en suite and window to the rear of the property.

Each room has had a supremely comfortable bed, slick and quiet air-conditioning, and a large Smart TV. There is a small fridge in each deluxe room, containing one or two bottles of Coke, diet Coke, juices and water. The contents are included in the price, and there's enough room for you to put some of your own drinks in as well. The rooms have always been extremely clean, and the bathrooms have been clean, shiny and well-maintained.

Noise insulation has generally been very good, though the street-level room suffered from some noise from the road outside, and noise from the reception nearby. The latter issue was resolved by closing the vestibule door that led to our room and the one next to it.

In conclusion, this is a very comfortable and stylish hotel in a great location for London's major museums, and the villagey attractions and atmosphere of South Kensington. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the whole hotel is clean and handsomely decorated. 

We'll be staying again.",5,2016,01,04
129,"Ampersand Hotel, Kensington","Stayed here for New Year's Eve, it was quite expensive but it was because of the day we stayed! Rooms were a little smaller than expected but overall and nice stay! Beautiful hotel and we liked the games room and library.",5,2016,01,04
129,Good Hotel,2nd stay at Ampersand and would definitely stay again when in London.  Excellent service and facilities.  This time stayed in a standard double which was a little small.  Last time paid more to stay in superior double which was much better.  Will pay extra next time for a larger room and bed.  Staff excellent.,5,2016,01,04
129,Excellent return visit,Excellent return stay. Quality of everything is high. Reception staff efficient and kind - arranged an ice pack for me after I fell on the way there. Booked a small double but was upgraded to a much larger room (12) but it was a disabled access room so was quite bare and lacking in style compared to other rooms we've seen or stayed in. But we slept well and enjoyed the enormous bed and shower room. Breakfast wasn't as nice as last time and it isn't cheap especially the cooked food. But overall we had a wonderful stay and will return ,5,2016,01,04
129,Fantastic Stay!,"Room was large enough, amenities in minibar was complimentary and overall service as fantastic!

We arrived at 6 on Christmas Day and requested a change from our original reservation. Our request was made with a smile and not only that, our rooms were already ready for us! That took away all the tiredness we had from flying in at 5 into Heathrow. ""It's Christmas, our gift to you"" was the comment from the Manager at the desk.

Location is perfect, just beside the South Kensignton Tube Station, with numerous dining choices in the nearby vicinity. The in-house outlet, Apero also served delightful cocktails and awesome fusion based food.

Overall, a fantastic place to stay in London!",5,2016,01,03
129,"Great service, great location!!","Excellent service!
The hotel is extremely clean, comfortable and convenient to get to.

The staff was helpful and attentive.
We highly recommend this hotel to couples, families, business travelers alike.

Very close to the South Kensington station .... Which makes it convenient to all of London!!",5,2016,01,03
129,"Fantastic hotel, great location, top class staff","As an interlude to a mammoth family Christmas and to celebrate a combined birthday/wedding anniversary/ New-year celebration I had booked a Deluxe Studio for 2 nights.

We were greeted by the excellent front desk staff who encouraged us to take coffee in the Drawing Rooms while they (very sneakily) got on with arranging an upgrade to a suite. What a lovely surprise this was and made our stay even more special than planned.

I cannot praise the staff enough. Everyone we encountered: front desk, housekeeping, bar staff, concierge were relaxed, polite, welcoming and professional. Thank you to all involved for the little touches you made to make our stay memorable.

We ate out a lot and met up with family on Westminster Bridge for the fireworks so didn't get to sample the wonderful menus on offer, but we did try the extensive cocktail list in the Apero Bar... wonderful with superb olives and focaccia to accompany them.

Loved the suite with its balcony, lovely bathroom complete with TV, very comfortable bed, espresso machine... very spacious and simple d√©cor. Very clean also.

We love London and enjoy trying new hotels. The only problem with this hotel is that they make it hard to not want to return. I have a feeling we'll be back again.

Loved our stay - thanks to all involved",5,2016,01,03
129,Fantastic London location,"Fantastic hotel in fab location, 5 minute walk to Natural History, Science and V&A museums. Other than room service snacks we did not eat in the hotel.  Plenty of cafes, restaurants and food stores by the hotel. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,01,03
129,New Year's Eve,"We chose this boutique hotel for a New Year's Eve stay in London having stayed there before.
The hotel is lovely.  We had a quite superior room with an extremely confortable bed.  Lovely linens and toiletries. 
The hotel bar is cosy and comfortable.
The hotel attends to every little detail making the visit even more enjoyable.
The hotel is certainly not inexpensive, yet for that special stay in London it is certainly worth staying there; we shall certainly be returning for a third time.",5,2016,01,01
129,Chic Boutique in the center of everything!,"What we liked: Incredibly clean and updated (a tv in the bathroom!), Friendly & Knowledgable staff. The restaurant onsite was delicious and the wait staff very helpful in making recommendations. The game room and library were good sources of downtime at the end of the day. The hotel is close to everything; the tube, great cafe's across the street, walking distance to sites. It is an undiscovered gem. The only negative feedback would be it can be a bit loud on the lower floors (we were on two) at night.  It wasn't enough to change rooms and after one night the noise was not even noticed again.  I would highly recommend this hotel to any discerning traveler, my family and I can only hope to come back soon.",5,2016,01,01
129,Great hotel!,"A contemporary styled hotel within a beautiful old building.

Breakfasts here are as yummy as they get - you'd be hard to match the quality and selection of food.

The rooms were all well appointed although a separate shower would have been a good addition.

Afternoon teas are a must - we were lucky enough to stay in Christmas time, where choirs sang as we scoffed down our scones jam and cream.

The only negative really was the rumble from the underground. ",4,2015,12,31
129,Hidden Gem!,"What a fantastic hotel - and staff! Superb location for V&A, Natural History Museum, Harvey Nicks & Harrods!
We took advantage of the excellent room service (as my daughter and her friend were using the hotel as a base to attend a ball) - delicious - as was the superb breakfast the following morning. (The only niggle was the service at breakfast was some what slow - when you have very hungry & tired teenage girls in your party).  We were on the 2nd floor and it was quiet however you are aware of the tube running - you can feel the vibrations. ",5,2015,12,31
129,Amazing,The Ampersand was exceptional! Fantastic stay in every aspect. The romms are modern and clean. I loved the whole feel of the hotel and the location is wonderful. We stayed over Christmas and the hotel felt so festive and cheerful.  We will be back for sure. ,5,2015,12,30
129,A perfext stay in a perfect hotel.,"Staying in The Ampersand is a pleasure. The suite was spotlessly clean, nice to stay in and the bed great. We did not notice any cleaning trolley and that is very good.
Everybody of the staff is so helpful! All the arrangements we asked for were organized perfect. The Apero restaurant has fine food and also nice staff.
the hotel is situated in a very interesting area. The V&A Museam, National History Museum, Hyde Park, Harrods....all in walking distance.
Go Ampersand!",5,2015,12,30
129,Nice City Hotel - If you get in-room wifi,"The hotel is nice, although our room was somewhat small. The location is good, just 50m off South Kensington station. 

It was very unfortunate that upon check-in, I was NOT informed about the in-room wifi. We were only told to use the guest wifi, which kept dropping our connections and was most of the time even unavailable. That was VERY annoying and quite impacted my overall experience of the otherwise pleasant stay.

Other than that, trying to upsell me immediately upon arrival is something I normally don't like. The staff though was very attentive and friendly.

We didn't use any of the other services though.",4,2015,12,28
129,Loved it!,"Was in London for 3 nights for work. What an amazing experience. The staff were fantastic - amazing! I booked the base room, they informed me it didn't have a desk in it, and were kind enough to upgrade me. They smiled and welcomed me each time I entered the hotel. The restaurant / bar area was great. It had everything I needed and it was beautiful. The location was brilliant, right next to South Kensington station. Would definitely stay again!",5,2015,12,28
129,Lovely stay,"As they say in London, Lovely.  A small luxury hotel in South Kensington, steps away from the tube, museums and Hyde park.  We occupied 207 & 208, 208 was  small and charming while 207 was much larger as it was a corner room.  We had our two teenage girls stay in 207 as it had a large shower and my wife preferred to have the tub in 208.  Beds and pillows were fantastic.  The heating/cooling system was temperamental so we regulated by opening/closing the window.   The underground must run directly beneath the hotel as we could feel rumblings of it but not enough to be of concern.  Windows were double pane so the street noise was inconsequential.  We enjoyed tea in the lobby and tapas at their restaurant in the basement.  Both were very nice with attentive servers.  With so many options in London, we may or may not be back as we love to try new places.  I would definitely recommend to families and couples.  ",4,2015,12,28
129,Loved it,"Great boutique Hotel, great staff and location. Look forward to our next visit. Clean modern rooms in a great old building. We felt very at home. Seemed like a great scene in the Drawing Room, although we didn't use it as there were so many great options in the area!",5,2015,12,27
129,Convenient location & good hotel,"Great location - good quality hotel with a sense of style. 
Rooms well thought out and decor of high standard.
Everything you need for a short stay in London.
Restaurant good - nice atmosphere.
Our third visit and we will be back.
",4,2015,12,27
129,current visit,"
I am currently staying at this hotel and am having a terrible experience. Rooms located at the ground, first and second floors transfer the vibrations of the underground train below. I can feel the vibrations every two minutes disrupting my sleep and time. When I spoke to the staff who knew of such problem, gave me the worst rooms as alternatives below the level I paid for. This is not my first stay here, I am very dissatisfied and am astonished how it is still holding on to its name and how the service/quality all receded.  Do not stay at this hotel.",1,2015,12,27
129,"Great location, excellent service and a very comfortable room",We are travelling with two young kids so we were very grateful for the front desk staff who did their best to accommodate us offering an early check in and an upgrade to a bigger room. It made such a difference as we had just come off a long haul flight. It is helpful service of this kind which makes a lasting impression. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. The rooms are very comfortable and we had lovely breakfasts at the beautifully decorated restaurant. ,5,2015,12,27
129,Lovely stay,We had a day in London to celebrate a birthday. The staff were friendly and helpful and the third floor room was comfortable and quiet. Great location for restaurants and sights. We will come back I am sure! The rooms are modern and although we ate out for dinner the breakfast was nice. ,5,2015,12,23
129,"Amazing hotel, great location","Nothing too much trouble. Attention to detail is second to none, we will return. Staff were friendly, location was excellent, right opposite to tube station. Room was clean and comfortable. We had early check-in. Lovely place!",5,2015,12,23
129,"Perfect hotel for trips to Hyde Park, museums and Kensington visits","Lovely stay in this friendly and well located hotel.  It was just a stones throw from the Science museum, V&A, natural history museum and Hyde Park as well as all the shops and restaurants of South Kensington and Knightsbridge.  The room was small but very clean and had a wonderfully comfortable king size bed as well as complementary mini bar.  Staff were really friendly and helpful. Overall a great hotel! ",5,2015,12,23
129,Love,"Love this hotel and everything about it! Excellent costumer service, incredibly clean and perfect location! Very elegant but comfortable at the same time! Probably one of my favorite hotels!

Modern and elegant!",5,2015,12,21
129,short stay,"Excellent location and staff, very clean and comfortable, was good value and upgraded on arrival. Didn't eat or use on site facilities. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Would be happy to recommend it.",5,2015,12,21
129,Afternoon Tea Delight,"If you can afford to splash out on afternoon tea this is well worth it. Delicious sarnies and cakes, plenty to go round (you might not need a whole tea per person, especially if you have younger ones). Relaxed modern vibe, boutique but not over the top arty and great location. I didn't think afternoon tea at a London hotel would be my cup of, err, tea...too stuffy and over-priced...but this was a great and fun thing to do.",5,2015,12,20
129,Outstanding hotel in  good location,"This was our 4th visit to the Ampersand Hotel, we just don't bother looking for anything else in London as this is just so good.  It looks traditional but it has a WOW factor in all its parts, bedrooms, restaurant, drawing room, even the staircase which spirals upwards through the centre of the building.  The decoration is interesting and very imaginative, but the bathrooms excel with white and black tiling and excellent fittings and fixtures. Breakfast is one of the best continentals we have had and the full English looks impressive.  Lunch is a calm affair in the Drawing room much better than being crushed up in a nearby caf√©,
The staff are so helpful and friendly always pleased to see you and offer assistance, such nice people.  Box of chocolates/cakes awaited us on our return to the room in the evening.
So close to the V&A and the Natural History Museum, buses to all corners of London and a tube station 50 yards away, perfect location.",5,2015,12,17
129,Excellent,Fantastic Hotel. We cannot thank the staff enough for their 5 star service during our stay. Room was impeccable & the Hotel Facilities are superb. The location is perfect for a weekend of fine dining or shopping.,5,2015,12,17
129,Beautiful hotel,"Great hotel and bar. Very helpful staff too :) 
Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are staying in the Chelsea area. 
We stayed in a deluxe room and booked through Mr & Mrs Smith. 
Very stylish boutique hotel...we will definitely return!",5,2015,12,16
129,Lovely stay,We spend only one night at the Ampersand but we had a really good time! They made us feel like home. The bedroom was so spacious and the staff was so nice and helpful. And the breakfast it is probably the best in town! ,5,2015,12,16
129,Our Ampersand Hotel Stay,"If you are looking for a wonderful place to stay close to Knightsbridge then I would highly recommend it, comfortable, individual and very welcoming we had a fabulous stay.  There are great local bars a cafes, my tip is go out for breakfast and experience the local atmosphere!",5,2015,12,16
129,Amazing hotel,This hotel is in a great location with a station just across the road.  The staff are very welcoming and friendly.   The interior of the hotel is decorated beautifully and the standard of the beds etc is perfect.  Would highly recommend.,5,2015,12,16
129,"80% great, 20% shocking!","Just stayed for one night so this will be brief. Lovely, posh South Ken hotel. Perfect location by the tube and the museums. Gorgeous room, amazing bed. Reception staff beyond lovely. The ""but"" that is most obviously coming is the absolutely shocking service presented not only to us, but other guests around us at breakfast. Hostile doesn't even begin to describe the staff's attitude. They seemed to resent serving everyone, were surly and rude in response to even the most polite requests, leaving me and fellow guests on adjoining tables wondering whether they wanted to actually fight us for daring to order a fry up and some juice. They need to sort it out or they will lose a lot of custom.",4,2015,12,15
129,A small boutique hotel in beautiful South Kensington,"The location is perfect with the South Kensington tube station a few steps away.
The rooms are surprisingly big and clean and the bed and pillows very comfortable.
Although you can feel the underground we really had one of our best sleeps!
The staff was really friendly and helpful and the breakfast rich, fresh and tasty!
I would definitely go there again",5,2015,12,15
129,Really lovely place,"The Ampersand ticks all the boxes for me. Although the lower priced rooms are small, and this is something a lot of people mention, they are beautifully decorated, clean, warm and very comfortable. I believe at the price this is the best hotel in London for all of the above reasons and also for its very convenient location. The staff are worth a mention, always ready to help, warm, friendly people.",5,2015,12,15
129,Great hotel with smelly towles,"Great hotel with friendly staff, good location (although you can hear the underground) and very nice rooms.
A bit disappointing then, that several of the big bathing towels that had just been placed in the room smelled like a sweaty man had used them two days before - without them being washed since...",4,2015,12,14
129,Stay at AMPERSAND Hotel,Excellent saty with a very helpful and professional staff. VERY GOOD BREAKFAST. I will recommand this hotel to colleagues and friends for theyr next stay in London. The hotel is next o Harrods department store and a metro station is around 2 minutes by walking. there is also a taxi station.,3,2015,12,14
129,A night out in London ,"A beautiful hotel in a perfect location in South Kensington.
Greeted on arrival by welcoming and helpful staff and also on reception desk.
The room was just amazing, clean and comfortable and exceeds expectations.
A lovely boutique hotel, excellent restaurant and 24 hr service. Breakfast was perfect",5,2015,12,14
129,"Beautiful Hotel, preferably higher floors","I stayed at the Ampersand during a short business visit to London, the location is great and the hotel is quite cozy and very elegant.  I liked the decor and furnishings, it was very comfortable and service was great.  however being located on top of a subway tunnel made it quite annoying and obviously vibrating whenever a train pulled in.  I had a third floor room and still was annoyed by those occasions.
generally its in a very nice part of West London, and within two minutes walking distance to South Kensington Station on the Picadilly/District/Circle Lines.
The surrounding area is full of restaurants and shops, and is also in direct view of the museums.  I would certainly consider this hotel in my next visit to London, but demand an even higher floor.",4,2015,12,14
129,mid-week visit to Royal Geographical Society,"I was looking for a nice hotel near the Royal Geographical Society and this wonderful hotel was my first choice and what a lovely place.
We were greeted by a pair of receptionists who handled the check-in with speed and humour. We had been given room 314 and when shown in we were amazed by the size, quality and cleanliness of the accommodation.  This in central London is in my experience exceptional as most rooms are shoe boxes with beige colours everywhere not so here!   The staff throughout our stay were helpful 
 and responsive in all our requests nothing was too much trouble.  Unfortunately due to prior commitments we were unable to dine but, as we will only stay here in future an opportunity to eat in the restaurant will arise.",5,2015,12,13
129,Great boutique hotel in perfect neighborhood!,"I've stayed many times at The Ampersand hotel. Love the facility, the restaurant, the lounge/cafe area and the staff are fresh and eager. The rooms are very current and with great amenities. Around the corner from the V&A, Science museum and Hyde Park - great access for running. My favourite place to stay in London. ",5,2015,12,13
129,An unexpected jewel hidden in London,"I travel often on a one day stay basis and normally would expect a nice, safe place to arrive while in the middle of a crazy schedule full of deadlines and, in my line of work, full of details to pay attention too. When I booked (through Travelocity) I saw a nice conveniently located place to help me go through my routine. And then I arrived. And as obsess with paying attention to details as I am, I started quietly enjoying the feeling of having discovered a hidden jewel I was definitely not expecting. Everything was in place, from check-in to check-out, with special mention to one of the most comfortable beds I have sleep in a long time, and specially softness of the towel that after a 12-hours flight you can only dream about. So, here's your review. I hope you are please as I was finding a place that I hope to return anytime soon, and that I hope you understand why I'm hesitant to share with the rest of the world so it stays untouched for a long time. Cheers. ",5,2015,12,13
129,Quick break to London,"Great place to stay, quick trip in from Heathrow, really clean, well furnished and friendly staff, tea room delightful.  Do hear a little noise from the underground but unless you are a light sleeper it would not bother you.  Easy access to all over London but area itself has plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes - a really nice place to be.",5,2015,12,12

129,Night at the Ampersand,"Wonderful location, beautiful decor throughout. Bedrooms a bit on the small side but as it was only one night that was fine. Dressing table in bedroom doesn't have mirror above so not great for ladies doing makeup and hair. However alll in all good hotel and facilities, lots of cafes and bars around and everything is in walking distance (less than 10 minutes to Harrods).",4,2015,12,10
129,Exceeded my expectations,"Our first time at this hotel and glad we gave it a try, staff are very friendly, courteous and obliging, hotel rooms were fantastic modern but in keeping with the period building, in fact both parties were upgraded to suits which was a pleasant surprise. Lounge area very accommodating food and drink all satisfactory, breakfast was really good. Would defiantly recommend this hotel. Oh, nearly forgot the in-room entertainment system included a TV in the bathroom, nice touch, and there was a complimentary soft drinks bar, on top of that we were told to keep a very nice and fashionable umbrella we'ed used, never had that before!",5,2015,12,09
129,Stunning hotel with helpful and friendly staff,"We have stayed at the Ampersand several times and have never been disappointed with any aspect of our stay.

Loved the contemporary and fun decor and the tea room has some delicious cakes and cookies that you can order to be delivered in your room as well.
The staff was fantastic, so friendly, always smiling and extremely helpful giving us directions on how to get to where we wanted to go, where to eat and how to use the subway.
Our room looked out into the street with and yet there was practically no noise and we had a wonderful sleep as the bed is extremely comfortable.

We've stayed at the Ampersand before and so were delighted that we had the sane room as last time as the bed was so comfortable! (I'm sure they are comfy in the other rooms too..)

The continental breakfast here is great with a delicious selection of continental treats in particular the little individual pots of Bircher muesli.

One slightly negative thing I would say is that as lovely as our room was, it was a little dark. Additional lighting wouldn't go amiss!",4,2015,12,04

A bit pricy but in the end very nice rooms, even the singles.

129,Amazing hotel üòç,"I stayed In this hotel for my boyfriends 21st birthday.. It is an amazing hotel, set in a handy location easy to get to the main sites in London!.. The staff were so helpful. The hotel was beautifully furnished up to a very high standard and had just those extra touches which made it a memorable stay. ",5,2015,12,03
129,Weekend break,"Very impressed with both the hotel, room and quality of service provided by staff. Staff must be commended for their high quality service and friendliness and could not be faulted. A couple of minutes walk from South Kensington tube and taxi rank outside front doors.  Room was a very good size with a seating area and the bathroom had a large walk in shower and a separate free standing bath all to a high standard. Very quiet, our room looked out at the back onto the courtyard at the back of the French Institute / Lycee Francais Charles deGaulle so there was space and views over the roofs to the towers of the Natural History museum. Nothing really to dislike about the place. Apero restaurant is a bar type venue so fairly casual so  if you want something more formal you may be disappointed. ",5,2015,12,03
129,Gorgeous base for exploring London,Meticulous attention to detail in this beautiful hotel. The drawing room is so welcoming. Our room was on the small side but everything we needed was there so no complaints. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2015,12,03
129,Conflicted,"i have stayed at the hotel 4 times. Location, staff, comfort of the bed, quality toiletries keep me coming back. The single rooms, however, are impossibly small. I had only one suitcase, but if you want it open you literally cannot get around the bed to the closet. It is London, rooms everywhere are small and expensive. I may have to find another hotel next time since I doubt I am getting a good value here.",4,2015,12,02
129,London stay,"Excellent location in South Kensington. Would highly recommend this hotel. Would have liked to be up from ground floor but accommodations were very nice. Staff was friendly, rooms were clean and well appointed.

129,Lovely boutique hotel in great location.,Lovely boutique hotel. My room was a bit small but the bed was wonderful and the bathroom was nice.  The location is great--steps from the underground and walking distance to museums. I would definitely return and will recommend The Ampersand to friends and family.,4,2015,12,02
129,Perfect location for museum visits,"Perfect location next to South Kennsington tube station. Easy access to central London via the District line. Rooms are small but comfortable. Staff is very friendly and helpful in making suggestions. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel, which is great for transportation...not so great for crowd gatherings at hotel entrance. Overall, great location and value.
      
      ",5,2015,12,01
129,Lovely touches but a teeny room,"What I liked:
. Very convenient location opposite the South Kensington underground station.
. Original yet elegant design of the public spaces and rooms.
. Egyptian cotton bed linens.
. Two types of pillows:  firm and soft.
. Radiant heat and rain shower head in the bathroom.
. iMacs and color printer available at all times.
. Fast Wi-Fi.
. Very friendly and professional staff.
. Lunch in the drawing rooms.
. Night-time quiet (although there is a noisy school behind the hotel).

What I didn't like:
. Teeny size of the room.
. Very confusing over-designed light controls. 
. Electronic do-not-disturb sign that can be turned on accidentally, resulting in no cleaning of the room that day.
. Creaking floors.",4,2015,12,01
129,Beautiful Hotel in a great location,"Amazing hotel with so comfy beds! I really enjoyed my stay here, the staff were super friendly, great decor and overall a wow experience! The location also is great - just next to South Kensington tube station so it is so easy to get around and explore gorgeous London!",5,2015,11,30
129,A Great Boutique Hotel,"Still sitting here in my room at The Ampersand as I write this review. After three nights here (and one to go), I can say this is one of the better boutique hotels I've stayed in throughout my travels. 

I'm in a Superior room, and it is (except in size, but that's typical for London). My king bed is comfortable, and the bathroom is half the size of the room. The toiletries provided are among the best I've experienced ... and the floor is heated. I live in Miami, and I think I'd love standing on a heated floor, that's how soothing it is on my tired tootsies.

There's a minibar fridge, which is stocked with glass bottles of water, sodas, juices, and milk ... and it's complimentary. You can also make tea and coffee with what they provide in-room. The Wi-Fi is also completely free ... and it's the fastest I've experienced in my travels around the UK. Yu can control the lighting from various points around the room, set your thermostat, and even request housekeeping or not to be disturbed digitally from inside the room.

The staff is friendly and helpful. I can't speak to the restaurants (or room service) here, since I haven't availed myself of them.

Finally, the location is great. I've walked to the Royal Albert for a concert, Hyde Park, Harrods ... I even walked to the Thames past Buckingham Palace and Parliament (a bit of a walk, but doable). There are great restaurants and shopping in the neighborhood, and the South Kensington tube station is literally across the street.

All in all, a great little hotel, one that I'd happily stay in again.",5,2015,11,30
129,Lovliest Hotel in All of London,"I would never want to stay anywhere else in London.  This is the most fun and classy hotel I have ever stayed at with the best staff.  Each room is a delightful surprise - and I'll admit I popped my head in every single one of the restrooms in the restaurant to look at the cool wallpaper.  Every single little detail was thought of here.  And for the best high tea you could have, stop in their restaurant.  Even my husband who was dubious of English tea LOVED it as the food was amazingly delicious.  I couldn't stop thinking about the scones when we got home, and took a chance and emailed to see if they might share the recipe and was slightly shocked when they did!! What excellent service!",5,2015,11,30
129,Brilliant location and stylish - small rooms,"Stayed two night with my 4 year old son. Great hotel with a brilliant location just next to the South Kensington underground. Nearby you have small restaurants, coffe shops and pubs. It is a stylish hotel with nice interior and modern look and feel. Rooms are very small but modern. Nice touch that the minibar is for free - not a lot to choose from - but it's free.  
Staff is friendly and helpfull. Always smiling and making you feel welcome. 
Breakfast is ok, had the buffet, not the best selection to choose from but it works.",5,2015,11,30
129,Cute weekend getaway,"Perfectly located in South Kensington, minutes walk away from Harrods/Knightsbridge a cute little hotel. Rooms are nice for a weekend getaway yet too small for a longer stay (although it has to be said that's a general problem in London) Nicely decorated rooms with small yet well outfitted bathrooms offering a great choice of toiletries .
Also great for high teas which can be taken in the lounge of the hotel.",4,2015,11,30
129,Just Excellent,"We're reasonably regular visitors to London and always stay in the Kensington area; but found it hard to find a hotel that we were completely satisfied with - until now.  We did have a little glitch at the start of our stay; but the staff responded superbly.  Our room was a decent size - unlike many others in the area.  The bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent.  We didn't have dinner there, but will next time. Lots of facilities - gym, the library etc. Staff were superb, friendly, efficient and were always around, but never overbearing.  All in all, a lovely hotel; we'll be back.",5,2015,11,30
129,pure class and style,"Interior design is gorgeous.  A little funky, a little British and a lot groovy.  Ingo Maurer light fixture residing on every floor.  Fantastic service, location and interior. Super friendly staff.  Just down the road from Harrods, Victoria and Albert museum and Natural History Museum.  Staff were very accommodating and lovely.  One can see the signage from South Kensington tube stop. Overall superb!

129,"Nice area, nice hotel, small rooms","it¬¥s around 200 pounds for a double room, in a great location with a lot of restaurants around, but the rooms are really extra small. nevertheless I think the value for money is better than in most other London hotels, so I would recommend it to other people!
Continental breakfast offers a wide choice of pastries, muslis, fruits, breads, spreads etc. so there is nothing to complain about.
Staff is very helpful, checkout was quick.",4,2015,11,26
129,Adorbs!!,"TINY room and quite pricy, but it was all worth it. We loved our stay at the Ampersand hotel - LOVED the service and decor - and the bathroom...oh, that bathroom sure made me feel fancy! The neighborhood was also wonderful. Highly recommended!",5,2015,11,26

129,Very small rooms,"Good location, nice facilities, nicely decorated and friendly staff.  I had booked a single room which was quite dark but the main problem was there was no space in the room for anything other than the bed!  Shame as otherwise this is a nice boutique hotel which I would stay at again but not in a single room!",3,2015,11,22
129,"Good location, excellent staff","Perfect location. Close to V&A. 30 seconds from underground. Coffee, bakery in close proximity. Excellent staff. Always eager to help proactively. Can't find anything that I didn't like about the staff, especially at the front desk and Drawing Room. Had an afternoon tea at there, which is another plus to the hotel. Staff at Apero were less...welcoming, I would say, though. Stayed in a single room. Very small almost the size of queen bed. ",4,2015,11,22

129,London Jazz week !!,"This is a very lovely hotel, well located for our needs. The staff are friendly and efficient. The room was quite small but had everything we needed for our stay. The Tea / Coffee etc were of good quality as were the Toiletries. Dressing Gown, Slippers and Hair Dryer, Mini Bar and plenty of Cushions !!

Close proximity to V&A and other museums was great and close also to lots of bars and restaurants - although weather stopped us travelling too far!",4,2015,11,18
129,Don't sit in the tea room,"We arrived and checked in, by the reception is a tea room that at the time was half empty, so we sat down, we were approached by an unhappy looking waiter who asked if we had a reservation, when we said no, I'm not kidding he literally turned his back on us and started to mumble something under his breath.  When he didn't return to our table we called him overonly to be abused by a rude waiter for not having an appointment - never again!!!",1,2015,11,18
129,"Very good, but could be better","Overall, I'd recommend this hotel.
I think that the hotel's amenities are far superior to the service that is provided.
Small but well appointed rooms.
Great area.
Good value.
Staff and service were both adaquate, but nothing special.

129,"Stylish, well located, good value","Location was excellent for our needs. Walking distance to Hyde Park, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and V&A. South Kensington tube stop right out the door and umbrellas in the room and lobby in case you forget. Wonderful array of dining options and pastry shops surround the hotel. 

Bathroom was luxurious and sexy. Lovely scented toiletries and thoughtful amenities.
Complimentary mini bar stocked with milk, apple juice, orange juice, coca cola, still and sparkling water. Truly set up to be a home away from home.

Bed was too comfortable. 

Only real downsides are that the room was small, even after an upgrade and that the train is somewhat audible from the ground floor rooms. However, I've only ever stayed in small rooms in London so I imagine this is the norm and the noise didn't bother me once I got over my jetlag. 

Really lovely hotel and I would like to stay there again. 
",4,2015,11,16
129,November trip,"Great stay in london at The Ampersand. Service was great and the room was comfortable. The bed was superb and the bathroom and amenities were great. I would book this hotel again and highly recommend it!
      ",5,2015,11,15
129,Ok but not great,"My wife and I stayed at The Ampersand for four nights in early November and while it was nice and ok we expected a bit more.  

There were a few glimmers of good service however in general we felt the staff could have done a little more or at least had a more welcoming attitude. 

There was no bellman or doorman when we arrived to help with luggage.  Not a big deal but as there are only stairs in the foyer this was less than ideal.  

We had a few of these type of incidents during our stay and the general sense from the staff was we could have asked.  My feeling is in a good hotel we should not need to ask.  Service should be anticipated and natural.  

The room was just ok, it was on the ground floor, a bit small and there was steady noise from the underground.   On one occasion we came to the room and there was a step ladder in the room with an open window.  No workman on notice in sight.  The front desk was advised and again they dealt with it however not impressive.  

The hotel's location is great and the general facility is very nice.  

The restaurant in the hotel, Apero is very nice and really made up for some of the hotel's short comings. 

Overall we would stay here again however would have lower overall expectations. ",3,2015,11,14
129,Fantastic place to stay,"A fantastic hotel, great location. Extremely friendly helpful staff. Nothing is to much trouble. Kids playroom in basement next to bar. What a great idea allowing us to have a drink I peace. The room was excellent. Wonderful boutique hotel.",5,2015,11,11
129,Five star in every way ,"We stayed at the Ampersand for 2 nights to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary. Everything about this hotel was just about perfect! A beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean room with some nice little extra touches including the duck in the bathroom! Very convenient for the tube and the museums, a wide choice of good restaurants nearby. We'd especially like to thank the lovely girl at reception who really did make our stay extra special. We will definitely choose the Ampersand for our next stay in London.

129,Charming hotel with great service,I stayed one night at the Ampersand hotel and was very please with the kindness and service of the staff. The room was a bit tiny but it is nicely decorated with all the needed amenities. I really enjoyed the restaurant where the drinks and food was truly amazing. The hotel is also very close to the subway with lots of activities around the hotel (I found the time to visit the V&A museum and bought some nice gifts for Christmas at their store). This hotel will be my first choice on my next stay in London.,5,2015,11,09
129,Nice but didn't rock my boat.,"This hotel is in a great location, near to museums, restaurants and bars. Thats essentially why we chose it. However, whilst the decor throughout was  tasteful the junior suite we booked was tiny- disappointingly so for what we paid. Upon entry into our suite, we noted that the lounge area could barely take my husband and I, we were almost sitting on top of each other.  There were tea and coffee facilities provided which was nice.The bedroom was very dark with a tiny  window in the corner, the bed was comfortable though with lovely linen.  The bathroom was quaint and well stocked with towels. We did have a great view of the high street however which did partially make up for the smallness and darkness. All in all whilst this is a popular hotel, I just didn't feel that it was value for money for what we got, the ambiance was ok but there was something lacking and  it just didn't do it for us.",4,2015,11,08
129,An engaging stay.......,"The hotel was well positioned for a few days of museum hopping and some visits into central London. Overall the quality of the room was above average and the service superior. The room (Deluxe Double) was large and very clean and well fitted. If staying in London for a few days, organise a Visitor Oyster Card for use on the underground and on buses....it is well worth it. We found a wonderful little Italian restaurant 3Bella Italia"" in Kendrick Place a 5 min walk from the hotel....good food and friendly staff.",5,2015,11,08
129,Fantastic hotel!,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely hotel. The rooms are great, with extremely comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms. The location is excellent , very close to the underground station, and with many cafes and restaurants nearby.

129,Top Notch Hotel and 5* Location,"We enjoyed very much our first stay at the Ampersand Hotel.  Gorgeous Hotel and the restaurant has relaxed, personable staff and fantastic food, excellent kitchen team and Chef.  It was only one night so we could go to an event at Royal Albert Hall but we will be back. ",5,2015,11,06

129,beautiful hotel in a great location,"We came to the Ampersand after staying at 2 different hotels in Soho (both of which were wonderful) We found that the Ampersand was extremely well run. It looked great, the staff were wonderful and our room as roomy by London standards and well decorated. The location is also wonderful being next to South Kensington tube and near the Victoria and Albert Museum. We enjoyed the more peaceful atmosphere of this location after the bustle of Soho.",5,2015,11,02
129,Disappointing,"On a positive note, the location of the hotel is brilliant for exploring central London and the staff are very professional and helpful. However, the Apero restaurant at night is more like a diner and less like a place you would want to share a memorable meal. The menu is limited and not appetizing. Surrounding hotels offer dinner at better prices and choices. The double room we shared was soooo disappointing. It was too small and overpriced. There were coffee stains on the wall, perhaps unnoticed by cleaning staff. ",2,2015,10,31
129,Surprised & delighted,"We have stayed in more expensive hotels in London, but none of them have been as welcoming and exceptional as Ampersand. From the first moment we walked in until we checked out, the staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable. The room was HUGE and it was so wonderful to have both a bath and a stall shower in the bathroom. The seating area in the room was flexible and allowed us several options for working or watching TV. I would happily go back!",5,2015,10,30
129,First time in London,"We absolutely loved this hotel, great location, the Hotel was beautiful. Wonderful staff very personable and kind. We felt comfortable the moment we arrived.

129,Sing me a song - the piano room!,"From the natural history-esque themed wall paper to the matching books and wall paper in the room, this funky little botique hotel has thought of most things and successfully compacted it into a neat  spaces. Heated floors in the bathroom, comfy beds, extra power points in the desk, and TV speaker in the bathroom. Super comfy bed and lovely staff, heat location too. This place creates a fresh vibe and modern twist on a beautiful old building. Of course, the rooms might be a bit tight, but this is London..right?! ",4,2015,10,30
129,Beautiful,"I chose this hotel because of the decor and its location - it is right around the corner from the V&A Museum.  The service was outstanding - reception staff (I wish I'd noted her name) was friendly, professional and very helpful.  I was upgraded which was lovely and I would go back.  I travel alone and it just felt comfortable.  I'd recommend the downstairs area gets a change of colour - upstairs the Drawing Room is so colourful but the transit to the restaurant and library is a bit on the clinical side and doesn't flow.  However, the breakfast was superb and the environment lovely.",4,2015,10,29

The breakfast is great and whilst it's not cheap, it is a good choice for a short stay in London.  The rooms aren't huge but the bed is super comfy (and huge!) and you have everything you need.

As a one night stop-over this hotel was a good choice.",4,2015,10,25
129,Fantastic Hotel,"Easily accessible, lovely staff, fantastic rooms and delicious food...and a gym.

129,Nice boutique hotel,"The location of this hotel could not possibly be any better - good shops and restaurants, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, and several of London's famous museums are all within easy walking distance. Also, the South Kensington tube station is only a minute away, thus allowing easy access to the entire city. The common areas of the hotel are attractive, bright and cheerful, although our room was a little dark and drab, but still perfectly comfortable and very quiet. Breakfast in the basement restaurant was excellent in terms of quality, quantity and freshness, and staff throughout the hotel were unfailingly obliging and friendly.",4,2015,10,25

129,A beautifully boutique experience,"I don't necessarily write reviews, I was sent here filling out a hotel survey. However I will say this: if you are considering staying at The Ampersand Hotel, make your reservation now, you won't regret it. Fabulous boutique hotel in a great location, close to public transport and many types of food establishments nearby. High level of service, food and amenities, our experience with the staff was wonderful. The rooms were lovely, very well appointed and clean. We stayed in a deluxe room with a stand-in shower as to our request. We would have preferred a rainfall shower head but the tension relieving head was still nice. To have a complimentary mini bar  and wifi available was great and the beds are amazing, you will definitely have the most comfortable sleep. 

When I was looking for a hotel to fit our needs, this one ticked all the boxes, and reading reviews from previous guests greatly assisted in finalising my decision. With that in mind, I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone and will stay again for future trips to London without a second thought. Book! You will love it.

Partner took me here for my birthday and we had a great time. Can't wait to go back! The facilities are great too.... Gym downstairs. One of the best hotels I have ever been too and I've been to loads! ,5,2015,10,24
129,"Luxury Boutique, fantastic location!","My husband and I stayed at The Ampersand for 5 nights as our first stop on our honeymoon. We were recommended by a friend and the experience did not disappoint!
This hotel is a luxurious boutique with excellent service to match. From the doorman to reception and the restaurant, we experienced high end service at all times. 
We stayed in the Deluxe Studio Room which was decorated in botanical style, with a king bed, enormous bathroom with TV built into the shower, beautiful amenities, Nespresso machine and tea making facilities. 
This hotel also has a gym which is rare for a boutique. We dined at the restaurant Apero most days for breakfast and dinner which I highly recommend. They have fantastic cocktails too!
The location is perfect, a short walk to South Kensington station, restaurants, cafes, Harrods, museums and Hyde park. 
Will return to this hotel for our next trip!
Thank you Ampersand!! :) ",5,2015,10,23
129,Perfect London Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Ampersand Hotel for the first two nights of our honeymoon.  We actually live in London but after our wedding, had lots of out of town guests to see off, so we decided to stay in town for convenience and comfort.  We got much more than we bargained for! First of all, with savings on early booking, the room was a steal and on top of that, we got a free upgrade to a suite which was comfortable, spacious and beautifully decorated.  The location is great for getting around the city.

Reception and concierge were prompt in greeting us and we were taken to our room and shown where everything was.  We were also surprised with a honeymoon sweet treat brought to us from the kitchen by the concierge.  A lovely gesture.  The tv screen in the bath was luxurious, as were the complimentary toiletries!  We even got to keep our little & rubber duck.  The bed was huge and very comfortable.

We had a light lunch in the tea room and breakfast the following day and both meals were delicious and the service was great.  

Thank you Ampersand for giving us a great start to our honeymoon.

 So much more quaint and personal than a big chain. High standards of cleanliness.

129,Charming Hotel,We stayed here for one night with our 3 month old baby. They provided a crib for our baby. Staff was very friendly. The mini fridge is free of charge for any drinks. The staff is wonderful. The hotel vibe is very fun! this is my second time staying here. the location i close to shopping and subways. ,4,2015,10,22
129,Location the winner,"Stayed with family members on 2 occasions close together. We found the very close proximity to the underground station South Kensington most useful. Lots of food outlets close by as well as Knightsbridge shopping . The rooms varied , despite booking them similarly. At the best they were very comfortable but others less attractive. The rooms we not available to move into on both occasions despite arriving late afternoon. Breakfast was well worth it and comparable in cost to times we went out for the first meal of the day. We would stay again because of the location and overall good facilities",4,2015,10,21
129,Lovely hotel in a great location,"This is a beautiful hotel and in a great location, very central and just a few minutes walk to the underground, bars, cafes, restaurants and shops. The room was as per the website gallery photos - very pretty and well equipped, very luxurious and comfortable superking beds. The staff and CS was excellent. Recommend rooms above ground level to avoid noise from tube and traffic for light-sleepers! Breakfast was excellent, good choice/quality/service and a beautiful breakfast room. Lovely experience. We will definitely book again. ",5,2015,10,21

129,6 day stay at the Ampersand,"We had a lovely experience staying at the Ampersand last week. We (my husband, me, and our adult daughter) booked 2 deluxe rooms. My husband and I had the slightly larger room 107 and daughter had room 106. The rooms were perfect for us: clean and inviting. I was dazzled by how clean and fresh everything was in the room, even on our 6th day. Housekeeping is very attentive to detail. The room's bathroom had the whitest grout I've ever seen. Really, it was just a perfect room for us, although this room does not have a great view, as it overlooks what looks to be air/heating units, which you can't hear at all. Being in the ""back"" of the building, the room is away from street noise.

I should note that being on the first floor, you can feel (and ""hear"" just a tiny bit) the tube as trains go under the building. However, I have excellent hearing and because I don't like noise, I always travel with ear plugs to sleep. So this wasn't a bother at all for me. My husband is not as sensitive to noise and did not ""hear"" anything and went to sleep very easily without ear plugs. 

The room has a mini frig and it is stocked daily with free water, sparkling water, juice and milk. This is such a nice touch after a long day out and about. You also get the use of slippers and bathrobes. 

The hotel staff at the reception desk were wonderful and attentive. Really, I can't say enough nice things about this place. It was definitely worth the money.",5,2015,10,20

We would all come and stay here again on our next trip to London. ",4,2015,10,20

129,Perfect!,"I have stayed in a number of high end hotels in London and I can honestly say that The Ampersand beat them hands down when it came to service and attentiveness. The staff went out of their way to meet every request I made and were always so friendly and welcoming. The hotel is beautifully decorated inside and very comfortable. The double room I stayed in was cosy and possible a bit small for a couple but just fine for a lone traveller. The bed was comfortable, the air con easy to understand and the bathroom was clean and modern. I also loved the fact it provided eye make up remover in their bathroom kit. Genius! The drawing room is light and airy and very pretty, the perfect place to meet for afternoon tea or a glass of champagne. I had dinner in Apero, the hotel restaurant, one evening with a friend and once again met with the same high standard of service and attentiveness. The food was delicious and the place was buzzing. It is in a great location, opposite South Kensington tube station and I found my regular haunts of Kensington, Knightbridge and Sloane Square were just a short walk away. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2015,10,18
129,Charming hotel in great location in South Kensington,"The Ampersand is a quaint hotel located in what seems a safe neighborhood and a few hundred feet from an Underground making it convenient to getting around London.  There are several small restaurants to get breakfast at within close proximity.

We stayed in room 410 which has a king bed and a small patio overlooking the front of the hotel and street.  Note at the time of this review, there is some construction work across the street which starts about 8:30am daily.  It didn't bother us much b/c we were already up but if you're looking to sleep in you may want to book a room in the back of the hotel.  The room was clean, of decent size with a small couch, desk, espresso maker and complimentary drinks (soda, juice and milk).  The bathroom was also nicely appointed and the heated floors were a nice touch.  The room had a converter receptacle and USB port in the desk, convenient to power up your phone and or iPad.  

The bed was soft, clean and definitely the most comfortable we have slept in in a hotel.

Staff was friendly and helpful.  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but it looked very nice.  

It was a bit pricey, but we enjoyed every aspect of the Ampersand.",5,2015,10,18

The staff was very attentive and food at Apero restaurant in the hotel was devine. Even room service at 3am was quick, thoughtfully prepared, and reasonably priced. Our only concern was a slight stale odor in room 210 that was easily remedied by opening the window and freshening the air. Indeed a hidden gem.",4,2015,10,18

From the less than positive perspective, there was a huge double shower when I would have preferred a bath and the lack of counter space in the bath is not ideal for a female business traveler.

129,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed overnight and chose the hotel for the proximity to the embassies in South Kensington. We booked a superior double (see photos). The only reason I didn't give the review a 5 star was because of the noise of the passing trains at night (we were on the side of the hotel overlooking the school), plus we didn't dine in so couldn't rate that aspect. We were too tired for the train noise to bother us (plus I had encountered this having lived in London before) so it wasn't a big deal for us. The staff were helpful (carrying buggy up and down the stairs at the entrance, suggesting places to eat, etc) and very sweet to the baby.",4,2015,10,12

129,Very good,"Great hotel! Service was fantastic, lovely relaxed atmosphere, great food, lovely breakfast and comfortable rooms. I stayed two night in different rooms. The first was in I think 417 which really was a tiny room and certainly not one for cat swingers. So small there was nowhere to put my bag! The waiter arrived with my dinner for room service and asked where I would like him to put the tray. I assume this was out of habit or pure curiosity because there really was no where to put it! Two points to make: firstly the house or mixed salad was just a selection of leaves. Not really good enough. And secondly the fruit salad was  tiny and overpriced. I can handle the overpriced bit. It is a London hotel and that is fine. But if you are giving me say 30p's worth of fruit and charging me ¬£6.50 , why not give me 90p's worth of fruit and charge me ¬£7.10? You make the same cash profit and I get 3 times as much fruit. You are just as happy and I am much happier. 417 was also strangely noisy - I could hear people talking both above me and next door. I was moved to a larger room on the 2nd night and it was excellent and much quieter despite facing the main road.",4,2015,10,09
129,Looking forward to coming back to again and again...,"Just love every single thing about it!!! All parameters of the Ampersad Hotel exel. Have to mention the outstanding design. The Umbrella that apeared in my cupboard for a sudden rainy day. The blue duck in the shower. The complimentary wi-fi and mini bar.

129,I Won't Stay Anywhere Else in London,"Just returned from my fourth visit to the Ampersand and (as if it were possible), each visit gets better and better. From the time I make my reservations until I reluctantly leave, the entire staff goes out of their way to make sure that I feel welcome, cared for, and valued. I love the quirky design touches, the beyond-comfortable beds, the luxurious bathrooms, and the delicious cocktails in the hotel lounge. The location -- a block from South Kensington Tube -- can't be beat. Are there less pricey options in London? Probably.  Does any hotel offer a better value for my money? No way! Thank you, Ampersand!",5,2015,10,08
129,Two check-on bags....,"If the room was a bit bigger, I would've easily given it a 5.  But with two large suitcases, it was a little tight. But I wouldn't let that dissuade anyone. The staff is very friendly but still professional. The rooms were clean and comfortable - a nice mixture of modern touches in a classic space.  It's a great location - half a block from South Kensington station.  The attached restaurant is great.  And those are the things that really count, right?  This was a really good value - I would go back there without hesitation.",4,2015,10,08

129,Elegant and relaxing,"My wife and I visited The Ampersand for a weekend stay in London, initially chosen because of its proximity to the Royal Albert Hall.  I was impressed by the email that preceded our arrival, checking whether we had any special requirements and giving us relevant information about the hotel, and this attention to detail continued during our stay.

The staff at the hotel were without exception engaging, friendly, efficient and helpful.

Our room rate did not include breakfast, so it was not our expectation to have this meal at the hotel.  However, it was sensibly priced, so we ate breakfast at the hotel on both mornings of our stay.  Absolutely delicious, and very good value given the quality and the environment.

Thanks again to all at The Ampersand, we look forward to our next stay.",5,2015,10,08
129,Nice for a weekend getaway,"We spent a couple of nights at this hotel. Our first room had a horrible smell in the bathroom but the staff sorted this out for us while we were out having dinner and drinks. Our new room was quite nice. It didn't smell, it was well appointed, it had lovely high ceilings and it was comfortable. The location also worked well for our purposes. I made use of the gym and thought it was adequate. The hotel staff were very nice and professional and we had an enjoyable stay.",4,2015,10,07

129,Potentially lovely but not quite there ,"I booked a standard double and to be fair in confirmation they did describe the tiny size of the room. It really was tiny which was ok except there really wasn't anywhere at all to put anything. 
The ""wardrobe"" had a rail above the kettle and tea tray which, even if the tray was moved, wasn't long enough to hang a shirt. It's been a while since I hung my clothes on a lamp in a hotel of this class! 
On the plus side, really comfortable bed, good quality linen, all the little touches in the bathroom and free soft drink minibar, proper coffee etc were great. Staff were excellent and efficient, great location and nicely quirky decor. 

They comped my 2 drinks when I checked out and mentioned my disappointment which I didn't expect or request and again, that was impressive service. 

Overall I'd return but would need to trade up room wise.   ",3,2015,10,02
129,A lovely gem in Kensington,"I chose The Ampersand for its location as my mother and I only had two nights in London, after several days getting my daughter settled at university in Leicester, before flying home to Canada. As my mother has some mobility issues, I wanted something where we could easily walk to cafes and restaurants as well as public transporation if we chose. The hotel was ideally suited for this purpose as the Hop-on-Hop-off bus tour has a stop directly in front of the hotel, so we were able to take advantage of a full day of sightseeing. The underground/subway also has a stop less than a minutes walk from the hotel and Harrod's was about a 12 minute walk away.  We dined one night at Apero, the Mediterranean restaurant in the hotel and the second night at an Tuscan restaurant called Riccardo's.  Both were excellent. Like most European hotels, the rooms are not large -  however, they have a very good use of space and extremely high ceilings so don't feel too small. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay at The Ampersand again when I am back in London.  ",5,2015,10,01
129,It was nice could be better,"The location of this hotel is very convenient.  The tube is literally 1 block away.  There are lots of little eateries around and it is on the bus line.  It was a rainy 1st day but luckily they provide umbrellas in the entry way so that was very helpful.  The front desk staff were all very helpful and accommodating.  We arrived early and our room was not ready, but they did offer suggestions of things to do in the meantime and drinks in the caf√©.  The room itself was very small, but I guess that is the norm in London.  There was not really much space to open and use your suitcase.  The view from our window was of a brick building so essentially we had no view.  The bathroom was decent enough, however the glass enclosed shower had a sewer smell when you showered.  That was totally disgusting.  Local calls on the room phone were free.  Housekeeping did a good job of cleaning and changing the sheets every day.  Overall the shower smell and extremely small size of the room were the only downfalls.  I would return to this hotel, but I would definitely prefer a king room instead of a double full.",4,2015,10,01

129,Perfect Kensington Stay,"Fantastic stay!
The staff are amazing, the facilities are lovely and immaculate (decoration is so chic is hurts), and little details like a free mini fridge stocked daily with water and soft drinks really take the Ampersand up to another level. 

The neighbourhood is beautiful and lovely to walk around - 10/15 minute walk to Harrods, another 10 minutes to Buckingham Palace and their lovely gardens.
A block or two away from some stunning museums, and the tube stop is right around the corner to take you to anywhere you need to go to in central London.
Breakfast at the hotel's restaurant is great, but so is Muriels down the street (perfect brunch food), and the most decadent of eclairs right across the street.

Fabulous stay, lovely service, perfection location - will be back!",5,2015,09,27

There are some fabulous restaurants and shopping in Chelsea is within walking distance.  the breakfast in Apero was great.  The entire staff was wonderful in every way.  I did request a walk in shower , but would have preferred a room with a bit more light on upper floor.  However, our room was very quiet in the back with no street noise--just lacking sunlight.....but overall a great place to stay.....would highly recommend and get the larger rooms if your budget allows.....Great beds as well as amenities....

129,Doggy delight,"We arrived to be greeted by the lovely Indira at the front desk who quickly arranged for our room to be more accommodating for our cockerpoo, providing not only a lovely bed for us but also a very comfy dog bed also.  All the staff were very welcoming and helpful during our stay and would happily return in the future.",5,2015,09,27
129,As Lovely As I Had Hoped,"We really enjoyed the hotels's location as it was near the Tube and plenty of restaurants.  The area is quiet but lively.  I needed to see a doctor and the staff directed me to one just a block away who was kind, thorough and well trained.  The front desk staff was always pleasant and helpful, especially Beatrice, Aline, Indira and Stacey (Tracy?).  Our room was spacious and the bathroom had both a walk-in shower and huge, deep tub with a television at one end.  Would love to return to this home away from home.  My only suggestion would be to provide more light in the room.",5,2015,09,26
129,"Stylish, but noisy.","Ampersand is everything you'd want from an upscale, boutique hotel. Almost. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, comfortable and stylish. And what a location! The only problem is the train from the South Kensington tube stop rattles the building every 3-5 minutes or so from early morning until, well, early morning. Maybe because I live in earthquake country I was more sensitive to the frequent rumble, but it definitely made for less-than-restful sleep. I am surprised to hear little mention of this in other reviews. Was it just the room I was in?",3,2015,09,26
129,Great hotel,"Quite a large boutique style hotel just 100m from South Kensington station. The staff are very welcoming and helpful and the room although quite small was excellent, nicely decorated with a free mini bar (no alcoholic drinks) and really all you need.

Continental breakfast was included in our rate and it was very extensive and of excellent quality served in the characterful basement restaurant/bar.

We will use this hotel again.",5,2015,09,26
129,Outstanding hotel,"The Ampersand is located in the ideal place for a holiday in London. A stone-throw from South Kensington station ( Direct line from Heathrow), a five minute walk to museums, and surrounded by a great choice of eateries and pubs.
Our fourth trip to London and wouldn't consider any other place to stay.",5,2015,09,26
129,Great for Knightsbridge and Chelsea,"Smart, modern hotel very close to S. Kensington tube station. Although situated in a very busy area the hotel is well soundproofed and is an oasis of calm. We found the staff exceptionally friendly. Although our superior room was nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed, it was just too small. Next time we stay we shall have to book a delux room for the extra space.",4,2015,09,25
129,Lovely boutique hotel in great location,"The Ampersand Hotel is in a perfect location--near the South Kensington tube station, on one of the double decker tour bus stops, and within walking distance to museums, shops, restaurants, and all London has to offer. The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly during my stay. I loved the restaurant, a below-street-level Italian cafe with great coffee and espresso, breakfast, and cocktails in the evening. The decor was a fun modern and clean look, and there were plenty of thoughtful extras in the room such as a mini fridge with complementary soda and water, bath robes and slippers, toiletries, and so forth. I particularly enjoyed the rainfall shower head. The room I had was quite small, but that is to be expected in a metropolitan area.",5,2015,09,24
129,Exemplary hotel by generously providing free mini bar,"I must applaud Ampersand for thoughtfully providing a free mini bar for guests. Considering that it's not terribly expensive to stock up a mini bar, I do not understand why other hotels do not just make this a standard practice. Wifi is complimentary too. This makes it convenient for travelers. 
The rooms are very small though. 
Location wise it's  very convenient. The bus stop is right at the hotel doorstep. The South Kensington Underground is just across the street. Is ",4,2015,09,24
129,Gave it Two Tries - Three Stars,"I gave this hotel two tries on a roundtrip excursion based in and out of London. Though well put together and visually attractive, it merits only three stars in my book because it doesn't offer breakfast (all my other European hotels did), isn't that centrally located (not it's fault, of course, though it is on the Piccadilly line direct to Heathrow), and the on-site restaurant leaves more than a little to be desired.

The Room:  The hotel has an interesting modernish style founded on black and white design with various nautical and avian themes. Quite pretty, actually, though the standard room we got on the first go-round was on the third floor at the rear of the hotel facing the back of other buildings and some kind of courtyard/schoolyard. Definitely no view of any kind. The linens were okay, though not great, and there was a rip in the upholstery on the couch. Lighting was nice, but I never did figure out all the switches before I left. The return visit was in a seemingly larger room on the fifth floor, that offered nicer views of the city. And it may be that I had spent a week in lesser accommodations, but the bed seemed very comfortable as were the linens.

The Niceties: Having arrived at tea time on both occasions, we were offered a welcome glass of champagne in the sitting room just off the lobby and a were tempted by a wide variety of biscuits and glistening espresso maker (which we were later told was not in service). The room is quaint with a bit of an Alice-in-Wonderland feel if you submerge yourself in the large red sitting chairs. The champagne was as nice as one might expect is an upscale hotel. On the matter of service, I had managed to misplace some of my travel papers on the way to London and the hotel staff was kind enough to let me forward various emails to them with attachments that they printed and delivered to the room. This is something to be expected of any high-end hotel, of course, but they were quite nice about it.

129,"Great Rooms at the front of the building, forget about the side ones","We recently stayed at the Ampersand in August and again in September, the rooms are lovely make sure you get a King size, all staff are very accommodating however there is a useless door man who just stands around leaning on the furniture watching you struggle with the bags and door, not sure what purpose he serves, on the 9 nights we stayed he did not open the door once for us, and could be found on most occasions picking his nails looking boored?  other than this the hotel is very well located and a real treasure in this busy city.",4,2015,09,24
129,Great location,"Great location and great hotel, great decoration, and friendly and knowledgeable staff but make sure when you have two guests that need to sleep in two beds to specify that (as in other hotels in London)

129,Delighted journey,"The bedroom, the food and the service are just great. We had already a previous journey last year, and we mention that it went really well, with just some noise coming from the street. And this time, in the same room, widows were double-glassed, and the room was way more quite. So, one more point for this great 4* hotel in London.
Then for next year, there will be a new challenge: the only small noise was coming from the upper floor, probably due to people walking on the wooden parquet floor under the carpet. May be it will be removed or arranged for our next journey?",5,2015,09,22
129,Ampersand Hotel,"Great Location and the front desk staff is first rate!! Recommendations for dinner were perfect and the decor is unique and well done.  Umbrella's provided both in your room and at the door.  Would stay here again.

129,Every modern convenience and comfort!,"Across the street from South Ken station, this comfortable, welcoming hotel is ideal for the museums in the area (science and V&A) and excellent for the Royal Albert Hall. The restaurant is excellent, the service lovely and the modern conveniences tip top.  We will stay here again for the Proms, and ask for a superior deluxe room. ",5,2015,09,21
129,"Tiny Room, Luxury Service","We booked a superior room but it was so tiny that the suitcase touched the bed and the wall at the same time, leaving no room to walk. Free wifi, adorable tea room with delicious sweets, and a WONDERFUL breakfast buffet. Croissants, meats, cheeses, pudding, yogurt, and an assortment of beverages and unlimited coffee/cappucinos/espresso. Location was not ideal for my husband and I who wanted to see a more hip part of town - South Kensington is closer to museums and luxury shopping but not the cool pubs, restaurants, boutiques, or even major landmarks. That being said, London is HUGE, and this is a block from a major Underground station. Excellent staff and service. Would not stay here again, though, because of the location and the room size.",4,2015,09,20
129,Great stay in a great location!,"Fresh, update London hotel in the heart of Kensington. Footsteps from the tube, lots of restaurants and the Victoria and Albert. 

The concierge was extremely helpful in booking restaurants and getting our large group to the airport in a timely fashion.

Perfect hotel for a girls' trip!",5,2015,09,18
129,"Great hotel, perfect stay, we would definitely stay again!","Great hotel in a convenient location.  The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and very helpful.  All areas were immaculate.  The hotel drawing room is very attractive.  We all loved the free mini bar in the room and fresh milk for tea!  We booked with Mr & Mrs Smith and received a glass of champagne and petit fours - superb!  We booked a deluxe room which was a good size and a good price for London.  Other reviewers had said about hearing the noise from the nearby tube  -  I would say it was more of a very, very faint rumble - certainly not an issue.   We had a perfect stay.  I would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2015,09,18
129,Great location & service,"Room was spacious and well appointed with a delux ultra comfy king size bed and amenities. They provide free mini bar, no alcohol but waters juices and fresh milk for your in room coffee.  Only problem was constant background noise of the underground trains and no view at all. Don't stay in room 107 if u are noise adverse or want view. In fact, don't stay on the first floor, I'm sure all rooms hear the low rumble. Front desk staff can't do enough for you. Had one snack in the hotel and it wasn't great and it was crazy expensive. The location is across the street from South Kensington tube stop and down the street from the V&A. The neighbourhood is full of eateries bistros pubs and restaurants. ",4,2015,09,17
129,Amazing Ampersand!,"The Ampersand adds to the London experience in so many ways!  the location is beyond perfection - right across from the South Kensington tube stop...and several double decker tour busses stop right outside...
it's also right around the corner from the VIctoria and Albert Museum and walking distance to the Harrod's area...
we were on a street-facing first floor room and it was still extremely quiet, and the rooms have super fast free wifi and also a mini bar with complimentary water, soda, and juices, and cookies...
also the rooms, while smallish, are very nicely appointed, very clean, and have a sleek, 'mod' vibe with lux bathroom amenities and plush robes.....
the staff is very friendly and helpful...this is not a corporate, sterile chain hotel at all...
there are so many great restaurants in a two block radius - every dinner we had in a 6 night stay was in the neighborhood (try Comptoir for excellent Lebanese food and la brasserie for perfect French bistro fare and casa brindisa for delicious tapas)...there are also lots of small, unique places to grab a quick bite for breakfast or lunch - try gail's for amazing pastries (sweet and savory) and leon for super good porridge...
this area has a real quaint neighborhood feel...you will figure out the lay of the land very quickly and totally feel at home!
we had a perfect stay, and will stay there again and will recommend to anyone travelling to London!",5,2015,09,16

Room, bathroom, breakfast, staff, apero area, gymnase ...","If you intend to go to this hotel, go and see the famous HARRODS shop and then you can go through KING'S ROAD (international shops cheaper than HARRODS of course). At about 5 or 10 min at feet! No taxi, no bus needed. So not expensive if you want to move around this hotel.  We recommend the APERO restaurant at the hotel : tastely food and excellent

129,Wonderful Oasis in South Kensington,"This was a just quick trip down to London form Yorkshire, so I was looking for somewhere special.  And the Ampersand is definitely somewhere special.  From the time we checked in with the friendlyand helpful staff to the time we checked out with the friendly and helpful staff we had 18 hours of restrained luxury and excellent service.

I booked a deluxe studio room, which turned out to be on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel.  The room was large (for London hotels) and beautifully appointed in a modern comtemporary style with the most comfortable bed my wife and I have ever slept in.  (We took off all the bedding this morning to find the make and model)  I can honestly report there was no noise from the busy road outside, nor any of the underground rumbling mentioned by other reviewers.

We ate in the lower ground floor restaurant in the evening.  Again the surroundings were very pleasant, and the food much above average for a hotel restaurant.  The sharing menu is good value at just over GBP 30 per head for 5 courses.   

The free soft drinks bar (including fresh milk for proper tea) is a really nice touch, and the free fast internet is available throughout the hotel without having to enter passwords.

In summary- as a luxury base for exploring London for a few days, it would be difficult to beat the Ampersand, particularly with the 3 for 2 deal currently available from the hotel's web-site.",5,2015,09,15
129,"Cozy, Comfy, and Close","I honestly wish I'd had more time to explore the area around the hotel, but I was only in london for a day. That being the case, the hotel met and exceeded my expectations, it felt cozy and warm despite the boutique-like decor with friendly staff, which I loved. The location was ideal,I wanted to be close to central london, but away for the noise. This fit the bill at literally less than a minute from the metro, my room was comfy,yet luxurious and the restaurant downstairs was a plus. Do yourself a favor and book here. ",5,2015,09,15
129,A first rate boutique hotel,"Our stay at The Ampersand can be summed up succinctly.  From the provision of every single need any guest would need, including warm robes and slippers, a loofah mitt, a large comfortable bed, beautifully decorated surroundings and a staff which, to the person, was intent on ensuring that we were well looked after, our stay in London will be remembered for some time.",5,2015,09,15
129,Moderately pleased,"Location excellent particularly as travelling with children
Rooms small   I know this is London but breakfast should be included Staff all very friendly  Beds very comfy  Better allocation of rooms for the rest of our party  Single lady in large room  Another couple could hardly walk around the bed  All beds are twins   No need for upgrade for singles travelling together

129,Great home base in London,"Highly recommend. Staff was incredibly welcoming and friendly. Location was less than a block from the South Kensington station (which happens to be on the line that goes direct to/from Heathrow), with lots of restaurants and activities right nearby. Room was on the small side, as you'd expect in most cities, but the decor was on point and everything was very comfortable. A lovely stay overall, and wouldn't hesitate to book again.",5,2015,09,13
129,"Very nice hotel, conveniently located next to underground station","I was very pleasantly surprised this time. Probably thanks to an upgrade, I got a very spacious room (for London standards at least!), clean and tidy, very nice bathroom, comfortable bed. The WiFi was also pretty good and the staff was very helpful. All that for what I would consider a decent price (again - it's London!). The proximity of South Kensington underground station was a huge plus. It takes some time to get to the very city centre but nevertheless, it was worth it.
Oh and the breakfast was really good, very nice setting, I enjoyed it a lot!",5,2015,09,13
129,Quality Hotel,"We stayed three nights in this lovely hotel. 

Only metres from South Kensington underground station, the hotel is located in an upmarket locale. There are lots of dining options nearby for breakfast etc if you don't fancy eating at the hotel. Close to the V&A museum. 

We enjoyed the comfort on offer; the hotel is just lovely, our room was immaculate and impeccably maintained. Whist not the biggest of rooms, it has lots of nice touches. The air con works well.

Dining, wise, we only tried the breakfast at the hotel which was fine. My partner thought the one slice of apparently unbuttered toast with the omelette was a bit stingy. 

We really enjoyed our stay but on checking out, the hotel attempted to double charge us for the breakfast that we had just eaten. Bit slapdash and took the gloss off things for me. Would stay here again.",4,2015,09,13
129,"Modern, clean, great hotel","This hotel is newly renovated, very clean and modern with a nice retro/British touch, in a great neighborhood. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. You can walk to Hyde Park, to Knightsbridge and Harrods. Great staff also, super helpful. 
The only drawback is that my room (going solo) was very, very small. So, get a larger room and enjoy!",5,2015,09,12
129,Very nice,"All went well. The hotel is very attractive, convenient and comfortable.
The staff were very helpful and welcoming.
The room was very nice, but a little crowded. The bed and bathroom were both spectacular.",4,2015,09,12
129,"Location, location, location","The location is the best part of this hotel. It's just across the road from the Tube and a couple of blocks from the Victoria & Albert, Natural History and Science museums. The location is chic and youthful.the hotel itself is a mixed bag of sophistication and poor service. The staff from front desk to servers in the restaurant are arrogant, which is the vibe of the hotel itself. They projected that they were doing me a favor by letting me stay there. In response to a query directly from the hotel, I had requested in making my reservation that my room NOT have a view of another building. My room's window opened to a view of a building wall. No apology.  

Like many single rooms in Europe, my room was a closet, with very poor lightings dark draperies, tiles and woodwork.  Breakfast. was good birth either offerings, including room ""service"" was poor. I ordered focaccia as an appetizer and was served large hunks of bread with a side of olive oil. No tomato, cheese, etc. The wait staff needs training in the basics of customer service. I the morning of my very early departure, I requested a cup of coffee and had not received it 45 minutes later! 

I have stayed in many hotels of varying quality throughout the world and I wouldn't give this hotel high marks for service quality or friendliness of staff. Since I had been to London several times before, I cared most about convenience and location.  If not for those attributes, I would have been very disappointed. ",3,2015,09,12
129,Great place to stay,"Very convenient to local restauarants, and tub, bit not far to anything by taxi. Also, we liked the tour bus stop right out front. Besides convenience, the hotel is very cute and clean, and we enjoyed our stay. Our room was a little small, but very nice. ",5,2015,09,10

The recent extended weekend break with my wife was a dream come true. 
In terms of overall design and comfort the workmanship is flawless, extremely smart, comfortable and elegant.  The attention to details are rare to find.  Nothing goes over the fine line of overdoing.  It‚Äôs simply perfect. 
The staff and service simply unbelievable so welcoming, outgoing and their genuine friendliness and helpfulness rare to find.  
I could spend pages getting into the details, but in reality I‚Äôm lacking words to describe my experience and satisfaction with the Ampersand.  People will simply have to see with their own eyes and enjoy the pleasure.

129,A Upper-class boutique hotel with excellent location!,"Stayed at the hotel in Aug for 7 days, where my wife followed me to London for my business trip.
The stay began on a good note where our room was ready at 9am even though our check-in time was at 2pm. Flexibility like this is a godsend especially after traveling 13 over hours and jet-lagged. We were given a nice corner room, that comes with a flat-screen Smart TV, and all other things you'd expect of a nice hotel. 
Pluses:
1. Great bed! Slept very well throughout our stay.
2. Free mini bar that is topped up daily: Apple juice, orange juice, coke, coke light, milk, still and sparkling water all complimentary. Loved this!
3. Location: It literally is a stone's throw away from South Kensington station that houses 3 tube lines. Getting to all of London's attractions was a breeze. Natural History Museum is also just around the corner. 
4. Lots of food options all round. The ala-carte breakfast at the hotel restaurant was great! Many different varieties around the vicinity.
Minuses:
1. Does not provide toothbrushes and shaver by default. You have to request for them. 
2. No bath tub: The bathroom is massive. Makes us wonder why not put a bathtub in there.
3. It is not cheap, but I guess I have to add that it is probably just about value for money.",4,2015,09,08
129,thoroughly recommended,"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. Great decor, the room facilities are very good and the staff are courteous and helpful. It's in a great location - right next to South Ken tube and a short walk to all the major museums. There is a very nice lounge bar area and the afternoon tea is fabulous.
It is a boutique hotel so the rooms are not huge but they have everything you could want and the beds and pillows are the most comfortable you could imagine.
All in all, an excellent stay.",5,2015,09,08
129,"Very nice hotel, great location!","Our room was on the 4th floor and not huge (this is London!) but very nice and clean. Modern bathroom and great shower, very comfortable bed.

I would definitely consider staying here again.",5,2015,09,08
129,A True Gem - Surprising Find,"We have been to London many times, but wanted to stay somewhere different. This may be our new favorite. The beds are amazing - high thread count sheets, perfect pillows and the perfect mattress- so good we didn't want to get up. The showers was good - strong and hot. The room is very small but we expected it from other reviews so not an issue for us. The service was fabulous - no request or question was an issue. The mini bar was restocked daily and was complimentary, which is unusual. Rooms had slippers, robes, and umbrellas. 

The bar was great - fabulous appetizers and drinks. The bartenders can make anything with style and were friendly conversationalists. I had a passion fruit and vanilla martini that was wickedly good. Their homemade potato crisps were great.  Drinks were generous. Breakfast and afternoon tea were great. There are so many restaurants to choose from close by, like Paul's Cafe - the best French patisserie I have been to outside Paris. The subway stop is just 3 minutes away, hype park a nice 30 minute stroll and Harrods just 25. We will be back! ",5,2015,09,07

It is expensive but it it's very much value for your money. Our room was very large, very nicely furnished and the staff amazing. Another plus for us is that it is so central, 1/2 block to the Piccadilly line, 2 blocks from the V&A Museums and a short tube ride to most of London's main sites.",5,2015,09,06
129,Suite was small and cramped,Disappointed.  Suite comprised bathroom; very small office area and bedroom (low ceiling height on one side of the bed necessitated bending down to get in and there was no window in bedroom area) combined; kitchen area and sofa; small balcony.  Waited 30 minutes to access room after published room availability times.,2,2015,09,05
129,Excellent hotel at excellent area,"My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights and we must say this is the best hotel experience we had (by far) in Europe!
we have stayed in many 5-star hotels before (ie. Ritz Carlton, St Regis, W hotel...etc) and must say this small luxury hotel makes it hard to decide which hotel experience was better! Ampersand is located just (literally) 2min next to South Kensington station, hotel staff is extremely friendly, we also didn't expect to have free mini bar and turn down service!
Shower Amenities are standard in my opinion, however the moment you step into the hotel you will be attracted by their decors and all the small touches! 
Totally fell in love with this small luxury hotel! 
Will definitely return to this hotel in our next visit to London!

129,Great location but small room,"We stayed at the Ampersand in late June at the time of the Wimbledon. The room rate was very expensive at that time and did not correspond to the quality of the room which was really small and relatively dark due to the placement of the window. I do not know if the rate was extremely high at that time or if it was the normal rate. The bathroom was fine, the best facility, but the wardrobe was very small only with a few hangers and the clothes had to hang just above - or with - the coffee boiler. There was a safe at the floor but a very strange one which could probably contain an iPad or the like but not more.
The fridge in the room was supplied with complimentary soft drinks. Fine idea
The location next to the Kensington Station is really great and the staff friendly and helpful.
Would I return. I do not think so. As you will understand value did not correspond to the money paid even taken into account that London is an expensive place.",3,2015,09,04

Being situated a minutes walk from South Ken tube and a short stroll from the museums ensured we had easy access to everything we wanted. We will certainly return.",5,2015,09,02

Friendly staff, oh so convenient location for Central London and late at night, you can feel the tube trains rumbling by underground!   ",5,2015,09,01
129,Family friendly hotel,"Hotel location is very good and everything works well. Family friendly and peaceful hotel. Tube work well and it is easy to go all destinations in town (only 100 meter from Hotel). Service was good at all.

129,Find Another Hotel - Noisy and Under Staffed. ,"The Ampersand Hotel is well appointed, but under staffed. In addition, the staff they do have is not trained in hospitality nor knowledgable of the hotel, procedures, or the surrounding area. There is no concierge and if you ask the front desk staff for recommendations or reservations they simply seem bewildered. The most knowledgable staff member is the doorman/bellman/front desk fill-in/room service person. 

Warning! The Tube, or under-ground train, runs under the hotel, and your room. It is extremely noisy and no one will warn you of this until you get into your room and think there is an earthquake. Add to the fact that the hotel is designed with the most annoying electrical system which micro manages your use of the A/C, lights (they can't be turned on without your room key in the slot), and plugs. We could not get the A/C to set to our comfort level and therefore, had to sleep in an uncomfortably warm room. 

Tip: Upon check-in the first room assigned to you will be the worst they have to offer. If you do decide to stay at this hotel I recommend you see your room first and then demand a better room. 

This was simply a miserable stay from start to finish and unfortunately, did impact our enjoyment of our London visit. ",1,2015,08,29
129,A good solution,"The hotel is located in a good position and it has a lot of comforts .
All the staff is extremely efficient and courteous. The cleanliness is excellent.
I think that for a family it's better to opt for two adjoining rooms because the quality of the third bed contrasts with  the great level of this hotel and the room becomes narrow. However, if you have problems, the manager assistant is very helpful to make your holiday perfect!
 
",4,2015,08,29
129,Great hotel,"Everything about this hotel ticks the box.  Great location, exceptionally friendly staff, beautiful decor and up to date extras such as efficient internet connections and free no alcohol mini bar.
My only slight complaint is the size of the rooms, this is a particular problem if you need a twin as two mattresses on one base doesn't really work if you are sharing with another adult you are not intimate with!  Once you have a room with two separate beds this is perfection.
Great place to stay!",4,2015,08,28

129,Fabulous Hotel in a Wonderful Location,"From arrival to departure, the staff could not do enough to ensure our needs were met.  We spent 3 nights in a stunning deluxe studio.  The room was huge with a gorgeous free standing bath in the bay window.  We were on the first floor and heard just the odd rumbling from the tube.  The location of the hotel is second to none.  Literally just steps from the tube station and lots of lovely cafes and restaurants.  South Kensington is a fabulous area and we happily walked around exploring.  I will definitely stay here again!",5,2015,08,25

129,Gem of a hotel! Great location; lovely stay,"This was my first visit to London and I obsessed over picking a hotel for hours and hours because I didn't have any recommendations and didn't know anything about London neighborhoods. This hotel was perfect for my aunt and I. We were there to see Hamlet, shop and go on sight seeing tours. We stayed for 5 nights which is longer than I normally stay in a hotel and it was lovely the whole time. After spending much of our days in touristy spots it was nice to get out of the center of town and be in a place with more of a neighborhood feel.

Steps away from great restaurants and shopping, Starbucks, the South Kensington tube station, a line of taxis right out front, an ATM and currency exchange and conveniently for us, a luggage store since we shopped for gifts and had to buy another suitcase. 

I read reviews of small rooms and warnings not to pick a room near front but our superior room on the 5th floor near back was perfect -- quiet and a good size for 2 people. I was especially happy with the bed as it was super comfortable and big enough so you aren't disturbed by the other person.

A few tips:
-The first night the air conditioning didn't work for us and we only realized the 2nd night we had to leave our key card in the slot for it to work (which I don't blame on the hotel because I think we just missed this piece of info when it was explained). After that the room temp was great. 
-It was a little difficult to get ready since we couldn't use the hair dryer they provide in the bathroom as there is not an outlet that works for hair appliances. We dried our hair in the bedroom with a small mirror and they provided us with a voltage box which allowed us to use our curling iron in the bathroom. 
-Had a great room on 5th floor. The 2 elevators weren't busy but I like taking the stairs; if you do too, I'd request 4th floor or lower as the top stairs seem to be more for staff.

Great service, lovely stay. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!",5,2015,08,23
129,the nicest hotel ever!,"most comfortable, elegent and welcoming and enjoyale. i would like to thank the staff for being most kund and eager to please. the location is perfect. the library was interesting. the rooms are decorated in good taste.

129,Great little hotel,"Nice place, lovely staff and walking distance to most of the touristic places and, if 40min walk to see the Big Ben sounds too much, the tube station is less than 3min walk.
Lots of nice little restaurants in the area too!",4,2015,08,23
129,Favourite London Hotel,"We come back time after time. Luxurious, central and great staff. Last time sadly , we were given a room with main road noise even though we had requested a quiet room. This was quickly rectified with a junior suite an a quiet part of the hotel. We had a wonderful relaxing stay, looking forward to Christmas shopping and staying here again.",5,2015,08,22
129,Warning -  Rooms are very small ,"I put that in the header because I missed it and if I had known how small the rooms are, I never would have stayed here.

Now that you know the problem, let me tell you a little bit more.

This is a lovely hotel in terms of charm and the location in South Kensington is convenient to the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Natural History Museum and a few others but it is well outside walking distance of The City of London.  Which kis where most the attractions are located.  We had no problem with the location as it is only 3 or 4 tube stops away from Piccadilly or  Westminster and we're comfortable using the underground.

The service was friendly enough.  The hotel has a certain swagger to it.  It's decorated in a whimsical, post modern fashion, very nicely done really.  The rooms have free wifi, another plus.

However, as we just completed a 2 week cruise with two large suitcases, one for my daughter and one for myself (I do not think that is excessive for 3 weeks in Europe) we were not prepared for the lack of space.  Since I had been warned by previous reviews about the size of the rooms, I paid for the upgrade to a superior room which they claim on their web site is 18 to 20 square meters.  By my calculations, that is a room of 54 to 60 sq ft. which is a large room.   When we got to our room, there wasn't a closet and the room wasn't large enough to open one of our two suitcases without being placed on the bed. 

I don't know what 54 sq meters means in British, but allow me translate this into American English.  When you can't lay your suitcase flat, or the space to open it, and you don't have a closet or a dresser to put your clothes into, that is a very small room. Or to put a visual on it, for all those ""cruisers"" out there, our tiny cabin was about twice the size of this room. There is nothing superior about it.  I walked the room multiple times and it is a room of 10 by 12 ft and that includes the bathroom.  So you are talking about a 120 ft room.  Put two twin beds or a King bed and a bathroom into that space and you don't have much left over.

We spoke to the front desk and asked to be moved but they were booked so there was nothing they could do, and they stuck to their claim that the room is 18 to 20 sq meters. Ok, enough said on the room size.  All else is good as far as my standards are concerned.

To sum up, this is a great spot for a romantic weekend away, when all you want is to snuggle in close to your partner, but if you have anything inconvenient like luggage or a child or dog or anything like that, this is not the place to stay.

I stuck to 4 stars because all else was above average in my opinion.",4,2015,08,22
129,"Stylish, great service, great location","The Ampersand is a lovely boutique hotel just steps from the South Kensington tube station and countless restaurants and shops. High-quality Wi-Fi and a fridge with free bottled water were pleasant surprises, as was the heated bathroom floor.

Drawbacks? It's not exactly a taste of old England. The facilities are Euro-American, and the staff is largely foreign. Also, the rooms (at least ours) can be cramped.

Overall, though, I don't think I could have chosen better.",5,2015,08,21
129,The Jewel in South Kensington,"I had an amazing weekend staying at The Ampersand Hotel. I cannot rate this London hotel highly enough!

The staff were lovely on arrival and we were given a complimentary upgrade. Our room was beautiful and I loved all the little extra touches, such as free refreshments in a mini fridge and the funky rubber duck in the bathroom! The bed was so comfortable, very sumptuous!  

The design of the hotel itself is cool -  very quirky and interesting. A breath of fresh air to the London hotel scene. Great location too, as it's so close to South Ken tube and the surrounding area/attractions. 

We had complimentary champagne at Apero, as we booked through Mr and Mrs Smith, and we really enjoyed this bar. The service is fantastic and the barmen knock up some cracking cocktails, with real attention to detail.

If staying in London, do not hesitate to stay here!",5,2015,08,20
129,Anniversary stay.Top notch!,"Had a delightful stay for our anniversary. The hotel and its staff were awesome. We were upgraded to a top floor suite after booking through Slh.com. 
Only tiny thing is that the food in Apero is marginally overpriced. That said it is very very good and we enjoyed it a lot. ",5,2015,08,19

      ",5,2015,08,18
129,Mostly wonderful,"We were here for only two nights and there are many things to love about this place with just a few small negatives.  

I booked our room for the end of July way back in April, and during the months preceding our arrival I emailed the hotel with many questions and requests.  My inquiries were always cheerfully and promptly answered -- I was able to get private car service arranged and billed to our hotel folio and restaurant reservations made before we got there.  I also got advice on tipping drivers, and found out that we didn't need to bring electrical adapters because they had one in each guest room.  

The hotel is in a great area -- just a half a block from the South Kensington station and walkable to some great museums like the Victoria and Albert Museum or the Natural History Museum.  The ""hop on hop off"" tourist bus actually stops directly in front of their door -- and, you can actually buy tickets for this bus at the front desk of the hotel and they'll put it on your folio!

The building is a beautifully renovated building with its old London exterior and its quirky chic modern interior.  One of the few downsides is that when we arrived after a long flight with two carry-ons and two large suitcases (we were heading for a cruise after our London stay) there are some reasonably steep steps to get to the front door and I couldn't drag my suitcases up them and my husband had his hands full and there was no porter to help.  Fortunately a staff person happened to be outside smoking and he helped me.  

We were too early for our room to be ready and got good advice from the front desk about a local lunch spot.  When our room was ready they called my cell phone.  Knowing that the rooms are small, we had reserved a Superior Room.  Even so, we could not have both of our large suitcases open at the same time (they are the clamshell type), which was the other main downside.  Otherwise the room was really comfortable -- really nicely appointed with a comfy bed and a pretty bathroom (the bathroom didn't have much room to put supplies in it, like contact lens cases, etc.).   I LOVED the fact that there was a mini-fridge with included sparkling and still water!  The a/c worked.  

We had a decent high tea in the parlor.  Great setting.  Most all of the staff were friendly and helpful.  

All in all we had a very nice stay and would look at returning the next time we're in London.  Shortly after our check-out I got an email with a survey that I completed about two weeks later.  About a day after I completed it I got a nice personal email referencing the porter issue and promising to address it.",4,2015,08,17
129,Neat place to stay in London,"The suite room 117 has a perfectly placed bathtub in the window overlooking a busy road. , busy but the soundproofing effectively blocks out noise. A well appointed suite and a lovely king size bed , plus coffee machine , kettle , and a free selection of water , coke and fresh milk . 

The air conditioning works effectively too ( often a flaw of London hotels in a hot summer ) .

The check in and service was perfect and a good old fashioned escort to the room . 

Not cheap , but the amenities nearby including the Natural History museum , and countless places to eat and drink make this an attractive location . 

My second stay and I will be back.",5,2015,08,17

One area for improvement: the bellman at the front door offered little or no assistance bringing our luggage up the front steps when we arrived.  ",5,2015,08,17
129,Excellent,"The hotel location and staff make the Ampersand a must stay in London.  Nothing is overlooked from the check-in staff, room service and food service. Our room was perfectly maintained for our 7 night stay.  Will stay at the Ampersand when I visit London again.",5,2015,08,16

The staff members are all very friendly and attentive.  The facilities are well kept.  And the location is perfect for museum going and the area is not too crowded.  The hotel is 2 minutes walk from the Tube station and within 10 minutes walk from the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum.  We had a great stay!",5,2015,08,16
129,Lovely hotel,"Stated for 1 night on the May bank holiday weekend as a couple. It is lovely - the decor is fresh and tasteful, the bathroom was modern and chic, and the staff were friendly. Also great value considering we booked at short notice and it was probably a busy weekend. Would go back again.",4,2015,08,16
129,A gem in a great location,"A lovely furnished hotel with a lot of well thought out details, though the room was a touch small. We had to ask for a second luggage rack and barely had space for the second bag.  The bed was comfortable though the mattress was two twins joined, so we could feel it.  The bed topper could have been better, but the linens were soft.  One drawback for people with allergies is the carpet--plush but also feels like it is full of dust. Luckily the hotel provides slippers.  Given that the renovations were completed three years ago, I wish the hotel had invested in hard floors.  The bathroom floor was heated tile, which was lovely. First class toiletries and very prompt housekeeping service, what you would expect at this level of luxury. Turn down service was good, though I wonder if a mint on the pillow could not have added a little extra touch. 

For people with mobility problems, there are seven steps to get to the lobby.  I withheld one star because we were not greeted at the entrance to take our bags.  If I had been alone with a large bag, it would have been a problem.  Note that they had valets but none was available when we arrived.  During the three days here, I rarely saw one at the door.

Umbrellas are available on loan from the hotel and were much appreciated. Plug adaptors can also be requested.  There was no shortage of plugs to recharge electronics.

Buffet breakfast was great and varied. The in-room minibar was stocked with complimentary sparkling water, juices and some soft drinks. A total treat and a lovely surprise.

Overall, a very positive experience and, given the location, I would return.",4,2015,08,16
129,Can't sleep - too much noise from the tube,"This hotel is very nice from the outside but there is a big problem - every time a tube goes by you are woken up because the room shakes. 

I am not sure about the upper floors but we were on the ground floor and basically couldn't sleep after 7am because of the amounts of tubes going to South Kensington which is one of the busiest stops in London.

No rush to stay here again.",2,2015,08,16
129,lovely hotel in the heart of south kensington,"this is a lovely hotel. clean comfortable friendly and in a good position.  near all kinds of transport but also in a neighbourhood.  i would totally recommend it to anyone.  i stayed only 4 days but it was perfect
      ",4,2015,08,15
129,"Fun, chic hotel in great location ","My husband and I stayed here in June. We chose one of the smaller rooms to save money. The room size was small (as we expected), but had everything we needed and was quite comfortable. The staff was very helpful, they were able to move us when we discovered we had been placed in an accessible room. 

We ate breakfast in the restaurant on our last day - the food and service was good. 

Location-wise the hotel is right off the tube with access to airport, st pancras station (euro star), and many main tourist sites (tower of London, Westminster, Piccadilly, etc). There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance and you can easily walk to the v&a museum, Kensington palace (~1mi), shopping (harrods is less than a mile). If you like to walk or run - Kensington gardens and Hyde Park are great places to get some exercise. 

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. ",4,2015,08,14
129,We did not want to leave!!,"My mother, my 1 year old daughter and I stayed in this lovely hotel for 2 nights as part of a recent trip to England. We arrived with stroller in tow and two big bags. The doorman helped us in and out of the hotel every time we left or came back, they had arranged a travel crib for our room, and even handled our baggage for us. Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived (which was before check in time), but we were happy to wander around the south Kensington neighbourhood for a while. Upon our return to the hotel, we were greeted with complimentary afternoon tea and scones hot out of the oven, and a free room upgrade! Our favourite part of the room had to be the bathroom, with the television in the tub area, and the amazing heated floors! The  bed was extremely comfortable and the d√©cor was beautifully unique. We can't wait to go back to London so we can stay there again! Can't say enough about how great the hotel and especially the service were. I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,13

129,All round great hotel in great location,"40 minutes from Heathrow, 100 metres from South Kensington tube station and with a taxi rank and bus stop at the door, our stay at the Ampersand was off to a good start. The building looks very fresh on the exterior and has a modern appearance in the lobby and common areas. Check in was efficient and welcoming and we were in the room within 5 minutes of entering the hotel. Our room 511, was of a reasonable size, especially considering how small London hotel rooms can be. Fixtures and fittings were new and of good quality. A small desk is placed in the room. A nice touch was an in room fridge stocked with soft drinks which were free of charge and even better, they were replenished each day. The bathroom worked well, good shower pressure and a heated floor together with nice toiletries further reinforced the quality of this property. The staff were very obliging and friendly but above all possessed great knowledge of London. We stepped off the treadmill of the big high street brands of hotel to try the Ampersand. It was a great decision and will be our first booking on our next trip to London. ",5,2015,08,13
129,First-rate Attention to Detail,An an attentive staff and superior accommodations. Great location within walking distance to a variety of museums with easy access to the London Underground. Exceptionally clean rooms and comfortable beds. Our room was ready late morning which was most appreciative as we arrived after an overnight flight. Check in staff was incredibly helpful providing great insights on local dining and attractions. Our only hotel dining experience was a late night after theater meal which was enjoyable although a bit expensive.,5,2015,08,12

129,superb accommodation in an ideal location,"My partner treated me to an overnight stay at The Ampersand combined with a return performance of my favourite West End show. Both were a complete delight. The Hotel is well located near South Kensington tube station and has been beautifully restored with stunning attention to detail.
Our refurbished fifth floor room had great views towards the Victoria and Albert Museum and a plethora of London landmarks beyond. As a light sleeper the treble glazing made it very quiet which, combined with a large and comfortable bed with superb linen made for a good night‚Äôs sleep. The bathroom was stunning with its heated floor, ceiling speaker linked to the television, powerful shower and high quality bathroom products. A delightful touch was the complimentary mini bar containing bottled water, juice and fresh milk.
The reception staff were charming during both check in and out.
We met family for drinks in the downstairs bar prior to dining elsewhere. These were on the expensive side (¬£52 for six pretty standard alcoholic drinks and one soft drink) and it was a little surprising for a hotel of this quality to be met with a blank expression by the bartender when asked for ‚ÄòFever Tree‚Äô tonic water. However the hotel itself, the location, room and service were truly outstanding and we shall certainly return.",5,2015,08,11

I forego points at bigger chains to stay here when I'm in town! haha. The staff is always so lovely and helpful but never in your face. The decor is beautiful. I'd say the size is on par for London hotels in general in this price range. As a New Yorker, smaller spaces don't scare me. 

And the afternoon tea is one of my favorites here. The restaurant downstairs serves great food, excellent breakfast. The location is very convenient. 

I'll continue to stay here for all my trips to London for work and pleasure.",5,2015,08,08
129,Still in love with the Ampersand,"I have had the pleasure of staying at the Ampersand three times now and I love it more and more. Every hotel employee is friendly. The rooms are well very comfortable and they are generous with bath towels. The mini-bar is still complimentary and the wifi works great. When you stay, be sure to order room service and indulge in breakfast in bed and try their fantastic afternoon tea. Best of all is the South Kensington location. What a nice neighborhood.",5,2015,08,08
129,Loved this amazing hotel!!!!,"This was our last hotel in an almost 2 week trip to Europe and we stayed here for 3 nights. This hotel in one word is amazing! The staff, the room, the location, and the value for the price was altogether what made it amazing! Obviously what can really make or break any stay, in my opinion, is it's staff. From front desk to housekeeping and all levels in between that can make your stay memorable and make a big difference and The Ampersand doesn't disappoint. The front desk was so helpful and courteous with our transportation needs and getting us pointed in the right direction with the public transportation. Also by the way the hotel is located very near the underground (tube) system and also above ground buses location. The hotel is in the  South Kensington area, which we really loved. Very nice neighborhood feel to it as well as lots of good pubs. Starbucks close by if you gotta have a familiar coffee fix and a quick bite to go. The hotel is very well appointed inside and had a luxury boutique feel to it. The rooms were very nice and had great features I've seen in 5 star hotels. You got to love a heated tile floor in the bathroom. Nice touch! They have complimentary drinks in the fridge and the room (207) had a lot of space. Plenty of closet and drawer storage too. One small word of attention is that the underground tube does go under the hotel and you can feel a small vibration. Honestly it's not that bad and was done at 12:30 am when they stop running. Maybe a higher floor wouldn't feel it as much. However even with that this place is true gem and worth staying at. I would even go as far to say that because of this hotel it made our London part of a 2 week trip our most favorite. We were very comfortable at the end of a long day. The South Kensington location is beautiful. Finally the staff was just excellent excellent excellent! We celebrated our 20th anniversary and the amenity left in our room was so very nice by the staff too. Thank you Ampersand for making our trip to London memorable. We will be back!",5,2015,08,07
129,Well priced London Hotel.,"If you want a London Hotel that is in avery central position at a reasonable price I would fully recommend The Ampersand. The staff were wonderful, the room was excellent and we would use this hotel again.",5,2015,08,06
129,My best keep secret!,"I LOVE this place. Have been here on 6 different occasions. Our last stay was for 12 days over the Christmas Holidays 2014/15. The location is perfect, the rooms are stunning, the Hotel is Gorgeous, the staff are wonderful, the Decor is spectacular, the food is Yummy and I really have only one thing to say... other than some of the rooms being a little noisy because they are above the underground (can't be helped) everything is Perfect and the price is really reasonable for a Hotel as lovely as this and in such a great place. Love!",5,2015,08,06
129,"Beautiful hotel, great neighborhood, built on top of the Tube","I loved the public spaces of this boutique hotel and my Deluxe King room was spacious (but not overly so) and very nicely appointed. There were lots of nice touches like dental moulding a in ceilings and really cool wallpaper and heated tile floors in the bathroom, plus courtesy water and juice in the fridge. But at night you can set a watch by the body shaking, bass tone rumble of the Tube roaring directly under the hotel every 8 minutes. The service was excellent and all of the good ALMOST makes up for the Tube - it's really that good. But you book a hotel to sleep in, so if you want a good night's rest it can be a challenge here. I was on the 4th floor which is much better than the lower floors and Ingot used to the sound by the second night.",3,2015,08,05
129,"Beautiful Hotel, but customer service is terrble","We stayed here for 4 days at the end of a 16 day Europe Trip.  I can not say much to recommend this hotel. We requested booked double beds through-out our trip but when we go to London, I was told we only had one bed (the only place this happened) - and that I should have paid more if I wanted another one. Nice. The rooms are ridiculously small, and the maid service was the worst - finding my toiletries each day was like an easter egg hunt, my suitcase looked like it had been ransacked, and anything we left out was waded up in a ball and thrown in the corner.
The pro of this hotel is that it was recently remodeled, the mini bar is complementary and tea time was divine.",2,2015,08,05
129,The Ampersand,"we stayed at the Ampersand with the family, the front desk was very helpful and friendly, very nice hotel, good rooms, nice bathroom, very good bed and excellent location, will certainly come back there's nothing more to say
      
      ",4,2015,08,05
129,Lovely looking rooms!,"Small hotel with lovely rooms and decor. Nicely situated, easily accessible via the Underground. Staff were friendly,  free wifi service and rooms were small but comfortable and clean.  Loved the bed! They also have a nice tea room for afternoon snacks if you fancy a bite to eat.",4,2015,08,04
129,All the Necessities at a Great Location,"Decent size room (king bed, bench at bottom of bed and two end tables with enough room to walk around) and finely appointed bathroom for a good price at an excellent location (500 meters from South Kensington tube station).  If you are a tourist looking for a good value and convenient location, I am not sure that there is a better value in London than the Ampersand Hotel.  We have been coming to London regularly since 2008 and have tried a number of locations and higher price points.  For our taste, the room and hotel is for overnight activities and storing one's belongings during the day and not for spending one's entire vacation in.  If this sounds like you, try the Ampersand.",5,2015,08,03
129,Near immaculate stay ,"We stayed here recently and could not have been happier.

As this is a five star hotel expect five star design, quality and customer service. Staff were very friendly accomodating to all of our needs including recommending restaurants, booking restaurants at the last minute etc 

The location is also impeccable providing easy access and convenience to key tourist sites, the city and of course the tube (it's across the road!). It is also in the heart of South London making the delightful suburbs of Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Mayfair all extremely close.

We requested a room on a higher floor having read reviews on trip advisor about being able to hear and feel the tube given its close proximity. To be honest I felt a slight rumble sometimes when being on be top floor but it was so minor I'm sure I may have missed many others given the high frequency of the tube.

The design of the rooms are great, they are small but not claustrophobic providing the room that you need for its purpose and the bathroom was of a spacious size with a full size bath and a shower included. 

The bed was also incredibly comfortable and so very generous in size with fluffy cushions.

All in all, whatever your purpose of needing a hotel in London is - I can't recommend this highly enough. ",5,2015,08,03
129,A comfortable and stylish design hotel full of delightful details!,"The Ampersand is a lovely design hotel with full of delightful details and very good location in South Kensinghton! We had the great pleasure to stay in a stylish Deluxe Studio. It was one of the most beautiful rooms I have ever stayed. A TV set in in the bathroom was a nice surprise too. Breakfast in the Apero was delicious. The enermous lighting fixture of Ingo Maurers ""Birds"" in the staircase is stunning! This is definitely my new favourite hotel in London!",5,2015,08,03
129,Loved Ampersand!,"I loved the decor of this hotel so much.   Easy access to almost every destination by using buses stopping right in front of the hotel and subway just a minute walk away.   We enjoyed having breakfast at Apero ... and don't forget to try their afternoon tea served at the Drawing Room, too!!!
",5,2015,08,02
129,Perfect,"Selected this hotel purely for it's location near the Victoria and Albert Museum and I wasn't disappointed, it was perfect! Near some great little restaurants and within walking distance to all of the luxury branded and high street shops. Also there's the added bonus of the tube station right across the street from the Hotel.

We were given a complimentary upgrade without request which was greatly appreciated, very comfortable room.

 The service is spot on, extremely attentive staff without being overbearing.

Had couple of drinks in the cool hotel bar before leaving.

Already planning my next trip to London and The Ampersand is where I will be staying.",5,2015,08,02
129,"Great stay, great location!",The hotel seems newly renovated and is very clean and sleek looking. Location is fantastic - you can literally see the tube station from the front door of the hotel. About an 8-10 minute tube ride from the Westminster area. Seems like a pretty central location. One awesome thing was the umbrellas available for the guests to use all day...super helpful!!! Much thanks to the concierge who made everything on our honeymoon run smoothly :),5,2015,08,02
129,Beautiful hotel in South Ken but rooms a bit small,"I stayed with my partner for one night in this gorgeous boutique hotel. We opted for the standard room, which was a mistake, as it was tiny and I think designed for one person. Thankfully it was just for one night otherwise I would have requested a different room. Bathroom was in very good condition and had a decent size shower over bath.

Customer service was excellent. From check-in to check-out you felt looked after. The lobby area is comfortable if you're waiting for guests and there is no shortage of staff available if you have any questions. 

The best thing about this hotel is the location. You are right opposite South Kensington tube station and there are cute shops nearby. The patisserie across the road looked amazing but unfortunately we didn't have time to go inside. 

Overall a pleasant experience for one night in London. 

",4,2015,08,01
129,Fabulous &  Brilliant Hotel,The perfect hotel for your London vacation. The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and the hotel is gorgeously decorated and very comfortable! We loved the bathroom toiletries and amenities and heated floors...and the umbrellas are so adorable!,5,2015,07,29
129,Excellent,Stayed here last weekend for 1 night with partner.  Great location close to tube station and some excellent bars and restaurants.  Loved the decor/style of public areas.  Bedroom and bathroom of high quality and spotlessly clean - best hotel bed I have ever slept in.  Miller Harris bathroom products lovely.  All staff very helpful and friendly.  Good breakfast.  Will definitely stay here from now on when in London.,5,2015,07,29
129,Lovely hotel; just avoid the ground floor,"The Ampersand's rooms are beautiful and comfortable. Everything is very high-tech, with electronic panels controlling all sorts of things. I found the hotel staff to be professional and accommodating. The location is excellent: near the Victoria & Albert Museum and right around the corner from the South Kensington tube station. The Picadilly line goes through the South Kensington station, and also goes to both Kings Cross-St. Pancras (the Eurostar station) and Heathrow airport.

However, don't let them put you in a ground floor room. I had the misfortune of arriving late on a weeknight, and they were full except for ground floor rooms. The Tube runs right under the hotel, and every time a train goes by you will feel the rumbling. It's a shame because the ground floor deluxe room they gave me was fabulous, but the only sleep I got was during the few hours when the Tube wasn't running. The staff didn't seem at all surprised when I complained about the noise, so obviously they get complaints about the noise pretty often. The next day I was able to move to the 5th floor, and it was quiet and comfortable.",5,2015,07,28
129,What a perfect Boutique Hotel is all about,"Beautifully furnished Boutique-Hotel. Small, but lovely and clean rooms, with very comfortable beds. Great interior design. Nice staff, especially the italian team in the breakfast restaurant: Always in a good mood, polite and attentive. The hotel is pretty expensive (like all good ones in London), but worth the price. Nice breakfast buffet. 
We'll be back.",5,2015,07,28
129,Preferred hotel in London,"We stayed at the Ampersand first time in 2013 as we quite like the hotel size, the decoration and the location. The hotel is right off the South Kensington underground station where also close to Hyde Park, Kensington Park and restaurants area. We can walk to Knightsbridge within 10 mins. Very easy to commute around London from here either walking or tubing. 

All in all, we will put the Ampersand our first pick whenever we go to London.
 
Excellent service, clean room, absolute preferred location/ neighbourhood.",5,2015,07,26
129,Fabulous Hotel in South Kensington! ,"We stayed in this lovely hotel for 4 nights. This was our first trip to London. We booked a superior room and requested a room on a higher floor on the opposite side of the tube stop. Upon check in, I was given a room exactly as requested!  The check in process was very efficient. The room was nicely decorated in a very modern style. I was very impressed!  The bathroom was a bit small, but everything was very well placed so it was not an issue. The shower had fantastic water pressure as well. Some reviews mentioned they could hear the tube from their room, but I did not find this to be true. However, we were on the 4th floor so this could have been the difference.  The little touches in our room, like coffee and tea service and an included mini bar with bottled water, soda, milk and juice were a nice bonus. 

The location was perfect!  We walked to Kensington Gardens,  Harrods, and The History Museum. Around the hotel, there are several restaurants,  pubs and shops all within the perimeter of the hotel. Also, the tube is right across the street. We had no issues getting from Heathrow Airport,  to the hotel, or to many of the main tourist sites in London. 

We ate at the restaurant in the hotel one evening for dinner and it was the best dinner we had while in London! We had two drinks, two appetizers, and two main dishes. Everything was delicious!  

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to family or friends! If we visit London again I will be sure to stay here. ",5,2015,07,26
129,Beautiful Hotel in South Kensington,"We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel. Beautiful hotel with great location. The South Kensington tube is very nearby, lot's of cafe and restaurant and also a supermarket. We will definetely recommend thia hotel to our friends and relatives. Thanks Ampersand for your awesome hospitality. ",5,2015,07,25
129,"Great location, lovely hotel","We booked three rooms and stayed two nights at Ampersand Hotel and we were so happy with our stay!  The location is fantastic for museum visits, and the hotel makes a great base for exploring around town.  The taxi stand is in front of the hotel, and bus stops are right at the corner. Our kids walked to the museum/s, and we strolled to Sloane Square and spent our morning in the Saatchi Gallery (fab!). 

The staff were all friendly and commiserated with us over the tube strike, and tried their best to help us sort out our transport requirements.  When the strike lifted, it took us 10 minutes to get back to the hotel by bus from the theatre district.

The rooms are small (we had three different sizes) but gorgeous, and the beds are comfortable. The cafe was great for a morning breakfast meeting. We would definitely stay again.",4,2015,07,25
129,Love this hotel!,"We stayed at the Ampersand for 3 nights last summer and loved it.  The room was beautifully appointed, the bathroom generously sized, and the service was excellent.  We can't wait to stay there again next summer when we travel to London.",5,2015,07,25
129,"Great location, Great hotel!!!","Excellent location, the hotel is very welcoming and beautiful. 
Rooms are a little tight but gorgeous.
Good value.
Definitely will come back and will recommend to friends.
If you want a great location this is the place to stay.

129,Great hotel in South Kensington,"I stayed there with my children and mother for 6 days and love the hotel so much. It is very homey and comfortable, small but complete with everything we need, even more complete than some bigger hotels. My children love playing table tennis in the game room. On the first night my mother requested a rubber mat for the bath tub and it was brought over immediately! The staffs are all so friendly and helpful. Location is most convenient for walking to all the museums and attending music performance in Royal Albert Hall. The tube station isn't rights at the corner, same with bus stop, and taxi rank just in front. We will definitely return. ",5,2015,07,25
129,"Good location, indulge yourself with breakfast and amenities","A very convenient hotel, near the tube and museums. Really nice decoration and other facilities, as the library. Loved the space and amenities of the bathroom, and breakfast. Really nice the complimentary glass of champagne and the Mac available in the business area. Staff of high quality.",4,2015,07,23
129,Why Am I Writing This?,"I'm warring with myself about this review because I don't want my favorite hotel to become unattainable. This is a really wonderful hotel in a can't-be-beat location right across from the South Kensington Tube and a taxi stand and near to great shopping, museums and tons of entertainment. The rooms are perfect and the bathrooms are spacious. The attention to design and detail is sensational and consistent. Beyond that, the service is superb. The staff is so accommodating and friendly - they really impress and have made my multiple stays memorable and perfect. 

The smaller rooms are small, but if you're willing to upgrade a bit the rooms are quite spacious, open and airy. 

There's much to be said about this hotel - they do everything right.",5,2015,07,22
129,lovely hotel good location,"staff welcoming and friendly. room was spotlessly clean. comfortable beds.good location near Hyde park and museums. room was small but perfectly adequate and the room sizes are clearly stated on the website if you want a bigger room they are available. my ground floor room was noisy with other guests in reception, bottles being emptied into bins and underground trains, next time I would request a higher floor. The drawing room and afternoon tea were excellent. room with board games and a library are nice extras. will definately return.",5,2015,07,20
129,No sleep after 5 am,"Woken up three mornings in a row at 5 am by noisy neighbours. Hotel did nothing to improve our situation. Poor insulation and poor service. 

Oh, and if you're looking for a hotel with a gym, this one decided to put it in a spare closet.",3,2015,07,20
129,Boutique Hotel in South Kensington,"Excellent location very near to South Kensington Tube station and within walking distance of the V&A and Natural History museum.
I stayed here one night with my daughter and we were very happy with the hotel which had comfortable beds and good quality bed linen. The bathroom although small was well laid out, with good water pressure and Miller and Harris toiletries.
We ate breakfast in room and were pleased with the service and quality.
I'd certainly return if I visited South Kensington again.",4,2015,07,20
129,Ampersand Celebration!,"We booked a 2 night stay for my 40th birthday celebrations. Chose Ampersand for the excellent location close to South Kensington tube and museums, + short walk to Hyde Park. Beautiful boutique hotel. We upgraded to a deluxe studio and felt it offered good value for the price paid (unusual with hotels, we often wonder if the upgrade is worth it!) All staff were excellent: polite, friendly & helpful.  We're considering a return trip later this year.....",5,2015,07,20
129,Charming hotel,"The hotel is at a great location. Very posh, clean, and modern. The room was small but that is to be expected given the location. The room was excellent and very well planned given the space. The bathroom was AMAZING! the staff was helpful and very polite. Room service was better than some of our meals out and cheaper! It was literally a 1 minute walk to the tube which, you HAVE to use to get around. It was a great place to stay and we would stay at the hotel again if we ever cross the pond again! ",5,2015,07,19
129,elegant and comfortable,"We stayed in a suite in the Ampersand hotel. It's nicely located next to the South Kensington tube station and a fifteen minute walk to Harrod's. The 'drawing room' downstairs is lovely to enjoy tea and scones in or even to read/work or just to relax. We enjoyed our English breakfasts in the hotel restaurant. Rooms are comfortable and cheery. The decor in common areas is quite charming and the Ampersand is the perfect combination of an old, charming facade and a contemporary interior. Staff are warm and welcoming.",5,2015,07,18
129,wheelchair experience,"Great hotel very helpful staff.Shower is somewhat dangerous for a wheelchair user no grab rails near the seat,bed too high impossible to get into without assistance..Good location near Hyde Park.Expensive.Our stay did not include breakfast

129,Fantastic establishment,"One night stay, super friendly welcome, fantastic Wimbledon champagne afternoon tea!  
Fantastic clean rooms, the cleanest hotel I have stayed in, with super modern amenities, TV in bathroom if you don't mind!
Great location for tube station, and great selection of restaurants locally too.  Would definitely stay again when in London, most splendid, you will not be disappointed, go stay!",5,2015,07,17
129,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"I took my 7 year old to London as an 'entering junior school' treat. The Ampersand hotel has a fantastic location - really couldn't be better. A minute from the tube station, lots of little restaurants nearby and museums about a 3 minute walk. The reception area was really lovely. We didn't eat or drink at any of the hotel options, as they aren't really for children (which was no problem). The hotel was quiet and the room was nice. We were not disturbed in our room at any point. We had room service one night and it was very quick. I would say that someone at the main entrance to help with bags, luggage, etc would be helpful - otherwise, it was great. ",5,2015,07,16
129,The best place to stay!,"The Ampersand Hotel is a gorgeous, boutique hotel right in the heart of London. The location is perfect; a Tube station a block (maybe even less) away, a bus stop two meters in front of the door, and another bus stop just around the corner. The people are incredibly helpful and always kind. The room itself was absolutely gorgeous, with a very comfortable bed and a great bathroom. On the first night, we could hear the Tube going by, but it was very quiet. After that night though, it simply faded into the background and we couldn't even notice it so don't worry about that too much! The restaurant has really great food, with plenty of options if you have small kids. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone traveling to London, as it was clean, comfortable, and had the perfect location.",5,2015,07,15
129,Great location and venue,"We arrived mid afternoon and check in was really easy as only a small hotel so wasn't busy. 
The rooms are on the small side but that's typical of any city especially london. Even though the room was small it was really well thought out and had everything you would need.
Sadly we didn't get to eat at the hotel but the food looked really nice. 
Would definitely stay here again as great location and staff were very friendly. ",5,2015,07,15
129,Perfect stay in London.,Fantastic experience at this hotel. Good location near transport links and close to the main museums and we could walk to Harrod¬¥s from the hotel. Staff are wonderful and were there for every need. The room was small but perfectly formed with a generous bathroom. Very impressive interiors thought the hotel and we loved the modern light instalment which was so original. Breakfast had a great selection and we did not feel rushed to vacate our table as you sometimes do. Would stay here again if in London.,5,2015,07,14
129,Great Location,"More than anything else, I commend the location of this hotel - a two minute walk from the Tube, a bus stop six feet from the front door, and amidst a charming neighborhood full of varied food/priced restaurants and great museums. The staff are young but pleasant, and quick to respond to any requests.  Yes, the rooms are relatively small, but not by European standards - and there are nice touches, such as multi-use charging station for electronic devices, a loofah in the bathroom, state of the art thermostat, and a stocked mini fridge.  We had breakfast once at Apero but frankly, found it a bit cost-prohibitive - I expect some cooked food, for the equivalent of a $40 CDN meal for one adult and one child.  My sole peeve was that the quality of housekeeping seemed to diminish as our five nights there progressed - the room was made up later and later in the day, and fewer items were left in the fridge.  On our final day there we came back around 5 p.m. and had to accost the housekeeper (who was knocking on the room next door) to ask our room be made up.  We then went out to the theatre and upon our return, found only one bath towel, no bath rug, and none of the items used in the fridge replaced - we had to call housekeeping (who, to their credit, seemed to respond almost immediately).",4,2015,07,14
129,Perfect Hotel for the End of a Long Journey,"Our 4th floor Deluxe Double was great. The windows opened which was a nice change from other places we stayed. The bed was very comfortable and they provided us with the extra pillows we needed. It was very clean and the decor was chic and playful. There was even a rubber ducky in the bathroom. The breakfast to our room and in the hotel restaurant was good. The Wimbledon themed afternoon tea was excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Also it is right near the tube station and museums, which was great.

It will definitely be my choice when I return to London.",5,2015,07,14
129,Fantastic!!,"Just came back from staying at The Ampersand over the weekend and I had to post a review because it was so fantastic! The staff were so lovely, fantastic food, the decor is beautiful, the room was super clean and sooo quiet and the location was the best. Thank you to all staff for making us feel so welcome. Will certainly go back in the future!!",5,2015,07,14
129,Totally love staying here,"We have now stayed in the ampersand several times and every time we stay I never want to leave. The hotel is wonderful! I love the decor, friendly staff, tea room and all the amenities in the rooms! Although the double room is a bit small we LOVE staying in the other rooms they are all fabulous and make a trip to London so special!!!",5,2015,07,13
129,One of the best hotels ,"I LOVE staying at the Ampersand! It is just so wonderful in everything that they do! The rooms are very comfortable and have great fittings and fixtures, all very modern and easy to use. I love all the little presents in the bathrooms and the fact that almost everything in the mini bar is free! It really just the best place to stay!!",5,2015,07,13
129,Fashionable boutique with great location,"Very attractive public rooms, excellent service, fine good.  Bedroom quite small, but bathroom very good -- with heated floor.  Excellent location, just half a block from the South Ken tube station, with many restaurant choices and of course, the great museums, within a short walk.
      
      
      ",4,2015,07,13
129,Wimbledon,"We stayed here in order to visit Wimbledon for the tennis. Perfect location. Tube just over the road. Lots of other choices to eat close by although I found the sharing platter in Apero excellent value for money. Everything I expected.
We had the superior room and found the bed one of the best. I would think that maybe the standard room might be a bit compact. All areas of service of a high standard.
      ",5,2015,07,13
129,Great hotel at a reasonable price,"This was my 1st stay in this hotel and it was great. I booked this one because I was passing through London and wanted somewhere affordable to stay. I wasn't going to be there long - arriving after 7pm and leaving after breakfast so I wasn't too bothered about a huge room but wanted a comfortable and high standard of hotel to stay in. I booked the small Double Room class and was not upgraded (availability low presumably). 

The room was small but done out in a good high quality ... King Size bed, walk in oversize rainfall shower, sofa, small desk, reasonable TV (which had a clever system to play content from your tablet or smart phone through the wireless system, which sounded great although I couldn't get it working in the 15 mins I allowed it!). 

The view from the window was a little restricted (though far from the worst I've had in London rooms costing over ¬£200 GBP) but it was OK. 

I used the gym (again, small but very well equipped with cross trainers, treadmills, static bikes, free weights etc.) and was very pleased & impressed with the complimentary water bottle fridge and rack full of towels.

Breakfast was good - tasty and fairly wide ranging items - and friendly service from the staff.
",5,2015,07,13
129,Great hotel great location,"My husband returned to London a day early and found this hotel based on reviews from TripAdviser. We were very happy with the beautiful room and lovely furnishings. The bath in the room was a nice, romantic touch. The heated floors in the bathroom were nice too. The location was great as it was steps away from the National History Museum. There are a number of great restaurants close by. We ordered room service the night we arrived and it was delivered quickly at the price was reasonable. We had a burger and the smoked salmon and cream cheese. Both were a delight. Overall, this was a very nice place to stay and we were very happy with it. We recommend you giving it a shot too.",4,2015,07,12
129,Overnight stay ,"Good location for Natural History Museum, Victoria & Albert, Saatchi Gallery etc... but super tiny room and no bath (I guess relatively normal for most townhouse London hotels). May stick to the larger rooms found in central hotels in the future. ",4,2015,07,12
129,A pleasant hotel with good service,"We visited the Ampersand hotel in South Kensington for a short vacation.

Overall the experience was a very pleasant one, the service at the hotel is excellent and any customer requests were fulfilled with a friendly attitude by the staff. Both breakfast and dinner were good quality, too.

The location is excellent with a short distance to many museums and the nearest tube station is very close by. 
",4,2015,07,12
129,Awesome place to stay,"Everything is great. Awesome service, fast check-in and checkout-, great rooms, really nothing bad. Highly recommended to stay. The hotel is very well decorated and beautiful. I like that place very much.
",5,2015,07,11
129,Great hotel in good part of the city,"One thing I will never get used to is how small the rooms are in London hotels. Yes the real estate must be expensive, but so is Manhattan! The Ampersand rooms and fresh, clean and comfortable, if a little on the cosy side - and we were in a suite (albeit with our 12 year old so we needed the sofa folded out as her bed. Breakfast is good and reasonably priced. Afternoon tea likewise - the meringues are enormous and were loved by said 12 year old. We had dinner in the restaurant the first night and it was good.",4,2015,07,10
129,A real find in the city,"A very comfortable quirky hotel. Just love the decor, bedroom very comfortable, air conditioned which is great, excellent bed, good ensuite with power shower. Only one disappointment there is no club or Business lounge??? 
Evening meal in the cellar was very good same as breakfast, good choice in a different setting. Well placed for the tube an excellent find I would stay again.",4,2015,07,10
129,Boutique luxury,"Enjoyed our stay at The Ampersand Hotel very much - a lovely boutique hotel in a great area to explore London. Lovely room, great afternoon tea, friendly staff and nice area. Would recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,07,10
129,Small but cosy,"Great location, small bedroom with view of brick wall! Drew this to attention of staff who were reasonably disinterested. Also had to advise them of a finished room service tray that lingered on our corridor.
      
      ",4,2015,07,10
129,Superb staff & Innovative interior design,"The Ampersand Hotel is just tops!

Great location in the heart of the Museum district (V&A, Science, Natural History) and English tourism institutions like Harrods. Not only is the South Kensington tube station close by, the Hop On/Hop Off double decker tourist bus stop right outside the hotel's front door.

The staff are all superb, in fact, my travelling part and I wondered about how the hotel finds and retains such a well-suited and dedicated team.

Our twin room on the ground floor was immaculate, creatively decorated in a music theme, with amenities plus (robes, slippers, personal care items, free non-alcohol minibar, umbrella, free wifi, house rubber duckie...), and was very quiet despite being on the ground floor.

Of course one of the unique aspects of the Ampersand is its creative interior decorating, which was an absolute delight from our first day to our last.

We only ate one breakfast in the hotel and that was fine.  I also had a glass of wine in the gorgeous Drawing Room, which was also fine.

If you feel like spending the money - which we did after 'roughing it' though Italy leading up to our London stay - then I would highly recommend the Ampersand.",5,2015,07,09
129,Capsule of luxury,"So glad I treated myself to a 3-night stay. My room (320) was extremely quiet (no street view) and comfortable. I loved being just steps away from the South Ken tube station, restaurants, and fantastic museums. 
Yes, the room was tiny, but was as described.  The ceilings are high and the
Beautiful en suite was larger than expected with a gorgeous shower.  I couldn't have wished for a more comfortable bed.
I hope to stay at The Ampersand again some day. ",5,2015,07,09
129,Good Looking Hotel Well Placed for South Ken Tube,"We enjoyed a good stay at the Ampersand, the hotel is literally 2 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station & is surrounded by several desirable eateries, in addition to many of London's best museums. I had fallen in love with the website photographs & wasn't disappointed,  it is a very attractive hotel decorated in bright & bold contemporary style. The bedroom was also pleasant, compact but tidy & modern, with a nice monochrome bathroom. I had a fine view from my 5th floor room & enjoyed a peaceful sleep in a comfortable bed with lovely linens. Others in our group also rated the hotel though those on lower floors complained that they could hear the rumble of the underground & some were also affected by noise from the lift. Reception were helpful & friendly. We ate in the delightful basement restaurant Apero which serves a tapas style menu. Food was utterly delicious & service friendly & efficient enough but rather disjointed. We were booked as a large group into the restaurant (months ahead) & admittedly we were over half an our after our booked slot when we wandered down from the nearby bar where we were enjoying pre-dinner drinks but we were surprised to find that they had given our table away despite the restaurant being half full.  No-one had thought to pop up to the bar & lead us down or even seemingly made the connection that we were the large group of residents who were booked in but hadn't yet emerged. We did also get the impression that we were being a bit of a nuisance in wanting to continue drinking into the early hours, though staff were never anything but pleasant. These were minor disappointments though & on the whole we felt the hotel served us well & offered a good experience at a reasonable rate.",5,2015,07,09
129,Great Little Hotel,"We were thoroughly delighted with our experience at the Ampersand Hotel.  Everything was scrupulously clean, and ultra modern.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Although there was no ""concierge"" per se, the front desk arranged for a car service to the airport for our very early departure, which turned out to be far superior and less expensive than a taxi.  They even made us fresh coffee at 4:30 am!  Highly recommended!",5,2015,07,08
129,What a wonderful find!,"We were just in London and spent 4 glorious nights at this hotel. We upgraded to a deluxe studio because the first room was lively but tiny. This room #117 was spacious, quiet, and beautifully decorated. In fact the whole hotel decor is just lovely. From the moment we arrived, the staff was totally helpful and willing to please. The front desk planned and reserved all our dinners and we could hardly wait for the next one. All the restaurants were local and excellent. They arranged museum tickets (it's minutes from the Victoria and Albert Museum) and arranged transportation to Gatwick when we departed. 
Love this hotel so much. Thank you Mr. And Mrs. Smith travel for suggesting it. It's new, only a year or so old and privately owned which I think is why the staff is so exceptional. Lovely location in South Kensington near museums and shopping. ",5,2015,07,08
129,'Ab fab',"We had an absolutely fabulous stay - really attentive staff, great decor and perfect High Tea. 
De Lux Room on 2nd floor was superb and the Tube rumble just added some local flavour.
Thanks a million!
....................................",5,2015,07,08
129,Amazing!,"The hotel, its decor and all of the little touches are were very well thought out and designed to make you as comfortable as possible. While the double room might be on the small side, the bed was heavenly and allowed for best sleep. The staff was very helpful and location was absolutely perfect! The Apero restaurant was really good in regards to both the service, speed and the quality of the food. For any future trips, I'll definitely be coming back to the Ampersand.
      ",5,2015,07,08
129,Like a second home! But...,"Overall the stay was very good. We stayed in a double deluxe room (some of the comments I have read about room size made me chose this one). The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. What I really like is the little amenities and facilities in room... it really made you feel like home, so you don't have to worry about a thing at all. 

However, the only one little thing I hope it would be better was this... since we arrived London at around 10pm, so by the time we got there, there was no one to help me with the suitcase. You might think this is nothing, but after a 12 hour sleepless flight, the last thing I really wanted to do is to carry this suitcase up the stairs. At the same time, the check in is also slower than I have expected.. It would really make a real difference! 

But all in all, well done Ampersand, this would definitely be the hotel I would come back next time I visit London again :)",4,2015,07,08
129,Great Location and Great Service,"We spent a few days here at the end of our UK trip.  Was very pleased with the service, cleanliness and location.  Only a few steps away from the tube station made it easy to get anywhere in the city.  Wonderful restaurants down the street made it ideal to grab a late dinner or early breakfast.  Proximity to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens was wonderful for evening strolls.  Would definitely stay here again when returning to London.",5,2015,07,07
129,Enjoyable stay,"We spent 3 nights at The Ampersand and agree with the comments of many other reviewers that the hotel is very service-orientated.  The staff were all excellent and super-friendly.  We also agree with many other reviewers who struggled with the room size.  Although our room was lovely and very clean, it was tiny and facing a brick wall made it dark as well. Even a single occupant would have had difficulty.  We could occasionally hear some slight rumbling from the tube, but noise was not an issue. 

The location of The Ampersand is excellent and with so many things to do during our visit to London, we only ever ate quick continental breakfasts at the hotel.  The buffet selection was good, although some fruit juices instead of just water would have been nice.  The goodies on offer for afternoon tea in the lounge looked amazing. 

We would definitely stay here again, but choose a larger room next time.",4,2015,07,07
129,Big value for small sweet room,"You can't beat the price and location..fabulous. All public areas are beautiful with creative use is color, accessories creating the most pleasant atmosphere.  Our room was very small but for the price I had no complaint..bathroom was terrific. I'm sure that there must be larger rooms for more money but for my needs of a one night visit it was fantastic..loved the South Kensington station location..Staff was friendly, helpful and very efficient ..will definitely return.",4,2015,07,07
129,"Excellent hotel, conveniently located","We spent a few days here as part of a family celebration. What a great hotel. Fantastic staff, super facilities and small but perfectly formed rooms. The location could not have been better either close to the museums and convenient for the underground.
We will be back.",5,2015,07,07
129,small room but great service and stay,"The Ampersand is focused on service! We had a great experience. It is quaint, well appointed and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was tiny but the bed was amazing. Great food and atmosphere at Apero. I would stay there again without hesitation. ",5,2015,07,06
129,"Appealing decor, friendly and obliging staff","I had a very nice stay Ampersand for a three day weekend in June. The hotel is fitted out in a way that makes you feel upbeat and happy just by walking in the door, and the staff were very pleasant and obliging. The bathroom  and indeed the whole place was impressively spotless. I enjoyed a nice meal at the restaurant. It was very busy, obviously not just patronised by hotel guests. My only criticism is that the bed in my single room was a bit  too big for the room so it was hard to manoeuvre from bathroom to suitcase and the little table. ",5,2015,07,06
129,Five Nights in London,"We love The Ampersand!  The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgable.  The location is excellent.  The rooms are great - although we supposedly moved up a level and the room seemed much the same as the ""lower"" level.  Do not get the smallest room as it does not have a closet and is very small for 2 people.  ",5,2015,07,05
129,"Beautiful Design, Great Location","This hotel was a trip highlight for me! I do have to agree my room was quite small however the hotel had told me this upon my booking. It would have been most suitable for one person rather than two. The design was absolutely stunning, very clean and quite even though my room was closest to the lift. And really appreciated the free minibar (which only had juice, soft drinks and water). The only criticism i had was that in the hotel book it stated that the staff could assist with jogging routs in the area. On my first morning i asked and the concierge said he didnt know. Not the end of the world - Hyde park was so close and easy to navigate.",5,2015,07,05
129,Absolutely fantastic,"I used the Three-for-Two offer for the end of my two-week trip to London and all I can say is WOW. This was my first time staying in such a nice hotel and I'll stay again in a heartbeat!
The staff were very courteous, professional and friendly - always got a nice 'hello!' when I walked through the lobby. The building is renovated but the old beautiful charm is still there. The rooms are small, but that feeling is made up for with the super-high ceilings. Bathroom is well situated, even though a bit small. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to check out the breakfast fare or food - guess I'll have to do that next time! :)",5,2015,07,05
129,room 401 very poor value,"We booked this room  only at the ""bargain"" price of ¬£216 per night.
The bathroom is bigger than the bedroom, the hot water tap when switched on made a high pitched whistling sound.
The ""wardrobe"" is tiny and when hanging anything in there,the clothes drape over the glasses and complimentary teas/coffees stored underneath.
The room is dark,the lights didnt really add much light to the bedroom even when all switched on.t
The view from the only window is of a brick wall.
There is no mirror for putting on make up etc,it really was very badly designed .
The fridge is right next door to the bed at head height when you are in bed,so when i turned over during the night i caught my temple on the cupboard corner,resulting in a large bruise.
On our first night we went downstairs for a drink and the staff were unsure as to whether they did brandy or not, 2 phonecalls later,it was revealed that they did.
Check out was slow as the girl ignored me and went to somebody else,she later apologised but i was very surprised that she had made this poor mistake.
When we return to London we wont return here.",2,2015,07,04
129,A little luxury," I was on a business trip in another part of the UK and decided to spend an extra two days in London before heading back home.  The hotel was lovely as was the staff.  I can't think of a single criticism....except maybe....nope, I've got nothing. I can't wait to visit again. ",5,2015,07,02
129,"Comfortable stay, convenient location","I stayed here in June for a week. The hotel is located right next to South Kensington underground station, and is in a lively yet not touristy neighbourhood. I stayed in a superior double room, which was just the right size for one person. The room was a bit on the small side, but was tastefully decorated and very clean. The bed and shower were very comfortable. All of the staff members, from the doorman to the receptionists to the cleaning lady, were very courteous and friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,06,30
129,Perfect luxury hotel experience,"I'd booked the hotel as a special treat for my fianc√© and it surpassed all expectations. We'd arrived very early and hoped to store our bags but not only did the reception accommodate us at 11AM, they also very kindly upgraded us as it was a special occasion. This was a wonderful surprise and helped make the weekend a memorable one. I had also asked beforehand if the concierge could help me with placing a surprise in the room whilst we were out at dinner, and not only did they do this, they also sent up two glasses of bubbles. Yes, it was an expensive stay but for the quality of service, location, ambience and luxurious rooms it's certainly worth it. I can't wait until our next visit!",5,2015,06,30
129,Well done modern hotel with a great location,"We stayed here for three days and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Tremendous service.  Super nice staff.  Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent and the room was really top notch.  Great location for Buckingham Palace, Knightsbridge, Belgravia.  Right across the street for Victoria and Albert Museum and the other museums.  Great restaurants in walking distance.  Definitely going to stay there the next time we are in London.",5,2015,06,29
129,"Great concept, poorly implemented","It's obvious that the owners went to great trouble to renovate this property into the good-looking hotel it is.  However, sadly, the service was poor, with consistent problems with housekeeping, room service, etc.  There were also a number of language problems - many of the staff are not native speakers, and I myself had numerous problems with this, and saw other guests struggle with this as well.  Again, it's a beautiful property, but with an inconsistently trained staff, which really dampened my visit.  I really wanted to like this property, but sadly would not recommend it.",2,2015,06,29
129,Excellent in every sense,"Top service and facilites, coupled with a perfect location.
Only non-5-Star comment is that my room was a wee bit on the small side, but perfectly suitable for a business trip.
Wonderful bed contributed to a top-notch sleeping experience.",5,2015,06,29
129,Consistent & excellent customer service,"Again a great one night stay.Very helpful staff, excellent problem solving skills
This location and modern furnishings always provide a welcome visit. 
Suggest you review the room descriptions as to size, before booking standard vs superior.

129,Great hotel,"We booked in for a Saturday night whilst in London at a music festival at Hyde Park. Prior to arrival I was slightly concerned about how we would fit in returning from Hyde park in our festival gear to a 5 star hotel in South Kensington however it was so laid back and chilled out, perfect! 

Amazing breakfast and great room, thoroughly recommended to anyone seeking a luxury hotel experience without any stuffiness. Love the Ampersand :-) ",5,2015,06,28
129,A Wonderful Stay at a Wonderful Hotel,"The Ampersand is a very special hotel. The reason it is special is the people that work there. The staff provides excellent service. What separates them from our hotels is the attention they give you, and making sure that all your needs are taken care of.
I am looking forward to returning there,",5,2015,06,27
129,Excellent location and service,"The Ampersand Hotel is an excellent choice for location, service and amenities. The hotel is located 100 meters from the South Kensington tube stop. From this station you can get onto the Piccadilly, Central and District lines. Most major destinations in London are less than 20 minutes away. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel doors as well. From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us with genuine friendliness and helpfulness. If we've needed something in our room, it's been delivered within a few minutes after a call to the front desk. Our room, though small, is beautiful with a comfortable bed, an excellent air conditioner and a well stocked fridge with complimentary beverages and snacks. On our next trip through London, we hope to stay here again.",5,2015,06,26

129,Alexander McQueen Mother and Daughter trip,Excellent hotel with beautiful decor in great location very near to the V&A museum. Good service (door opened for us and use of hotel umbrellas nice touch). Our family visited us during our stay and were made to feel equally welcome. Very homely feeling with five star service; a great combination. ,5,2015,06,24
129,Still the only place to stay in London,"As ever the Ampersand was faultless. Location is great, rooms are first class, bed is very comfortable, food is good and as ever the staff are superbly pleasant and helpful. Nearly 18 months since we last stayed and standards have stayed as high as ever. We really should experience  other London hotels, but why? From our previous experiences not only in London but other capitals and large cities The Ampersand is the best.",5,2015,06,24
129,Lovely getaway in busy London,"We got upgraded upon arrival. Room 509. Lovely view over London. Massive big bed, best hotelbed and cushions I ever slept in.

129,Great stay,"Lovely hotel great location very very clean all mod cons good choice.
The hotel name proved a challenge to some taxi drivers as it was changed only a few years ago so be prepared from station to have more details than just the name.

129,Modern hotel with a Surperb location!,"Modern London Hotel with great ambience and a superb location. A few steps from the South Kensington tube station. Very near the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert museum. I walked over to see the Alexander McQueen exhibit at the Victoria. 
I stayed in a small room with astronomical theme which was very well organized. Small tea service for the am in the room. Good free WI Fi and IT port/connections at the desk. Bathroom has a nice shower head and sports a cute blue spotted duck. I really liked having modern fixtures in the bathroom. A great plus!  Restaurant on the ground floor is convenient.

129,Lovely hotel in a great location,We really enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand. The staff were all very helpful and kind and the hotel was very pretty.

Professional staff; good (spendy, as most are) breakfast buffet. 
Quiet room; okay bathroom, comfortable mattress: the basics done well.
All in all, nothing to distinguish itself; follows the current practice of mixing new-and-older styles.

On our first visit we got upgraded but on this visit, although we got an upgrade as well, it was a bit hard to tell. The room was small and dark as it faced a brick wall! However, the hotel service is warm and efficient, breakfast in their downstairs bistro/bar is fantastic, and they even have a small gym. The currency exchange is punishing so it made for an expensive stay but would definitely consider staying there again given the quality of the hotel and the lovely service.",4,2015,06,15

129,great,"I recently had a very pleasant time at the Ampersand. I used to live in London and have been coming back once or twice each year for almost a decade, so I‚Äôve had my fair share of good vs bad hotels. The level of comfort, staff, and location all make this hotel a truly wonderful place. The tube servicing 3 lines (one direct to Heathrow) is only a min walk away. Museums and parks are easily accessible on foot. 

Previously I made a non-refundable booking which I had to cancel, and they were very accommodating to change the booking to another date, different rates notwithstanding; the whole experience (communication via email) was completely hassle-free. So I already had a good impression before I arrived at the hotel. Throughout my stay, the front desk, porters, and other hotel staff are professional and friendly, service is personable yet not intrusive. I had an AC problem in my room on the first night and they resolved the matter quickly by moving me to a new room within 10 minutes. I travel quite a bit and can tell that they‚Äôve got a good team going here. The place is well managed, I hope they can maintain the standard and stay committed (and stay affordable, ha).",5,2015,06,11
129,Nice clean hotel but overpriced for a decent room,"Paid the extra to get a Superior double room. Checked in at 3:30 pm. Was given a noisey ground floor room right near hotel entrance. When I asked to change, the Recepionist said there was nothing available as every one at this rate had already checked in. (Really? An hour and a half after start of check-in?). She did not offer us a solution.

The next morning I did not get my Newspaper as requested the day before.",3,2015,06,10

I don't know who is the housekeping manager but is dooing a great job......and there is a great housekeeper on 5th floor who's dooing profesional job, the best from all hotels i've been. I was treated like a king in a queen's country. Lovely hotel.",5,2015,06,10
129,Stunning Sunrise in London via The Ampersand,"A chic home away from home.Before I even need step out onto my balcony The Ampersand's one bedroom suite has the entire floor to ceiling window displaying a teaser of Londons classic rooftops. The suite was perfect for me and my family and with the sofa bed option in the living room all I had to do was slide the adjoining section shut and I was in my own quarters.

The bathroom floors are heated which is very helpful. It not only dries the marble floors faster but keeps us warm and toasty post shower. A large bathtub accompanied by a big tv awaits along with adorable floatable rubber duckies with the Ampersand logo on them. These little attention to details are not lost on me, I absolutely love it.

Breakfast downstairs at Apero was lovely, check out their interior and deco that didnt fail to draw smiles from us. We had a full English breakfast with delicious black pudding before heading out by foot towards Harrods. They also have a cafe upstairs beside the concierge with a unique array of high tea options which we look forward to trying on our next visit. On the way out towards Harrods/ shopping streets you will pass heaps of cafes,museums, patisseries and right across the road from the hotel is the subway should you need it and right at the entrance of the hotel is usually a line of black cabs ready to take you.

All in all a clean well located hotel with friendly staff who were helpful with our needs.",5,2015,06,09

While a tad bit pricey, it was well worth it; comfortable, clean rooms with lots of extra amenities.  Just steps from the tube - which made traveling with kids ages 14-26 very easy!    

Rooms are small - but you are in London, not in America and things are smaller there...besides, who wants to stay in a hotel room all day??

129,Another great stay at The Ampersand,"This was our second stay at The Ampersand and the hotel continues to impress. 

Yes, the rooms are small, but they are clean and tidy and feature everything you need.

Location is perfect. Walking distance to the tube, Waitrose on the next street over and a number of restaurants and caf√©s close by.

All the staff members we encountered were polite. Special mention goes to the porters who always warmly greeted us when we left/returned to the hotel.

The restaurants and food and beverage on site are not the best but there are other options nearby. There's a free minibar which gets restocked throughout your stay. A nice touch!

Wifi is fast and stable.",4,2015,06,09
129,Amazing boutique hotel,"I absolutely loved staying at the Ampersand. The service was excellent. They have so many little touches that really make your stay special. Everything from the free minibar to amazing, unique breakfast, the inviting decor of the room, and the friendliness of the staff was very impressive. I loved being steps away from the tube and walking distance to Kensington Gardens, Chelsea, site-seeing, etc. ",5,2015,06,08
129,A fabulous hidden gem in the heart of the capital,"We found this hotel completely by fluke, while visiting another. We were looking for a place to stay for myself and my husband (to be) and for our wedding guests in June 2015. The staff were wonderful and eager to please and helped us so much to plan our perfect day.

The rooms were finished to a very high standard and extremely clean. We had drinks in the lounge and breakfast downstairs the following day - which we would highly recommend. 

I totally recommend this hotel; unlike some of the bigger chains, it has heart, soul and exudes friendliness and character. It is like home from home.

The only downside was that we had to check out! ",5,2015,06,08
129,Fantastic experience,"Myself and 14 friends had Afternoon Tea, in the Games Room, at the Ampersand Hotel on Saturday afternoon. From the very beginning, from booking to choosing menus, the communication, staff and service was excellent. The food was fantastic and the staff were welcoming and professional. The hire room, and hotel in general, had very cool decor and was a perfect venue for a private function.",5,2015,06,08
129,Small room at the Ampersand,"Booked a small double room (""intimate yet luxurious"") for two nights during a solo trip to London. The rooms are really really small. You have to manoeuvre around the (admittedly comfortable and rather large) bed. You wouldn't be able to stall any large items of luggage, and I wouldn't recommend the rooms to a couple (unless you're madly in love). I'm familiar with room rates of upscale London hotels, but let's just say that for this size the rooms aren't particularly cheap either. All staff members I met were extremely friendly, knowledgeable and engaging, kudos to them! I asked for a glass of wine when I returned to the hotel late at night, and although the bar was already closed they managed to bring me something. Sadly I have to say the wine (from the bar menu, again coming at a steep price) wasn't really nice at all. I rated the value for money as 'average' which might seem a bit harsh, but given the fact that there were a couple of negatives, that's about right I think.",4,2015,06,07
129,Excellent  Visit,"The Ampersand has a wonderful location close to West Kensington tube station - convenient for visiting all parts of London ...the hotel , having recently had complete renovation,  has first class amenities & service to match ... all together highly recommend for an enjoyable stay in London",4,2015,06,07
129,Lovely and whimsical afternoon tea,"I have not stayed as a guest in this hotel, but I had afternoon tea here in July 2014.

The Ampersand is known for its creative and fun themed teas, taking inspiration from the world famous museums virtually on its door step.  I had the ""Musical Tea"" which featured not only delicious sandwiches and scones with clotted cream and jam, but colorful pastries and cookies in the shape of music notes and musical instruments.  The presentation was delightful and the service was perfect. 

If anyone is looking for a fun, alternative afternoon tea experience, I highly recommend The Ampersand.  In fact, if you combine a nice tea here with some time in the V&A museum (or the Natural History museum or the Science museum) across the street and then a nice walk to Kensington Palace and Gardens not far away, you've got yourself a lovely day out in London.",5,2015,06,07
129,Stunning hotel in South Ken,"The Ampersand is a beautiful hotel, designed with style and comfort in mind. Great location right near to the bistros and museums of South Kensington. High spec rooms and great staff - it deserves its great reputation!",5,2015,06,06
129,PERFECTION IN LONDON,"As a seasoned traveler I cannot begin to explain how wonderful our experience at The Ampersand hotel was. We wanted a 5 star hotel on the perfect location and this was it! We had a deluxe room and it was well worth the money. Great views and an exceptional bed with a beautiful bathroom. We stayed in the hotel 1 week and loved it. The South Kensington Tube stop is just steps from the front door which we loved. The area is beyond perfect. Tons of restaurants and shops and walking distance to many attractions. This was not our first time in London however staying at this hotel made it our BEST trip to this fantastic city. The only downfall is that the breakfast is a complete waste of money. VERY expensive for almost nothing ! We walked directly across the street daily to Muriel's Kitchen for a delicious breakfast for about 1/3 of the price of the hotel. Other than that, its basically perfect. We will be back yearly!",5,2015,06,06
129,Not quite the five star experience as our first visit,"Our second stay at The Ampersand proved a bit of a disappointment compared to our first stellar visit.  The staff is still warm and accommodating but the exceptional Tsui Ping is long gone (her work visa having expired) and the remaining staff less knowledgeable.  The rooms are very, very small.  In fact, we had to upgrade at 40 pounds more per night just to be able to sit down in our room!  To their credit, the staff allowed us to store an extra suitcase downstairs.  Most concerning, the shower must have been designed by a hungry orthopedic surgeon.  It's downright  hazardous.  Surely there must be a safer way to get in and out of a shower.  The location is still terrific, the lobby lively and cheerful, the welcome genuine and warm and the decor truly beautiful.  Check out the amazing art work everywhere in the hotel.  Even the elevator recording has a distinctive voice.",4,2015,06,06
129,"Early check in larger rooms, pay the night before",prepay the night before if you are arriving early into the larger rooms. select an interior room if you are sensitive to street noise. Studio rooms are beautiful and very clean and comfy. Room d√©cor is beautiful. Books in the room remind me of the way the Bel-air Hotel in California used to be.,4,2015,06,05
129,Stylish Hotel - excellent located,"Stayed here for just one night after a evening out in Town.
We were upgraded to a Superior room on the top floor. It (along with the rest of the hotel) has obviously been worked on by a vast army of interior designers with no surface left untouched.
The room was compact but the bathroom was nearly the same size again with the largest shower I think I've ever had in a hotel.
The complimentary mini bar (non-alcoholic unfortunately) was also a nice touch.
Special mention must be made of the staff who were all without exception friendly and willing to assist in any way.

Breakfast is taken in the downstairs vaulted restaurant and comprises a huge spread of breads, cereals, cold meats and juices.
I'm not sure I would have wanted to pay ¬£16+ for it but as it was included in the B&B rate it was  more than acceptable.

Finally, mention should be made of the location which is unbeatable.
Less than 3 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station, and within walking distance of the museums as well as Knightsbridge and Chelsea.",5,2015,06,04
129,Free upgrade ,"The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to the subway. The service is superb. Hassle free check in and check out. Front desk and bell boy are always ready to help if you need anything. I was pleased to find that my deluxe studio got upgraded to the suite for 1 night free of charge  , as I booked the suite separately for the remaining nights to take advantage of the buy 3 free 2 offer . Although my arrangement was a little complicated , the staff was extremely prompt and friendly in helping me organize the booking. I also like how the hotel would send you reminders just before your arrival and also a postcard for you to send to your friends during your stay. Nice touch! The rooms were a little small , but it's comfortable . I adjusted the position of the sofa and dining area a bit so that there is space for our huge suitcases . The toilet however is very spacious considering the size of the room. The drinks and snacks in the fridge are free. Breakfast was quite a cool experience. I loved the interior decor- warm and cosy. All in all, terrific hotel in south Kensington.",5,2015,06,04
129,Excellent Hotel,"This was an Excellent Hotel in all aspects that matter to us.  Great facilities and service.  Excellent location.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  We hope to stay here again on our next visit to London.    
      
      ",5,2015,06,03
129,My home away from home,"The staff is so friendly and the location so convenient that we keep coming back over and over again. The decor is superb, blending both traditional and the modern, and thus offering a refreshing atmosphere away from the boring corporate or the stuffy traditional. A hotel that feels more like a grand but cosy home and which should suit anyone and any occasion. 
      
      ",5,2015,06,02
129,SMALL LUXURY HOTEL IS RIGHT,"Just back from The Ampersand and am compelled to recommend it. From the moment we go there everything was just lovely. Warmly welcomed by smiling,  friendly staff, terrific room with a really luxurious feel, if not huge certainly sumptuous. Fantastic attention to detail all round from little luxury extras in the bathroom, great shower, great towels and robes, complimentary fresh milk and soft drinks in the fridge. Even at the front it was quiet, not disturbed at all. Gorgeous lobby space for tea, real tea leaves too. Doorman friendly and gave us best advice on tube changes with our suitcases, thanks doorman. Will certainly use this hotel next visit. Thanks for looking after us so well, exceptional service, great location, great sleep, who could ask for anything more?",5,2015,06,02
129,Nice hotel in South Kensington,"Very nice hotel in London,me and my friend stayed here for two nights.Perfect for Royal Albert Hall,a ten minutes walk.Perfect for underground,2 minutes walk.Plenty of museums and restaurant around the corner.Service is good,we got a late check out at 2pm.Free soft drinks in the minibar,and a . very good bed.No problem to ant to book again.A very clean hotel in South Kensington,not far from Harrods and other shops.",4,2015,06,01
129,Perfect hotel for a short stay,"Incredible staff, helpful and kind. By all means avoid single room - claustrofobically small. I had to move my carry on bag every time I needed to walk around the bed or go to the bathroom. What is nice is a free minibar stocked with soft beverages and milk. You can also make a coffe in your room. Cleaning was horrible, however, that was the first time out of my four stays at Ampersand.",4,2015,05,31
129,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Service","I booked this hotel last minute, as I was doing the Bupa 100000 on Bank Holiday monday.
Check-in was relatively easy, The room was ok, except it smelled of smoke, quite strongly.  
Saying that, I'd stay again.",4,2015,05,31
129,Gorgeous. ,I booked this hotel as a treat for a few days in London. I had stayed there before and wasn't disappointed this time. My room was lovely and well stocked. It is in a perfect location and the staff are extremely helpful. Room service breakfast was great. ,5,2015,05,31
129,Recommended,"Wonderful service, great location, and the room was very good. The only negatives were the stench of cigarette smoke upon entering our room on arrival, the loose light switches, loose bathroom tap and broken towel rail in the shower.  The hotel will definitely deserve five stars if hotel maintenance is assigned to to check and fix these minor but annoying  faults in each room. I would recommend that guests request a non-smoking room and book through Tablet hotels to receive the excellent complimentary continental breakfast.",4,2015,05,29
129,Great and unforgetable nice experience!!,"We are delighted on having experienced such an excellent stay at the Ampersand during our first visit to London! Our room was excellent, the bed was extra comfortable, the sweets on our welcome were tasty, the peace and quiet was perfect to rest, etc,etc, etc The hotel itself is a great pleasure to the senses, the special deco of the different areas is carefully selected, all tiny details are taking care of, the staff is highly professional,  resourceful and committed. All these details  help to make the hotel special. Of course we will come back and highly recommend it!!!",5,2015,05,29
129,"Great place to stay, friendly staff, nice hotel","Charming hotel, friendly and helpful staff, close to tube and many restaurants, small place for clothes but we didn't need more. Minibar with sodas and water is free. The inside rooms are great to get a good night sleep.
      ",5,2015,05,29
129,Fantastic boutique hotel in wonderful location,"We had stayed at the Ampersand before, and sent others there as well.  It did not disappoint.  The rooms are not large, but they are so attractive and serene and the bathrooms well equipped with glorious rain showers and all the other amenities.  While the entire concierge/check in staff was friendly and warm, of course some were better at offering ideas and suggestions of restaurants and things to do than others.  A hotel of this level needs to offer ideas for private tours, behind the scene activities, unique places to see and go - not just hand the client a brochure filled with bus tours.  Otherwise, the Ampersand remains cheery, beautiful, a stone's throw from Museums and a great Tube stop...and there's always tea and food and pleasant places to sit.  Love this hotel.",5,2015,05,28
129,First Class Hotel In Excellent Location,"From check in to check out this hotel was first class all the way. Next time I need a room in London I would not hesitate to stay here again.Highly recommended would definately advise a stay here. Only down side was a little pricey for the room size, but its in London after all.",5,2015,05,28

129,"Great location, close to South Kensington tube station","The Ampersand was fabulous. We stayed in 3 different rooms because of leaving London and returning. The staff were all extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating. The location of the hotel was good being close to the tube and many restaurants and pubs. Very close to Hyde park, a number of museums and attractions. Our rooms were all mostly quiet and comfortable although the last room was very small, hardly much room for luggage. We had extended our stay so our room choices were limited. Free WIFI, room safe and coffees, teas, bar fridge with bottled water and pop. Very small gym downstairs and a kind of odd restaurant as well. Many other better choices close by. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,05,26
129,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here for bank holiday weekend and was a lovely, clean hotel. Very good location close to South Kensington tube station, and many restaurants and atttractions such as museums. Staff were very polite however the shower was very hot and set off the smoke alarm sending staff up to knock on the door.
Would definitely recommend to friends and family though.",4,2015,05,26
129,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel because it is at a convenient distance from the Chelsea Flower Show.
The hotel is very close to the South Kensington underground station, it is a a few minutes walking from the V&A museum and in a really nice neighborhood with nice restaurants and bars. 
The hotel is a very stylish classical building that has been redecorated with great taste and attention for details. The color scheme i s black, white and red. The wall paper on our floor showed magnified extracts of a scientific dictionary showing the definition of an experiment or an organism etc. Everything done  with great taste! 
The reception is very very friendly and helpful. You feel immediately welcome. You will notice the staircase which boosts a gracious light tree that grows from the -1 floor all the way up to the fifth floor. 
The key to the room is a touch and go system via a terminal next to the door. Again done very stylishly in glass with a nice blue backlight. The black and white color scheme continues in the room, actually all through the hotel.
We had room 318, an upgrade of what we booked. The room is very spacious, quiet and has a nice couch and high quality flat screen TV, with speaker in the bathroom. It has a spacious shower, no bath. Internet was for free.
The restaurant is the only slight disappointment. It is on level -1 and doesn't fit at all with the classy style of the hotel. It is some kind of brasserie set-up. The food is fine, the breakfast included in the price if the room was poor: everything was cold food, no scrambled eggs etc. for that you need to order √† la carte and pay 22 pounds extra. Dinner in the evening was not so good: our table was a clumsy 2 persons table wish worn out chairs. Most tables feature a couch kid of seat fixed against the wall. The food was good. The service was fast in the evening and a bit disorganized in the morning. 
We will certainly stay in this hotel again! It is not cheap, but it gives value for the money.",5,2015,05,25
129,best hotel experience to date,"Everything about this hotel is excellent. Here are a few of the things that made it a great experience for me and my partner - we stayed here in May 2015:

- Location steps from the South Kensington tube station.
- Heated bathroom floors -- what a great perk!
- Quiet rooms -- probably the quietest we've ever stayed in. No noise transfer from other rooms, and minimal hallway noise in the morning.
- Amazing staff who go above and beyond to ensure your comfort.
- High-quality restaurant Apero (we had breakfast there almost every day -- and when we didn't, we wished we had)
- Small-ish hotel but big enough to have perks like 24-hour room service, a small gym and business centre.
- Beautifully appointed with great art and furnishings.
- The umbrellas are awesome!
- Free, reliable WiFi

We stayed in a Superior room, which was perfect for our one-week stay. We will book at this hotel again when we are next in London.",5,2015,05,25
129,Anniversary break,"Excellent hotel with great location, friendly staff, clean rooms and good public areas. Second time here, this time went for a basic double rather than larger double, was on the cramped side so would recommend spending the extra ¬£s per night to go large.",5,2015,05,25
129,"Great Room, Great Staff","A handy location close to the tube. Our room fitted the 5 star bill, and the front desk staff were attentive. Parking was tricky, we used the cul de sac behind to unload from the rental car. Had breakfast multiple days down stairs and the open selection fitted the bill. Late afternoon coffee and cake one day was great. Had a casual lunch at Le Pain Quotidien around the corner. Quick and tasty for a busy cafeteria. Yes I'd stay again.",5,2015,05,22
129,Amazing!!,"A really beautiful Hotel in an amazing location at the heart of everything! Staff are really friendly and attentive! We will definitely be making a trip to saty here next year! Thank you for a wonderful time!                  
      
      ",5,2015,05,20
129,Good enough but room for so much improvement,"Adequate but that's not what one would expect from a boutique 5-star in central London - everything about this place is lacklustre. The rest of the trip was amazing - Eric Clapton at RAH in private box, the Greenhouse restaurant in Mayfair for example so the hotel really didn't live up to its hype - we'd booked a suite which was fine but just so-so. Don't think we will be back.

129,Amazing Experience,"The Ampersand is a charming boutique hotel centrally located near museums, the tube, restaurants and shopping areas.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay enjoyable.

My room was fabulous. It was very comfortable and well appointed. The mini bar was stocked everyday with water and soft drinks, all complimentary. It was my husbands birthday while we were there and we came back to our room to find a happy birthday plate of pure deliciousness left on the bed with a lovely note from the front desk. The hotel is in a wonderful neighborhood with fantastic restaurants just steps from the front door. If your confused about what hotel to stay in while in London, think no more. The Ampersand is a good value for what you get. Its in a very convenient location. South Kensingston station across the street. Walk to Harrods is 7 minutes. Tracey and Indira at the front desk are incredibly lovely. They make the general manager look like a genius for hiring them. I cannot say enough nice things about The Ampersand.

129,Great base for a London experience,"This is a first class hotel with great rooms, facilities, staff AND it's close to all forms of transport. South Kensington station within 100 meters, taxi rank out the front along with metro bus stop and a hop-on-hop-off bus stop. In house dining is great and you are within two minute walk to over 5 local restaurants.",5,2015,05,09
129,Perfect Luxury for a Solo Traveler,"I rave about this place!  There is a tiny studio room so I picked the next size up (Deluxe I think?) and it was pretty tiny but perfect for a solo traveler like me.  It had a queen size bed and mini desk and full size bathroom.  The only thing I found too small was the closet.  The decor was perfect neutrals with black - a very serene but modern style.  If you love clean bathrooms then this is the place for you. The tub, heated tiled floors, and counter looked brand new.  It was simple and exactly what I wanted.  The mini fridge is hidden in the nightstand and I love that that they give you free sodas, juices, and water.  Of course, I asked for a refill every night.  

The room is updated with fast wifi and cool remote card access.  I also loved that I could remote into the TV.  It is a very techy forward hotel.  The staff was friendly and answered all my requests.  Lastly, the hotel is well situated - taxi line-up is in front, tube station is literally kitty-corner and the best museums are 4 blocks away.  The entire neighborhood is a delight to walk around with lots of activity.  It doesn't feel very touristy but more of an uptown vibe.  

The cost of the hotel was very cheap compared to my other hotels and I would stay here in a heartbeat.  Coming from NYC, the lack of space is not an issue but I would caution those that may find it too tiny for their tastes.",5,2015,05,08
129,Friendly and helpful,"A beautiful hotel with helpful and attentive staff, relaxed and welcoming.  Tea is the Drawing Room is wonderful.  Fantastic room with large walk-in shower allocated to elderly parents with mobility issues   Exceeded already high expectations from reading previous reviews.  Great location. ",5,2015,05,08
129,First choice for London.  I won't stay anywhere else from now on.,"Location - perfect.  South Kensington tube (Piccadilly, Central and District lines) 100 yards.  Natural History museum 250 yards.  V&A/Science museums 400 yards.  Dozens of restaurants, cafes, even a Tesco Metro and a Little Waitrose, within easy distance.  Albert Hall, Harrods, Kensington Gardens half a mile.

Quality of hotel and room - perfect.  Way better than I'd expect of a hotel in this star/price bracket.  A room safe is expected nowadays but not always provided.  The Ampersand provides one, big enough for a laptop plus a tablet and all the other stuff we travel with now.  Complementary water and soft drinks in the room fridge were an unexpected bonus.

Quality of service - perfect.  The only time I've seen this many happy, helpful people was in Hyderabad.  Nothing close in a hotel in USA or Europe.

Food - very good.  I'm vegetarian so the main menu was too restrictive for me to eat in the hotel restaurant in the evening (Not a problem with so many local eateries) but we had the breakfast.  I have no complaints about the quality of the buffet but the choice was not as good as I've seen in some other hotels of a similar class - only three choices of cereal, plus granola; no real choice of bread for toast, though it was from an unsliced loaf so you can cut yourself a doorstep if you want; coffee was from a small cafetiere and a little bitter, rather than filter - but I'm nit-picking as everything else about the hotel was so good.

If you've read my other reviews you'll have seen that the availability of complementary wi-fi is one of my hobby horses :)  NO complaints here.  Wi-fi was free and of excellent quality.",5,2015,05,07
129,5 nights in London---a dream hotel,"My wife and I stayed 5 nights in April 2015.  We found the Ampersand on tripadvisor and were not disappointed.  This was the perfect hotel for our trip.  We had been to London before and wanted to stay away from the tourist areas.  The Ampersand is perfectly located in South Kensington and near Chelsea.  A tube station is less than a half block away and the area is full of incredible dining and a great area for spring walks for a leisure vacation.  The hotel it self was the nicest we had ever stayed at and we do a fair amount of travel.  The staff was incredibly professional yet laid back, perfect for 20-40 year old travelers.  We will stay again when we return to London in 3 years.",5,2015,05,06

129,Perfect Place for a Short Stay in London,"We bookended our romp through the English countryside with short stays in London at the Ampersand. It was a perfect choice. The hotel is large enough to have amenities like a nice restaurant and lounge, but not so large that it becomes drab and generic. It's a stylish little place, and in the best possible location. South Kensington is out of the tourist crush, but close enough to the heavily touristed areas for easy access. The gardens and Hyde Park are just a few blocks away, great museums just one block away, and for trips further afield the South Ken tube station is half a block away. It's on the Picadilly Line, so if you're traveling light you can just take the tube direct from Heathrow. The only small downside is that you do hear the rumble from those trains, but it was never annoying. Don't forget to stop by the lounge for a cream tea - the scones here were probably the best of our trip. Friendly service all around too. Good stay!",4,2015,05,05
129,Not as good as I expected,The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed...however the room smelled musty.  I didnt ask for a change.  After an international flight it seemed too much of an effort and by the time we rested up we decided we would just live with it.  On the plus side the location is great and the staff is helpful.,3,2015,05,04
129,Really nice hotel in good location,"Good value for money and friendly and helpfull staff. The breakfast is really good, a lot of options. It's in a good location, close to the subway, parks and resturants. The rooms in some categories are a bit small so go for the deluxe room if you have the option.

Excellent service in all part of the hotel, wonderfull decorated rooms and this 50 metres from the Tube¬¥s South Kensington Station, makes the Ampersand the ideal starting point to discover the posh part of London (Chelsea, Kensington, Mafair and Marylebone). Really recommended",5,2015,05,03
129,Overall I'd say just okay,"Pros: The bed and sheets were very comfortable, the room was quiet, and the heating/cooling in the room actually works, so I slept well. The bathroom was nice. Both are clean. The light fixture in the stairwell is beautiful. The location in South Kensington is great with lots of restaurants, the tube, and museums nearby.

Cons: The room is tiny - actually they upgraded me from superior to deluxe but there is still very little room to walk around the bed. I chose the superior because I thought the room looked pretty and bright, while the deluxe room was very dark (didn't realize this until after I'd unpacked and couldn't be bothered to ask to switch). I had trouble getting the wifi to work. Went back to my room one day at 3.30 for a rest and it wasn't made up yet. Between 3.30 and 5 I was interrupted three times by housekeeping, despite the fact I told them each time that I was trying to rest.",3,2015,05,02
129,Wonderful stay,"Very special hotel with the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. Fabulous service, achieving the difficult balance of being helpful and friendly without being intrusive. 
Good location in the heart of South Kensington. Walking distance to Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens. 
Be warned you can feel/ hear the rumble of underground trains, but the don't run overnight and to my mind is all part of the city vibe. ",5,2015,05,02
129,Luxury hotel in south Kensington,"Beautiful hotel, luxurious, quality design, first class service.

Stayed for our wedding anniversary after booking through mr&mrs smith website. Complimentary glass of champagne and petit fours were provided. Room was very spacious. King size bed was very comfortable. Stylish room and bathroom. The shower was fantastic and the heated floor a nice touch. Dined in the attached apero restaurant, excellent tapas style food. Went for drinks in Kensington and returned to find a plate of chocolate brownie with an anniversary message written in chocolate. Classy hotel.",5,2015,05,02
129,Excellent hotel in the heart of South Kensington,"I had business to conduct at ICL and this hotel was conveniently located. No complaints except for the price, but that's just the way London is...
The staff were very friendly, the room I was in was small but functional with a very nice bathroom.",5,2015,05,02
129,location and staff are the best,"The hotel is lovely with an attentive, and accommodating staff.  The hotel is steps to South Kensington Station with easy access to various tube lines. It's an easy walk to the V & A, plus other musuems, restaurants,  and more.",5,2015,05,01
129,Great hotel & simply the best service!!!,"Really enjoyed my stay in Ampersand Hotel. I loved the location, so handy for Heathrow and for everywhere in London, the tube station is right beside. I also loved the area for browsing and lovely coffee shops!. 
The hotel is lovely, the room was quite small, i have to admit but had everything you could want and more, really comfortable and great shower
Staff really make this place great though, they couldn't do enough and special thanks to go them for so quickly locating the Iphone i left behind and insuring and sending to me by registered post which i got only 2 days later, so so efficient and really above and beyond. 
Thanks, would recommend highly.",5,2015,05,01
129,Perfect stay,"Amazing hotel with lovely, friendly people who work within it!
Our stay was short but was very nice, the staff we're thoughtful and helpful. Food was delicious and the room was perfect for us and our small baby..

129,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","Cannot fault it. Stayed here for a business meeting, staff were amazing, room was spot on. Despite being next to the tube station, was quiet as well. Also, the best breakfast I have ever had!! An amazing stay!",5,2015,04,30
129,Return trip,"Just returned from another great stay. I got a good deal for a room one step up from the cheapest room, which was much better. A view of the airshaft, but I was not in the room much. The smallest rooms literally leave no room to walk around the bed and you have to put your suitcase in the bathroom. Location is perfect, easy 45-minute Tube ride direct to Heathrow, loads of restaurants at all price points nearby. The beds are super comfortable, great quality toiletries and free basic mini bar beverages. The fresh milk is lovely, although the container on my last morning was sour--did not have time to call for another. Generally very quiet although housekeeping had a habit of slamming a supply closet door shut. Very friendly staff I didn't really need, but they seemed ready to help if asked. Free wifi should be standard everywhere but isn't--speed here was good and reliable.",5,2015,04,29
129,Very nice hotel with great staff,"This is a great hotel and the staff are very efficient and friendly. I would have given a 5 rating but there were one or two things that stopped this from being perfect for me. The feather pillows are horrendously soft and spoiled my sleep which was a shame as the bed was very comfortable. The smoke / carbon detector has a very bright green light which is also quite disturbing if you like a dark room.  My room on the second floor shook with every tube. However, when I mentioned it to the reception staff, they immediately suggested another room on the 4th floor which was much better. I also mentioned the pillows and they have updated my profile to ensure that I get firmer pillows on the next stay so they couldn't do enough to help. There was some door banging noise as the doors seem to be on a strong self-closing mechanism. We had breakfast from the buffet (can't see why breakfast isn't included in the price) which was varied and very good.  All in all I would definitely stay at the Ampersand again.",4,2015,04,29
129,London-trip,"For my 3 day London-trip I had the most satisfying stay at the Ampersand. Excellent room service, nice room, small but well furnished, good food. I will definitely go back there for my next stay in London.

129,Excellent location and stylish hotel,"Nice interiors and very friendly staff, yet the room I got was very small and annoying small space. So, make sure to avoid this type of rooms. They really need to re consider these rooms. Great speed of Check-in and Check-out and excellent WiFi service 
              ",4,2015,04,28
129,Perfect stay,"I have booked with Tablet Hotels so I got with Tablet plus free upgrade, breakfast and other amenities. The hotel is perfectly located one minute walking from South Kensington tube station. The hotel has a nice decor in every area and the staff is very kind and fast. The room was a good size for London standard and the bathroom has a nice decor. Quality/price is one of the best hotel I have used in London. ",5,2015,04,27
129,Fabulous Hotel,"A friend recommended this hotel and we owe him a HUGE thank you. The hotel is beautiful, the staff very professional, helpful and cheerful and the location couldn't be better for a tourist. As our Canadian dollar is quite low compared to the pound, the hotel is slightly expensive but we feel that we received great value during our nine day stay. The staff were amazing. If a client seemed to want to be left alone , they were. If the client wanted to chat, they made time to do so. They were attentive to your every need. Our room was spacious and gorgeous. We were on the first floor and could hear a very low rumble when a tube train passed under the hotel but heard no street traffic even though a bus stop is directly in front of the hotel including the stop for the hop on hop off bus tours. The tube noise was never annoying and so low in volume and pitch that you almost imperceptably felt it rather than heard it.",5,2015,04,27
129,Such a beautiful hotel,"We stayed at the Ampersand for five days and it was wonderful. 
The hotel is great. Staff were very welcoming and helpful from beginning to end. 
We had a room on the first floor facing the street with a bathtub in the main room. While there was a bit more noise during the day, at night it was pretty quiet.  
The hotel is beautifully decorated with so much attention to detail. There are ampersands on the paper used in drawers, on the pencil provided in the room, on some of the towels. The wallpaper inspired by the museums nearby is beautifully done, and the books in the room are well chosen (we had books about plants). 
We had breakfast at Apero on a couple of occasions and that was also very good. 
The location is handy, very close to South Kensington Station.
We would definitely stay there again when visiting London. Highly recommended.",5,2015,04,26
129,Luxurious boutique hotel with 5* service,"The hotel provided excellent services before, during and after our stay. Before, because for some reason I had to direct a delivery from my online purchase to the concierge before I check-in. Staff was prompt in acknowledging my request. Next I had to call the hotel to arrange for a pick-up from Victoria coach station, which was also done without any problems. During, because they provide daily top-up of our mini-bar in the room. The room was comfy and felt rather new. After, because my delivery didn't arrive as scheduled and the hotel offered to re-direct to my Singapore address (thankfully they managed to locate it just before I head to the airport!). Totally impressed with the grand boutique hotel and the personal touches they provided during my short stay.",5,2015,04,26
129,What a brilliant discovery,"I was in London for the beginning of the Alexander McQueen exhibition and chose the Ampersand simply because it was so close to the V&A. What a brilliant choice it turned out to be. I was hoping for a lot from my one-night stay: to feel pampered, relaxed and super-comfortable. And that's just what I got. The free (soft drink) minibar and free wifi were a great start - at last... a hotel that was giving me what I wanted rather than looking for opportunities to fleece me! The staff were excellent: welcoming and friendly without being intrusive. 

I stayed in a standard double and although it was fairly small I found it very well designed and never felt cramped, although guests with more than just overnight bags might find it difficult to stow their luggage. The bed was sublimely comfortable with gorgeous linen, and despite some rumbling noise (I'm not sure whether it was the lift or noise from the Tube) I slept exceptionally well. The bathroom also made good use of a fairly small space and the shower had good water pressure. I usually prefer to use my own toiletries, but these ones were just too tempting.

The hotel is situated in a buzzy part of Kensington, surrounded by cafes and just a few minutes walk from the museums. As a great fan of the South Ken museum buildings, the icing on the cake for me was the night-time view from my room of the enchanting illuminated roof of the Natural History Museum.  So thank you, Ampersand, for a brief stay that left me feeling refreshed, relaxed and happy. I'm already planning my next visit.",5,2015,04,25
129,Best Boutique Hotel Ever,"This is a wonderful hotel in South Kensington. The exterior has a classic residential look. Reception area is lovely with a very pleasant drawing room nearby where tea and cocktails are served. The bar and restaurant are on the lower level. We booked a deluxe studio, and it was perfect. It is large, luxurious and has a bay window, a sofa, a desk, and a bar area. The mini bar has complementary soft drinks. If a guest wants something that is not there, he or she may call the front desk and request it. The room is technologically advanced. There is a light to engage upon leaving the room to summon housekeeping. Likewise for Do Not Disturb. The bathroom floor is heated. There is a TV recessed into the wall facing the bathtub. Umbrellas are provided in the room and at the front door. Wonderful goodies in the bathroom. There is even a taxi que just steps down the street, and the South Kensington station is just around the corner. The Ampersand has it all!",5,2015,04,25
129,A stand out 5* in London,"My wife and I rarely get the chance to go away without the kids, so when we do, it needs to be somewhere special. There are hundreds of 5 star hotels in London, so which one to chose?

Room sizes are notoriously small in London, so this was a major consideration, as was a big bed (goes hand in hand I suppose). The bathroom needs to be immaculate, modern and include shower and bath. All mod cons should be a given (large flat screen TV, Sky, free in room wifi, nespresso etc.). Location is important too, central well served by local bars, shops and tube.

We researched extensively using a number of well known travel sites, and Trip Advisor of course. Almost by accident we stumbled across the Ampersand just before choosing an alternative - what an excellent choice that proved to be!

Through their own website we were able to book a suite for the price we were expecting to pay for a room elsewhere, a great deal. 

The suite was modern, Immaculate and spotlessly clean with a separate living room with kitchenette. Modern technology was all around with secured personal wifi in room and no less than 3 TVs ! ( 42"" internet TVs in lounge and bedroom, and a small flat screen in the bathroom).

The bathroom was large, modern, very clean and stylish. The bedroom was not massive but big enough for the king bed, bedside tables and a writing desk.

The hotel ticked all the boxes listed above, plus having an excellent bar/restaurant, gym, drawing room as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was a particular treat, there are plenty of places to eat nearby but why go elsewhere when it's this good.

Location was excellent, 2 mins from the tube with plenty of bakeries, bars and restaurants near by. Service was excellent as you would expect.

We had a wonderful time and I hope to stay there again in the future.

129,First time in London,"My husband and I had a delightful time at the Ampersand Hotel.  The atmosphere, location, pricing, comforts...everything was perfect.  We had several options to get around town to tour and to eat within walking distance or a quick hop onto the tubes across the street.  This was a fantastic choice for our first trip to London, we hope to visit again.  Loved the morning breakfast!  Perfect way to start the day :)",5,2015,04,23
129,Great place and staff,On my first business trip to London. I enjoyed the stay a lot. Great room and nice welcome. Super nice to get the umbrella help out to grab a Taxi.

The staff were friendly and helpful, everything you could think of was provided in the room - coffee machine, fresh milk, free soft drinks mini bar, TV in sitting area, bedroom and bathroom! Birthday petit fours and glass of champagne.  Brilliant position near the tube, round the corner from museums, lots of places locally to sit out and eat. Good breakfast with interesting choices and not ridiculously priced.  Would certainly return.",5,2015,04,23

So close to Kensington tube station, gorgeous boutiques and devine eateries.  It was perfect.  I would recommend to anyone.  Only issue what no pug near mirror to blow dry hair and rooms quite small.",5,2015,04,22

The hotel is minutes from the South Kensington tube station. ",5,2015,04,22
129,The best in South Kensington,"High quality hotel with the personal care of a small boutique hotel. Room was perfect. Dining for breakfast was top class. Super close to the Underground and Piccadilly line so easy access from Heathrow. Free mini bar drinks. Great proximity to lots of great restaurants. Close to museums. Will always recommend. Will always stay there again.

129,Ampersand cool...,"Great location, look and feel of this hotel. The staff were always helpful, and the rooms looked as advertised. We would recommend to friends and family. We didn't get to have the delicious looking afternoon tea as this was booked out on both Saturday and Sunday, so if this is on your agenda, book in advance.Our only negative was the sound proofing, we could hear the bathtub above us being drawn, used and emptied, slamming guest doors and the occasional tube rumble. Our advice, stipulate a room above the 2nd floor and at the front of the hotel.
              ",4,2015,04,21
129,"Gorgeous hotel, great location, very small room, quite expensive if you don't get a promotional rate","I loved this hotel (It iis quite expensive, but to be fair, it is in South Kensington so I guess I should expect that?).
It was beautifully decorated, super clean, the staff are fantastic and friendly, and helpful!
Our room was very small with virtually no storage but I think you can pay more to get a bigger room with presumably more storage.

FREE mini bar is a nice touch (coke. Diet coke, still water, sparkling water, 2 juices, milk) and the free wi fi works really well).

It is about 2 mins walk from the South Kensington tube station (which is on the Picadilly line so you can get there straight from Heathrow for about ¬£5 - rather than paying for the Heathrow express and transferring at Paddington).

Lots and wonderful patisseries near by (Paul's, Gail's and 1-2 others).  Fantastic pizza places walking distance (Brompton Rd) and Indian across the road.

We walked into Oxford Street from the hotel through Hyde park.  It was a few kilometres walk but we knew that and wanted to do that rather than catch the tube and not see anything.

We walked to Stamford Bridge from the hotel (to see Chelsea play) - about 25 min walk (past beautiful shops and cafes on Fulham Road).

I would definitely stay there again!!!",5,2015,04,21
129,3rd stay and still one of the best!,"We took our in-laws for their wedding anniversary and the hotel looked after all of us fantastically, happy to fulfill the request to have a bath in one of the rooms, made sure that their room details to sign at check in didn't include the price as it was a treat and we didn't want them to see the details. They also had a plate of treats with a Happy Anniversary message waiting in their room. As we booked through Mr&Mrs Smith we had a complimentary glass of champagne each, they hotel were happy to swap 2 of these for alternative drinks which was very good of them. The rooms are comfortable, stylish and have everything you need. The beds are super comfortable, the mini-bar is included and the underfloor heating in the bathroom is very welcome when you have to get up in the night! I have no doubt we'll be staying again.",5,2015,04,21
129,"Lovely decor, great location, comfy beds",Stayed twice now and still love. Great value for money and breakfast incl. lovely breakfast selection. Really comfy beds. Would avoid standard rooms though if staying more than one night as they are pretty cramped for two. Room 418 had quite a lot of lift noise. ,4,2015,04,20
129,Business in UK,"Great hotel, central Kensington location. Nice and friendly staff. Could easily come back if I have business in that part of London again.
Close to the Underground. Small cozy rooms but that is classic London.

129,Gem,"Just stayed 6 nights at this wonderful boutique hotel, the staff are fantastic, special thank you to Beatrice on the front desk. The hotel is very close to the V and A Museum steps from South Kensington tube station so easy traveling around London. The continental breakfast was excellent we were spoiled for choice. Lovely toiletries in the room, free wi-fI, nice linens, and smart TV attention to detail is evident. Room tip take a higher floor as the rumble of the tube can be heard on the ground floor.",5,2015,04,18
129,Perfect boutique hotel in ideal location,"Our family of five(three teenagers and two adults stayed in a suite which interconnected with a deluxe room and this worked perfectly as we were all able to enjoy the living space. Understandably in central London, the rooms were fairly small but still beautifully decorated and with all the extra facilities that you would expect with a surprisingly large bathroom(separate bath and shower) in the suite. The beds were extremely comfortable and the noise level was low because we were on the top floor. The food in the restaurant was very enjoyable as they offer a sharing type of menu which was very high quality. We intend to visit again soon.",5,2015,04,16
129,Birthday weekend,"Very pleasant stay - pretty satisfied. Would recommend it.

Positives:
-Gorgeous Drawing Rooms - great for tea and cake
-Very comfortable Bed
-The weekend was a surprise for my boyfriend and the staff were excellent at being discrete about my plans.
-Service was very smooth and friendly
-Breakfast in bed was tasty and delivered on time
-Well furnished all over
-Requests such as the room facing the back, being on a higher floor and being quiet were heeded to.

Negative:
-Deluxe Room was more compact than I hoped (albeit well furnished), which made the stay feel a little less luxurious. Any excess space was just enough to ensure one could get around comfortably, so it felt a bit restricted which was surprising given the rate paid for the room. I suspect that the Deluxe Studio would be a more enjoyable option.

The service was great, starting from the fabulous restaurant tips we got prior to arriving (loved the Indian family restaurant Thali!) to the smooth check-in and help that was always available at the lobby. We even received an anniversary platter!  The location is fabulous, tube station right next to the Ampersand and a lovely walking distance via the Hyde Park to Piccadilly Circus. Lots of restaurants nearby, very nice atmosphere around the hotel. Beautiful design inside the hotel, too, free Wi-Fi and newspaper delivered to your room every morning.

129,Loved the Location,Traveled to London for Spring Break with my family of 5 (3 teens) this was perfect! Kensington offered so much for my family with the Underground being so close and the local bistros & cafes gave my family plenty of choices for food! My 2 teen daughters loved that they could walk to Chelsea for shopping and my teen son was happy the Science museum was a short walk from the hotel. The hotel staff was great they greeted us always with a smile and offered to assist with any questions.  I did book 2 rooms to accommodate my family and I recommend if you need a roll away book the larger king room it was perfect for 3 people. We did eat at the hotel restaurant for breakfast several times it was very good!,4,2015,04,14

Blocks from the V&A, Science Museum, Kensington Palace, great shopping and restaurants in Chelsea and Kensington.  Room and hotel is gorgeous.  Loved that they provide daily newspaper, free wifi, water and soda everyday in our room fridge.  Library and Game room is a wonderful reprieve. Work out room is adequate for a quick work out while on vacation.  ",5,2015,04,12
129,Brilliant hotel,"Some friends had recommended this hotel to me and I was not disappointed. Brilliant location and such a gorgeous design. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the overall feel is cosy is relaxing. It almost had a country retreat feel but with a cool city vibe. 

My room was ¬£155, it was just one night so I went for the cheapest. The room was small and the bathroom tiny so I wouldn't want to stay more than 2 nights without upgrading. Whilst you get water and juice in your room sadly it didn't include breakfast. I never really like it when hotels don't include breakfast but it's becoming more and more common. However, this is Central London and a 10 minute walk from Harrods so all in all a fabulous hotel and I will stay there anytime I am in the area. ",5,2015,04,11
129,Good value for money,"I spent a lot of time trying to find a hotel for our family of 5 adults.  We needed 3 rooms and wanted a treat with some luxury but did not want to pay a small fortune for one night. I eventually chose this hotel after looking at many others.  We were very pleased with our choice.  
The hotel is located in South Kensington which is good for museums such as the Natural History Museum and for high end shopping such as Harrods.  What i didn't realise is that is also very close to some lovely cafes and smaller shops such as Fernandez and Wells, Roots and Bulbs, Patisserie des Reves and an independent book shop.   
I don't use lifts so wanted rooms on the ground or first floor.  We were given rooms 10, 12 and 14 which were a superior double and twin and a standard double.  Two of the rooms were accessible for those with disabilities which meant that they were larger than other rooms at that price.  They were very spacious with high ceilings and excellent showers.  The beds were amazingly comfortable - to the extent that we made sure to find out the brand for future reference.  The rooms include a small fridge with complimentary soft drinks which is a helpful touch.  We used room service for an evening snack and the food came very quickly.  
Two of our rooms didn't have a good view as they overlooked the air conditioning unit however this didn't really matter as we were out of the room during the day.  The other room overlooked a not particularly attractive street but the triple glazing meant that we didn't hear any noise all night and the rooms were very quiet.  
Breakfast is not included in the room rate.  We paid around ¬£147 and ¬£187 for the superior doubles.  This is an excellent rate when compared to other similar quality hotels.  Breakfast was ok - i enjoyed the coconut porridge with caramelised banana and the hot chocolate is very good.  However i would recommend trying out the excellent local cafes just across the road in Exhibition road.  The drawing room upstairs is nicely decorated and there is a good games room with table tennis in the basement along with a nice library (although the books were clearly selected by a man).  These were welcome additions.  
All in all highly recommended and we would use the hotel again if travelling as a family group.  I hope they keep the prices at the current levels as it is very good value.",5,2015,04,09
129,Fantastic hotel,"Great location, great rooms, great bar and great restaurant. 

The rooms are a bit small, but for the area people shouldn't be shocked by that. They are made up beautifully and have lovely interiors and details. The star of the show has to be the restaurant which is excellent. The staff working in this hotel were brilliant, and couldn't do enough to be welcoming and helpful.

Staying in this part of London? There isn't a hotel this way that matches it.",5,2015,04,09
129,Very charming and super location,"We found that hotel thru SLH and the price was amazing for that location! There's a bus and taxi stop in front and the subway around the corner! Many attractions were close enough to walk!
The hotel is very cute and the staff offers a very good service! 
We would defenetly go again!

129,"Luxury, location, lovely!",We stayed here while traveling to London last week and highly recommend it. We were on the lobby level which initially made us nervous but the room was SILENT. We slept like champions! Everything was very clean and well kept. It was nice to be so easy to the South Ken tube station. We weren't in our room much as we were enjoying the city but would absolutely stay again. Having a complimentary (non-alcoholic) mini bar was a really nice perk too at the end of long days. And my husband loved getting the paper every morning! Wifi was complimentary and worked perfectly the whole time we were there.,5,2015,04,08
129,Apero restaurant,"The first time I tried Apero (restaurant in Ampersand) was with a group of adult colleagues following an awards evening- it was excellent- food, ambience, service etc. Came by to Lonodon with family-2 Young children and decided to give it a second try- so worth the detour! Our lovely waitress Dea was so charming- that charming our 3 year old fell completely in love and has asked about when he can go back and see Dea again! The food was again faultless- we had the 5 course set menu and it was truly sumptuous. We were seated in the Wine Room- which I love. The restaurant itself is really stylish. Cannot recommend highly enough- if you are in London- it is a must do. Can't wait to return. Thank you for a great evening- ps big kiss to Deaüòò",5,2015,04,08
129,Lovely Hotel - very poor rooms and bed,"I love South Kensington, its a wonderful neighbourhood. I loved the style of these hotel too - but the rooms are quite bad. There is no space at all for the coats, no space at all for the sewing bag - a tiny shelf right above the toilet - to make sure you worry about your stuff all the time as the chances are big that something drops in the toilet. The bed is very very small, we couldnt relax because of this. As the receptionist announced right away that this were one of the bigger rooms - there would be tinier rooms than this one - we were scared and didnt ask for another room. 
Otherwise, the location is just excellent and the cleanliness are very good too. I wouldnt recommend this hotel as the rooms are the most important thing to me when staying in a hotel. ",2,2015,04,08
129,Every aspect of this hotel is fantastic - a true London gem,"The Ampersand is a beautiful hotel, and I could probably write an entire essay about what made our stay here so special. I'll summarise as best I can though.

From check-in to check-out, the customer service from all staff from front desk to kitchen to cleaners was second-to-none. Nothing was too much trouble, and they went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

The room size was smaller than other hotels I've stayed in, but it wasn't too small - it was very well-sized actually. We were in one of the astronomy-themed rooms. The biography of Galileo on the bedside table was a cute touch as well - I just wish I'd have had time to read it.

The electronic 'do not disturb' room panel functionality was something I'd not seen before, and was a nice touch.

The shower room was exceptional, with a heated floor and robes as standard. I really liked the speaker system in the bathroom too, which is linked to the TV in the bedroom.

The food was so good that we had room service twice. My personal recommendation is the toasted bacon sandwich for breakfast. Trust me, just do it. Even if you're a veggie. Especially if you're a veggie. 

A truly five-star experience.",5,2015,04,07
129,Repeat Visit,"This was my second stay at the Ampersand, and it was another great holiday. The staff are so accommodating and helpful. Great location, easy access to the tube, restaurants and museums nearby. The rooms are finished to a high degree, quiet, private and very stylish. Looking forward to coming back again soon.",5,2015,04,07
129,Unforgettable NYE,"My partner and I booked a deluxe room for NYE at Ampersand. King size bed, super comfy mattress, beautiful linen, mini bar with unlimited refreshments and a shiny bathtub. We were even served a glass of champagne each in the room after we came back from the fireworks. 
As about the breakfast at Apero..scrumptious! Freshly baked pastries, selection of cheese and fruit and anything else you can think of! 
Service was excellent.
Recommendations: 
Ask for a room on the top floors; preferably with street view and a bathtub.
P.S. Only thing that distracted all that glamour and luxury was the staff uniform. A smarter suit would complete the package! 
Overall, it was an amazing experience
Thank you guys",5,2015,04,06

129,Great stay in lovely hotel,"I recently stayed at the hotel with my daughter for a special trip to London.  We were really impressed with the hotel, the room and the staff.  The staff were very helpful and the rooms clean and very comfortable.  We will be back - Thank you!

129,Stylish boutique hotel with prime location,"I stayed there for 4 nights during my stay in London,  the location is just perfect, the South Kensington is just 2 mins walk, many london buses routes within 20 footsteps.  Walking distance to V&A Museum, Harrods.... Hotel breakfast with variety of choices.  Vert stylish room decor although the standard room size is just enough for 2 people without extra baggages.  There is window outlet to open if you cannot stand for the heat in winter.  Room service is up to 5 star standard too.  recommended.",4,2015,04,02
129,A thoroughly enjoyable stay,We have stayed at this hotel twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed our stay on both occasions. The rooms are lovely and spotlessly clean. The Reception staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly. Breakfast was lovely with lots of choice on both the a la carte and buffet options. We would recommend the hotel to friends and will be back again ourselves.,5,2015,04,02
129,Perfect,"The Ampersand is a beautifully run, perfectly located hotel. Yes the rooms are very small  but the quality is excellent .

We surely come back.

129,Staff are a delight,"The Ampersand is in a great location just a stone's throw from the South Kensington tube station and a short walk to the Natural History museum etc. Despite the bustle of the (excellent) locality there is calm as soon as you enter the hotel. 
It has been decorated beautifully and attention has been to the little details such as including make up wipes and other goodies in addition to the bog standard hotel toiletries. This continues throughout all aspects of the hotel, it is quirky but elegant- top marks to the interior designers!
The staff were all wonderful, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful and seemed to be genuinely happy in their work. A rare treat in any hotel but an especially unexpected surprise in London. Well worth a visit if you are in the area even just for a pot of tea and a macaroon to nosy at the Drawing Room.",5,2015,03,31
129,Best Hotel in London,"This is what a true Small Luxury hotel should look like. The staff is amazing and the location is great. You are next to the underground station and walking distance to restaurants and some museums. For sure I will stay there again!
      
      ",5,2015,03,30
129,Modern Luxury in South Kensington,"This is a beautifully appointed hotel, it has been decorated in elegant style and it is well furnished, our room was extremely comfortable and properly luxurious though not overly large. The bathroom was smart, comfortably warm thanks to underfloor heating and had the most spacious shower I think I've ever encountered. The bed was also generously large and extremely comfortable.

The room was not subject to noise from other guests or the street, in fact the corridors were almost silent and housekeeping was immaculate. There was a compact desk with a very useful set of sockets for charging portable items, including usb ports etc. Even the environmental controls were sophisticated with clear illuminated display which included settings for do not disturb, or to indicate the room was available for housekeeping via a display panel at the external lock. Our room, which I believe was classified as a Superior had a free minibar with water, fruit juice and cola, plus real milk for making tea - all replenished daily.

The staff were always attentive, courteous and helpful, it was hard to even pick-up a piece of your own luggage as some helpful member of staff would always be on hand keen to help, open a door for you or organise a taxi, they managed all this without ever being intrusive, a real skill. Although we did not eat in the hotel we did use the comfortable and relaxed bar late one evening.

Ampersand is well situated, plenty of places to grab a bite to eat nearby, and South Kensington is a good place to stay in London, you are at the heart of things without being in the very frenetic centre of the city.  You're on the Piccadilly line (as well as the District & Circle) which makes getting into key places for visitors, like Covent Garden & Theatreland, Kings Cross, Westminster, etc. very straightforward. Not to mention having the Natural History Museum, The Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum on your doorstep, plus the Royal Albert Hall, the Serpentine Gallery and Kensington Gardens only about 15 minutes walk away. There are plenty of buses which serve the area as well, and a taxi rank outside the hotel.

I am struggling to find some criticisms so that this review is not all praise. We were in a top room at the rear and when all else was quiet it was possible to hear the air conditioning unit on the roof, but there was no street noise and this rythmic throbbing soon became part of the background. The wardrobe was really a little too small for two people's clothes and it's compactness was exaggerated by the decision to put both the safe and the tea making facitilies into it, so half was less suitable for hanging items - despite this it had a very helpful movement activated light so when using the safe, getting the kettle or hanging items it was useful not to be in the dark.

We would definitely stay here again, and I am happy to recommend it to others.",5,2015,03,30
129,I just love this hotel!,"I stayed in the Ampersand already a couple of times and I can only give my very best recommendations choosing this hotel. The service is just outstanding and the staff really understands how to make a guest feeling valued and welcome. The breakfast is different to other hotels with a bunch of very tasty options like an avocado/feta/olives/poached egg bread, which I love! I wish other hotels would be as creative as the Ampersand is! 

The rooms are beautiful, the bed like sleeping on clouds and everything very clean and well maintained. The fitness room is opened 24 hours which is also very convenient for business travellers.

After checking out a bunch of hotels in London, I found the one and only option for me choosing the Ampersand. One more key note: the location is fabulous being just around the corner of the museums district/hyde park plus a direct link to London Heathrow (Piccadilly Line) and another 2 tube lines which can bring you around city center.",5,2015,03,30
129,Lovely hotel in S. Kensington,"Besides having one of the neatest names (for all you literary geeks out there) in the history of hotels, it has the most lovely staff. They were knowledgeable, helpful, and kindly. The beds are exceedingly comfortable and the turn down service is perfect. While the rooms are small, they are well appointed. ",5,2015,03,25

129,Great hotel!,"We stayed here based on a reccomendation from a friend and were not dissapointed.

We had a suite for the first two nights which had a small kitchen, small living room, bathroom and seperate bedroom.  (The TV in the bathroom was a nice touch).  

The second night we had a superior double room which was good size with nice high ceilings.  Being just me and my wife travelling, the superior double was big enough for us.  Both rooms were very clean with comfortable beds.

Breakfast was excellent and the staff was very helpfull both in the restaurant and at the front desk.

It is close to the tube and walking distance from Harrods.  

All in all a great hotel.",5,2015,03,24

The area is great for shopaholics, museum lovers and the Royal Albert Hall. We had a one bedroom suite which had a little balcony overlooking the street. It was nicely decorated and whilst not huge it was great for us.
There is a cool bar which is ideal for pre dinner cocktails. Full English breakfast highly recommended!
Sadly we did not mange t have a game of table tennis, but we will definitely be back so hopefully next time!",5,2015,03,22

129,Genuine friendliness,"The Ampersand has a perfect location; a minute's walk to the tube station (South-Kensington) and a few more to some of the main attractions of the city. The hotel has an easy-going atmosphere and the staff's friendliness and interest feels genuine. The breakfast buffet is great, but I couldn't resists the temptation to to add some choices from the menu which offers some irresistible extras. I can recommend Ampersand with no reservations, one of my best hotel experiences in years. I surely will stay there again on my next visit.",5,2015,03,21

129,Fabulous hotel,"I can't say enough good things about the Ampersand Hotel.  The space is beautiful and our room was delightful, with incredibly high ceilings.  The staff was uniformly friendly and honored every request.  There were also so many nice little touches - welcome gift, complimentary newspaper, complimentary wi-fi, electrical adapter in the room, etc.  They've really thought it through well.  And, can't beat the location 1/2 a block from the South Kensington Tube station.  ",5,2015,03,17
129,"Great hotel in a less busy area, however central","Usually stay in Mayfair but was convinced to try South Kensington. Had a lovely loft suite with a generous balcony to enjoy the view from the roof top. Super comfy beds and great tech in the room. Great breakfast although we preferred to discover the surroundings which offer great alternatives, for example Le Pain Quotidien. A solid four rating could have been a four and a half if it wasn't for an untidy balcony on arrival - soda can and cigarettes... Dislike.",4,2015,03,17
129,"Great hotel, good location, nice style","Its a great hotel right in the heart of all the museums and a short ride to Victoria and Piccadilly. Kensington tube is about a 2 min walk away so its really convenient. Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, Science Museum are all an easy 2 min walk away as well as Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall and many other options.

Try the breakfast downstairs, its worth it! Being an expat Englishman the traditional breakfast was superb. But there are also healthier options on the menu and nearby. It wasn't that busy, but service was a bit slow, only a few people working. Glad we weren't in a rush.

The rooms are small. So it's good for a short break, but you'll be tripping over your suitcase if you're staying a bit longer. Probably not suitable if you need to catch up on work as the desks are tiny, but they have a nice lounge near the lobby. Bathroom is cosy and we really appreciated the nice and toasty underfloor heating. Beds are very comfortable and the overall room is stylishly put together.

For the price, its fantastic value for money.",5,2015,03,17
129,Understated luxury,"Stayed here 3 nights some months ago, so this review a little late. Got a 3for2 deal on Mr&Mrs Smith. Not too pretentious and staff very welcoming. Dined in the restaurant in the basement which was lovely. Dinner and wine ¬£100, which is pretty reasonable for Kensington. Close to science museum etc. Would stay again.",5,2015,03,17
129,cool hotel warm reception,"This is a very cool and quirky boutique hotel right across the street from South Kensington Tube Station. The decor - by the wonderful Kit Kemp is gorgeous. Our room, though small, was spotless and perfectly furnished with all our needs - the complimentary mini bar which is topped up each day was a nice touch. Check in was quick and easy and the reception staff were efficient and very welcoming. Afternoon tea was delicious and a late check out request was not a problem. We will definitely be back!",5,2015,03,17
129,"Stylish, excellently located boutique hotel","Our second visit didn't disappoint.  Beautiful hotel with immaculately kept rooms. A special thank you to Alberto in reception whose professional,courteous manner was much appreciated. Outstanding customer service. We will be back",5,2015,03,17
129,Amazing hotel in a great location,"My wife and I are semi-frequent visitors to London and until now we were trying to find a hotel worth returning to in London. The Ampersand is certainly that hotel. It is in a great location, with excellent museums within minutes walking (I could spend all day at the Natural History Museum) and only a couple of minutes from the tube station. It is also a short walk to Harrods and plenty more shopping, which is an up or downside depending on if you ask my wife or me! 

The hotel itself has a really funky style and great staff. We received an upgraded room as SLH members and it was excellent! It wasn't massive but it was certainly big by London standards and very well equipped. Everything was modern and clean.

The restaurant downstairs was very funky also, although it can get a bit crowded. One of our favourite little touches is a stand of umbrellas by the door for guests to use for the day to ward of typical London weather. We loved our umbrella and would have bought one if we didn't have to haul it all the way back to New Zealand. 

All in all I can't fault this hotel for the money and we will be staying there again when we return!",5,2015,03,17
129,Visit 2 and its still top notch,"2nd visit to the Ampersand and I truly cannot fault the experience again. 

Nice room on the top floor quiet and tucked away just want I asked for when I arrived. Room is spotless and all the amenities you could wish for with a nice big shower.

The breakfast buffet is still the best in my opinion. Great selection and you must have a Bircher bowl. 

The team were all helpful and very attentive. We will be back next year! ",5,2015,03,15
129,Very pretty hotel,"My room was huge and had a balcony, but I hear that many of the rooms are very small. Regardless, the lobby and breakfast area are very pretty and modern. The restaurant and bar downstairs are intimate and attractive. The cocktail list is interesting. The location is very central, with buses stopping right outside and the tube just across the street. The staff were responsive and helpful. Overall, I had an excellent stay.",5,2015,03,13
129,"Good location, modern room, helpful service","Picked this hotel as it is a Small Luxury Hotel member and convenient location.  Only stayed one night in and out but can fully enjoy.  Can easy walk to V&A museum, Knightsbridge area and tons of hip eateries around.  Room size is not big (it's central London) but well designed.  Mini-bar & free Wifi is included which is great.  Even continental breakfast provides good varieties.  Had a glass of champaign with afternoon snacks  at the Drawing Room and really enjoy our Saturday afternoon!",5,2015,03,10
129,"Great Location, Comfortable Rooms","I stayed here for four nights on business.

The hotel is just steps from the Tube, as well as from some of London's most famous museums. It's got all the amenities - free minibar, great beds, good wifi, and good service.",5,2015,03,08
129,Another perfect stay,"I stayed in this hotel last year and love it, so when I planned to go to London again, I booked this hotel again without hesitation. The location is superb -- it is less than a minute walk from South Kensington station. It is in the nicest area in London and feel very safe. There are lots of restaurants around, I have tried a few of them and all are good. You can go to the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum within 5 minutes on foot. If you are a shopaholic, numerous branded shops are 10 minutes away on foot, and you can also walk to Harrods within 15-20 minutes. 

Staff members are friendly, efficient and helpful. The rooms are not huge but already good in London standard. Deco is modern, creative and elegant. I had afternoon tea in their cafe and it was good as well. I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to London.",5,2015,03,08
129,Very nice hotel in South Kensington,"Location wise it's 1-2 minutes from South Kensington station, which is on the picadilly line that brings you to west end and central London in a heartbeat.  It is also close to many of the museums.
Being close to the tube station meant that yes, indeed you will hear sounds from the trains in your room.  But it didn't bother my sleep at all, and I am a terribly light sleeper.  
We were fortunate to get a room upgrade and we were given a deluxe room.  The deluxe room was of a very decent size given that it's London; but the bathroom configuration was a bit odd and it was also quite small.  It wasn't possible to walk from the shower to the toilet if you let the bathroom door open - there was just no space between the opened door and the sink.  But again, small hotel rooms - and bathrooms - are probably just what you will commonly see in London.
Otherwise everything in the bedroom was very good.  Bed was very comfortable, and wifi signals were always strong.  The only criticism I had was the closet - you can't really hang more than 2 thick jackets in it.  The safe was a bit too small as well and it's not possible to store your laptop or ipad inside.
Staff at the hotel were generally very nice and helpful - I requested firmer pillows and one of them brought every pillow he could find to our room for me to try out.  
With deals and offers you can get this hotel room for less than $2000 HKD per night, and that is of a very reasonable price for a London decent boutique hotel.  So I am definitely recommending the Ampersand to fellow travellers.",5,2015,03,07
129,"Amazing hotel, perfectly located","The Ampersand hotel is a fantastic hotel! I had a deluxe room which is very big and has got everything you might need, even free mini bar (soft drinks). Bed is very confortable and pillows too. Batrhoom is also big and everything is clean. Staff is friendly and they help you with anything you need.
The only small negative thing is the continental breakfast which could be richer but food is good.",5,2015,03,07
129,Excellent stay,"Stayed at Hotel as going to the Albert Hall.
Staff were very warm and welcoming. 
The room (superior double) was excellent - good size, spotlessly clean, massive bed - that was very comfy, and room well kitted out.
Breakfast is paid for separately, but there's an excellent choice, cooked beautifully, and reasonably priced.
Nice basement bar and restaurant (same as where breakfast is served) which does excellent cocktails in the evening, with friendly and knowledgeable barman
All areas of the hotel were to a high standard, and all the staff smiling and very helpful.
Hotel is well located - near to tube/museums/Albert Hall etc , and a really good pub - The Queens Arms, halfway between the hotel and A'Hall.",5,2015,03,05
129,Good stay,"Typically stay at the Kensington hotel but decided to give the Ampersand a try given they had a deal on.  We like to stay in South Kensington because it is off the Piccadilly line and easy to take to Heathrow.  Now the Ampersand is convenient, literally 1 minute walk from the tube station.  The check-in was quick and warm, though I hate when they take a photocopy of your passport.  I actually feel it‚Äôs a violation of my privacy and security (and there is no reason they have to ‚Ä¶I have stayed in numerous hotels across the world, including London, where this is not required.  It‚Äôs obviously company policy).

They insisted in having someone take you to your room (which to be honest I hate because after hauling my luggage across the Atlantic ocean, through Heathrow and the tube station ‚Äì I don‚Äôt need the help for the last 5 metres). I  understand if you have not stayed there before why they would want someone to accompany you  - so as to show you where things are appointed. They did not pressure for a tip and were very pleasant (in fact throughout the stay they were all very pleasant).  So the professionalism also impressed me.

We had a room on thethirdfloor and it was compact but very well appointed.  Bed comfortable, free wifi and water (there is a free mini bar and while I note that it‚Äôs just water, coke and juice ‚Äì this is a nice touch and something many hotels do not do).  The heated floors in the bathroom were the best ! The hotel is on a busier street with a bus stop outside so it‚Äôs not the quietest (but then you are in London and to be frank the room is not noisy ‚Äì you can just hear some noise). And yes you can hear the tube ‚Ä¶even on the 3rd floor.  If this is an issue then bring earplugs.  

I have to say that it‚Äôs a toss-up between here and the Kensington.  If there was a deal to be had we would come back.  Both are great options.",4,2015,03,04
129,Great hotel at a great location,"Fantastic staff, extremely clean rooms, pleasant service, lovely drawing room. I would definitely come back. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but bed is super-comfortable and bathrooms are spacious.

129,Good hotel in a good location,"We stayed at the Ampersand for a second time in February 2015. The hotel is in a wonderful location being close to South Kensington tube and a five minute walk to King's road. Staff are incredibly friendly and they were kind enough to give us an upgrade as it was my birthday.

The hotel is modern, well furnished and has a boutique feel - rooms however are a little small, although the fittings are high quality and the bed is comfortable. This was the first time we used the gym in hotel, and whilst it was quite small, everything was in place for a good work out.

The cost of the room is relatively substantial, and whilst I do like the place, I probably would look around for a deal before heading back.",4,2015,03,02

The hotel ticks all the boxes and offers exceptional value for a London hotel, the staff have to be commended for their exceptional attention to detail and the customer service is second to none, the Ampersand makes a trip to London stress free.

I didn't like the room temperature (I had to open windows when it was around 0¬∞C outside!!) and the fact that they kept resetting the temperature to a much higher position.
Another slightly annoying thing about the hotel was the request of showing the room key when I got back a bit later than usual (around midnight). The request is fine per se, but it was asked in a rude way from the hotel staff, I felt like I was looking like a possible criminal.",3,2015,02,23
129,Staff. Comfort. Luxury. Style. The Amerpsand Has It All.,"My nine-year-old daughter and I stayed at the Ampersand for three nights during her half-term holiday. As the Great British weather can‚Äôt really be depended upon in February, we decided on South Kensington so that we could go with the ‚Äòweather-safe‚Äô option of visiting the Natural History, Science and V&A museums all of which are - quite literally - a stone‚Äôs throw from the hotel.

It‚Äôs also really close to the underground station, and the area is littered with lovely, independent coffee shops and restaurants, so in terms of location, the hotel got 5 stars even before we‚Äôd walked through its doors! But when we did, we were instantly impressed with the fresh, clean modern reception - adjacent to the fabulously decorated drawing rooms where guests can take afternoon tea - and a truly warm welcome from the staff at the front desk.

Check-in was quick, friendly and efficient, and we were taken to our room by a very personable member of staff. After reading other TripAdvisor comments about the potential of noise from the underground line running under the property, I‚Äôd contacted the hotel before we travelled to ask for a high room, preferably facing away from the street (both me and my daughter can be quite light sleepers). They let me know by email that they‚Äôd allocated us a room on the fourth floor, facing the back of the hotel, and this - I‚Äôm delighted to say - is exactly what we got.

The room - a ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô king - was just perfect. A decent size, clean, beautifully decorated with an incredibly comfortable bed. A lovely bathroom (that, to be fair, came without a bath but did have a wonderful walk-in shower), a fair amount of wardrobe and drawer space and a minibar stocked with complimentary soft drinks (a real bonus when travelling with a thirsty child!). The view from the room was delightful, looking out over the cobbles of Cromwell Mews, to the rooftops of the Natural History and V&A museums. And, as I‚Äôve already mentioned, I can be a very light sleeper, but the combination of the wonderful bed and pillows, quiet but effective air conditioning, thick blackout curtains and double glazed windows made the room a dark and velvety cocoon of a night.

The staff were - to a man and a woman - a delight. Smiling, sincere, helpful and friendly. I left my daughter sat in reception while I nipped back to the room one morning; when I came back down I found her chomping contentedly on an over-sized gingerbread man, given to her by the ‚Äònice lady‚Äô on reception. A really lovely touch.

The great style and top service also transfer effortlessly to Apero, the hotel‚Äôs basement bar and restaurant. A really interesting menu, fabulous cocktails (and some of the best martinis I‚Äôve had the good fortune to sample), and genuinely friendly, interested, pro-active staff. Whilst they don‚Äôt have a dedicated children‚Äôs menu (and to be fair, at 9, my daughter is tending to grow out of dinosaur-shaped breaded chicken), they can make smaller portions from their room service menu. Both of the nights that we ate there, my daughter chose the battered plaice and chips, which came as a really decent sized portion and tasted fab. I opted for various bits and pieces from their ‚Äòsharing menu‚Äô: seaweed bread with smoked butter, queen scallops, spatchcocked quail, tiramisu. All were delicious. And again, I have to mention the staff. Helpful and chatty, bringing marshmallows and other ‚Äòpetit fours‚Äô for my daughter whilst I sampled yet another stonkingly well-made martini at the bar.

On our last day, we weren‚Äôt catching our train home until mid-afternoon and wanted to visit the Science Museum again, and there was no problem in the hotel keeping hold of our luggage until we headed for the station. They even looked after my daughter‚Äôs soft toy (Rosie the dog), giving her pride of place behind reception until we returned.

Can‚Äôt recommend the place highly enough; so much so that next time we need a hotel in London (as we do occasionally for a Westend show or suchlike), I‚Äôd be sorely tempted to stay at the Ampersand again. Even though it‚Äôs not as ‚Äòcentral‚Äô as our usual haunts, it‚Äôs only four stops or so on the tube from Covent Garden, and the property, rooms, staff and really reasonable pricing would make it a serious contender. Thank you so much to all at the Ampersand Hotel for making our stay so pleasant and memorable.",5,2015,02,23
129,Couldn't bring ourselves to leave!,"Most of the time I can't wait to get out of hotels. This was our second stay at the hotel in the same room on a 2 for 1 offer in the studio room. Love the attention we get at the cosy  reception area which has the lifts immediately adjacent. The room is big and decor soothingly calm. Bolstered by lots of cushions and soft touches. Although our room looked out onto the busy room, the noise was not intrusive apart from the odd piercing exhaust note of another exotic supercar. I used the valet parking. At ¬£52 pounds per day.Still cheaper than both of us travelling by public transport. I forgot my phone in the car, but the staff went back to the car and delivered it to me.  The location of the hotel is excellent, as other people have commented. I love the V&A museum and to have that, the science and natural history museum a five min walk away, past the heavily guarded French Embassy, is a huge advantage. There are lots of places to eat. I would recommend exploring around the nearby streets. Check out Macellaio Roberta Costa, its one of the best steak restaurants I've ever eaten.There are quite a few Lebanese restaurants, try Maroush 2 a short walk away. After two days, we were supposed to go back home, but we were having such a good time that we asked if we could stay an extra night. No problem for the staff and suddenly we were back in our little lux world. We're going back in March!",5,2015,02,22
129,Fantastic but look for a Deal,"Quality is as expected, great location, good service and staff - only downside is suite bedroom tight for the taller gentleman but bathroom and lounge very very good - would visit again without hesitation as not stuffy in the slightest and a very relaxing birthday weekend had",5,2015,02,22
129,Top guest service!,"We walked in for breakfast 
My wife desperately wanted pancakes... Bad news.. Not on the menu. We asked out waitress Mary if the chef could make pancakes for us... Chef Ahmed says yes! Happy days!!
Thank you guys!!! Top quality!",5,2015,02,22
129,Excellent Hotel,"We had a deluxe studio room, with tv in the bathroom :) the bed was huge very comfortable and the room had everything you would need including free mini bar which was stocked daily. Staff were helpful and friendly. Location is just across the road from the tube station and busses stop outside hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2015,02,22
129,Romantic stay,"The hotel was exactly as it was photographed and was even better than we could have hoped for! We arrived at the hotel early with the intention of merely dropping off our luggage to be told that our room was ready and we could check in early : ) The room was stunning! We had a botanical room with a free standing bath in the sash window, which was throughly enjoyed! Bed was huge and so comfy. The front of house staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We also thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon tea, arguably our best in London but have reviewed that separately. The only point worth noting is you can hear the underground in the rooms, however this is not a problem if you are aware of it in my eyes and let's face it.....if you want to be close to an underground station and have masses of room and bathroom space in the centre of London, then it's to be expected and you get used to it and don't notice it. Overall, would go back next weekend! ",5,2015,02,21
129,Chillout break,Ampersand is brilliantly located and is a great hotel. Would stay again. On the downside the tv in our room was a bit random and air cooling/heating was a bit unresponsive. All in all the staff were very helpful and friendly and the decor was interesting. Perfect for this type of break where you are visiting London as South Ken tube is right there.,4,2015,02,18
129,"Excellent location, lovely hotel","Stayed for Valentines weekend and got a very welcome upgrade to a deluxe room. The location of the hotel is absolutely excellent: a minute from the Tube, which I rarely use but it was so convenient that it was hard not to, also around the corner from some great museums, Harrods a short walk. Wonderful being away from central London for a change. 

The hotel is lovely, a bit of a mix between a business hotel and a leisure hotel. Great double bathroom with heated floors, huge very comfortable bed, and good size room, spacious. Good entertainment system and some great playlists available for background music, piped through to the bathroom. although tricky to figure out how to use. Good wifi.  

Some great design features which separate it from a business hotel, lovely staircase and lighting, awesome headboard, bathroom really was highlight. 

There are so many little cares around we did not eat in the hotel so difficult to rate service but staff at the reception desk were lovely and the hotel accommodated us beautifully for a late checkout after 3pm which was fantastic. 

",5,2015,02,18
129,Just perfect,"I used to make documentaries for BBC Television about the world's best hotels and most of them were big or bold or very very expensive. The Ampersand is stylish and personable, affordable for that special occasion and we would love to return. It ticks the 'I love this hotel box' and have already recommended to friends and family. Gorgeous linen & Bed, Restaurant and staff are brilliant, complementary mini bar and Nespresso machine & TV in the bath all. Deluxe studio rooms much more spacious. We got an out of season deal so definitely worth it. Thank you!",5,2015,02,16
129,Ampersand Wows,"Stayed for four nights over Christmas Break prior to traveling to Paris for a week. (see review on 123 le sebastopol).  Let me just say that once we made our way to Paris we actually were homesick for The Ampersand.  This hotel is quite literally top-notch across the board.  Casually elegant service is delivered so effortlessly.  No tight upper lip Brits here.  The staff, from the restaurants, housekeeping and the front desk just make it happen.  They are on top of everything and can and do whatever is requested.  Service is so proactive.  We had a suite and a connecting room for our kids and it was perfect.  Plenty of space and the unique architecture made the rooms so interesting and quaint.  Wonderful amenities, stocked mini fridge (remains that way for free throughout your stay), impeccably clean, comfortable beds with luxurious duvets, on and on and on.  The hotels afternoon tea with the tasty treats is so well done.  We love a hotel that is high class without the snobbery, and all the departments demonstrated this same trait.  The location of the hotel is fantastic, so close to many wonderful eateries and a delightful respite from the touristy areas each evening.  Though we love to experience different hotels when we travel, we would seriously consider staying here again on our next visit to London.  Thank you Ampersand for making our kids first trip to London so memorable!",5,2015,02,11
129,Something different,A very comfortable bed and food as excellent and as different and as eclectic as one could wish for. All the staff really nice. A really beautiful old building that has been refurbished in a lovely way.,5,2015,02,09
129,"Great Location, Great Stay","Great Location this is walking distance to the Natural History Museum and Harrods. It has a taxi rank right outside which always has one in for convenience of travel and has a tube station near. 

The rooms are perfect and the hotel for London prices is very reasonable. It is one of the few hotels in London that don't charge you for an extra bed in the room other hotels charge. 

The decor is unique and very interesting it's a fabulously decorated and modern hotel. The service at the front desk is very quick and the room mini bar is included in the price which has a few bottles of water in and orange and diet coke in. 

The beds are very comfy. 

You can hear a bit or road noise but nothing that you don't get anywhere else. 

Overall great value and great stay will stop again.",5,2015,02,08
129,Luxury Anniversary,We chose the hotel based on proximity to the major museums but couldn't have found a better and more cosy bolt hole for our 2 night london stay. Gorgeous rooms and attentive staff. Even the gentle rumble of the tube trains under the hotel was comforting.,5,2015,02,08
129,Lovely London hotel!,"The Ampersand is a small hotel in a wonderful neighborhood; close to the Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, walking distance to many sights.  And close to a tube stop!  The hotel has a lovely restaurant, very attentive staff, and wonderful service.  Our room was not large but certainly adequate; I loved staying here!",5,2015,02,05
129,Great hotel.,Great location. Great hotel. Friendly staff. Bar was a little expensive but given its location we expected it to be. The bedroom was lovely as was the bathroom . Not cheap but well worth the price. I would definitely stay there again. The room wasn't huge but the storage was good. Continental breakfast was included with plenty of choice. We paid extra for a full English breakfast but couldn't eat it all so maybe just stick with the continental if it's included in your room price. Free mini bar as well for soft drinks which were replaced.,5,2015,02,04
129,Amazing stay on the last leg of our honeymoon,"We stayed at the Ampersand for 3 nights in January 2014. It was the last city of our 3-city European honeymoon, and I can't imagine a better way to end our trip. Everything about this hotel is top notch, from the staff all the way to the toiletries in the bathroom. The hotel was located right in front of a bus stop and near a station for the subway, so we had no trouble getting anywhere we needed. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.",5,2015,02,04
129,It cannot get any better,"I am back home and I can`t stop thinking of the Ampersand. It was my birthday treat, four days in London. 

This is the best hotel that I have ever been to. We felt very welcome the minute we entered the hotel. We arrived early and where sent to  breakfast until the room was ready. Soon after we received a message that the room was ready. Wow. We had booked a Superior Room and received an upgrade to a Deluxe Room. This room was heaven, very tastefully decorated. A fabulous bed with a topper and a divine duvet. The bathroom in a very stylish black and white layout. Spotless clean. 

For my birthday I received a special surprise, that was so kind. 

The whole package is just perfect, the location in South Kensington near Hyde Park. I always went running before breakfast, which was my special treat every morning.

I must add, the people who work there really make a diference. Especially Aline was so very professional and welcoming. Everything we wished for, she made it happen.

There is not one single thing that needs improvement.

Yes, it is a little expensive to stay there. But it was so so worth it. 

We will surely come again.",5,2015,02,03
129,I was expecting something different,"The room could not be compared with the beautiful launch area.  It was all dark brown and not done to a high standard.  It's decoration was not nicely done.  In addition, I think that a rather new hotel like this should have a wooden floor, not carpet.
      
      ",3,2015,02,03
129,Ampersand Stay January 2015,"The hotel was charming, incredibly clean and comfortable. Has a wonderful bar/restaurant downstairs which is also very quaint. Our entire experience was great and the staff was so friendly and accommodating. We would absolutely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a great boutique type hotel in a quiet area. The tube was steps away and everything was very convenient to / from the hotel. ",5,2015,02,01
129,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Upon arrival we were made to feel very welcome. The hotel images do not do the hotel justice, the style and concept is very chic while still welcoming. Our room although a little small was beautiful. Would definitely invest in a bigger room for our next stay. The location is just near kings road so was ideal for our stay. Can't wait to book again !!",5,2015,02,01
129,Good value hotel in South Kensington,"This is really lovely hotel, with reasonable prices for London. We stayed in a suite for two nights on a special offer, and were impressed. It had a sofa, dining table and everything you would need in a kitchen. The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom was superb - underfloor heating, huge freestanding bath and wet room shower. It also had a balcony with table and chairs. Decor in the hotel is lovely, as is the bar and restaurant. The best asset was the staff, who were all fabulous. And it's only a 2-minute walk to the Natural History Museum. We will go back.",5,2015,02,01
129,Fantastic experience in stylish boutique hotel. Staff is great!,"We absolutely loved our stay in hotel Ampersand! From the first moment you walk in you feel a welcome guest and you can enjoy the modern, fresh and arty atmosphere. The staff is super kind, not too formal/stiff at all, but very friendly and accomodating. The normal double rooms are smallish, still they are beautiful, have a great bed and good facilities (free minibar, ipod dock etc.). We had the luck that we were upgraded to a much bigger room and we absolutely loved it! Great bathroom with TV, separate shower and plenty space for a seating area. The Ampersand houses in a beautiful building in a posh neighbourhood and you'll be spoiled with choice for restaurants. 
We had breakfast once and it was of excellent quality, as you might expect from a hotel of this class it's not cheap. Breakfast room is very stylish just like all public spaces in the hotel.",5,2015,02,01
129,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"We loved our experience at The Ampersand. The hotel has everything you can ask for and the rooms are very nice. The location is great with high quality restaurants nearby and also located right near the South Kensington underground. Overall, great hotel.
              ",5,2015,01,31
129,Perfect Everything,"An incredible hotel where the thoughtful staff, amazing location, fantastic food and drinks made it the perfect weekend for me and my fianc√©. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it's location is perfect for the museums and Royal Albert, the service received at the hotel is the best service I have ever seen. Always going that extra mile! Fantastic!
              ",5,2015,01,28
129,"Modern rooms, beautiful design & great location!","I visited the delightful Ampersand Hotel last July for 3 nights. It's location was fantastic and their staff very helpful. The only downside would be the size of the rooms - they are very, very small. However, they are also very modern and comfortable. Therefore, the size was not an issue. I will certainly be back to Ampersand on my next visit to the UK!",5,2015,01,27
129,Great hotel in great location with great service,I stayed at this hotel for work.  It's a lovely boutique hotel with great d√©cor.  The one meal I had at the hotel was very fresh and served very quickly.  The staff were amazing.  My only complaint is that there are no irons in the room.,5,2015,01,26
129,Superb breakfast,"I didn't stay here, but whilst on a short stay in London, I frequented The Ampersand many times for breakfast. The staff really are a credit to the hotel, especially the restaurant staff. Anyway I loved the breakfast, I had the full English on all occasions, with a pot of tea and an orange juice. I loved the decor of the hotel, and I am hoping to stay here when next in London.  The location is also fantastic, perfectly situated in the heart of South Ken.",5,2015,01,26
129,Speech on Shale Gas to Imperial College,"Ampersand is excellent hotel with consistent excellent stayed 4 times over 2 years. Always very good. Only downside is room size but that's standard in London. It's good for families and business...........   
      
      
      ",5,2015,01,26
129,Loved staying at The Ampersand,Our entire stay at The Ampersand was enjoyable. Loved the neighborhood with super easy access to museums and the South Kensington tube stop. The staff was extremely attentive and always willing to give recommendations. The interior of the hotel was so cool that I've been inspired to decorate my own house in a similar style!,5,2015,01,25
129,All in all a very pleansant stay,"My husband, our dog and I stayed at The Ampersand Hotel for a long weekend and our stay was all in all very pleasant. All staff were extraordinary friendly and helpful and very kind. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from the first to the last minute and go back as often as we can.
",5,2015,01,25
129,Nice boutique hotel lovely situated,"Great new but personalised hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are nicely decorated although a bit small. You can feel the motion from the underground trough the building, but l guess that is just London standard ;-)",4,2015,01,22
129,Splendid boutique hotel,"I came here on my birthday and was given a special upgrade on my room. The room I was given was a good size, facing south kensington high street but very quiet. Wonderful big comfortable bed, heated floor in the bathroom and all the luxuries one can expect from a boutique hotel of this standard.  Modern and individualistic style to the rooms. 

Reception staff were friendly and professional. They helped me to the room with my luggage. 

I was not enthusiastic about the restaurant as it was in the basement. Very crowded and when I walked in I was ignored by the waiting staff who were just too busy. I'm guessing that the majority of restaurant clients were from outside. I ordered food in the bar area which was okay - nothing special. 

Location great with the tube station just a stone's throw away. ",4,2015,01,21
129,Great location but falls short in other areas,"Location is by far the reason to stay here - literally right down the street from the tube; the Victoria & Albert is around the corner. Great shops and restaurants in walking distance. Hotel is beautifully designed and the common areas are beautiful. But the rooms are quite small and short on needed amenities (only two outlets in the room, the ONLY outlet in the bathroom is for shavers only) and it is loud - both from outside noise and the shaking from the metro (every ten minutes or so, until midnight every day) AND from noises from the halls and other rooms. Also, there's no concierge, and while front desk staff are very friendly, it is hit or miss whether they can provide answers to questions about the area. The restaurant and bar are great, but they don't serve food in the bar before 5pm - seems like a small thing that a hotel that wishes to cater to international travelers should do. In short, it's a boutique hotel that seems to prize design more than stellar service. Not sure I would stay here again given all of the great hotels in London.",4,2015,01,21
129,Suprisingly slick and highly enjoyable.,"....I don't know why I was 'surprised' but perhaps with so many hotels in London and so many of those being poor and disappointing, I never really expect to be impressed. However, Ampersand did impress from the friendly check-in, to the complimentary room upgrade and the exceptional restaurant experience. Sure, the rooms aren't huge but then it's an easy two minutes walk from the V&A, so for 'central' South Kensington, I'd say it's well above average. Nice, relatively compact bathroom but super-hot water, great shower and all the nice smelly and fluffy things you expect and some you don't - the little rough & smooth Loofah pad was appreciated. We hadn't booked a table at Apero, the hotel restaurant and as they were fully booked, so I didn't expect to be squeezed in. But they did find a table and offered us our 'complimentary' champagne - as we'd booked through Mr & Mrs Smith. We chose the 'Tasting Menu', five courses for ¬£32 each (I think) and each course was excellent, with the exception of part of the pudding, a rather dry and pointless pecan cake which didn't offer anything to the dish. I mentioned it in passing to the waitress, who apologised. Of course, when the bill came, she had take the pudding cost off the total. Very generous and not necessary. Back up to the room (and it's mini-bar and complimentary contents...no booze of course!) we had a very comfortable night. The only point worth mentioning is you do feel the rumble of the tube underneath. Not really enough to wake us up but might be a consideration if you're a light sleeper - I suggest you partake heavily from the  interesting cocktail list and fall into a deep, deep sleep instead. Recommended.",4,2015,01,20
129,"Great hotel, wonderful location!!","This hotel was recommended to us by some friends and I totally agree with them... It was an excellent choice!!!!The staff is very friendly, the rooms are not very large, but beautiful, comfortable and clean!!! The location is amazing!! There's a subway station VERY near and lots of restaurants. They have connecting rooms, which is great when you are travelling with children,,,",5,2015,01,19
129,Everything we could hope for.,"We adored it here. Travelling with a child only 5 months old, we were accommodated in every way possible. 
The rooms, service, cleanliness and restaurants are fantastic. And the room service (used quite a lot) a lifesaver!
We can't wait to return this coming Easter.",5,2015,01,18
129,A great stay,"A lovely hotel with friendly, welcoming staff. Our room was small but comfortable with everything we needed during our stay. We enjoyed the complimentary refreshments in the minibar, plus a glass of champagne and petit fours on arrival for booking through Mr and Mrs Smith. The hotel is a two minute walk from South Kensington tube station and is a short walk to the Natural History Museum and some great pubs, bars and restaurants. However you can often hear the tube rumbling below, even on the third floor. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others looking for a convenient base when visiting London.",4,2015,01,18
129,What a great gem in Kensington,"Wow! Great pre-stay service, clean rooms, very comfortable bed, a home away from home feeling, excellent wifi, great library to borrow a wide range of books, plus table tennis & play station for kids, wholesome breakfast and great coffee (and that's from a real coffee snob). Very easy access to local transportation and nearby foodie spots. Would love to stay there again",5,2015,01,17
129,Nice but some problems...,"Hotel is beautiful inside. Decor is great etc. Do beware of the noise from the tube, even on the 3rd floor you can still feel it vibrating. What I don't have good to say is...Booked this hotel straight from their own website and booked a deluxe room for six nights. Got a room in the back with a view of an alley and fire escape. Also staff was not helpful at all in accommodating an extra day lost due to my flight not coming in on time. The hotel was not booked and they would not give me an extra day or even move us to another room due to the non-refundable option. They finally gave me a $100 dollar credit at the end but it took my travel agent some groveling to get that. You would think that paying for a six night stay and only getting five would have been unacceptable in terms of customer service for such a high ranking hotel. Would have liked to be treated a little better than that so I could have given them a five star rating.",3,2015,01,16
129,The Ampersand is a true gem,"The Ampersand is my very favorite type of hotel. Intimate enough to not feel generic, yet luxurious enough to feel like you are on vacation. I enjoy the chain luxury hotels as much as the next person, but there is something truly special about The Ampersand that sets it apart.
To start, I absolutely love the location. Away from the crowds and tourists, yet incredibly convenient- super close to the South Kensington tube station and The Victoria & Albert Museum. There are great restaurants and shops nearby, and every convenience one might need, and yet you can still wander through beautiful neighborhoods and mews streets and try to pretend for a minute you live there.
I also love that from the moment you walk in to the room, everything is included. The wifi is free (and works very well!), as are all the refreshments in the mini-bar. They replenish each day, and leave cookies or biscuits too. It's a little thing, but it's nice to not feel nickle and dimed.
The services were excellent, everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned beautifully and the bed was incredibly comfortable. All around excellent experience! I hope to be back soon!",5,2015,01,15
129,Truly 5 star,"Six of us attended for 2 nights for a family celebration. The whole hotel was most impressive delightfully decorated. Two of our rooms were suites, one on the fourth floor and one on the fifth. Both had a small balcony with 2 chairs which would be well used in summer. The beds were huge and comfortable as were the pillows. Both suites were clean and well furnished. 
The suites differed in that the one on the fourth floor had a large living area and a smaller bathroom whilst the fifth floor had a smaller living room with cutlery and crockery for four but only a small table and two chairs. The bathroom was huge with a wet room and large freestanding bath anl flat screen TV. 
The games room in the cellar was very useful for younger members of the party.
The breakfast was very good.
Not cheap but value for money and in an excellent location for museums etc
Although at times you could hear the tube trains it did not disturb our sleep.",5,2015,01,14
129,"Excellent location, comfortable bed, Nice breakfast",Location of the hotel is excellent. The tube is just a stone's throw away. Plenty of good restaurants around. Beds are comfortable. Very clean. Good breakfast. The staff are very friendly and helpful too. Highly recommended. ,5,2015,01,14
129,I'm spoiled for life.,"Perhaps I don't travel enough or maybe I don't stay in enough first rate hotels but the Ampersand really did it all for me. In September 2014 my girlfriend and I stayed at the Ampersand for three nights and I was hopelessly spoiled by the room and the staff. We plan to travel to London again in 2015 and will stay here again for 7 - 10 days . Perfect location, near the tube, museums, pubs, etc. It just ticked all the boxes for us. ",5,2015,01,13
129,Outstanding as always,"I have visited and stayed at The Ampersand a number of times now and I can honestly say this was the best.  My girlfriend had organised a suprise celebration for my birthday.  We arrived Saturday to be told the room was not quite ready, but then asked if we would like to sit in the dining area with a glass of champagne whilst we waited.  After finishing our champagne we were then show to our room which was actually a suite.  I had never stayed in a suite before in the Ampersand and have to say this was perfect.  My girlfriend had organised various suprises, one of which was dinner in the hotel on Sunday night which was fantastic.  Also given a complimentary glass of bubbly, along with a small cake and candle which was a lovely gesture.  Fantastic service, staff are brilliant, and we cant wait to go back. Thank you so much for making my birthday so special.",5,2015,01,13
129,"Excellent location, rooms are clean and nicely done","1 block from south ken tube station
The room is excellent very clean, modern interior design. 
A number of good options for dinner 1 block from it
Very close to the NHM, science museum and other great places to visit - 5¬£ taxi from there to Harrolds as a reference
Breakfast is basic and efficient,the same with the gym.

If you are going with family ask for a bigger room.

Great surprise: tea room, with good service and eating options it is a cool place for informal meetings",5,2015,01,11

129,Wonderful nights over New Years,"My son and I were doing a 2 week football trip throughout England and finished it off with a few nights at the Ampersand.  As far as lodging goes, this was our highlight.  Very nice, boutique hotel without being pretentious at all.  We had a room on the lobby floor that my son loved because it gave him quick access to the ping-pong table downstairs (highlight #1).  The bed was super comfortable, noise wasn't a problem and they restocked the fridge with soft drinks/juices twice daily (highlight #2).  The wifi was fast and the breakfast, included with our rate, hit the spot.  The location is fantastic for being close to everything (literally 45 seconds to the Tube) without being inside a major tourist zone.  Probably less than a half-mile to run in Hyde & Kensington Parks and near the V&A, National History and other landmarks. 

Last comment is for the staff who were fantastic without being annoyed that a 12-year old wanted to play ping pong constantly.  They gave us a great recommendation of an Indian restaurant nearby and were helpful with everything.",5,2015,01,09
129,Lovely Hotel,"The Ampersand is a lovely hotel in South Kensington, literally right across from the Tube with direct lines to almost all of the most popular tourist destinations. Our room was small and comfortable, very nicely decorated. The staff were all friendly and helpful. ",5,2015,01,08
129,Perfect!!,Wonderful boutique hotel with beautiful decor and very attentive and friendly staff! Bedroom and bathroom also beautiful and well equipped! Free upgrade was also a pleasant surprise! Cocktails at apero were also great!,5,2015,01,08
129,Welcomming and professional,"We stayed six nights at Ampersand this time. The hotel is small and exclusive, The rooms are not huge but very tastefully decorated. The service is excellent, friendly and personal in an assertive manner, demonstrating true professionalism. We love it.",5,2015,01,08
129,Fantastic boutique hotel,"All round great experience, would definitely revisit. Only complaints were water temperature wasn't hot, just warm-hot throughout stay, and the bath in our room made a strange gurgling noise which woke us a few times",5,2015,01,07
129,Lovely stay,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. My only comment would be don't get a room next to the lift. I didn't actually hear it, as I'm a very heavy sleeper but my husband did. I will definitely return ! ",5,2015,01,07
129,Review,"The hotel is excellent. Great location, especially for the museums. The cleaning of the room could be a little better, and the options of the restaurant are complicated, with the concept of sharing dishes, i prefer the traditional style.",5,2015,01,06
129,New Year¬¥s Eve short break,"Located very conveniently in South Kensington, we could reach every spot we wanted to visit by foot.. Friendly staff, nicely decorated interiors of the hotel and good breakfast made for a great stay over new year¬¥s eve into 2015.",4,2015,01,06
129,"Lovely contemporary, boutique.","Good size rooms, good service, nice bistro downstairs and a tearoom upstairs. Very cool decor in the communal areas and rooms. Quite cute and romantic even.  Free wifi. 
Right next to South Kensington Tube, loads of shopping and eating nearby. 
Pretty expensive per night but still representative of the area.",4,2015,01,06
129,Wonderful Hotel in a Perfect Location,"It would be hard to imagine a more perfectly situated hotel for seeing London than the Ampersand. Walking distance to the big museums, great restaurants, and Hyde Park, and a stone's throw from the South Kensington tube stop which gets you just about anywhere else you want to go within minutes. The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms well-appointed, and the restaurant excellent. We had our three small children, who were welcomed and comfortable.",5,2015,01,06
129,Boutique comfort,"This lovely hotel was stop #2 on our honeymoon. I booked a superior room and it was not large, but that's par for the course in central London.  They compensated for the lack of square footage with a lot of shelf/closet space (more than I was expecting anyway).
The decor was just lovely. Everything in the hotel felt brand new, on top of being very clean and very comfortable. A great mattress and a great shower make a huge difference in how I feel when traveling, and this room had both.
Most importantly, it's hard to beat the location. It's literally across the street from the South Ken tube and many bus lines, in a charming and safe neighborhood, and even on the 1st floor we were not bothered by street noise at all.
Service was good too--there was a complementary mini-bar (milk, juice, and a few other things) that they were quick to re-stock when we ran out.
Finally, a word about food. We chose not to get breakfast included, but we did end up eating at the hotel one morning. It was very good but really expensive IMO, although everything in South Ken is pricey.",5,2015,01,05
129,Excellent All Around,"Service is phenomenal at this lovely South Kensington boutique hotel.  Every request is met with a smile and quick action.  Decor is lovely.  Hotel is immaculately clean.  Good eating and relaxation options at Apero and in the Drawing Rooms.
              ",5,2015,01,05
129,Xmas and New Year Break,"Our second stay at the Ampersand, great stay and ideal location.  The in house restaurant is also top drawer and worth trying even although your spoiled for choice in the area. Good value if you can get the 3 for 3 night option,
              
              
              ",5,2015,01,05
129,Great boutique hotel in great location,"Rooms on the small side but clean and comfortable. Very good service and personable staff. Mini fridge with free drinks a plus when travelling with family. Love the heated bathroom floors.  Would recommend this hotel.
              ",4,2015,01,05
129,LONDON NEW YEAR DAYS,"We have been for 5days at the Ampersand over New Year and
would highly recommend this hotel located very central. We are 
frequent traveller using  5star hotels and cannot find a single 
thing we did not like or even complain for. The interior is very stylish
and our deluxe studio was really perfect with beautiful design.
Maike and Marc from Hamburg Germany.       ",5,2015,01,05
129,"A faultless hotel, with all the home comforts 5*","4 nights here were a pleasure and if we travel to the city again will be looking to stay here. The location is a minute from South Kensington station where London is your oyster (pardon the pun). One of the outstanding features was the comfort of the bed which primarily is what your paying for at a hotel in my view.
We opted for the stay without breakfast but we ate there on our 3rd day and now wish we had taken the option when booking, very fresh (we chose from the menu instead of buffet) and the standard was as high as the comfort of the bed.
All in all, a great hotel where the staff are keen to ensure your stay is as pleasant as you would expect.",5,2015,01,04
129,A gem in the heart of Kensington,I live in north London and do not particularly care about staying overnight in a hotel in central London but The Ampersand Hotel has changed my mind. I loved my experience (albeit one night only) and will definitely stay there whenever I want a night out in London. I have already recommended it to friends and I hope they enjoy themselves as much as I did.,5,2015,01,03
129,Fantastic hotel!,"I just spent 7 nights at this boutique hotel.  Great staff and nicely designed rooms.  
I stayed in the single room and although I had no problem with it's small size (I live in New York and understand small city living) I do think this room should only be for 1 person.  So be honest with yourself before you book.  My room was on the 4th floor facing the back so I had no problems whatsoever with street noise.
Now the hotel - I was there over the Christmas holiday's so the hotel was beautifully decorated.  I absolutely LOVED the location!  It is right across from the Underground (Piccadilly, District & Circle lines).  Most importantly you can take the underground to/from Heathrow right to the hotel in 30mins or so for only 5 British Pounds!!  And with 3 Underground lines at your disposal - you can go anywhere to sightsee!
But also with the location - it's literally down the street from the Museum of Natural History and the Victoria & Albert Museum.  It's still central to Westminster Abbey and Big Ben -  I walked from both the Portobello Road Market and Buckingham Palace.  Long walks (45mins or so) but a nice way to see the city.  If you're not a walker the Underground took only 15-20mins.
I had the continental breakfast included in the room rate and they have quite a nice spread.  It's the same every morning but the quality is good and there are options (3-4 kinds of bread plus croissants and pain au chocolate, muesli, yogurt, cereal....) and whatever coffee/juice you want and they keep refiling it for you.
Around the neighborhood there are plenty of places to eat.  I strongly recommend the Hereford Arms - their bangers and mash was so so good!  As well as the Queen's Arms pub.
Also recommend Ben's Cookies because you are on vacation and can have a cookie.  Pret was also close if you want a good cheap option.  
I have zero hesitation of recommending this hotel.  I would go back in a heartbeat.",5,2015,01,03
129,Shabby staff & small & overpriced room/ suite,"Staff (at breakfast) doesn't speak English very well. And some of them looked shabby. And we got charged 6 pounds for 2 boiled eggs! I have never ever been in a hotel where boiled eggs are not included in the continental breakfast. Room was much to small for a suite. Not enough space for clothes etc. We stayed in the suite (503), our friends in the deluxe room (504). They found clothes of somebody else in their room at arrival! So the room had not been cleaned very well. We told the reception, but nothing was done to make us feel better. Only one man at the reception was very helpful and friendly during our stay. ",2,2015,01,02
129,Very charming hotel with excellent service,"I stayed here for 3 nights in March and upon reaching the hotel in the evening was promptly greeted and helped with my bags.

Check in was smooth and the stafft provided me a complimentary upgrade to a slightly bigger room as I had a baby and needed more space. they also gave me a complimentary baby cot for my boy to sleep in so that was much appreciated.

Room was comfortable but bathroom can be a bit tiny. Overall excellent",5,2015,01,01
129,"Beautiful hotel, convenient location","The Ampersand hotel is right across the South Kensington Tube station, which is along the Picadillly line which brings you straight to Heathrow. (You can do a change if you're coming from Gatwick) If you don't fancy eating at the hotel every night, there is Pret a Manger, Muriel's Kitchen, Wasabi, Paul and much more just across the street. The Natural History Museum is also just a 5 minute walk away.

Inside the hotel, the furnishing is beautiful, rooms and toilets are extremely clean and comfortable. The rooms are comfortably sized by London standards, and the mini bar drinks are free. Staff are also extremely helpful and friendly.

We will definitely stay here again when we visit London.",5,2015,01,01
129,Wonderfully sophisticated ,"I prefer small hotels in big cities and this one was excellent. In true London style, the rooms were pretty small but the amenities made it tolerable.  We spent family time in their Library, which had great books, by the way!  The service was so personal too. ",4,2015,01,01
129,Not bad,"We stayed here in December for a couple of nights while visiting friends in London. Overall the hotel has a nice feel to it, the staff are all very pleasant and the drawing room was just gorgeous. But I felt it lacked the finesse of some of the other boutique hotels I have stayed in in London, maybe an eye for detail that was just missed. Definitely some cute touches though and worth a look even if it's just for a coffee in the drawing room.",3,2015,01,01
129,"Beautifully decorated hotel, classy service and interior","Excellent little hotel in a great area. High attention to detail with superb service, befitting of the relatively high price. Very clean, quite during day and night. Provided high quality toiletries and bedroom/bathroom accessories. Very comfortable bed and pillows. 

Having booked the double room, the only complaint my wife and I have is that there's very little space for luggage storage. We had 3 luggages in total, 1 check-in and 2 hand carry's - all within aviation rule limits. There's very little room to move around, let alone position the luggage comfortable in the double room. Only reason I'm marking it down by one star.",4,2014,12,31
129,Can't wait to visit again!,"I would like to keep this short and sweet: The Ampersand Hotel is by far one of the most amazing boutique hotels that my husband and I have ever stayed at (and we've traveled a lot!). The location is perfect; the rooms are modern, comfortable and clean (always clean and tidy). Even though it's a fairly small hotel, the owners have spared no expense to ensure we get a good night's rest (the bed and pillows were so comfy!). Most importantly, the hotel staff were wonderful! Absolutely professional and constantly going out of their way to ensure we're taken care of. The food was less than average but that didn't bother us considering the excellent overall experience (besides, we preferred to eat out most of the time anyway). Our stay at the Ampersand made our trip to London during Christmas truly memorable. Thank you and hope to see you soon!",5,2014,12,31
129,Xmas break,Hotel was perfect location next to Piccadilly line. Everything about the hotel was professional and seamless. Nothing was too much trouble. Staff were genuinely polite and helpful. Hotel oozed quality. The final touches to all aspects made this feel a real top class hotel. Quiet. Discreet and lovely for a quite weekend away in the city.,5,2014,12,31
129,Almost perfect,"The location, in South Kensington nearly across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum, is perfect. It's also within walking distance to Harrod's and other great shopping.
The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. We were traveling with an active 2 1/2 year old, and the staff were all very accommodating. The Drawing Rooms are delightful for snacks, drinks, or tea.
Our room was lovely: not huge, but very comfortable and very nicely decorated. Very comfortable bed. We would stay there again.",4,2014,12,30
129,The usual little jewel in the heart of South Kensington,"From the moment you step into The Ampersand you feel cocooned by these charming young fellows who are always smiley, friendly, professional and chatty; but at the same time discreet and proper. Rooms are extremely well appointed, I tend to book the Deluxe, but in a couple of occasions lately - for very short stays - I booked Superior rooms which are also agreeable, slightly smaller, but amenity wise are similar.",5,2014,12,30
129,Family pre-Christmas treat,"A lovely hotel with very pleasant, helpful staff. Sadly a twin room incurred additional costs over and above that of a double? Why when the two single beds were fixed next to each other and the room had no additional space or facilities? The water was cooler than desired. Nice touches included the soft drinks in room, fresh milk and fresh coffee/ herbal teas etc.  Very comfortable beds and great location",3,2014,12,28
129,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful neighborhood,"My family and I spend our Christmas Holiday in London, staying at The Ampersand Hotel. It was a very pleasant experience. The hotel is beautifully decorated and designed, the rooms (we stayed in Deluxe Rooms) were neat and   of acceptable size, the staff was kind and helpful and the Kensington district was a wonderful area to stay in with lots of charming restaurants, cafes, shops and museums. The tubestation was only two minutes walk away and it was easy to reach any place in London from here.

Only complaint would be the restaurant Aperos service on our Christmas Eve. Unfortunately we didn't get value for our money this evening.

",4,2014,12,28
129,Little home,"I stayed in this hotel 26/12 and my family was really excited, what the friendly staff and the service I would say excellent! Room was superb, spacious and bed very comfy. Housekeeping doing great job, only would say attention to details. In over all my stay with family was memorable I would recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,26
129,Extremely satisfied,"Very,very nice hotel. We'll come back.
 Perfect service, very clean, friendly staff and moderate prices. For visiting London it is the Perfect location. Also the continental breakfast contains more than usual.
      ",5,2014,12,25
129,"Big and spacious room, good interior.","I was excited to stay here, but I could not make a reservation over the telephone after 40 minutes. I was repeatedly shuffled around between an endless procession of employees, and none of them was able to simply reserve a room for me. I found this to be very difficult to believe because one of the ""managers"" told me they currently had 300 employees",5,2014,12,25
129,"Position is perfect, noise not so","We loved the location of the hotel, easy walk to tube and nearby museums and shops. We recommend rooms at the back or a high floor for a satisfactory night sleep. Once we moved we had a great stay here ! 
      ",4,2014,12,24
129,Pure bliss...,"We returned to the Ampersand for one night to attend a function in London. Having had a simply wonderful stay last year we hoped it would prove to be equally as special and it was.
The Ampersand is a small piece of bliss in London, with modern, luxury rooms and a very very good breakfast I cannot imagine us staying anywhere else in future....keep up the good work",5,2014,12,23
129,A good hotel in a prime location,"I stayed at the hotel twice within a week. The location is prime and the drawing room experience is very nice and the some of the staff are friendly some were very miserable. The drawbacks are the rooms are slightly on the small size, anything larger for the price I would stay at a 5 star hotel within the area because for the price you pay at this hotel you won‚Äôt get the service. This is from my experience as a SLH loved member and AMEX Platinum card holder. I didn't get an upgrade on both occasions I stayed at the hotel within a week. I had the free continental breakfast, which was basic and limited as I don‚Äôt eat pork or ham there were no other options for non-pork/ham eaters. I recommend they include salmon, bresaola, pastrami, and turkey as options (not all are necessary but some). Looking forward, based on my three experiences at this property I don‚Äôt think I would stay here again, I would recommend the other SLH hotel No. 11 Cadogan Gardens as it is also close to an underground station and in a lovely area next to all the important places to shop. ",4,2014,12,23
129,Pre-Christmas shopping,My daughter and I stayed at the Ampersand on our way through London just before Christmas.  The location was fantastic.  Easy access to the tube with lots of small restaurants and shops nearby.  We were on a higher floor which was good since the street noise could have been bothersome. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  The only downside is that the rooms and bathrooms are a bit small.  If you like space then book one of the largest rooms.  We were upgraded to a suite after viewing several options.  ,4,2014,12,22
129,Favourite London hotel,"This is my second stay at this hotel in a year. This time we stayed for a week and wish we could've stayed longer. 

The hotel is near South Kensington station so transportation was great. It's near lots of great eateries such as Pret, Paul, Wasabi, Muriel's Kitchen, Gail's, Ben's cookies and the list goes on. It's also a short 13 minute walk away from Hyde Park and we were able to go to Winter Wonderland since it's Christmas period.

The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom had heated floors and a TV in the shower/tub. My only complaint is that it can get a little noisy from the main road traffic. 

I love this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,21
129,Great service and location,"Booked via Mr & Mrs Smith so got the free champagne and chocolates! This is a lovely hotel with great staff. Our room was fine although smaller than we normally have in London, but we only really sleep there! Wifi is strong all over the hotel, and you have personal login for your room that is super fast!",5,2014,12,20
129,Just gorgeous,"Fabulous hotel. Always so warm and welcoming. Beautifully furnished. Ideal location, next to South Kensington tube station. Great shops and restaurants in the area. Near Museums and walking distance to Harrods. See you again in 2015 !! 
              
              ",5,2014,12,19
129,Disappointed,"We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our 5 week holiday. I had booked a suite to ensue that we had space to relax and rest before the long flight back to Australia. I was very disappointed with suite, the bedroom did have a king bed which took up the whole space there was very little natural light and the lighting in the room was poor, there was very little room to move when you have more than once piece of luggage. The bathroom was acceptable with free standing bath and separate shower, decent window. The sitting room come kitchenette was so small it was a joke. You could not sit on the lounge and watch TV to get to the little balcony you had to shuffle the furniture around but it was nice to be able to open the door for fresh air. If you need to use the sofa bed as we did there is absolutely no room to move in fact I think it would be a fire hazard as you need to place the single chair in front of the door to have room to put the bed out. I was sharing the suite with my elderly mother this arrangement has not acceptable. The restaurant staff were very keen to assist and serve, we ate breakfast lunch and dinner with them over the four days and their attention to detail didn't change. My mother who sufferers from Parkinson really appreciated the effort they made to accommodate her special needs.  Reception staff not that helpful, tried to get an additional room for myself they just kept saying nothing available yet the adjoining room appeared not to be occupied , no help with bags, find your own taxi that sort of thing.  The location is great V&A, harrods and Natural history museum right on the door step . The red tourist bus stop is right out side the door. Underground on the corner. Whilst the hotel can not be held responsible they did arrange a private transfer to gatwick for me, the driver of the car was so ill with flu that both myself and my mother ended up with flu. We actually didn't think he was going to get us there he was that unwell.",3,2014,12,18
129,"I love, love, love this hotel!","I loved staying at the Ampersand so much, I hated to leave. I am in withdrawal.  It is SO charming, so perfect. I felt welcomed the moment I walked in the door and well  taken care of here.  Let me count the ways:  The location in South Kensington is terrific. The South Kensington tube station is across the street.  It's walking distance to Sloane Square, Harrods, the Victoria and Albert Museum and an easy subway ride to Covent Gardens and Westminster.  The reception staff takes a genuine interest in your stay. Tsui Pi, who registered us when we first arrived--took us up to our room, gave us a map, made great recommendations for places to eat, knew a good independently owned bookstore and actually asked us for feedback!  The rest of the staff was helpful as well. Don't get me wrong--it wasn't unctuous or overbearing--just interested and caring.  I loved the beautifully decorated lobby with an expresso bar and lots of good things to eat day and night around.  When my cousin dropped by to visit, she was offered fresh water.  Little touches like that go a long way.  The restaurant downstairs has an amazing breakfast and nice 3-course prix fixed luncheon menu.  Our room was small but nicely arranged.  There was a comfortable bed (very important to me), automatic lighting that preserved energy, sparkling clean lovely black-and-white tiled bathroom with a rubber ducky that you get to take home with you!  What's not to love?  It's not cheap but we were able to take advantage of three nights for the price of two winter special.  I would not stay any place else the next time I'm in London.",5,2014,12,17
129,lovely new hotel in south kensington,"I was excited to discover a new hotel had opened in south kensignton.  I wasn't disappointed by the location, rooms or amenities.  Wonderful stay!  I would definitely recommend this hotel for future work or pleasure visits. 
              ",5,2014,12,17
129,Lovely get together at the Ampisand,"A group of friends got together in a room at the hotel last weekend. We were made really welcome by the staff at reception and by those who served the lunch - I would certainly recommend it for food an service, and consider staying there in the future - it is in an ideal position for the museums and close to the South Kensington station if you want to go further afield. 
Surrounded by numerous cafes and restaurants",4,2014,12,17
129,One for the short list!,"This is a hotel to keep on your short list. It's a gem of a boutique hotel opposite South Kensington tube station. I booked for one night through Mr and Mrs Smith and got a great rate plus a little extra of petits fours and a glass of champagne. 

Check in was efficient and then the receptionist took me to my room. I witnessed a discussion between the receptionists about me being a single female guest and therefore it should be a female who escorted me to my room. That's the first time I've seen this thought about and I appreciated it. The room wasn't huge but they'd upgraded me to the next category and it was very nicely decorated. The technology is excellent with iPod docks, flat screen TV and everything controlled electronically. I had a small shower room with every amenity you could possibly think of and Miller Harris toiletries, very nice. The bed was huge with excellent linen and I got a great night's sleep with no noise from outside, even though I had a front facing street view. I also had tea/coffee in the room.

A couple of things struck me about this hotel. Firstly it was beautifully decorated for Christmas in an unusual and modern way. It felt a bit like being in a designer's house. It also had a very cosy and friendly feel, most un-hotel-like. The room rate was inexpensive for a week night in London but as a complete bonus, the food and beverage prices in the hotel were very reasonable. I had breakfast and the menu was really different, interesting and sensibly priced. I paid about ¬£8 for a grilled halloumi and tomato sandwich and a latte. I also had tea and cake in the pretty lounge when I returned after shopping and it cost no more than a trip to Costa. Very unusual for a London hotel and great to see.

Location wise this is perfect for Kensington, Chelsea or Knightsbridge and being so close to the tube, you can access most of London easily from here. There is also a taxi rank right outside the hotel. There were other facilities available inside the hotel such as a spa which I didn't have time to try unfortunately and a business centre with PCs available for guests use but with free wifi you didn't really need them.

Top marks Ampersand, I will definitely return!",5,2014,12,17
129,Amazing!,"A sensational hotel, great styling, beautiful room, afternoon tea to dream. The whole hotel is perfectly decorated. The location in Kensington is great. Subway station directly at the hotel. Certainly a highligt in London. We will definitely go back.",5,2014,12,17
129,lovely stay at the Ampersand,"Beautiful hotel, with friendly and welcoming staff team. 

Room was lovely although smaller than we anticipated but having not previously stayed in london this may be a general thing. 
We stayed in a double executive room which was beautifully decorated, bathroom was lovely and all the little things had been thought of which was a nice touch; complimentary hot and cold drinks, toiletries, cosy dressing gown and slippers. 

Would highly recommend :) ",5,2014,12,16
129,Short Stay in London,"What a superb gem of a hotel. In a great location. Smart clean and trendy. Great bar for cocktails and a brilliant breakfast. To top it all extremely friendly and accommodating staff. I cannot fault it.

129,A great update to a classic hotel,"Great service, beautifully appointed and great location.  We were delighted with our stay and found the staff very helpful.  The food in the restaurant was great.  The hotel is about 100 metres from South kensington station meaning it is easy to get around London.  South Kensington also has a vibrant cafe and restaurant strip.  A short but very enjoyable stay.",5,2014,12,16
129,Indeera indeed,"Beautiful hotel, impeccable service, great food
humongous compliments from a fellow Parisian hotelier, Miss Indeera is the best receptionist I've had the pleasure to be welcomed by, and followed throughout the stay. 
Greatest stay in London, will definitely be back!",5,2014,12,15
129,Too many mistakes,"Very Dan and comfortable, however too many mistakes were made from charging our group for the breakfast we had already paid for in the room rate, cold showers, to apathy at finding an item I had accidentally left in my room on check out. A shame as it has soured my experience and sadly I cannot recommend.",3,2014,12,15
129,Nice wall luxury hotel near tube stop,"Overall, if you're looking for a luxury and comfortable experience without the feel of a massive luxury hotel, the Ampersand is worth your consideration. It‚Äôs location and comfortable, stylish rooms are great. 

The hotel was elegant and not too large. The decorations and wallpapering was nice as were the electronic keys and room information displays - a neat touch. We checked in but our room was not ready since it was only about 10:30am so we placed our bags at the front desk. We came back later in the evening to get our keys and go to the room and there was some confusion when we said we had left our bags because the man said there were not bags in storage‚Ä¶ Eventually it turned out that they had been taken up to the room. 

The room was nice sized, not too cramped but by no means large. We were in room 203 which was somewhat far from the elevator and down one step. The bed was very comfortable and a good size with large, soft pillows. There were also a desk and a tv which we did not use. There was a large window and high ceilings though the window looked out on another wall of the hotel but nonetheless was a nice touch. The bathroom was great with a rain shower and bathtub. The floors in the bathroom were heated which was a very comfortable touch for our winter visit. 

We had a nice overall time at the hotel. Not all staff members were as warm or accommodating as you get at some luxury hotels (although there were a few who were really friendly and helpful) but they did their jobs efficiently when we checked in, out and requested a synthetic pillow. There is also a nice restaurant and cafe in the hotel which looked nice though we did not use it. There are computers and a printer to do any work on the basement floor as well. The only thing I can‚Äôt really comment on is the value of the hotel, since our stay was payed for as a gift.",5,2014,12,14
129,Fabulous and so convenient for museums shops and cafes,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel for 3 nights. Its the best hotel we've stayed at in London and we were at the Park Plaza earlier this year!
The deluxe bedroom on the first floor had an enormous bed, beautiful luxury cotton bedding and fabulously appointed bathroom. Bathrobes, slippers and luxury toiletries were standard. A nice touch was the cafetiere  which makes a nice change from the bog standard sachets of instant coffee. Water, fruit juices and fresh milk were in the fridge and constantly replenished....very nice! 
The lounge was warm and cosy and service at the bar second to none......in fact all the staff were extremely helpful

The hotel is within 3 minutes walking distance of South Kensington tube and very close to all the amenities and parks. We walked down to the embankment  round the parks and yet we were very close to Harrods and Harvey Nichols and other lovely shops

I would certainly stay here again we had a fab time!",5,2014,12,14
129,"Great stay, very good location","This hotel is about 2 mins walk to South Kensington station which means the location is absolutely fantastic. We loved the area (plenty of good food to start the day with) and the two museums (national history and science museum) are just a few mins away.

Book this hotel if you want a great base for your London trip!",5,2014,12,13
129,"great location, great service, great hotel","We were in London for Christmas Shopping and found this hotel over slh.com. Of course before we decide if we go to a hotel we always read the comments on tripadvisor, so when we checked the comments on tripadvisor, we knew that the hotel will be good. 
When we arrived at the hotel the staff welcomed us the a warm greeting, the portier asked if he could bring the luggage to the room and in the lobby the christmas tree was just stunning. The rezeptionist told us that they upgrated us to an larger room. The room was really nice with a big kingbed a little table and a modern toilet. 
The hotel is in South Kensington only one minute from the underground what is great so you are very flexible and you only have some minutes to get into the city center. Around the hotel there are a few nice places, we spoted an italian restaurant and a good indian food place even a Starbucks is near by. 
The only thing that was  in accordance with a 5 star hotel was the thiny breakfast buffet even tho you had many dishes you could order to this I missed the diversity. 
But beside this little point everything was really great and the bed is soo confortable I think I never had such good sleep. 
Thank you to the Ampersand Hotel to make our stay so  pleasant, we come back for sure :)",5,2014,12,12
129,Excellent Hotel,"Was at the Ampersand for 3 nights and must say that this hotel is excellent and exceeded my expectations.
- Excellent location: As mentioned by other reviewers, just across the street from the tube.   
- well appointed room, big enough but I have to state that I had the superior room.  Modern controls for the air-conditioning and door.  It also had a very comfortable bed and I slept very well.
- Staff were very friendly and helpful at all times.  No hassle at all during check in and check out.
- other small touches but nevertheless very nice like heated bathroom floor (!), free mini bar (though it is probably already in the bill), stable and fast wifi and umbrellas provided for the London rain is just icing on the cake.

Definitely much better value than many others, will be back!",5,2014,12,12

hotel is very beautiful in decoration. 
would totally recommend as the neighborhood is also very beautiful!...........................",5,2014,12,11
129,Excellent as always ,This was 3rd time staying at this hotel and the quality of truly fantastic. The location is great as you can see it from the South Kensington tube station which saves taxis or searching for directions. The staff are always extremely polite and helpful. The little things like a free soft drink mini bar and complimentary copy of The Times hanging on your door in the morning are lovely extras. The room size is excellent and the beds are seriously wonderful! I can't recommend this hotel enough. ,5,2014,12,11

129,Gorgeous,Lovely hotel with a small but very cozy and clean rooms. The room has everything you need for a wonderful stay in London. The room has everything you need. Located in the heart of all the attractions. The nearest tube station is South Kensington. I was here for the second time and the next time will stop only here.,5,2014,12,09
129,Affordable design in London!,"There are a lot of really terrible hotels in London. This is not one of them. A word of caution - if you are comparing this hotel to others cities, don't. Despite the tiny rooms, this hotel offers excellent value for money in London. While nothing can beat the Premier Inn in terms of price/quality, it is not exactly 'design' - which is where The Ampersand comes in.

Situated in the well-heeled bubble of South Kensington, it is a block from 'museum mile', and easy access to the posh shops which line Sloane Square and Fulham Road. It is literally across from the South Ken tube station, so forget the Heathrow Express or a taxi: for door to door service hop on the Picadilly line from Heathrow. 

The hotel cafe/bar is beautifully and whimsically decorated and has a lovely selection of fresh pastries and sweets. Large umbrellas are available for guests to take with them as the explore the city. The hotel restaurant 'Apero' is in the cosy arched basement and offers a varied menu of small plates (which is useful if you are sticking to a budget). Continental breakfast was included in the rate, which I expected to be a croissant and a coffee, but instead turned out to be a delicious buffet full of breads, cheeses, pastries, meats, yogurts, coffee and fresh orange juice. 

Soaring ceilings made the room feel spacious, despite its tiny proportion.  The elegant decor, comfortable bed and modern bathroom were superb (and a far cry from the tiny, aging, mouldy rooms that characterize London). Be warned though - the room was so small I had to lift my suitcase over the bed to place it on the luggage stand - an extra foot all round would have made a big difference. This is not a hotel for someone planning to hang out in the room all day, and while it has a desk and a business centre, I would hesitate to stay here on business as its not really set up for it.  There was some noise that came through the walls, but it wasn't bad. Also, the hotel is above the tube line, so you can feel the occasional vibrations, but nothing that prevented sleep.  There are some very modern gadgets in the room, you can pair your tablet with the TV, a fancy room thermometer, and touchless room entry. 

There were a few computers and a printer in the basement (Macs), though no headphones which was a pity since I wanted to make a VoIP call. I also had a bit of trouble with the in-room phone so if you are planning to make calls over your stay, check it first before you unpack. 

There were lots of little touches - a handwritten welcome note, soft drinks and water included in the room, coffee & tea in the room, an umbrella in the room, a little rubber ducky in the shower, a book on the bedstand. This is now my go-to hotel in London!",4,2014,12,09
129,Excellent Boutique Hotel in South Kensington,"Arriving:
My wife and I arrived in the middle of the day and took a cab from King's Cross train station.  The traffic was congested (probably typical) and so the ride felt long, but for convenience it wasn't bad.  The hotel is located directly across from the South Kensington Underground station and so it was easy to direct our taxi driver to.  Check-in was very simple and the lobby was open and inviting.  The building was beautiful on the outside and on the inside was complimented by light-colored walls and dark, dramatic furniture and carpet.  

Room:
We had read reviews about the room sizes and so we booked a Deluxe Room.  We were actually able to save money over a Superior Room because of a special the hotel was running.  I think this was the perfect size, and fairly large for Europe.  I will say it is hard to imagine something a lot smaller, although it may be okay for shorter stays.  The room was very modern and I enjoyed the themes (Deluxe rooms are ornithologically, i.e. birds,  themed) and the use of purple over-sized headboards and curtains.  The view was just okay, but the large windows allowed for plenty of sunlight.  The bathroom was very nice and heated floors were an awesome unexpected touch.  It was also smaller, but there was more than enough room to move around and the actual shower was big.

Location:
The location itself was alright, because you're within walking distance to some great museums and the Kensington Palace and Gardens.  However, the major perk was the access to the the Underground.  South Kensington is a stop for three major lines with quick and easy access to all of the attractions/restaurants/nightlife of London.  By staying slightly further away you can get a steal and still be anywhere in a short matter of time.  The added cost of the Underground is minimal compared to the price of some other hotels.

Food & Drink:
We had a drink in the Drawing Room, which felt like a lounge with plenty of room to relax and enjoy a break from the hustle of travel.

Overall:
Based on the value for the amenities and the location we'd have no reservations about staying here again.  It's a fun, unique hotel with a lot to offer.",4,2014,12,09
129,Excellent location and amenities,Stayed here for 3 nights in November and have only positive things to say about this hotel..Beautiful decoration and very high standard. Located just across the road from South Kensington underground station and surrounded by great restaurants. Free Wifi. Willstay here again.,5,2014,12,08
129,beautiful hotel,"This is a really super hotel.  The d√©cor is beautiful.  I stayed for one night on business.  The best bits - the bed was fantastically comfortable and the air conditioning kept the room at just the right temperature.  On a cold December day, I also loved the under floor heating in the very sumptuous bathroom.  There was only 1 downside - the size of the room was small even by PARISIAN standards!  With only 1 plug socket and no mirror in the bedroom itself, I had to dry my hair by touch.  Shame!  
Others have mentioned the tube noise - I couldn't hear it at all apart from when I ate in the restaurant in the basement.
Nice place.  Not an ideal business/single person hotel, but only because it was so full of folks enjoying each other's company.",4,2014,12,05
129,Good hotel,"Hotel has a good location very close to underground station, you can go walking to Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Hyde Park. Their staff is very friendly, bedroom is clean, but a little tight. 
              ",5,2014,12,05
129,"Great location, great staff","The Ampersand has a hip modern vibe. The location is wonderful with easy access to underground and bus, lots of wonderful restaurants close by, and near the Kensington museums. The only downside to this is that there is some street noise although the hotel itself is very quiet. The room was small but comfortable. Free minibar, wifi, newspaper. My daughter became ill while we were there and the staff got a doctor to come quickly. When I had to extend my stay because of this and they were booked, the staff spent a lot of time finding another place for me to stay. If you want to be comfortable and well looked after, the Ampersand is a great choice.",5,2014,12,04
129,Business Traveler,Nice hotel in the most convenient location near underground..buses..restaurants. not a cookie cutter chain hotel...and what you could hope for if visiting London. Staff are exceptional. We were working very long hours..and be when we were returning to the hotel at night would go out of their way to make us comfortable. Definitely worth considering I'd you are staying in west London,5,2014,12,03
129,Quirky but Enjoyable,"The Ampersand lived up to expectations in terms of service, cleanliness and friendliness of staff.  The hotel has its own unique character and is in a great location, close to South Ken tube station, the central parks, the museums & the Albert Hall.  Definitely not a budget hotel, but fair value for money.",4,2014,12,03

129,Decent hotel ,"Stayed there for 10 nights over my last trip to London.

I booked it through the SLH.

Overall the hotel is in a good condition and staff  were quite friendly and helpful.

My first night was not that great as I had a several bug bites so I complained to the hotel stuff who kindly changed the room very efficiently. The new room was very nice and you got everything you can expect. However this is facing the street so you could pick up quite few noise which made you difficult in falling asleep. 

I also tried the restaurant whose food was great but service was very acreage.

Overall 75 out of 100 and will come back again but need to book a room not facing the street.",4,2014,11,29

129,Overall excellent experience,"Booked 5 rooms for a 50th birthday celebration. Overall we felt that the hotel was excellent and our experience was very positive. Good service generally and all staff were helpful and friendly. We were given a glass of complementary champagne on arrival and I returned after a night out to find cake and a nice birthday message in my room. These nice touches were much appreciated. Bedrooms were very nice and the beds huge and comfortable with beautiful linen, but the rooms were all small - although that didn't bother us. Food unfortunately though was variable. The room service food was very good and came very quickly. In aperol the cocktails were delicious and well priced. At breakfast the next day the choice and quality of food was excellent. However the service was VERY slow for hot breakfast orders with half of my party having finished their breakfast before the other food even arrived. They did their best but seemed under staffed. Sadly, our post drinks meal was not good as all 3 chicken burgers in our order tasted so strange that they had to be sent back. The cost was removed from the bill without a fuss and they offered us mini deserts as compensation, which were lovely. The next day however one of my party who ate more of their chicken burger than the others was very ill with stomach problems. Maybe this was just a coincidence but I doubt it. Despite this our stay overall was very positive and I certainly would go back, but I wouldn't eat there next time. ",4,2014,11,26
129,Fantastic Hotel In A Perfect Location,"Recently spent 3 nights at this truly excellent hotel and both myself and my partner could not have been more impressed. The price (for once) is justified on this new and trendy hotel which manages to mix a mordern style with class effortlessly. Location is spot on for visitors of London being across the road from The tube which gets you easily to Oxford Street, Victoria, etc etc. Walking distance is The Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall, The V&A and much more. 

On arrival staff we professional and friendly which made checking in a breeze and the room itself was one of the best we have stayed in. We were in a Deluxe Double i believe and this was a great size room with a stylish decour which did not try too hard equipped with balcony, sofa, chair, desk and plenty of cupboard space with feeling cramped at all. Bathroom had heated floors and TV with a shower/bath combo which worked well for us. 

Complimentary mini bar & access to simple necessities which make travelling easier such as hair dryer, proper umbrella (not cheap and nasty) washing and ironing service and much more. 

The hotel itself also has fabulous tea rooms which provide the perfect resting spot after a busy day in London. Also with a library, games room, gym and restaurant and bar this hotel really does have it all.

My only slight concern for some sleepers would be the tube rumbling along which can be heard at night when things quiet down. However for me this just added to the charm

We were very sad to leave but will be back in the new year for sure. 

We did not have breakfast at the hotel but instead enjoyed a fantastic morning meal at Muriel's just along the road and Le Pain Quotidien just further on which we both highly recommend. 

There are a flourish of local restaurants around the hotel which we opted for one night and enjoyed a very reasonably priced Italian called Rocca Di Papa",5,2014,11,24
129,A lovely experience,"We treated our son for his 9th birthday to a weekend in London (mainly to see Wicked).

We are lucky enough to consider ourselves seasoned travellers and without doubt, our experience at the Ampersand ranks up there with the best - checking in and out was a breeze.  Our room was great and already set-up with our sons camp bed laid out.  Our son was made to feel very welcome.....and making children feel welcome is something that many London hotels sometimes struggle with!  A good range of food was still available in the Drawing Room at 11:00pm on Saturday night - our son was again treated very well with the chef giving him a tasty gingerbread man and a little toy.  

Its location is great for the Natural History, Science and V&A museums and is only a few tube stops away from all the eating, drinking and shopping locations.  Not overly pricey for a boutique London hotel, either!

A special mention goes out to the staff member who made an extra special effort to accommodate us in a larger, family friendly room at the time of booking - to him: apologies for forgetting your name, but thank you for going the extra mile - we'll definitely come back again!",4,2014,11,24
129,The Ampesand hotel is a very good choice," Very nice stay at Ampesand Hotel
              Relaxing atmosphere, nice and contemporary decoraci√≥n. Recently refurbished . Very polite staff. Close to p√∫blic transport, shops and restaurants, and museums . The food is very good",4,2014,11,24
129,Ampersand stay,"I've now stayed @ the Ampersand twice,  the past 2 Novembers. To begin with, the drawing room adjacent to the front desk is gorgeous,  & it's  impossible to not notice it when checking in. Also,  the check-in process is quite efficient with regard to speed & orientation to the area/city.
    With regards to the rooms,  I've been impressed with both of my rooms as they are EXACTLY as they appear on the website.  The rooms are always clean, & they feel rather inviting.  
     The quality of food for breakfast & the attentiveness of the staff while dining were both very good. And finally,  I loved that the hotel was literally 150 yards from the South Kensington tube station with connections to the Piccadilly,  Circle,  & District lines.  It's difficult to find a place in London you'd want to go that isn't either directly accessible in 1 of those lines or with only 1 line transfer. 
   In short,  I think this is a superb hotel with regard to the presentation of the rooms,  the facilities,  & its location in London, especially for the price.   I'll keep coming back.

The location cant be faulted. less than 100 meters from South Kensington station with ample of restaurants and cafe nearby. Room was indeed very small with a double bed plus 2 ft spare on all sides. But then again the decor and the feel of the hotel makes it more bearable. The staff is friendly and I especially like the toilets!!! which I used as changing room twice (to get ready for work same day and to dress down for airport). Toilets cubicles were large and could fit in a suitcase with basins. Handy!

129,"Large rooms, convenient location and fantastic service at this modern hotel in South Kensington","We stayed here two years ago when The Ampersand just opened. We didn't experience any teething issues at all during our stay there. In fact we loved our stay and will definitely be coming back to the Ampersand when we return to London.

Reservations: When we made our booking, the hotel emailed back to let us know that there would be a power outage during part of our stay and so they had arranged for an alternative hotel - this was handled extremely smoothly and with lots of apologies. We were also given a better rate as a result. 

Check in/Check out: Smooth, no issues. During check in, we were offered coffee and tea in the lounge while we waited which was a nice touch because it was cold, chilly and rainy when we arrived.

Room: We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. Love the decor of the room, and of the hotel in general. Wifi worked with no issues at all. Amenities were replenished daily, room was kept extremely clean daily - absolutely no complaints at all.

Location: We loved that it was a very convenient location - close to public transport, the subway and it was very easy to catch cabs if we needed. We were there for a friend's wedding at the Natural History Museum and this turned out to be right around the corner. It's also close to the famous Hummingbird Bakery ;) 

Breakfast at Apero downstairs was fantastic as lots of delicious options - in fact, we looked forward to breakfast daily.

Overall, our stay was amazing and it was fantastic value for a brand new boutique hotel in a convenient location with great service. Can't wait to go back!",5,2014,11,20
129,ROOM TOO DARK AND TOO NOISY,"I so wanted to love this hotel and to recommend it, but I didn't and I can't.
Undoubtedly, it's in a great location, close to the Natural History Museum, the V&A and Harrods, but then so are lots of other hotels.

The room we were given had a lovely big bed in it but there was, despite there being a window, virtually no natural light and precious little artifical light either.  The room was actually fairly dark despite all the lights being switched on.
Despite being on the ground floor, there was constant banging about heard from below us which made for a very uncomfortable night's sleep.

And very disappointingly, I accidentally left behind 4 beautiful silk ties in a nice cotton bag, but the hotel have made no attempt to contact me about them, so I must presume that the room service person threw them out and that's really not good. In fact, it has really let down the honour of the hotel.

So, great location, nice building, nice room, but wierdly too dark and far, far too noisy.  Plus, I'm down 4 ties.  Shame really.

I paid ¬£200 per night.",2,2014,11,20
129,Great family stay,"We chose this hotel as a one-night base for a significant birthday celebration in mid October. Our remit was it had to be central, not too expensive and could accommodate our family group from teens to 70s across 3 rooms. We settled on Ampersand as it was much more quirky than the boring big name chains, and we were so glad we did. It was fun. Just chilling over table tennis with the family was a great way of settling in, as well as eyeing up the cakes in the gorgeous lounge. My mum got totally obsessed with the Rolling Stones book in her room!

We knew the rooms would be small, but we were still a bit taken back by the size of the single room. But hey, we knew the score when we booked and it was OK for one night. Luckily we had upgraded one of the double rooms to a superior so there was plenty of space there. We booked direct with Ampersand and got a deal on the larger rooms.

The staff were delightful. So warm and welcoming and very helpful directing us to a cheap (for central London) car park. We had a brunch on Sunday and that was also good.

Great location. Right by the tube, shops, restaurants and museums. We all fell in love with the Ampersand and getting that right for both mother and mother-in-law is saying something!",5,2014,11,20
129,convenient London location with well-maintained rooms,"Nice spot! Really convenient to the South Kensington tube station. You can take the Piccadilly line to/from Heathrow with no changes and get there in about 45 minutes. The hotel is less than 5 minutes walk from the tube stop. 

Our room was nice, though very small. It's not a cheap neighborhood by any means, but it was nice to arrive in London and stay somewhere somewhat luxurious our first night. The bathroom was seriously tiny, and the shower's temperature control was EXTREMELY sensitive. Once you get the temperature you want, DO NOT TOUCH IT. :)

The hotel is very close to the V&A Museum as well as many others. We felt totally safe walking around at night for a late reservation at Evans & Peel Detective Agency, which was a 15-20 minute walk from The Ampersand. 

We had afternoon tea here after arriving, which was nice, but the open-face sandwich format can be hard to eat without spilling food everywhere. The whole place seems to be run by fashionable Italians. The front desk staff was very cheeky - I think a couple of them must be an item, because as we were checking out one guy was playfully patting one lady on the bum. Laid back style, you could say! But they were very friendly (OBVIOUSLY, heheh) and helpful during our stay. 

Breakfast downstairs in Apero was really nice. It's kind of funny, due to the proximity to the tube station you can hear the trains rumbling by every few minutes when you're down there in the basement. It's nice and bright, though, and the breakfast buffet option was perfect for my jetlagged self. 

I would stay here again due to the niceness of the rooms, not-too-exorbitant price, convenience to the tube, and maybe if you want to get a pat on the bum. :-o :)",4,2014,11,19
129,Modern Hotel in a lovely area,"Most of the hotels in London are the traditional hotel look and feel. For The Ampersand Hotel, the exterior of the building looks traditional indeed yet however, the hotel itself give such a classy feel that you will love it the moment you stepped into the Hotel.

Room:
The room is very big for a deluxe. With all facilities including free bar. The bed is big and comfy and the overall hotel experience is very modern and clean. The bathroom shows a class of designer feel with white and black deco. It's all tastefully done and a very modern feel.

Location:
The Ampersand Hotel is just 50 steps walk opposite South Kensington underground tube. With varieties of cafes, restaurants, coffee joints surrounding the hotel.
As this is near Knightsbridge, you can walk to the famous Harrods for shopping.

129,Luxury London trip,"We stayed for one night on 12th November 2014. After researching on trip advisor we picked the ampersand as the reviews were mainly positive. We booked through mr and mrs smith as we had some vouchers. The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from south Kensington tube station. We arrived early at around 12pm and were lucky to find our room was ready. We had booked a deluxe bedroom and we chose a room with a bath. It was on the second floor at the front. We were pleased with the size and it was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. It had sky television tea and coffee making facilities and a mini bar with free two diet cokes, 3 bottles of water and a small bottle of orange and apple juice. The bathroom was gorgeous and had a tv and underfloor heating. There was some road noise and a slight rumble of tubes could be heard but it didn't bother us. The hotel is beautifully decorated and we loved the individual art work and light tree in the centre of the staircase. The reception staff were polite and friendly and offered to book us taxis although we didn't require one. We can't comment on dinner as we chose to eat out. The breakfast rate includes a continental breakfast. There was a good selection of cereals breads cheeses meats yoghurts and a large bowl of fruit salad. It cannot be swapped for a cooked breakfast but this and other items can be ordered separately from the a la carte menu and charged. We would definitely return to this beautiful hotel. We had a very enjoyable stay. Thank you the ampersand hotel",5,2014,11,14
129,Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel. Good value. Liked that mini bar was free and Wi Fi too although didn't use either. Well furnished and contemporary. The Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was nice but there was very little room between the bed and the desk chair. Kept bumping into it.

129,How to loose a regular client ,"Was a regular client of the hotel which I liked a lot . It is a well decorated hotel in the West end which I loved to stay . I erased it from my agenda address book after the unfortunate charge of a room night by the front desk manager one hour after the time limit to cancel a booking had elapsed which I thought was very inelegant and unfair considering I was a faithful client .

129,Stunning,"We only stayed one night but will definitely return. The hotel is simply beautiful throughout. Gorgeous decor and furnishings.
We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe room and it was faultless. Spacious yet cosy and comfortable with plush furnishings and excellent facilities.
The hotel is in the best location possible, one minute walk to the tube station and near the museums and parks of Kensington.
Can't wait to go back!",5,2014,11,12

129,Pure indulgence!,"We have just returned from a truly wonderful three night minimoon stay at The Ampersand!   We treated ourselves to a delux suite and were delighted to get one of the suites with a bath tub in the room.  Friends had pre booked champagne in our room for our arrival so we drink this whilst enjoying an amazing deep bath... The perfect way to relax and settle into our stay!  The bed was so comfortable and the sheets were divinely soft!   It felt a real treat to have complimentary soft drinks from the mini bar and newspaper delivered each morning... And we couldn't resist the tasty room service breakfasts each day!
The staff were wonderful and made us feel so very welcome, and it's very convenient being only a few minutes walk from the tube.    There is also the fabulous Apero bar and restaurant within the hotel.  We couldn't recommend this hotel enough!",5,2014,11,10
129,Location and People,"We spent one night in London, using it as a stop-over between the U.S. and Spain.  We wanted a ""low risk"" experience as our main objective was to adjust to the clock.  Cross referencing multiple sources and reading through several T/A notes, we picked the Ampersand and that decision was rewarded.

LOCATION is excellent.  In the Kensington and only a minute from the tube.  The hop-on, hop-off bus is steps away and yet, the place is extremely quiet.  You will have the airport commute but the hotel offered and we accepted a car -- not cheap but extremely convenient considering the time zone coming from the west coast of the U.S.

CHARM because the hotel was actually a series of independent apartments that were patched together.

SERVICE is outstanding.  The entire team seems highly sensitive to your needs at the front desk, for a quick cup of coffee and for breakfast.

Perfect place for our needs.",5,2014,11,10
129,Excellent hotel in central London,"Excellent, great team, guest rooms are superb, small but perfect. Love the Miller Harris amenities!

The staff was friendly and eager to please. ",4,2014,11,09

129,Good choice for museum lovers,"I was at Ampersand Hotel for 3 nights, and I enjoyed my stay here. It is just a short walk from the museums. When weather is good it is even more enjoyable walking 15mins to Knightsbridge than taking the tube.

We got a room on the higher floor with access to a small terrace. The room is pretty spacious and very clean. Breakfast is good too, with quite a variety to choose at the buffet table.

We would not hesitate to come again next time we visit London.",4,2014,11,09
129,Excellent stay,"Second stay. As good as a year ago. I really recommend this place. The bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly. And for business and leisure really a perfect location. Had drinks in the lounge. Friendly and fast service as well.

129,absolutely impeccable,"Splendidly located near Sloane Avenue and South Kensington Station, The Ampersand has lovely though very small rooms that are furnished with ample amenities and the mini bar is free as well as the Wifi. Breakfast was delicious> The Continental buffet had wonderful breads, (many types from Sourdough to Cinammon) a great array of cheeses and fruits as well as anything else your extremely hungry heart could desire.The staff was very attentive and helpful. Definitely coming back to this hotel.",5,2014,11,07

129,Great hotel,"Great hotel within a very short distance from South Kensington Tube stop. Excellent and friendly staff, who were very knowledgeable about the local amenities.
We booked this hotel as it was one of many within walking distance from the Royal Albert Hall, and this certainly did not disappoint.
Only thing I would remind future guests is that you will need to bring your own toothbrushes as there were none provided in the room. Unless this was an oversight, bring your own!
Overall though, a thoroughly pleasant stay and definitely recommended.",5,2014,11,05

129,"Beautiful hotel, Great location!","Recently stayed 4 nights. In spite of our early arrival the staff made sure our room was ready within 20 minutes. The rooms are very small yet very charming and well decorated and clean. The staff was so warm helpful and friendly. The room had a mini fridge stocked with soft drinks, water and juice which was included in the room price.The location is amazing for sight seeing, you are seconds away from the S. Kensington tube station and from there a short distance to everywhere in London. Hotel is close to the Royal Albert Hall and the Natural history Museum. Great places to eat nearby as well. The hotel restaurant was very good, we had dinner and breakfast there.
Great place to stay!",5,2014,11,05
129,Super boutique hotel in great location,"Across the road from the South Ken. tube station.  This hotel is just a gem. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.  The bedroom (I was on the second floor) was a good size, quite and temperature was spot on.  The bathroom was small but very well appointed and exceptionally clean.  The meeting space is at the basement of the hotel and extremely good.  It has a country-house feel to it with soft blues and book cases in the meeting room we used. The food was excellent!  Usually a buffet-style lunch doesn't stir me to excitement but here, the food was absolutely delicious, plentiful and very well presented.  I would definitely recommend for business or pleasure.",5,2014,11,05
129,"Lovely hotel, perfect location, wonderful staff","We had one night here, and it was just sweet and perfect for the first night in a new city.  Rooms are tiny, pretty standard though for London.  Heated bathroom floors seem to be everywhere in Eurpoe, but are the best!  Staff was more than accomodating to our every question and referal request, and there were several available.  The tea room is also sweet and casual yet still elegant.  Would have preferred a room with a view but the early check-in was more important to us. I rarely tspend this much on a hotel in the US, but for London it was realitvely reasonable.",5,2014,11,04
129,"Great hotel, great position","We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of September. The hotel is lovely, in a pretty part of Sth Kensington, not far from the train station. The hotel restaurant is very charming, and we had a terrific breakfast. Although small, the room was very comfortable, nicely furnished, great bed and spacious bathroom. The service was very good - front desk staff were very helpful & attentive. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,04
129,Convenience and Style,"The Ampersand hotel is a stylish comfortable hotel in  a great location for visiting the great cultural icons of London. The Victoria and Albert  and Natural History Museum  are only a ten minute walk from the hotel. Royal Albert Hall is a stones throw as well. South Kensington station takes you pretty much anywhere easily in London. Sloane Square with its great restaurants and pubs is only a few minutes away. The station Is a great intersection for many lines on the tube.The bedrooms are small but the bed is large and comfortable. The bathroom is stylish but very small. The shower is very good . Breakfast is NOT included. Despite this my wife and I found the a la carte breakfast very enjoyable ... The omelette superb! The interior design is intriguing  and not in any way gloomy.
This is not a cheap and cheerful establishment. It is a reasonably priced stylish and comfortable hotel with fabulous connections to the wonders of London.",4,2014,11,04
129,Best value for money and more!,"We stayed here twice during our recent trip to England and both experiences were excellent.  The hotel and our room was lovely and clean and we really loved the modern, fun design and colours throughout.  It made quite the nice change from your usual hotel look. We also appreciated all those little extra details that were included in the price such as the free waters, soft driinks, & juices provided for you in the mini fridge and the fact that this was the only hotel in the price range that provided an extra bed for a child for free.  The staff were also very friendly, polite, and very helpful.  

The hotel is also conveniently located less than 5 minutes from the South Kensington tube station.  There are also a wide variety of later night eateries for those of you who like to eat late  and the major museums of Victoria & Albert, The Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum just around the corner.

When we went, there was also a lovely little organic market across the street (on a Saturday) where we bought some fresh pastries and sandwiches.

129,"Good value, great location","Great location, near tube station, just few stations to the city center. Rooms quite small, very difficult to organize yourself in the room but everything else is pretty good. Do not expect much space for clothes, at least in room 222. Bathroom is big enough for comfortable use. Breakfast good but expected greater variety of the food, for the price. Overall great for short stay.",3,2014,11,03
129,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a perfect location. Very convenient to the tube, a block from the V&A museum. Service was very friendly and attentive. We had read on tripadvisor to request a room not facing Harrington Rd and not on the ground floor, so I emailed in advance and they were very accomodating. We had a deluxe studio which was very large and comfortable.",5,2014,11,02
129,Great Experience,"This was my first visit to the Ampersand.  I was traveling with my 12 year old daughter and had request a room with twin beds.  We arrived late from Scotland and the room was ready and the beds terrific.  The hotel is in a great Knights Bridge location with plenty of great  restaurants nearby to choose from.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Hotel was very clean, very attractive, and the room/bathroom were attractive and nicely equipped. This will be the place I stay in London on future visits.",5,2014,11,02
129,I wish I would return one day,"We stayed at a deluxe double room and it was a perfect size with two sinks and a nice large bathroom. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful with all the warm greetings each time we met. Hotel decor was very nice, contemporary but not over the top, loved the staircase and the beautiful wallpaper and carpet. The large bed was extremely soft with super fine silky linen it was the best bed we had throughout that Europe trip. And free in room beverage was a plus too. Housekeeping was fast and did a great job in keeping the room spotlessly clean. And I love love the neighborhood, tube was only steps away, lots of restaurants and young vibrant people. Quiet not crowded but still very lively every night. Two bus stations right outside hotel and it was very convenient to get to Piccadilly and major places as we preferred buses most of the time.

Ampersand could easily become my dream hotel as I tried very hard to fall in love with it, yet will I return? NO WAY!!......
The deal breaker was the horribly slow internet - so slow and unstable there was only 0.32Mps most of the time (sometimes you would get over 1M but most of the time way below that!)
Unless you don't go online you could hardly find the wifi useful AT ALL. So slow I could hardly successfully complete viewing one static page not to mention most pages aren't static nowadays. During those days I couldn't work, talk with my colleagues, view larger pictures or files, watch streaming videos, not even streaming audio! And we didn't even watch TV because TV was using up bandwidth and with that turned on your wifi would be walking dead. 

I tried both wifi connections they suggested and even tried the wall lan connection (mind you the plug at the desk was fake you will have to plug to the wall) but still slow like 56k (or maybe worse). I went to ask front desk about other options at that point I didn't mind paying extra if I had to but the gentleman replied in regrets ""really? So sorry about that we have never received such complaints before"" !!! Seriously?? Ok maybe I'm a weird person who just can't live without wifi, but who doesn't need to check emails and work a little bit during vacations? I know free wifi is supposed to be slow but even the free wifi at Heathrow airport was faster, offering something that doesn't work is quite unacceptable to us even though it's free.
Too bad I wish I could come back one day because I just love all other things about this hotel.",3,2014,11,01
129,Overall good experience.,"Positives: 
- Excellent location. Very near tube station, bus stop, various restaurants, cafes, museums, Harrods, etc.
- Modern hotel with relatively good service.
- Good and fast Wi-Fi.
- No problems with noise.

Cons:
- Tiny room. And I mean really really really small. I have stayed in tiny rooms in Tokyo but this has to be the tiniest room I have stayed in. 2 adults is a real squeeze with no room at all for luggage, etc.
- Although service was relatively alright, some staff were quite cold in their service and approach. Not all were as friendly as the rest.",4,2014,11,01
129,A gem of a hotel,I loved everything about this place.  The staff were phenomenal and the in house restaurant is amazing.  Only issue was that I noticed some weird dynamic between the older concierge and his younger charges...,5,2014,11,01
129,"Good hotel, let down by lots of little things","Stayed here for one night on a business trip. I had telephoned the night before to check that an iron and ironing board were available in the room. They weren't so I was assured that one would be placed in my room. I needed a very quick turnaround before heading out for a business dinner. Staff very efficient and friendly on arrival and again assured me that an iron and ironing board would be in the room. Arrived in the room, and no iron available. Back to reception and requested one. Waited. Back to reception again. Iron turns up. Plugged in, not working. Back to reception. Maintenance arrive. Fuses in room blown. Replaced and eventually iron functioning but now too late to shower and change before dinner so I gave up. 

On return, lots of all night roadworks outside the hotel window. Very noisy as they dug up and replaced the road surface. Not the hotel's fault but the council website indicates that notice had been given for the night I was staying and the subsequent night. I would have appreciated being informed by the hotel and the option of choosing somewhere else to stay. That, and the constant rumbling of tube trains under the hotel (except between about midnight and 5 am) meant a very poor night's sleep. On waking, the room felt very dark and dingy (the window looks out onto an air conditioning unit and a blank wall). The fuses had blown again so I had to cope without a functioning mobile and ipad the next day as they hadn't charged. Not great. And as others have noted, the wifi is extremely slow. Gave up trying to download email and reverted to 3G instead. 

On the positive side, staff are friendly and the hotel is very clean and modern, although some areas already suffering from wear and tear (leaking shower hose, wonky light switches for example). Location is great but I have stayed in similar rated but better value for money hotels in the Kensington area. I wouldn't return.",3,2014,10,31
129,Excellent hotel,"Rooms are nice and clean. Service is excellent. The food is good. The only negative point is the noise from the street. Don't worry, you will sleep. But the hotel should find a way to isolate rooms from the noise.",5,2014,10,30
129,Excellent Boutique hotel in the heart of South Kensignton,"Fantastic hotel, great rooms and really stunning tea room. Slightly pricey but for location, very much worth it. Great central location and highly recommended, frriendly staff and laid back atmosphere.

Once again I have to thank the excellent staff, always friendly and wishing to help.
An important plus is that just in front you have many busses lines and South Kensington tube in the corner, two blocks away different kind of excellent restaurants and a little further on the museums.",5,2014,10,29

129,Special place for a special treat,"My husband booked this hotel for my 50th birthday. We had a wonderful stay. As it was a special occasion he had reserved the 'Wine room' for a private party with a few friends. This was the best decision, as we had our own space and could relax knowing that everything was taken care off. The staff on the night were discreet yet attentive. The food was delicious and knowing that we only had to take the lift to get back to our room was a bonus. Our room was spotless, extremely well appointed and we particularly appreciated the extra touches like having free soft drinks and water in the minibar and a good coffee machine. The bedroom was quiet and the underfloor heating in the bathroom felt lovely underfoot. The decor inside is inspired by the various museums around and the location is perfect for the V&A  which was only minutes away walking. We will definitely stay there again when we are next in London. Well done to the team for making my day and our week end very special indeed.",5,2014,10,28
129,Lovely boutique hotel!,"From moment of our arrival, the staff went out of their way to make us feel completely at home.  This is a little slice of elegance in the heart of London.  Beautifully appointed rooms and brand new bathrooms make for a very comfortable stay.  The tea room on main floor is gorgeous and inviting.  We had our breakfast downstairs in Cafe and were not disappointed.  Only negative was the sound that pipes made above us when other guests were using the shower.  The pipes seemed to hum or sing... Would totally recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,28
129,Ampersand - a great place to stay,"Www took advantage of an offer ona suite and stayed one night at the Ampersand.
The suite we stayed in was compact with a great bathroom and small verandah. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. A games room and library were available but not used by us. Staff were efficient and friendly.
We enjoyed an excellent continental breakfast.
The hotel is well located in being only a short walk from South Kensington, which places it on a direct underground line from Heathrow airport ( n.b. Not the Heathrow express which goes to Paddington). 
I would have liked to stay longer at this hotel.",5,2014,10,28

129,Could not have been better,"After comparing hotels and neighborhoods for hours, I'm so happy I chose The Ampersand Hotel. My husband and I stayed here during our honeymoon. The neighborhood was clean and we never felt unsafe no matter what time of day. The room was spotless and a good size. The staff was incredible and so accommodating. We had breakfast here every morning during our stay. It was delicious and a wonderful way to start our day. Their afternoon tea was amazing as well. The hotel is about a minute walk from the South Kensington tube stop, so it was perfect location for getting around. I would, and already have, recommended this hotel to family and friends. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat and certainly hope to. Everything was beyond perfect.",5,2014,10,26

We pre-booked our parking at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel via 'just park' website ¬£25 for 24 hrs. It's a 5 minute walk to the Ampersand from here. There is absolutely no parking/stopping outside, as there is a busy bus lane! Our room was at the back - we could just about see the Natural History Museum from the window. Room was lovely - bathroom had underfloor heating too, the bed was lovely and comfortable we had a very good nights sleep! There was a complimentary mini bar (soft drinks) which was replenished each day. Tea/coffee making facilities with proper milk in the mini bar/fridge. We didn't eat breakfast or any other meals. We did sit in the bar for pre-theatre drinks and again the staff were attentive and friendly. Would definitely stay again!",5,2014,10,26
129,South Ken's Best Hotel !,"The Ampersand is a very smart boutique hotel. Very high standard of furnishings and bathroom fittings, excellent beds etc. The Staff are excellent. Really very helpful and assist at all times. The rooms are small. Very small. Wardrobe space in the suits is minimal. Immaculate hotel but maybe more suited to the businessman and not the family.

129,Fourth stay and counting...,"This will be our fourth stay at the Ampersand over the past 18 months, and I have no doubt we'll be back in the future. We really enjoy the convenient location - the tube station is just across the road, there are two bus stops right outside and you can easily walk to many of the major museums, Kensington Gardens, Harrods, etc. There are lots of restaurants, supermarkets and pharmacies in the immediate area. You really can't beat it for great location. We also love the service here. We haven't met anyone who hasn't been anything but incredibly helpful, polite and accommodating, willing to do everything from book theatre tickets, provide local information, give us free coffee (thank you!) and just make our return after a long day anything but delightful. The rooms are comfortable and beautifully decorated. Possibly the single and double rooms are a little small, and we would recommend the deluxe rooms or the deluxe studios. You can request if you value something in particular, such as afternoon sun facing rooms or bath or bath/shower combination bathrooms. The beds are some of the most comfortable we have slept in, and we love the complimentary snacks and drinks.
There are printing facilities, which is useful for boarding passes, etc. There is also a restaurant on the ground floor, which is also convenient. Overall, the managers have managed to get the perfect balance between convenience, luxury, beauty and quirkiness, which is really rare to find. We unreservedly recommend it - unlikely to disappoint.",5,2014,10,21

129,Lovin' London at the Ampersand,"My first trip to London and chose this hotel as it looked cute online plus the neighbourhood seemed very safe...an important consideration for a female travelling solo. Very easy to access from both airports (I landed at Heathrow and departed from gatwick). Quite literally a stones throw from south kensington tube.  Excellent lighting (yes, this matters!). Fab bed and delicious linens. Nice little mini fridge to store some treats from M&S, just round the corner.  I ate at the lovely restaurant twice as I got in late and didn't want to go out again.  Perfect small plates for one!  I can't fault it really aside from a tiny issue right at check in (not being shown the features of my room...perhaps my fault for insisting I could take my own bags). In any case, it didn't impact my enjoyment!  Overall, great service (the fellow at checkout was especially sweet), perfect location and pristine cleanliness.  I'd go back tomorrow if I could!  I'd suggest a room in the deluxe category just for the space.  Mine was a double deluxe and it was perfection :)",5,2014,10,19

129,Could do better,"First impression excellent and email before arrival set the expectation high, stayed for one night to attend fund raiser ball nearby, usually stay at the Dorchester and this really was eggs and cheese in comparison.  We requested a hairdresser nearby and was offered for a chap to come to us, perfect we thought (there were 3 of us) but total rip off, ¬£50 later each and total disaster, thinking it best to let receptionist know,she mentioned regular chap had let them down, Shame we were not told!! But that would providing a proper service. Rooms are small but comfy and showers good, mini bar a nice touch, valet parking is a shocker, although we 'booked' a time slot, hubbie was asked to drive around the block as valet was not available, needless to say he did not,  but sat in the car and waited.  Restaurant staff especially at breakfast not interested at all, 2 of our party of 8 arrived at 11.02 to be told breakfast service ends at 11 and they would not be served despite fully stocked PREPAID buffet clearly visible‚Ä¶ we rallied around between us sharing our food & drinks with them, waiter then ambarrassed and offered bacon sandwiches from the room service menu. Falls short of quality London hotels but expect they will do well as location is good and price is fair ¬£400 approx for B&B with parking.",3,2014,10,18
129,Staff were very helpful,"I had lost my reservation two days before arrivng at the Ampersand hotel. In spite of my fault, they gave me a suite at reasonable price.

129,superb experience,Nothing is too much trouble for people at The Ampersand.  Service is genuine and caring and the hotel is beautifully decorated.  I will book the hotel again on my next trip to London.  We had a small room but I'd much rather a small room in a great hotel than a large room in an average one.,5,2014,10,16
129,First trip to London special,"The hotel met every one of our needs and expectations, and the high ratings of other guests on TripAdvisor were totally accurate. The staff were great, food was outstanding and location was ideal.  Beautiful hotel in a fantastic neighbourhood. 
      
      ",5,2014,10,16
129,Beautiful Modern hotel - good location,"loved this hotel! it was perfect. 
its round the corner from south Kensington underground- which has three different lines going through it. 
the hotel itself is stunning. every part of it is beautiful. very chic boutique. 
we were upgraded to a deluxe studio and we had a bath tub in the room by the window. the room was large - massive superking bed, large bathroom with large shower. everything was clean, tidy and looked new. 
the hotel staff were all friendly. 
so the hotel ticks all the boxes and so does the location. its also round the corner from the museums. 
hotel is perfect for couples/romance. and I would suggest if you can that the upgrade is worth it if you want to spend some time in your room to relax. and the bed was so comfy I didn't want to get out the next day! 
you could hear the rail noise slightly from our room but it wasn't loud enough to annoy anyone.",5,2014,10,15
129,brilliant,"i thought the staff were pleasant and very helpful. the hotel felt nice, yet informal which kept a relaxed atmosphere. the room was well equipped and the hotel was in a great location. highly recommend. ",5,2014,10,15
129,Beautiful hotel,"Great location and gorgeous decor. Close to South Kensington Station. 
The rooms are not large but they are nice.  The hotel's Drawing Room is a nice space to meet friends or relax outside of your room. 
      ",5,2014,10,15
129,Wonderful boutique hotel,Well appointed hotel with helpful and friendly staff close to the Kensington South tube and numerous bus lines that take you anywhere you want to go in London.  A stones throw from the Victoria and Albert museum plus many other points of interest.  Highly recommend!!!,5,2014,10,14
129,Pricey but can't beat the location!,"My husband and I stayed at the Ampersand for a week in a double room. The hotel mentioned they typically would not recommend this size room (it's pretty small) for such a long period of time, but since we didn't spend too much time in the room, it worked great for us! 

The location is very convenient to the tube (South Kensington stop), bus stops, restaurants, cafes, ATM, Hyde Park and a number of museums. Check out Gail's bakery a block away for great breakfast pastries. 

The rooms came with a number of amenities, comfortable beds, outlet adaptor, and the bathrooms even had heated floors which were a real treat! The complimentary minibar with bottled water and juice was very much appreciated. We had a week's worth of laundry done by the hotel at the end of our stay- the price left me shell-shocked but we didn't want to waste any time in a laundromat, so... 

We had tea at the hotel once as well. We went on a weekday afternoon without a reservation and they were able to accommodate us, however they said if you plan to go on a weekend, a reservation is a must. Tea was very nice - just something to check off the bucket list. 

This is really a beautiful hotel and all the staff were wonderful. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!",5,2014,10,14
129,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"Great Location and Service. Overall nice clean feeling and well maintained, staff was fantastic! only downside is that is it pricey but then again so is the rest of London. 
Amazing selection for Breakfast at reasonable prices.

129,"Ampersand, October 2014","Our stay at the Ampersand was wonderful. The staff was very warm and met any request without hesitation. The room and property was nicely appointed, and very clean. The location was ideal for the tube.
      ",5,2014,10,14
129,great location and cost for the price,"The room was small, but had everything we needed including an extra outlet adapter, complementary juice and water, tea, make up remover, land a nice loofa. We were on the first floor (room 10). While we could hear the train from the Kensington Station, it was only a low rumble and did not keep us from sleeping.  The bathroom was very small, but the shower was really nice. Check in was easy. The hotel is decorated in a modern fashion with the theme being nature or things found in a museum of natural history. They provided maps and good recommendation for lunch and dinner. There are many places to eat very close by. Also grocery stores and an ATM a few minutes away. Considering the price and the location the hotel was a great deal. Stayed for two nights.",5,2014,10,13
129,Lovely boutique hotel.,"Service is well meaning but a bit clueless.  I would however definitely stay there again - as the location cannot be beat and the rooms are new,  attractive, comfortable, and spotless - which as a business traveller is all I want.   The minibar could be improved with some snacks instead of just drinks.   The common areas are also quite comfortable and inviting.   ",4,2014,10,13
129,Great London stay,"The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. The hotel is lovely, and in a great location to explore London. Only negative was the small size of our room. Had to open our luggage on our bed!",5,2014,10,12
129,Nice Hotel in London,The Ampersand is my favourite hotel in Kensington.  The location is superb and the hotel is very nicely furnished and the atmosphere is great.  The rooms are small so I recommend the double deluxe rooms.,5,2014,10,12
129,lovely boutique hotel great location,all the reviews are accurate this boutique hotel is worthy of its rating. Great location service superb. Standard rooms are small its worth upgrading if you can afford it.We had lunch in the restaurant and it was delicious. Great bathroom with lovely toiletries. Excellent staff.,4,2014,10,12
129,"Great stay, will definitely come back","My family (wife & 2 1/2 yr. old son) stayed for four nights (Oct 1st-5th).  The staff was very attentive & nice, felt like the staff truly liked their jobs.  We upgraded our room to a suite, we'll worth the money.  Our 1st room was too small for the 3 of us plus our luggage.  The suite had a huge bathroom with tub/shower sort of separate and had a tv installed in the wall you can watch while bathing/showering.  We also had a living room/kitchen area with a balcony, while the separate bedroom was spacious and extremely comfortable.  My wife and I have been discussing buying the bed and pillows from the hotel.
The location was great, 2 minute walk to museums and 20 minutes from Knightsbridge (harrods).  
If hungry go to Bospherous kebabs around corner on old brompton rd. for great food at reasonable.
Next time in London will definitely be back.",4,2014,10,12
129,Lovely Service,"This hotel has quite possibly the kindest staff I have ever encountered - across the board.  We arrived about an hour before our room was ready and the staff made (great) suggestions of how to pass the time.  The held our bags and took them to our room directly. 

European hotel rooms are all pretty much smaller than what you will find in the US.  We know this and so had no issue with the room size for the two of us.  The bathroom has heated floors which was an excellent surprise.  The mini bar and WiFi were complimentary.  The bed is exceptionally comfy, and the high ceilings make the room feel more open.

Room service was honestly very tasty.  We had a club sandwich and fish & chips.  Both were far and above what we were use to getting when it comes to room service food quality.  The location of the hotel is spot on for exploring London.  The hotel staff were also able to arrange a drive to take us back to LHR for a flat 50¬£ which was quite nice.",5,2014,10,12
129,Beautiful hotel that gets the details right!,"Finally, a hotel that thinks about the details! My husband and I just spent 10 days at The Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington, London. This hotel popped up during my husband‚Äôs initial search and he liked the looks of it right from the beginning. The location is great, the tube station is less than a block away. There are restaurants, museums (V & A, Natural History and Science) and shops nearby but location is only a fraction of what makes this a lovely place to stay and one I hope we can visit again. The building is beautiful, has been carefully remodeled with up-to-date technology without losing its old world charm. The decor is so beautiful, everywhere you look there is something lovely and interesting to meet your eye. This feels less like a hotel and more like someone‚Äôs beautifully and thoughtfully decorated home. We stayed in a Deluxe Studio. The room is good-sized by London standards and ours even had a tiny balcony to go out and feel the breeze and the buzz of London. The king bed was comfy and the two different types of pillows were a welcome touch. The bedding is wonderful to sink into after a long day of sight-seeing but size and comfy bedding aren‚Äôt the only things‚Äîit goes well beyond that. What sets it apart for me is that the designer has dealt with annoying things that make travel such a pain, especially for women. In our room, there was an actual place for the use of a blow dryer, in a cupboard with easy-to-reach outlets and a full-length mirror on the door and a surface (not the floor) to use for the blow dryer and a brush. The mirror was a bit too low but it was so much better than any other place I‚Äôve stayed. Built into the desk were: two outlets, a hardwired cat-5 outlet, audio-visual inputs and a charging USB port. Adaptors were also provided. Besides the desk outlets, there are easy-to-reach outlets on either side of the bed at the top of the nightstand. It makes life so much easier! There was a clock with an iPod dock which we did not use. The entertainment system was a bit glitch-y in our room but it was so nice to have options that were not all ‚Äúfee-required‚Äù. (They were extremely quick to help resolve problems, sending a very nice, friendly and knowledgeable tech guy to the room almost immediately when we called.) There is a selection of music to listen to, television, movies and more. There was access to the entertainment in the bathroom, as well, and a nice tub to soak in. I use shower caps occasionally and I have never opened one that provided a rubber band to hold my hair up and under the cap. There is a minibar and the contents are complimentary. A selection of coffees and teas are provided with a small milk in the fridge. I got to have tea when I got up every morning and did not have to pay extra or wait for delivery. For me it‚Äôs all in the details and these details made me feel like I was home. Outside the room, was The Drawing Room an inviting, beautiful place for afternoon tea or a glass of wine. We had a lovely breakfast and dinner at Apero, the hotel restaurant. We traveled late September-early October, stayed ten nights and paid roughly ¬£236 or $400 per night. It is pricy, but it is also South Kensington in London and I feel like we might actually have gotten more than we paid for when our stay was over. We stayed in a very expensive Hyatt in Paris the week before in a bland, bland room with one outlet each, mine almost behind the door at the floor.  The room had no charm no extras and the mini bar was in upcharge with sodas that were over ‚Ç¨7! What a difference! The staff at Ampersand were lovely‚Äîcourteous, friendly and helpful, too. All of them. I needed my shoes polished after walking around in the dust in Paris the previous week. They cleaned them up for me in about 15 minutes. The housekeeping staff helped me resolve an issue before we even checked in. The first play they recommended was one of the best plays we‚Äôve ever seen. When I asked questions about the d√©cor, they told me all kinds of wonderful things about the designers, the art and the awards the hotel has won. Just writing this makes me miss my time there! Bravo Ampersand and thanks for making our trip so wonderful!",5,2014,10,11
129,when in London,you want to stay in peace and quiet yet be a stone's throw from museums and easy tube public transit. The Ampersand fills the bill in all categories. Plenty of neighborhood shops and restaurants to explore. Tube station less than a block away with great connections to wherever you wish to end up. For an added luxurious experience book a junior suite which offers all sorts of additional amenities plus a gorgeous room.,5,2014,10,10
129,Great hotel,"Would highly recommend The Ampersand. So easy to get to and from Heathrow and Tube station is just next to hotel for access into the city.
Staff very friendly and courteous.
Room very clean and bed comfortable although a little small. 
We stay here each time we visit London and would definitely come back again ",5,2014,10,09
129,Wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel,"My husband (his first time in London) and I stayed at the Ampersand for 6 nights in August 2014 at the start of a 6 week Europe holiday. We chose the Superior Double room to give us a little more space. We loved the hotel, close to South Kensington tube station, easy access on the Piccadilly line to Heathrow airport (escalators and a few stairs only). Lots of great restaurants within 5 minutes walk away. Red open top bus stops outside the hotel, and walking distance to all the museums, Kensington Gardens etc. The room was a little on the smaller size but more than adequate for our stay. Bathroom, huge walk in shower and compact but very adequate bathroom. Mini bar refilled free, good wi fi in room. Quiet room and no noise from the street. Windows could open, a bonus. We did have the continental breakfast and although a bit expensive a beautiful spread with unlimited coffee, tea, juices, big variety of cereals etc cold meats and cheeses, fresh fruit and pastries, breads. It set us up for the day and usually managed without lunch until dinner. All of the staff whether reception or restaurant were professional, attentive but unobtrusive. A wonderful stay and will definitely return.",5,2014,10,08
129,Recommendation!,"A really good hotel at a convenient place in South Kensington, right around the corner of good museums, metro, Hyde park, you name it. The value for money is a lot better than what you receive elsewhere.",5,2014,10,08
129,Great experience,"We found the Ampersand Hotel on Tripadvisor and were extremely satisfied. It has a beautiful overall design and very friendly stuff. The rooms had a beautiful interior but were a bit small. The bed was very good and the bathroom well done for a small space.
We only used the drawing room which perfect for coffee and tea and had a great range of cakes and other sweet.
We definetly come again.",5,2014,10,08
129,The best!,"The Ampersand is hands down one of the best hotels in London! It IS quite pricey but it is deffo worth the money! The rooms are beautifully decorated and tres chic! 
The staff are so friendly, I have been back numerous times and have asked for a cheeky upgrade which I always seem to get.
The only thing bad is that the cheaper room are realllly small, it's worth paying a little extra for the bigger rooms.
Location is great, right by the tube and all the museums. Will go back over and over again!",5,2014,10,07
129,Beautiful!,"Amazing staff. So friendly and helpful, without exception. Room was beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean, as was the rest of the hotel. I especially loved the design of the drawing room next to the lobby! The cakes looked amazing, but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try them. Bed was really comfy and there was no noise in the room from the road outside. This was perfect, as I'm quite a light sleeper. 

Location is perfect for Natural History Museum, Science Museum, V&A etc, which are all just a few minutes' walk away. If you want the West End, it's about 5-10 mins on the tube. 

The only criticism I have was the breakfast. We opted for the Continental breakfast, which was quite limited in its options and lacking the quality of the rest of the hotel. But this was a very minor downside to an otherwise excellent stay, and we will be returning again when we next visit London!",5,2014,10,07
129,"I wish this hotel imminent failure, and hopefully subsequent closure","I stay in hotels all over the world for business and for pleasure.  I am not a devotee of ‚Äòluxury hotels‚Äô necessarily and I stay in places of all types of budgets.  I won‚Äôt say that this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at, because that would be a lie.  But I will state, that apart from one other case, this hotel has offered me the worst and most shallow level of service that I have ever experienced.",2,2014,10,07
129,Very Good but Expensive,"My partner and I spent a short break in London and stayed at the Ampersand Hotel
Overall experience was good. The staff were charming and helpful but the room was very small. The bathroom was lacking in storage space but the shower large.
Breakfasts were huge but over priced.",4,2014,10,07

129,Chic and unpretentious ,"First time visitor to London and stayed here for 3 nights.  Was concerned at first that it wasn't located in the usual tourist areas of Westminster, Covent Garden etc. 
My concerns were unfounded. The Ampersand had great access to the tube lines with South Kensington station just across the Hotel.  Having arrived from Paris via the Eurostar,  S Kensington station was on the same line direct from ST Pancras,  which was a plus.

Room was spacious and comfortable. Love the heated bathroom flooring.  A small detail but added to the comfort of the room. Room Switches were all digital. 

Hotel's common areas and restaurants were stylish, well decorated with quirky art touches.  Friendly, unpretentious  and helpful service throughout with a youthful team. Great vibe!",5,2014,10,06

129,Wonderfull Hotel,"We stayed at the Delux room at Ampersand Hotel for 6 nights in August. The room was charming, clean, spacious and comfortable, as were the public areas. Complementary minibar was a nice bonus. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Hotel conveniently located next to South Ken tube station, and numerous bus lines, as wel as a short walking distance from Hyde Park, the V&A, Science and Natural History museums.
After leaving, we realised we had forgotten several items in the room. Those were found by the hotel staff, and promptly sent to our home address in Israel.
Altogether a very pleasant experience at the Ampersand Hotel. We definitely recommend!",5,2014,10,04
129,Perfect in London,"After 10 years we retuned to London, this time with a 9 month old son.
The Ampersand is fantastic for family and for sure for couples. 
The rooms are quite small, but that is a standard in London, don't expect a suite for less than ¬£500 per night.
The amenities in the room are great, good quality and tasty details. All drinks in the mini bar are included and the room has a French press coffee maker that was my morning delight before hitting the streets and tube (station just 50m away from the lobby door) of the city.
Last but not lease the staff was fantastic. In particular Beatriz who managed all our lunch and dinner reservations. 

I definitely recommend to consider the ampersand for your stay in London.

129,Perfect place to stay,"The hotel is beautifully kept, clean and tidy.  The staff are lovely and very helpful.  Some may find the rooms a little small but we were only staying for one night so it was ok.
Food in the Apero is fresh and the breakfast was just perfect.  My friends had continental breakfast included and they were very happy I ate from the menu and it was superb.

A definite recommendation",5,2014,10,03

129,40th Birthday Treat,"A fabulous hotel which whisks you away from the humdrum of the daily grind and pampers you with its gorgeous surroundings and friendly staff.  I booked the hotel as part of a surprise birthday treat for my sister and because it was close to the Natural History Museum.  We both had a lovely time escaping from the children and husbands and enjoying a little contemporary luxury in the heart of London.  Highly recommended.

129,Another excellent stay,"This is the third time I have stayed at The Ampersand, and again it was an excellent experience. The staff are helpful and responsive. Beds are very comfortable. The room is adequate in size and very well equipped. ",5,2014,09,28
129,Pretty good,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in a standard room. The hotel is boutique and tastefully renovated. The location is great, across the road from South Kensignton tube station and walking distance to Hyde Park and lots of museums. 

Despite the good location, our experience was quite disappointing given the price we paid for this hotel. We checked in at night and the staff members were quite confused about the whole check in process. We were then given a room on the first floor at the back of the hotel next to a noisy exhaust fan outside when we specially requested a quiet room on a high floor. The room had a musty smell and was quite dusty in certain areas (in particular the desk and curtains), which made me think it hadn't been cleaned thoroughly. Most of the lights in the room also didn't work and the staff had to come in and out of our room 3 times just to work out what was going on. We were told that they couldn't fix the lights but there were no other rooms available. The next day an electrician just showed up at our door early in the morning to fix the lights - the staff hadn't communicated this to us and it was quite an interruption. 

We were eventually moved to a room on the 5th floor and this was far more pleasant with a bath and view of the natural history museum. The room was next to the lift well so quite nosiy but better than the first room so we didn't complain. 

I think the hotel is still finding its feet and the service certainly needs some work. For the price we paid, we were disappointed and won't be recommending or returning to the hotel.",3,2014,09,28
129,A very special hotel ÔøΩÔøΩ,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Ampersand Hotel for 6 nights in London.  On checking in we found our room to be on a higher floor at the end of the hallway which was lovely & quiet.  The room was decorated beautifully & the bathroom very modern, well appointed & clean.  We did however request some furniture to be removed from the room in order for us to open our 3 suitcases as the room was very small.....(will take note to book a larger room next time).  

This hotel in general is beautiful with amazing decor & artwork.  It has a very homely feel & is in a fantastic location, so close to South Kensington tube station & bus stop....we found it to be the perfect location for exploring London.

We enjoyed dining daily in the breakfast room.  The food was delicious & of a very high standard & the afternoon tea was delightful!

We consider this hotel to be a real 'find' & will definitely return in future.",5,2014,09,27

This hotel has free soft drinks in the mini bar and you can make tea/coffe in the room which is a plus.

129,Beautiful hotel and 2 minute walk to the Tube!,"Wow, this was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at in London!  Spent 3 nights here and had reserved a deluxe studio which was really a nice sized room according to London standards.  Plenty of room to walk around the bed and there was even a bench at the end of the bed.  The furnishings were beautiful and the room was very clean.  Our room was on the 2nd floor and on the back side of the hotel over looking a school of some sort.  It was very quiet during the evenings with the exception of the tube.  The hotel sits right over the South Kensington tube line so you can hear the rumbling of the train coming into or leaving the station (not sure which one).  Once we figured out what the noise was, we had no problem with it.  I would believe the higher floor you are in the hotel, the rumbling should be less or not noticible at all.  

The bathroom was huge with a full size shower and separate tub that you just want to sit in, soak and relax especially after a long day running around town.  Our bathroom also had a TV in it to watch while you were sitting in the tub!  I captured that with a picture.   There was even a little blue Ampersand rubber duck to keep you company in the tub!

The lobby was also decorated nicely and the tea room looked very welcoming but we didn't have time on this trip to enjoy tea.  We will try to have tea on our next trip. 

Would very highly recommend this hotel and if you can confirm your dates ahead of time, pre-pay to save a couple of pounds (dollars to some of us!)  Will definitely be back!",5,2014,09,24
129,Comfortable hotel at a great location for the museums,"The location of the ampersand was great for the museums and the South Kensington tube which connects to the Piccadilly, District and Circle lines. Many shops and restaurants are within walking distance. Overall, it's a good hotel to stay with kids ( they have connecting rooms) and the rooms are comfortable, well kitted out, though a little cramped ( not that we minded too much as we only came back to sleep)",4,2014,09,23
129,Great Location,It certainly lived up to the previous Tripadvisor reviews. Our superior room a bit smaller than anticipated but just big enough. Somewhat on the pricy side for a room only rate. A coffee and a beer in the lobby bar area were very overpriced; but will stay here again.,4,2014,09,23
129,Great position and Hotel,"For a quaint hotel to venture off and explore London, this was ideal for us as a couple, but also for our big group friends who travelled with us. Good location near Tube station, within walking distance of Harrods, Museums and good food. Across the road Muriels Kitchen excellent breakfasts, as did the Hotel, and the recommendation by the doorman to eat at Bumpkins Pub(one street away and 3-4 blocks to the right) was great. Good clean pub atmosphere, food servings and taste sensational.Would definitely stay there again.",4,2014,09,23
129,The Ampersand - A delightful hotel in South Kensington,"Although this was a first time stay I certainly hope it will not be the last.

The staff were friendly and eager to please with nothing too much trouble.  I, and my family, look forward to returning in the not too distant future.",5,2014,09,23
129,Very nice!,"Beautiful hotel, great breakfast (choose from a'la carte or buff√©), polite people. Yes, everything is there! Great location, about 100m from closest Tube station (South Kensington). Can't say much more.",5,2014,09,22

129,Ampersand review,"I've stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed. Great, friendly staff and a fantastic location fro getting quickly to all the notable London sights. The drawing room is lovely and bright and has great ambience.  Unfortunately, the air conditioner may have been faulty on my recent stay as I was unable to cool the room to a comfortable level to sleep.",4,2014,09,21
129,Unbeatable.,"You couldn't ask for more: a staff that will go the extra mile to assure your satisfaction...spacious, beautifully-appointed rooms...an atmosphere that is both lively and luxe...and a two-minute walk to the South Kensington Tube station. Our rooms were thoughtfully equipped with everything you would need for a pampering stay in London. We loved our visit to Ampersand and can't wait to return!

129,"Perfect location, look no further.","I've stayed at The Ampersand several times in the last 12months. It's a fabulous hotel, where staff go out of their way to ensure you a comfortable and relaxing stay. 

This time I was on business in London but the convenience of the hotel to south ken tube station makes this hotel the perfect choice.

With lovely Miller Harris toiletries, well stocked mini bar and lovely restaurant what more could you need!

I was also blown away by the wonderful food at Apero, their restaurant...breakfast and dinners were incredible!!  Thank you to the chef and wonderful waitstaff.",4,2014,09,20
129,Fantastic hotel to explore London,"Really liked the hotel, rooms were nice although small, but perfectly formed. Staff were friendly and helpful. Loved the Apero bar (cocktails were amazing) and the drawing room was delightful. The hotel is in a fantastic location just across the road from the tube station, and only a short walk to Harrods. Would definitely stay again.",4,2014,09,20
129,3 nights in my old hometown- this is an oasis.,"Was pleasantly surprised by the large, bright comfortable room, the hotel located right by Sth Kensington tube station. Excellent staff, reasonable room rate for this quality hotel. Well appointed and finished, free wifi from memory. A few tube stops from the West End , or catch the bus from directly out the front of the hotel. Easy access to LHR. Great area to explore the fabulous museums and parks in London. Local nightlife is high end, with a few bars and clubs, you may spot the odd royal about. This was an oasis from the non stop action that can be London, yet close enough to get right into it within minutes if you so choose. Beautifully decorated. I'd be happy to return. A terrific base to explore London and all its offerings.",5,2014,09,19
129,Amazing Ampersand,"Our group of 8 stayed here for 3 nights & loved every bit of this boutique hotel from the facade, to check in, to rooms & bar it was pure joy but best of all is location. Nestled in South Kensington this property is a short walk to the Natural History Museum, Victoria & Albert, Royal Albert Hall & Harrods. What more could you want! Very clean & very efficient I would highly rate this property & certainly come back. ",5,2014,09,19
129,Well location,This hotel is well located : 5-10 min by step to harrods or 1 min to the underground. The hobby is nice. Rooms are like every hotel in London : SMALL!! But they are very clean and modern and you are not supposed to spend times in the room!! ,4,2014,09,17
129,Basic Furniture not fit for purpose.,"Table and Chair in bedroom is not fit for purpose.Essential business work was painful. Front desk totally ignored my request for help. When I departed, staff suggested I should have paid for a better room.

129,An absolute perfect boutique hotel.,"I have stayed at the Ampersand Hotel now on three occasions and each time I have an absolutely perfect hotel experience. The design of the space, the food and especially the incredible staff make The Ampersand one of my favorite places to be.",5,2014,09,16
129,7 days in London,"We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Friendly helpful staff. Felt like a 'small hotel' more like a boutique than a soulless chain. Room well appointed and comfortable and clean. Housekeeping efficient . Really nice lobby and drawing room area.  Excellent location as  2 mins from South Kensington tube station and is surrounded by caf√©s and food shops. We spent more than we would normally have done but have no other London hotel to compare it with. Would definitely stay again as was worth it.
      ",5,2014,09,16
129,Beautiful property in the heart of the museum district,"Stayed 3 nights in a Deluxe room while on a business trip. Almost regretted it because it was such a lovely hotel I wished I was there with my hubby! Beautifully decorated throughout, from lobby, staircase and corridors to in-room decor, bathrooms and restaurants. Room was nice and quiet with no traffic noise. 

Convenient location. Easy walking distance to tube station and the surrounding museums. Lots of little shops nearby (including a small Tesco for convenience items or food). 

Breakfast a little expensive but reasonable for the quality of food. 

All hotel staff very friendly and helpful, happy to chat whenever you meet them in the corridor or lobby. 

I would come back again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,09,16
129,Absolute luxury!,"We just didn't want to leave! We chose to book the Deluxe room, after reading that the smaller rooms were very very small. Our room was just devine! At check in we requested a room with a bath (to soak after our busy days walking around) and we were delighted when they were able to accommodate our request. Amazing location, and despite being on the ground floor facing the main road, the noise was minimal and didn't disrupt us at all. Staff were always wearing a smile and happy to help with anything. We will definitely stay there again next time we are lucky enough to travel to London!",5,2014,09,15
129,Great location but tiny rooms,"I chose this hotel because of the upscale location and nice photos of the chic decor, the rates were quite reasonable for the area, and I found out why when I checked into my room. The room was so small it would not be possible to open up a large size luggage while in it, and I would not recommend it for 2 person occupancy. The room did not have a full size closet, instead there was this tea-making station that doubled as a half size closet, I suppose you could steam your shirts while boiling water with the kettle. The only good thing about the room was the bathroom, which was clean and well designed. Service was just OK, definitely not at the standard of a luxury hotel - I had to wait a long time to check-in and service was slow at the restaurant.",3,2014,09,14
129,Wheeeeelie Wheeeeeelie good!!,"Having just stayed for one night in London I can safely say that everything at The Ampersand Hotel was top notch. Location was great, the room and bed extremely comfortable, breakfast although just continental 5 star and all the staff ever so friendly üëç I couldn't recommend this hotel enough to anybody staying in London x x",5,2014,09,14
129,A Very Nice Hotel in Central London,"The Ampersand Hotel is very nice. I stayed for 3 nights in September 2014. My room was nice and well appointed, but, as you can expect in London, on the small side. The bathroom as especially small. I loved the fact that the hotel is very quiet and for a light sleeper that I am, I slept great. The bed was very comfy, too. Wifi worked ok and the free stuff in the mini-bar are a nice touch. Also, it is just great that the location is absolutely excellent: subway station very close, many nice restaurants nearby, museums and Harrods just around the corner. Also, if you need to buy provisions such as water or fruit or whatever, there are numerous stores to do that. 
For all the Americans: do not expect to get what you are used to in the States: the rooms are much, much smaller, closets are small, bathrooms are super small. And everything is more expensive. But the hotel itself is very nice, for European standards.",5,2014,09,14
129,One night stay-very comfortable ,"Chic, smart and comfortable. Room was lovely, nice details. Refreshing to stay in a small hotel, excellent service. Breakfast was very good. Location so handy for tube and museums. Would definitely stay again, recommend to anyone wanting a more personal touch ",5,2014,09,13
129,A VERY POOR ARRIVAL EXPERIENCE," Despite a request for an upper floor room when booking 3 months earlier a ground floor room looking out at a bus stop was presented as the only available room.  After indicating that we were not prepared to stay was a quite nice room on the 4th floor eventually found. NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
      
      ",3,2014,09,13
129,Great Stay at the Ampersand!,"Firstly, I would like to say that our overall experience at the Ampersand was excellent. However, when we arrived at the hotel at midday in the middle of a huge down pour after walking from the tube station with all our luggage there wasn't anyone available to open the hotel door or help us lift our luggage up the staircase to the lobby. When we checked in we were sent to the wrong room initially. After that initial inconvenience all services and accommodations were excellent. The international staff was friendly and helpful. Our deluxe double was very comfortable with ample room for two adults to move around and relax. The bathroom was a good size and the water pressure and temperature was good. We were able to take advantage of the summer special rate of 3 nights for the price of 2 so we had a great value. As planned our son moved from a superior double to a single room halfway through our stay. The single room was extremely small with only 2 feet around the bed to move around. Although the hotel does send the room square footage with the reservation we just were not expecting such a framed room for the price. Not such a great value! I would encourage guests who are staying for more than a night or two to book a deluxe double for the extra space. The complimentary mini bar is a great perk! The hotel is convenient to so many things: the tube, museums, Hyde and Kensington parks, palaces, Albert Hall, great restaurants! We walked to many sights and restaurants. The Hop On Hop Off bus stops right in front of the hotel. That was a convenient and a worthwhile activity one day. The ladies at the front desk assisted us in getting the tickets for the day so we could get started as soon as the first bus arrived in the morning. We enjoyed the game room and played ping pong one night. We only ate at the restaurant in the hotel once. It was very tasty.  I would recommend the Ampersand hotel without hesitation!",5,2014,09,11
129,A MOST WONDERFUL HOTEL!,"We just returned from London and staying at the Ampersand Hotel was one of the highlights of our short stay.  We are from Los Angeles and took a chance based on others' reviews and we were not disappointed!  The staff are all incredibly polite, solicitous, knowledgeable and extraordinarily friendly.  Every staff member we encountered was this way.  They are quite an asset to the hotel.

The room is spacious and neat with includes everything a traveler would need, including electricity adapters and a panel where you can plug in any device.  The bathroom floor tiles are heated and make stepping onto the tile much less difficult.  The bed was comfortable and clean, the television works well.  

The afternoon tea is lovely, offering many options, and it feels very civilized to be sitting in the well-lighted room, enjoying a short respite from the day.  And, the business center functions very nicely.

One of the best aspects of this hotel is its location.  It is steps away from the South Kensington tube station, there are restaurants all around, including British pubs, cafes, a French patisserie and other ethic places.  It is a short walk to the Victoria and Albert Museum and a little bit longer walk (but still quite doable) to Knightsbridge and Harrods.  We even walked up to Buckingham Palace without another thought.

My husband and I would most assuredly stay here again.

We loved our stay at the Ampersand.  Thank you, all, for making our three nights so cheerful and lovely.",5,2014,09,10
129,Perfect Stay,"The Ampersand Hotel was a wonderful respite from the crazy days in London. Calm and beautifully decorated, you feel relaxed upon entering. The location is great for getting around the city to most attractions, just a half block to the tube, there were almost always taxis queued up outside and a bus line directly out front. 
Our room was large by London standards, fully equipped with all the amenities we needed and spectacularly well functioning air con. Even complimentary water, juice and soda. Wifi performed quite well in our 4th floor room.
Breakfast was very good with many choices of breads, pastries, fruit, yoghurt and cereal.  An additional extra charge menu is available to order from if you like. 
Employees we encountered were all very friendly and helpful. Our stay as I said..perfect. I could not find a fault in the hotel or service on this stay.",4,2014,09,09
129,Staff & Location Marvelous,"Upon arrival we were able to move into a larger room which meant much as we were staying for 6 nights. All staff were superb and we so appreciated the location with a great many restaurants, caf√©s and South Kensington train station so close. ",5,2014,09,09
129,Great hotel,"This is a lovely hotel with unusual decor and brilliantly situated. It's expensive but no more than you'd expect for Kensington / SW London. Staff very helpful. Great breakfasts. Bathroom a bit narrow but again typical for London and rain shower was great. I'd give it 5 stars but for two things - every item ordered is just marked as room service and date with no idea if it's wine, food, what time etc so easy to get overcharged. Also dinner in Apero was very ordinary, most disappointing meal of our trip - scallops not fresh, duck over cooked, dull tapas, We were rushing out to Kate Bush concert so didn't complain. Would stay again but avoid Apero for dinner anyway.",4,2014,09,09
129,Beautiful hotel in very good location South Kensington,We liked this well designed hotel very much. It lies directly opposite of South Kensington tube station. There are a lot of nice restaurants very near the hotel.The stuff is superfriendly. We got upgrade without asking. Beautiful room.,5,2014,09,09
129,Great Hotel in South Kensington,"Let's begin with positives.  Newly-refurbished in recent years, The Ampersand is a really beautiful property.  The lobby, public rooms, and guest rooms are very nicely designed and richly appointed.  Their website is one of the best I've experienced, giving you the ability to customize your reservation, make a request of the staff, and book a dinner reservation at great list of pre-selected restaurants in the area.  Somehow the booking function doesn't always operate right, but eventually you'll get it.  Our guest room (suite) made a very good impression, and while on the smaller side, was interesting and functional.  On the negative side, the staff at the front desk and in other departments seemed a bit overwhelmed some of the time and had trouble solving rather small requests/issues.  Aside from this, The Ampersand is in a great location, giving guests a rather quick & easy way to visit Harrods, numerous museums, or the Underground to anywhere in London.  In closing, I give some high marks for The Apersand.",4,2014,09,09
129,"Very good hotel, poor wifi.","Very good hotel, poor wifi. Good service, nice room, great bathrooms, excellent restaurant and tea room. Nice three nights for the price of two deal. Great location near South Kensington station. Don't stay if you need good wifi.

129,Very special anniversary break!,"We have just returned from our 1st wedding anniversary break at The Ampersand Hotel and I really cannot sing the praises of this place enough!

As we approached this beautiful, grand hotel in a perfect central location less than a minute from South Kensington tube I knew we'd picked a great hotel and it just kept getting better from the minute we walked in to the lobby area.  The concierge and the staff on reception were so, so friendly and helpful.  It has the feeling of a very smart and luxurious hotel but is very relaxed and friendly.  We were able to check in early and upgraded to a deluxe room for our anniversary - a gorgeous room with beautiful decor and a stunning bathroom complete with an Ampersand rubber duck!  Extremely comfy bed and given that you are in central London we had a very peaceful night's sleep!

It is the little things that make this place, the attention to detail and the personal touches.  On a very sunny, warm weekend in London the complimentary mini bar was very much appreciated!  Everyone in the hotel says hello, from the restaurant staff to the maintenance staff, they all made us feel very welcome.  I cannot find fault with this hotel.  If you get the chance eat in Apero - beautiful food in a lovely setting and very reasonably priced food and drinks.

Thank you so much Ampersand for such a wonderful, romantic and unforgettable anniversary trip!",5,2014,09,08

Nothing but praise. A real five-star experience.

129,"Great boutique hotel, excellent location, lovely atmosphere","I stayed in this hotel upon the recommendation of a friend. As soon as you walk in you know you will be spoiled. There is a very nice cocktail/afternoon tea lounge area, the breakfast area is absolutely amazing with a very new italian style. The rooms are not large but very comfortable and beautifully decorated. It is across from South Kensington tube, and therefore very easy access to Heathrow airport (without having to take that expensive heathrow express train). I will definitely come here more often!",5,2014,09,07
129,First London Visit,"Wonderful location, easy access to tube and bus is right out front. Rooms are small but very luxurious. Beds are wonderful, bathroom was beautiful with great shower, heated floor and great amenities. The staff were all warm and friendly. A few standouts- Alberto Ivars arranged a car last minute from the airport. Istvan was a wonderful first impression helping with luggage and explaining everything about our room. Aline was very helpful at the front desk. Mary and Michael were great waiters. Last but not least Tusi Pi Tsang acted as our concierge, she answered all our questions with a smile,suggested great restaurants and activities. Definitely exceptional customer service. We will be back! ",5,2014,09,05
129,Great hotel in a great location,"I stayed at the Ampersand Hotel from 2 - 12 September 2014. I chose this hotel from other reviews on TripAdvisor but also because of its location. It is 5 minutes from South Kensington tube station which is perfect for direct train trips to all the major attractions.
The area has a great number of restaurants and there is a real international feel to the area with lots of French coffee shops, etc. There are also some great little sandwich shops and a Tesco Express for any groceries.
The hotel is excellent. The design and concept are quite unique and everything seems new and clean. You are greeted by extremely friendly staff, from the concierge through to the receptions staff. I have had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant at the hotel and it was very high quality and good value (for London). The restaurant staff make you feel very welcome and are super efficient. The rooms has a small fridge, safe and new electronic door locks (no more trying to slide that key in the right way up!!)
My room (#318) was at the rear of the building, away from busy Harrington Road, so it was lovely and quite. The room has double windows to reduce the noise, but they also open if you want fresh air. The rooms are not huge, but are a comfortable size and mine had a king size bed. The bathroom is well appointed with a shower that has the largest shower head I have ever seen (perfect after a long days touring).
The daily housekeeping service is also excellent.
The rooms have flat screen TV with a large selection of channels, and the desk contains a series of plugs for USB, Audio/PC, HDMI, etc., so all you audio visual needs are met. The bedside alarm has an iPhone dock (but not a iPhone 5....so I bought my adapter).
The only complaint I have is there is a strange odour which I think is from the air-conditioning (that musty damp smell), but with the window open it is not really an issue.
I could not find any laundromats in the area and the fee that the hotel charges for laundry is quite exorbitant, so if you are travelling for a long time or have family....keep this in mind.
I would definitely come back here and would recommend it to anyone who asks!",4,2014,09,05
129,Superb service! Great central location!,"We had a great stay at the Ampersand, the room was clean and new with excellent staff at the check-in.  The breakfast room was great and cosy.  The location was very near to the South Kensington tube station which was very convenient.  ",4,2014,09,03

129,Charming Hotel in a Great Location,"I first stayed at the Ampersand in March and enjoyed it so much that I booked it again when I returned to London in August. The hotel itself is a small, charming boutique hotel with great d√©cor. The single and double rooms can be quite small, but they mention that in the room descriptions. The Superior rooms are perfect.

The location is fantastic! Steps from several museums and a 5-10 minute walk to Hyde Park. I have had lunch and dinner at Apero and both were excellent.

I highly recommend The Ampersand. You can't beat the quality, location or price!",5,2014,09,02

It is just steps from the underground so it feels centrally located, yet on a quiet street.  The best amenity the hotel offers is its staff, who are wonderfully accommodating and friendly.  The food in the restaurant was delicious, and a drink and dessert in the Drawing Room was the perfect end to out last long day of sightseeing.  I highly recommend The Ampersand.",4,2014,09,02

The a entities at the hotel were excellent.  I used the gym everyday and the kids liked playing ping pong in the Library and Game rooms.  It is extremely well located practically right next to the South Kensington tube station.  The front desk was extremely accommodating making several dinner reservations for us.  Every place they recommended was excellent.  The service from the Drawing room to the front desk was excellent.

Friendly staff and service from hotel staff and extremely helpful to our needs and requests. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and free mini bar and Nespresso in Studios is a first in my life! Overall an excellent hotel and I would give two thumbs up!,5,2014,08,30
129,Above and beyond all expectations,"I booked during a promotion period that enabled us to get a room at this stunning modern hotel for a tiny fraction of the price one would need to fork out for other places in South Kensington. The location is fantastic - the tube station is about 100m away, boujis (the club) is practically next door and all the big museums and parks are within short walking distance. The service was also incredible, thanks to professional, knowledgeable staff. We stayed in two different suites, of which we preferred the first one on the second floor as it was more spacious, but both were sparkling clean and tastefully decorated. I've been recommending this hotel to all of my friends travelling to London with excitement.",5,2014,08,29

Our room was stuffy as air/con was not working properly, but we were given an excellent complimentary breakfast.",5,2014,08,29
129,Not suitable for holiday travellers,"My wife and I booked a Deluxe room as it was described as ""Space to relax."" We were initially offered a wheelchair access room on the ground floor, which was reasonably spacious, but there was a tiny robe and few draws. No sooner than we had unpacked we became conscious of the constant rumble of trains from the tube below and it was clear that sleep would be difficult, so requested a change of room. The staff were very obliging and offered a 2nd floor room, which was very cramped and we certainly did not have the ‚Äúspace to relax‚Äù one would expect in a Deluxe room. I questioned whether it was indeed a Deluxe room and was assured that this room was the same as all the Deluxe rooms in the hotel with the exception of the wheelchair access room on the ground floor. The robe was even smaller and there were no draws. The bathroom was tiny. We reluctantly accepted it as there was no other choice and although we could still hear the underground, it was tolerable.

We had been travelling for several weeks on holidays and had several large pieces of luggage. As there was nowhere to put anything, we had to live out of our suitcases constantly falling over them and each other. We are seasoned travellers and are aware that hotel rooms in some European countries can be quite small, so always opt for ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù category of room to gain adequate space. The room we were offered at the Ampersand was completely misrepresented as deluxe and totally unsuitable for holiday travellers with anything other than very limited luggage and little requirement for wardrobe space or draws.

I also mention that Internet access was offered as a free service. However, it was highly intermittent with regular dropouts. I reported this to reception and they promptly sent someone to look at the problem. He agreed that there was a problem, so the system was rebooted to no effect. At this point, I gave up and decided that I was here to enjoy myself rather than endlessly persevering with their faulty Wi-Fi internet access.

Finally, I should mention that the hotel staff were very helpful and obliging. However, I couldn't possibly recommend this hotel based on our experience.",1,2014,08,28
129,Odd design choices,"This was a very stylish hotel, but not very practical. The kettle was in the small wardrobe and couldn't be used while also hanging clothing. The bathroom door wouldn't open all the way. There didn't seem to be a way to turn down (or off) the heated bathroom floors which were too hot for our tastes. The room was small for the price, even by London standards; it made opening our two suitcases very difficult while still being able to walk past the bed. While it didn't bother us, the Tube runs nearby and causes a near constant rumble and rattle of the room. 

While I'm glad we stayed closer to Heathrow on our departure day than downtown London, I would otherwise probably not return to this hotel simply because of the above-listed ill-considered design choices.",3,2014,08,28
129,Good but expensive,"Excellent location, nice decoration, great staff but very expensive comparison to same class hotels.Rooms are small and they are not perfectly organized, it was hard to find a mirror for make up or to find a place for ironing.

129,Great venue - lovely lunch,"Super venue near the tube and ideal for business meetings - very smart and quiet. Lunch was very generous with the most amazing sea bream, saffron risotto and super tomato salad (the tomatoes were really ripe and tasty). Great food and good service.",5,2014,08,27
129,Happy Couple,"Excellent location in South Kensington and good tips from the hotel personnel for evening restaurants and other locations. I recommend this hotel to short weekend trips or even loger stay in London. 

Breakfast should be inclueded to the SLH rate!!!

129,Exceeded expectations,"Everything about this hotel is wonderful. The location is perfect, the stylish decor adds to the wow factor, the staff are all extremely helpful, the beds are luxuriously comfortable, the bathrooms are well kitted out, the wi-fi is good and there is fresh milk in the fridge.",5,2014,08,27
129,great hotel in a great location,"stayed here for 3 nights with our 2 year old daughter. we were upgraded to a larger room so that there was more room with a cot, which was very nice of the staff. overall the rooms are very nice, staff very helpful and food is good. location wise couldn't be better.",5,2014,08,26
129,Wedding Night,"We spent the night of our wedding here and were very happy with our choice. We were treated to a free glass of champagne and were upgraded to a deluxe room which was very nice. The room & bathroom were lovely, the staff very welcoming and the breakfast delicious. An excellent hotel.",5,2014,08,25
129,excellent hotel,"the Ampersandare out hotel takes hospitality to a new level. Staff is very welcoming an make you feel right at home.
allthough the building is older the interior is very modern with prestine clean rooms that are outfitted with everything a traveler would need.there's even an umbrella availeble because 'well it's London""as the receptionist who showed us our room told us :) . the underground station is just across the street so access to the rest of London is very good. the area of Kensington is rich in restaurants and bars, the hotel has two very good restaurants of his own. the Natural history museum, sience museum, Victoria & Albert museum and the Royal Albert hall are all a mere 10 minutes walk away.",5,2014,08,24
129,"Beautiful Hotel, highly recommended","My partner and I stayed here on a Saturday night whilst attending a friends wedding nearby.  The hotel allowed us to check in early (subject to availability) so that we didn't have to travel in our wedding clobber as the ceremony was due to start at 12:00.  Had our room not been available early they had also offered the use of the downstairs bathroom in which to change - and they would have kept hold of our bags until our room was ready.  This is proactively good customer service which we were really pleased with. 

Every part of the hotel we saw was decorated beautifully and still in immaculate condition since it's refurb a couple of years ago.  Room service was efficient, tasty, and not overpriced.  One of the lighting circuits in our room was not working but they sent someone to investigate within 10 minutes of my pointing it out.  

The only, very minor, detraction was that the shower was thermostatically controlled to only allow you a nominal temperature determined by the British Health and Safety police to be ""safe"".  I'm becoming resigned to British hotels being forced to include this feature so didn't mention anything until we checked out - had I mentioned something earlier it turns out that they could have removed the restriction!     

All in all, the food, staff and hotel itself were of a really high standard and I would be very happy to recommend the hotel to both my friends, and to my business colleagues.",5,2014,08,24
129,great location and lovely staff,"Just come back from an overnight say at The Ampersand while attending the Royal Albert hall. Staff very friendly and helpful, room smart, well equipped and spotlessly clean. Book through Mr and Mrs Smith website and you will get 2 free glasses of champagne and a box of petit fours! we went for a Deluxe room, having read that lower class rooms are very small. If you can I would try not to book a room below this grade, as even for 1 night we found our room on the small side. It was very well equipped though, plenty of storage space VERY comfortable bed and nice touch of tea and coffee facilities with proper milk in the fridge, and free soft drinks in the mini bar.
We had our free champagne in the Apero up at the bar at 6pm, which was buzzing and pleasant. However when we came back at 10 pm for dinner after our show, we found it rather quiet and the service a bit rushed. That said the food was very nice. We did not have breakfast, but on the ground floor by reception was a lovely room that served afternoon tea that looked scrumptious, and seems to be doing light breakfast too. I think a bigger breakfast available in the Apero, or on room service.Very convenient for Royal Albert Hall, South Kensington and all the museums. Would definitely recommend, and would stay again if in the area. To note we were on 2nd floor and there was some soft rumble of the tube that must go under the hotel. Ask for a higher floor room if you think this would bother you.",5,2014,08,23
129,The quite centre of London,"This was my fourth visit to London and my fourth stay at Ampersand. The shops and cafe's nearby give it a local neighbourhood feel and the tube station ensures you can get anywhere in London within minutes. Tip: Go see the 'book of mormon' play, it's brilliant",5,2014,08,22
129,Great Location,Perfect location and lovely staff make this boutique hotel a good choice. Our room was at the back of the hotel so no view but nice and quiet. The hotel is spotlessly clean and has a fresh pleasant decor. London hotel rooms tend to be small so for the price I think the room size is what I had expected. The bathroom was tiny but I recommend this hotel and be happy to return.,5,2014,08,22
129,Nice visit.,"Our first trip to London and had a great trip. We arrived on Aug 10 and there was a bike race that closed the streets near the hotel. Our car service could only get a few blocks away so a staff member met us at the car and walked us to the hotel. It was also raining and he brought along umbrellas for us. He also pointed out some restaurants along the way that we tried and were very satisfied. The rooms were clean, updated and had plenty of space. It is very close to the Underground so there is a slight rumble of the trains but never bothered us. Very good location.",5,2014,08,20
129,The Amazing Ampersand!,"We just returned from a week-long stay at The Ampersand--truly an extraordinarily gracious hotel! The location was excellent, the room lovely, comfortable, and immaculate--and the small touches luxurious. The mini refrigerator was stocked with cold drinks and cookies always awaited us each day. Yet these all paled in comparison to the cordial and knowledgeable staff--without exception, each fulfilled our every request with good cheer. We would be delighted to return to this stress-free and delightful gem.",5,2014,08,20

129,Very nice hotel in a great location,"I stayed at the Ampersand for a couple of nights in July and I was very impressed by the hotel. There is a general feeling of class about the place and it's obvious a great amount of care is taken to make the right impression. The location is spot on in terms of what is in the near vicinity, such as South Kensington tube station, museums and dining options. The walk into central London is also very pleasant and manageable.

Check-in at the hotel was speedy and welcoming. I did have a small double room booked but I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and see it was the next room type up. It was spacious enough and had a very boutique feeling, which is the hotels I tend to go for. Everything was spotless and not in the slightest worn looking. It's always a nice touch when the mini-bar is complimentary too. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,19
129,pretty darn good,our deluxe room was beautiful and the bed was good.  We could hear the trains in the tube but it didn't bother me.  I found being this close to an underground station so darn convenient.  The surrounding area is amazing.  My only complaint was some very loud people moved into the unit upstairs and made a ton of noise.  it was like having elephants overhead.  The hotel offered to move us but we didn't want to have to repack everything so we went and got earplugs.  I wish they had left 2 coffee packages since there were 2 of us and we fought over who got to have it each morning.,4,2014,08,19
129,Hollidays,"Very nice h√¥tel, good situation near The South Kensigton stop Tube. The room are veriy nice, mine was a liitle bit small but the bed was very comfortable. The doors √† very heavy and they make a lot of noise when closing.

129,Close to perfect,"We had three nights at The Ampersand while treating ourselves to the Proms. We were driving into London and the staff were exceptionally helpful in advance in providing advice on parking - they will valet park your car (London parking is expensive of course but for us it was an expense we were prepared to pay). The hotel is also well located so we were able to get around by tube and/or walking for most of the things we wanted to do. We had a larger double room which was very nicely appointed though not large (so I figure the standard doubles would be quite small). Small but perfectly designed bathroom. Great shower, bathrobes, fluffy towels, and excellent selection of toiletries and bathroom related goodies. The staff were brilliant and willing to help at all times. Although the hotel is not cheap, it does fall into the 'reasonable' price bracket for what is a very good London hotel.",5,2014,08,18
129,Charming and Quaint,"We recently stayed at The Ampersand Hotel during our holiday vacation in August.  The location is ideal.  We hopped on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow and within 40 minutes we were at The Ampersand.  The hotel is just a 2 minute walk from the South Kensington tube station; perfect location for vacationers like myself.  We were immediately greeted by the staff with a warm hello.  They checked us in quickly and showed us to our room.  The valet gave us a brief overview of all of our amenities and quietly made himself scarce. The Ampersand is listed as a small luxury hotel and it didn't disappoint.  The rooms were spacious, clean and modern.  The beds were comfortable, bathrooms were large and the minibar was complimentary!

AND that's just the start of it.  I can't say enough about the staff.  Right from the beginning they were very friendly and helpful. At any given moment, they were eager to assist with our daily needs.  We were interested in a hop-on, hop-off tour (we had too!), they immediately gave us recommendations.  Turn out, the blue line of the Original Tour stopped right in front of the hotel.  We were interested in having tea in the charming little tea room of the hotel, but were apprehensive because we were traveling with a 10 year old with egg and nut allergies, 7 year old with a nut allergy and an energetic 3 year old.  However, we wanted the children to have the full experience of an English Tea.  The team immediately put us at ease.  They assured us it wouldn't be a problem and let the chef know about the allergies.  On the day of our tea, they immediately welcomed us and we didn't have to remind them of the allergies.  They went out of their way to let us know of the pastries that didn't have eggs or nuts.  I also ran into the chef outside of the tea room and she made it a point to ask how everything was.  It doesn't get any better than that.

All in all, with the fabulous location, superb customer service, and charming decor... The Ampersand Hotel comes highly recommended by me.  I am looking forward to my next London visit and staying at The Ampersand Hotel once again.",5,2014,08,18
129,Can't say it's the best hotel in the world but it's definitely my Favourite!!,"I don't usually write reviews but this hotel deserves a huge thanks to the beautiful design, atmosphere, and amazingly friendly staff.

129,Simply Marvelous!,"Simply marvelous! From the room to the service to the meals, this was a really special stay.

129,Fabulous.,"I loved this hotel. Having a quiet solo break in London. Arrived early in the morning and was delighted when my room was ready. It was a beautiful double room, loved the dark furniture and solar system wall. Bathroom was gorgeous with a drench shower. Towels and robes in great condition. Toiletries, a loofah and eye make up remover wipes were all great touches. 
The location, right next to South Kensington underground, is perfect. I had room service one evening and also ate brunch in Apero. Food was excellent in both cases. Service was relaxed and friendly. 
It is a treat to stay here, reflected in the price, but worth every penny.",5,2014,08,15
129,Love!,"We LOVED our stay at the Ampersand! Location is perfect to feel close to everything, but out of the tourist trap. The rooms are gorgeous - comfy beds and linens, large bathroom.  Plentiful amenities (from a complimentary mini bar with sodas and shortbread to a shoe shine kit) were much appreciated!  Staff is really helpful and friendly, and the Drawing Room on site was the perfect spot for a cocktail or tea. Only complaint is that I loved the hotel so much, it was hard to force myself out for sightseeing!

Arriving late on Friday afternoon we were able to take advantage of the late opening at the museum which is only a short walk away.
Choice of breakfast suited us well---it is good to be able to choose and pay for what you fancy rather than an all in charge for items you may not want.
The proximity to tube station made sightseeing really easy.
After busy days it was lovely to return to the calm oasis of the Ampersand with beautiful flowers and a personal atmosphere.
Having not visited London for nearly thirty years I am hoping to be able to return to the Ampersand very soon to do some more exploring and enjoy the treat which awaits at the Ampersand",5,2014,08,13
129,Always a pleasure to stay...,"n the well known district of South Ken, this is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for a classic British style hotel with a fresh touch of design.
The hotel is located 2 min walking from the tube station, very handy if you are reaching the city centre from Heathrow airport with the Piccadilly line.
The rooms are very clean, stylish and design for fitting all what you need during your stay, whether it is for pleasure or business. The bathroom are very chic with many more amenities than standards and displayed in a very posh way.

The staff are very friendly and helpful at all times. Highly recommended",5,2014,08,13
129,Stylish and Freindly,"We stayed overnight at the Ampersand for our Wedding Anniversary. Our Room had been upgraded without any request from us and the greeting at Reception was prompt, efficient and Friendly.

Too many Hotels in London think they are doing you a favour letting you stay at their overpriced abode. The Ampersand is a a reasonable price in comparison to most London Hotels and in my view gives value for money.
Our Room was really nice (215), the location is good for the Tube and the staff are great.
Good experience all round for us.",5,2014,08,13
129,Very welcoming,"This hotel visit was a gift from family and we were not let down. The roomsmaw was small but perfectly formed.

Rooms were of a very generous size. Good value for money for the price.
Staff were excellent. Very friendly and helpful.
Loved the lounge area on the ground floor. Perfect for hosting a business meeting.
Location was also excellent. South Kensington (or now considered 'Little France') right next to the tube. Lots of great French cafes/restaurants next to the hotel.
The only slightly bad experience was eating lunch at Apero. Took ages for lunch to arrive. Mine came first (lukewarm) and my friends salad took another 10mins to arrive. Something went wrong at the kitchen - but wasn't acknowledged. Hasn't put me off trying again at the restaurant because the rest of the hotel experience was excellent.",5,2014,08,13

The rooms are classic with modern touches and have everything you need. Seriously. I wanted for nothing. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bath towels plentiful. It was a treat to have coffee in that big bed and read the paper each morning. The complimentary mini bar had real milk! Did I mention the heated bathroom floor tiles? The neighborhood is vibrant, but not overly noisy and the tube station is a minute away. My room was quiet, but one of the things I loved was the very gentle rumble of the underground as I dozed off at night and woke up in the morning. I miss the beautiful Ampersand. ",5,2014,08,11

129,Really enjoyable stay,"A friend recommended The Ampersand and I'm so pleased they did. We booked for 3 nights in a deluxe studio room.  

The hotel was just across the road from the South Kensington tube in a vibrant area full of all sorts of shops and eateries. Really good position. 

The room was lovely. A good size with a huge, comfy, bed and as well as the dressing table area, a small sofa and table to the side. The room had all the features I would expect and more. A large TV, safe, free wifi, tea tray and a separate coffee machine. A fridge with complimentary water, juice and real milk. 

The bathroom had a huge shower, bath with TV and all manner of bathroom accessories (loofa mit, shampoos, etc). The decor is really lovely both in the room and the hotel overall.  

We had breakfast and tried the continental and cooked. Both were lovely with loads of choice. I was blown away by the vegetarian cooked.  Husband said the full English cooked was also very good. The food was clearly really high quality both in terms of raw ingredients and how it was cooked. Little things impressed me, in particular, the butter pats were individually wrapped in grease proof, not those catering pats which are often given. The butter also was really creamy and rich!  

The staff were all really helpful and lovely to talk to. Really friendly people. We would definitely recommend the hotel and look forward to staying here again in the future.",5,2014,08,10
129,service & style,"thrilled to find real milk in the room ( it doesn't take much to please!), great location - walked to many places, room quite small but nice to have a ground floor room. staff terrific, would definitely stay again. Also, if in town would use the restaurant - lunch only ¬£12 for 2 courses.",5,2014,08,10
129,Enjoyable 1 night stay,"We stopped last night so we didn't have a late night trek  home after a late prom. On this occasion we had a ground floor room  which is geared up for the disabled guest. The room was spacious although the bathroom layout was not great. We had petit four and a free glass of champagne  on arrival which we took in the bar downstairs. We returned to the bar for cocktails post prom - bar staff are friendly and helpful and they always have an excellent choice of  spirits and cocktails to choose from. 
The bed was very comfy and I had a great nights sleep. 
For me , the best bit of a stay at the ampersand is the continental breakfast from the counter. All the food is home made and the banana bread is delicious. The choices are  good and just that bit different from your average breakfast buffet. The only trouble is I am tempted to eat too much.
I love the  location of this hotel  and undoubtedly we will stop again.",5,2014,08,09
129,Definitely Not a Five Star Hotel,"We stayed at the Ampersand having travelled to London from Australia.  We wanted to stay in Kensington and were looking forward to a high class stay.  The Ampersand was a disappointment.  The service was average - we were offered no assistance with carrying our luggage and no real guidance as to where to head to in the city.  The rooms were smaller than small. I am 5ft 2 and tiny and my partner is average height and build and we couldn't fit into the bathroom together.  There was barely enough space for our luggage in the bedroom.  The hotel also advertises as having a gym but this was also very small.  The location is ok but is isn't near the tourist sights.  We return to London a week late and stayed at the County Plaza Hotel near the London eye - it was a 4 star hotel but was amazing! Perfect views, spacious rooms, tidy, modern and a great gym!",3,2014,08,09
129,Bed & Afternoon Tea,"I booked this hotel for a night as I had tickets for a show at the nearby Royal Albert Hall.
As a treat I also booked the Afternoon Tea.

The tea was delicious although there was so much of it that I had a moment when I thought it might defeat me. I struggled on and won over in the end. 

The hotel itself is fantastic: sleek and comfortable, staff helpful and charming, room was spotlessly clean as was the bathroom. Ideal position for not only the Royal Albert Hall but also the museums. The price was very reasonable for a London hotel of this standard.

I hope to stay here again and would wholeheartedly recommend it to those still undecided.",4,2014,08,09
129,"Great Location, Great Stay","We recently stayed in the Ampersand and enjoyed it so much we booked again for our return trip via London.

Pros:

- Exceptionally professional, helpful, welcoming and sincere staff.  We've stayed in many hotels in London (4 and 5 stars) and truly feel Ampersand provided the best service by far
- Fantastic location: very close to South Kensington tube station, restaurants, bars, museums etc.  There is even a taxi stand and bus stop outside the hotel entrance
- Nicely designed hotel both in the public spaces and in the room
- Very very comfortable bed 
- Good and powerful rain shower
- Free minibar 
- Free and fast wifi (in room and in the public areas)
- Quick room service and competitively priced hotel laundry service 
- The price represented good value for money

Cons:

- The booking website does not make it easy to see the special offers / best rates (must read carefully and click the + icon to expand / show the various options).  I foolishly booked a high rate but had no issue at all cancelling and amending the booking to a more competitive rate",5,2014,08,09

I felt welcomed before I even get there! Took care all our tour and theatre tickets reservations. Very enjoyable stay!!,4,2014,08,07
129,An amazing stay,"Sorry, it has taken me a while to write this review.

We stayed in June for our anniversary as a rare break away from our two young children. The staff were so warm & welcoming with none of the stuffiness expected of Central London hotels (my husband really liked the shirt with jeans & apron attire/uniform for the eateries). We were upgraded from the superior into a Deluxe room at no extra cost, which was lovely. To be honest all the rooms as does the hotel look beautiful. Really great location across from South Kensington tube and to the museums and enabled us to have an evening out in the city. The minibar was fully stocked & complimentary and the petit fours were delicious.

We ate at both Apero and The Drawing Rooms, which were amazing and a real treat. The extra touch at the tearoom was lovely as they gave us a little extra dessert with Congratulations on and as part of our booking we got a complimentary glass of champagne - wonderful!

The room itself was furnished well: comfortable, luxurious yet practical. Staff couldn't do enough and if we needed anything they arranged it immediately ie needing fridge restocking, ironing board etc.

We utilised the games room and the library too, which was great too.

The only downside is that we had to leave. Thank you again x",5,2014,08,07
129,Had everything we wanted,"I was very skeptical at the high ratings & great location. Fortunately it all reached the reviews. Other than the room being smaller than in the pictures, the thought put into everything made a wonderful stay. 
Bathroom: heated floor, speakers of what's playing on the TV in the other room, and eye makeup remover (first I've seen. Very helpful) among the usual complimentary items.
Bedroom: thoughtful lighting, many outlets, wonderful wifi (both a room wifi with password and the general wifi).
Hotel: a corner away from a bunch of adorable great breakfast-friendly caf√©s that feel like an extension of the hotel. Very friendly staff, walking distance from museums and tube station, and generally adorable. Husband was satisfied with gym, which had the necessities. ",5,2014,08,06
129,"Beautiful, unique and lovely","We stayed in a deluxe studio which was perfect, i would be put off by some of the smaller rooms though, we walked past one that was TINY! But with such reasonable prices for central London you can go for a bigger room. 
The staff were lovely, the hotel was beautiful and felt really personal and unique. A true boutique hotel. The location was great, the restaurant and cake room were also brilliant. An unexpectedly great meal in the restaurant!
Little touches like the fact that the mini bar was free and they leave biscuits out every day probably made it get 5 stars. I would return if you are looking for something unique and without the impersonal feel of some of the big hotels in London.",5,2014,08,06
129,Brilliant,"Excellent Hotel! Laid back feel to the place with great styling. The staff were brilliant and friendly. 
We could bring our dog also without feeling guilty or that we were annoying anyone. In fact, I think everyone liked the dog there! 
      ",5,2014,08,06
129,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"We booked mainly due to the hotel's proximity to the NHM and Science Museum. Only two minutes away from the museums and handy for the tube and lots of local eateries. From the start the service was superb. Helpful and friendly. The hotel itself is nicely decorated. Not my style but smart in a contemporary manner. The room was quiet and we'll equipped with space for an extra bed for our 4 year old. Supper in the restaurant was fab, sharing menu and a very good bottle of wine. Breakfast was also good with a good range of buffet items and avoided that usual tired look of breakfast items you see at many hotels. It's hard to think of any faults. My only niggle was the automatic service charge for the restaurant, a pet hate of mine. We'll definitely be back again soon! ",5,2014,08,06
129,Carmen's thoughts,"The Ampersand hotel is in a great location.  The South Kensington train station is across the street, you can take the District line or the Piccadilly line which are central lines in London.   The area has many restaurants within walking distance.  Walking any time day or night I felt safe.   The Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum are a block away.  The city bus line stops right in front of the hotel, you can also pick up the Tourist double decker busses at the end of the street.
The hotel is very clean and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  I would go back to this location again. 
",5,2014,08,05
129,Pleasant hotel,"Well located across the road from Sth Kensington tube - nicely appointed with very attentive staff.
Breakfast/restaurant area downstairs is good and the breakfasts are delicious - staff there are great
Rooms are very nicely decorated in a mix of classic and contemporary British style - basic rooms are a little small - take the next size up if you don't like tripping over your suitcase in the room.
Plenty of cabs right outside the front door - lovely sitting room off the lobby serving full afternoon teas or quiet if you prefer to sit and read",4,2014,08,05
129,Fabulous hotel,"This Ampersand Hotel is just fabulous. It's in a great location right near the South Kensington station and a short walk to the museums. The room we choose was the Deluxe Double and it was luxurious. It was more spacious than we expected, had beautiful d√©cor and the king size bed was very comfortable.  We were lucky enough to be on the fifth floor where the rooms have balconies. There are free sodas and water in the mini bar, which are replenished daily. The staff was so nice, smiling every time we passed through the lobby and enthusiastically helped us with any requests we made. We also had the chance to enjoy afternoon tea in the Drawing Room. We loved everything about the Ampersand would love to stay there again in the future.",5,2014,08,03
129,Great hotel!,"After a three week trip around Europe staying in hostels The Ampersand was a perfect way to finish! The staff were so friendly and welcoming and hotel itself was absolutely gorgeous. Our room was lovely and included a complimentary minibar. 
The bathroom was spacious, clean and had beautiful soaps and toiletries provided. You feel like you are a million miles away in a cute England village when you are only a 10min tube away from busy London. ",5,2014,08,03
129,A fantastic experience,"We have just enjoyed a wonderful luxurious break at the Ampersand Hotel. The staff were all lovely, offering a friendly, attentive and unpretentious service. The hotel is beautifully decorated, and we really appreciated being offered an upgrade to a junior suite on our arrival, which gave us a huge room with an enormous and incredibly comfortable bed, massive shower, bath and much-appreciated tea, coffee and soft drinks in the room.  We enjoyed an excellent breakfast and afternoon tea.  The hotel is in a great spot for exploring London. Already saving up for our next visit.",5,2014,08,02
129,Good location to explore London,"Our room was very quiet, as requested, with the exception of the occasional rumble from the Tube. No view, but that was not a priority. Staff is friendly and cooperative. A big plus is the location a few steps from South Kensington station and several restaurants. 
      ",5,2014,08,01
129,Exquisite!,"Little did I know when I booked this hotel on Booking.com that I was saving the best hotel of my month in England and France for my last night.  It is a terrific location just steps from the South Kensington tube station on the Paddington line. 

The name appealed: &. And the decor is really clever and modern. The rooms are comfortable and plenty large for two people. The bathroom is so comfortable although the taps took some figuring out. The wifi was super convenient plus they had a business center for printing boarding pass. Some boutique hotels leave this service out. 

The tea room upstairs and the restaurant downstairs for breakfast were both perfect and Didi provided above and beyond service. Plus there was a complimentary Diet Coke in the minibar.

Service throughout was excellent. A+ for our stay.

The walking and shopping is first rate in the neighborhood. We took the tube to the Theater (with the early emails we asked the Concierge to get tickets to War Horse for us and Voila!) Also convenient to see Buckingham Palace via tube.

It is more spendy than my usual but I am so glad I dipped in. Saved money by taking tube to Heathrow.",5,2014,08,01
129,The best place to stay in London,We had a wonderful stay in London because of our choice of the Ampersand hotel.  It's located right by the tube stop of South Kensington.  We loved every minute at the hotel.  We will stay there again for sure!!!!,5,2014,08,01
129,The perfect location to enjoy the best of London,"A stylishly low-key hotel; friendly, welcoming and discreet staff make you feel instantly at home. Beautifully decorated and appointed rooms provide all that you'll need. Great location; close by the South Ken tube station, so easy connections to virtually all that you'd want to visit. Also enjoyably close to Kensington, Knightsbridge etc by foot. A great choice, thoroughly recommended.",5,2014,08,01
129,Neat and trendy,"Lovely d√©cor, excellently positioned, attentive service.

However do avoid rooms on the first floor if possible. As with many old buildings in London, I could feel the trains arriving into the station. ",5,2014,07,31
129,Perfect weekend bolt hole,Great location by South Ken underground. Modern stylish hotel in an old building. Staff friendly and efficient . Room very small but comfortable with plenty of nice touches. Bed comfortable and hotel pretty quiet so a good nights sleep. Bathroom had a great shower and nice toiletries,5,2014,07,30
129,Excellent stay,"Great hotel, wonderful,capable staff, and excellent location. We had great service in every respect. Good food and quiet at night. Right by a good tube stop and near good restaurants. Highly recommended. 
      ",5,2014,07,29
129,Amazing 5 star hotel,"Stayed at The Ampersand Hotel last night for a well deserved mom's weekend with my very special friend Lucy with no kids. Lovely hotel and also in a great location, we had an amazing room on the 3rd floor in room 316 and had dinner and drinks at Apero which was superb, lots of yummy food and delicious wine. Also had a great breakfast in the morning even though we were running late.
It's a must stay for anyone.We will be back soon for another stay. Can't wait to go back.",5,2014,07,27
129,Greetings and gifts,"Someone is at the door to greet you almost every time you come in to the hotel.   Free drinks  in the mini-frig and a free treat everyday make for a nice welcome.   Many excellent places to eat nearby make this a great spot to stay.   Very easy access to Heathrow via the Piccadilly Line.  Was worried about the noise reported by other reviewers, but found it was no problem at all.  (And we were on the 2nd floor.)  Would definitely stay there again!",5,2014,07,27
129,Great experience,"We stayed in a larger double and truly enjoyed our time. The staff was very helpful, the room was clean, and we really enjoyed the small details such as the loofas and bath products, water and soda in room, and available tea cakes in the lounge. We thought the location in South Kensington was an excellent balance for a neighborhood feel with easy access from Heathrow/the tube. We also enjoyed our one morning exploring Kensington Gardens, which was an easy walk away. ",5,2014,07,25
129,First-class London hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for six nights and couldn't be happier. The hotel is pleasant and beautifully decorated. The rooms are stylish and very well appointed and the hotel service is impeccable.  The staff was extremely responsive to our needs and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and Indira, at the front desk, even brought us champagne to celebrate. The location is perfect...just a few minutes walk from the South Kensington tube station. The neighborhood has lots of shops and restaurants and several major museums are right around the corner. It is a great neighborhood in which to stay and a great hotel to stay in. We will definitely be back. ",5,2014,07,25
129,"Great Hotel, great location...","Very nice and comfortable hotel and very friendly staff - the ""design"" was fun and not in your face. Location is great for all arriving from Heathrow and wanting to explore downtown. Not cheap but well worth while the price
      
      
      
      ",5,2014,07,25
129,Our home away from home,"I should qualify that. The Ampersand is much nicer than our home. I want to live here. So I stay here every time we come to London. The staff is so friendly I feel like I have friends right here in the city. The design is so top notch that every where I look I have a reason to smile. We stayed in room 217 this time, which was larger than our room on the ground floor last time. It was our most comfortable bed of the entire trip. We had a great nights rest and a lovely breakfast in the morning.",5,2014,07,23
129,1st London Visit,"The room was larger than I expected.  The decor is clean and modern-love the tap to unlock. The free cold beverages are a very nice touch.  The bathroom was lovely, with robes to use. , with robes to use.",5,2014,07,22
129,A South Kensington Gem,"We stayed at the Ampersand from July 9-13, and what a wonderful stay it was! The hotel is spotless and beautifully decorated, with themes of botany, music, ornithology and astronomy reflected all through the rooms and public area--the hotel has so much character!. I have visited several highly-rated London hotels over the years, and I have to say that the Ampersand is my favorite. Although the rooms were a bit small, the beds were super-comfortable, and there were great amenities in the bathrooms--little personalized cloth bags containing everything a traveller could need. There were robes and slippers as well. The location is fantastic--right by the South Kensington tube station,and within walking distance of many sights including Harrod's, the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and many more. There are lots of good restaurants in the area as well. Room service was amazingly quick, and breakfast downstairs at the Apero restaurant was very good as well. One of the most significant things to me as a tourist was the fact that every member of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and answered all of our questions--and if they didn't have an answer, they researched until they found one. I would highly recommend The Ampersand and when I (hopefully) can get back to London, I can't wait to visit again!",5,2014,07,21
129,Good,"Very good hotel, we visited it for the second time, and wish to stay here next time!
We travelled with four children (12 - 17). We asked for twin rooms for them, but  they were not available. The beds in the double rooms were too small for two (tall) boys. Twin rooms were available but only for an additional charge of 180 euros for two nights (one room). Besides the size of the rooms and beds the hotel exceeded all our expectations!
      ",4,2014,07,20
129,Stylish hotel,"Lovely hotel, in a great location: is 3 minutes far from South Kensington undergound and 10 minutes walking from V&A Museum and National Science Museum ( free entrance). 
Design room, with complimentary miny bar and many amenities in the bathroom, also good free wifi.
The staff is young and friendly, all public spaces are elegant and beautiful appointed.
Very good breakfast, withnhealthy choices.
Is a member of Small Luxury Hotel.
We will definetely come back.",5,2014,07,20
129,Hard to beat British Boutique,"Just a minute from South Kensington tube (terribly easy on the PIccadilly line) and a stone's throw to a variety of decent places to eat at. No ready doorman to help with luggage up some stairs but check in was a breeze, the front desk utterly charming and an upgrade with SLH most welcome. Rooms are small but pretty typical for such London boutique establishments. Having a champagne night cap in a deserted fancy lounge was not quite the expected manner with which to conclude a pleasant day in the capital but a good sleep was had then on to the next adventure.",4,2014,07,20
129,Perfect,"Everything was excellent and the bed was so comfy! It was my husbands 50th birthday and they informed us that they had upgraded our room to a deluxe, which was a lovely room. Would love to stay here again in the future.
      
      ",5,2014,07,18
129,Great Stay! Great Location!,"My wife and I walked passed the Ampersand one day and looked inside and thought we have to stay there some time, so we did.
The hotel's interior and rooms are amazing, the bed is to die for and makes it hard to wake up in the morning. i think they must use some sort of 1 million thread count sheets because they were the softest sheets i've ever felt. The hotel is positioned pretty much directly across from South Kensington underground and this made getting anywhere very easy. If this hotel is within your budget and you don't stay here, then you must be crazy!",5,2014,07,17
129,Great stay,"We've become to enjoy staying in South Kensington when in London. The Ampersand has the perfect location in the area, by the South Kensington station. The hotel is very comfortable and decorated in a lovely way. Highlights: wonderful beds with a proper duvet, clean bathrooms, a small but free mini-bar, lovely lounge. Will definately come back!",5,2014,07,17
129,"Location, location, location","Hotel is close to Underground South Kensington, to museums and Hyde Park. Many restaurants around. Very friendly personnel. Rooms are small, but ok. Shower was not hot and hairdrying without a mirror an experiment.
 We booked breakfast with the room. Unfortunately this option is very limited in choice. Whatever is beyond, which is even eggs, is an extra. 
      ",4,2014,07,16
129,Great choice for leisure travel,"We stayed for three nights on a winter-break in top-floor suite (as SLH member got an upgrade). It was (too) short but (very) sweet and enjoyable experience. Service and the overall atmosphere does make a difference for this place. Prepare to be pampered all the way from the moment you make reservation through prompt follow-up after your stay. You really get a feeling that they do care for each and every guest. It's not exactly the same as in those small family-owned hotels, this one is not a small place but they manage to balance it out in a way that is likely to positively surprise you (at least it did surprise us). Everything else adds to positive experience - very convenient location for tube (just across from South Kensington station), Albert Hall and museums, combination of traditional with modern, thoughtful and detailed interior, comfy furnishings in the room, tiny but romantic roof balcony, huge bathroom, option to get books from in-house library, even umbrellas are 'special' etc.etc. An epitome of ‚Äòattention to detail‚Äô.
If you stay here and have warm feelings for Italian / Mediterranean type of food do not miss-out on their restaurant Apero - good menu, original cocktails and reasonable pricing. Note, however, that this a 'democratic' and popular place which tends to get crowded, so not the best choice if you plan for romantic quiet dinner on your own :)",5,2014,07,16
129,Great experience in South Kensington!,"We found the location, ambience and service at the Ampersand terrific! While the room was a little small, it was well-appointed, clean and comfortable. Great gym as well!  Would definitely recommend to friends and will certainly stay there again in the future.
      ",5,2014,07,16
129,Luxurious comfort and an excellent location,"Just a stone's throw from South Kensington Underground lays the Ampersand Hotel. I took my wife here as part of a wedding anniversary treat which included a Jazz Brunch and an evening concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very polite man who offered to carry our case and escorted us to the check in desk. Check in was uncomplicated, and then we were taken to our room, where we were given a guided tour of the room and facilities.

The room was air conditioned, which was handy as it was a very humid day. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was spotlessly clean. The mini bar had complimentary soft drinks and water, and there were even complimentary slippers and a rubber duck too!

When I booked the hotel through Bookings.com they stated that the breakfast was continental and ¬£14.50 per head, this isnt true as there is a full breakfast menu available including a full English for ¬£12.50. Following a deep and restful sleep, we decided to take breakfast the next morning. I had the full English and my wife the vegetarian. Both were excellent, freshly cooked and using quality ingredients. The only downside was that coffee and juice are not included in the price of the breakfast.

Cost for the night in a standard deluxe was ¬£216 excluding breakfast ‚Äì not that expensive for this part of London and worth every penny!",5,2014,07,16
129,Lovely night away,"Great restaurant and bar, friendly staff, good location and extremely comfy beds! 
A lovely relaxed London hotel! 
Would certainly recommend Ampersand to stay or return to visit ' Apero' restaurant for brunch, lunch, dinner, afternoon tea and the bar! ",5,2014,07,15
129,A day to remember,"After a lot of research I selected the Ampersand Hotel for a very important occasion - a school reunion for a group of twenty ladies, many of whom had not seen one another for forty years. Many hotels in London provide an elegant afternoon tea, but the Ampersand was the only venue that would enable us to enjoy a three hour long get-together in the privacy of a private room. From the start of making arrangements by email with Francesca, everything with smoothly and nothing was too much trouble. On Saturday 12th July 2014 I and nineteen ""old girls"" met for a very special reunion tea. We had attended school in Johannesburg, South Africa all those years ago and now we were meeting in London, Some of the ladies flew in for the occasion from as far afield as Australia, the United States and South Africa so it was important to me that the reunion event was something memorable and indeed it exceeded expectations. The savoury open sandwiches were freshly prepared, tasty and plentiful; the scones, served with jam and clotted cream, were still warm when they arrived piled up on beautiful crockery. The pastry selection was fabulous and presenting the pastries in our school colours was a stroke of genius. My request for gluten free food was handled graciously and my food items were brought in on separate plates but no less beautifully presented. At all times the staff members were attentive and unfailingly friendly and polite. The afternoon was relaxed and unhurried and while we could have reminisced about our school days almost anywhere in London, I am so glad we chose to do so at the Ampersand. It made a wonderful day even more special and even more memorable. I look forward to visiting the hotel again and would certainly recommend it if you are looking for an elegant yet contemporary, friendly venue in London.",5,2014,07,14
129,"Excellent comfort & location, but some technical issues","We chose the Ampersand for our 6-night stay in London last week.  Upon arrival at 9:15 AM, after a long transatlantic flight, our room was not ready - something we had expected. However, the reception staff gladly gave us a call later that morning to tell us that the room was ready. This was appreciated.  

The location of Ampersand is excellent, with the South Kensington Tube Station about 100 meters away, the V&A and Natural History museums a 5-minute walk away, and numerous restaurants nearby. The pedestrianized Exhibition Road, in particular, has many good places for breakfast, such as Comptoir Libanais and Pain Quotidien. It is also a very good place for people-watching!

We had booked a Deluxe Double room, a good decision since the smaller rooms at the Ampersand (called Superior Doubles and Standard Doubles) are small. We were initially given room 221, a quiet room at the back of the hotel. It was comfortable and well appointed. The view was limited, however.  More significantly, the fan in the bathroom was not functional, which meant a lot of fog and humidity after every shower. A technical staff member was quickly dispatched. We were told that, this being Sunday, we would have to wait until the following day to have the problem taken care of. The following day, the problem was apparently complex enough for the Hotel to offer to relocate us. So we moved to room 208, a brighter and altogether more pleasant room on the same floor but facing Harrington Road. Street noise was noticeable, but this never prevented us from sleeping. Nor did the occasional rumble from the tube apparently passing underneath.  However, if you suspect this might be an issue for you, it might be preferable to ask for a room at the back or at the sides.

Despite the technical issues (including heated floors that apparently did not heat - in either of our two rooms), we enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand. The level of comfort is very high. The decor is stylish and pleasant, especially in the Drawing Rooms, where we enjoyed an excellent afternoon tea on our last day. Above all, the location is superb.

Staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2014,07,14
129,"Great location, boutique hotel","Right next to South Kensington Tube station- fabulous location. Small, clean, great service, price is not bad considering. Walk to museums, Hyde Park, Harrods, etc. Rooms are a little small, but they offer King size beds, great amenities for the price. 
      ",4,2014,07,14
129,Perfect except for one fatal flaw,"Everything about this hotel -- the staff, the location, the decor, the rooms, the food -- was terrific, except for one fatal flaw: the internet connection was unusable because it was so erratic and slow. If it weren't for this problem, the Ampersand Hotel would be my ""go to"" hotel for my frequent trips to London.  It's such a shame.  The staff work so hard and are so friendly and skilled, and so much expert care has clearly gone into the design of the public spaces and rooms.  However, because my colleagues and I couldn't reliably connect to email or browse relatively simple websites, we don't think we will return. If anyone hears that this problem has been resolved, please post it here.  If this problem were fixed, I would gladly give the hotel 5 stars.",2,2014,07,14
129,Fantastic!,"One of the best hotel experiences I've had. Will certainly return! We reserved and standard room and staff member found us a slightly larger room due to our 6 night stay- greatly appreciated.  Staff was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  Great location.

129,Luxurious Charm & Comfort,"This gem of hospitality is in the perfect location for accessing all of London's delights. Luxurious rooms, complimentary minibar and even a rubber ducky in the tub made this stay exquisite. Decent fitness facility and friendly staff.

129,The Ampersand Hotel,"We stayed at The Ampersand Hotel May 21 to May 26.  It is a beautiful, modern, upscale hotel with excellent service.  The staff are wonderful and always ready to help.  We were in Room 410 which faced the rear of the building.  The room was adequate in size with a King Size bed, couch at the foot of the bed, a desk, a wardrobe with a safe and shelves.  There was an area by the door with shelves, a refrigerator, coffee/tea service.  The bathroom was very nice with the heated floor, stall shower with great pressure and hand held shower and plenty of hot water.  There were many amenities like robes and slippers, and shampoos and lotions, etc. as well as a stocked refrigerator with waters, soft drinks, milk and cookies.  The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well.  The Drawing Room in the Lobby was a lovely place to sit and have a snack, drinks, tea and to relax.  We ate in Apero twice.  The food was delicious and the service was outstanding.  We will certainly return to this hotel next time we visit London.",5,2014,07,11
129,MEMORABLE WIMBLEDON STAY!,"What a fabulous experience at a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff!
We booked this hotel as my 13 year old daughter and I were in London to attend 2 days at Wimbledon and were looking for a luxury hotel with easy access to South Kensington tube station.
This hotel exceeded our expectations, from the excellent service response times when we made the initial booking from Sydney, Australia, to the easy check-in experience. 
We had made a special request to be on a higher floor, facing the street, and this request was accommodated with a gorgeous room with balcony overlooking the London rooftops!
We wish to thank the very responsive and helpful staff, particularly at check-in and breakfast, and would definitely stay there again.
Stay here for a truly authentic London experience.",5,2014,07,11

I meant to write my review much earlier.I visit London quite often both on business and leisure.This boutique hotel is going to be the one I always stay in. It meets everything a travellor or someone on business would wish for . Great location ,exceptionally courteous and well informed staff.
Comfortable rooms ,well equipped , even down to an umbrella!",5,2014,07,08
129,Extraordinary,"This is our first experience with this hotel, but it did offer us the luxury, warm and friendly expectations, though an upgrade was not made possible allegedly due to non-availability. We were allocated a double room on the 3rd floor with part of city view, but open to a primary school. Fortunately, sufficient insulation to school activities is put in place on all windows.
It's worthy to note that the Apero restaurant is wonderful especially the manager Anthonio, who made us feel at home and served with the best Italian cuisines we ever taste.
 My compliments to him and his fleet of chefs and staff, who contributed significantly in making us a fantastic stay there and recording a remarkable memory in our whole journey to London.",4,2014,07,08
129,London Weekend,"Fantastic stay in a fabulous hotel. Wish we had stayed longer. Great location with easy access to the tube station. The staff were both friendly and knowledgable.

129,No better place to stay...,"Stayed for 10 days with my daughter. Basically, everything was perfect. Room, cleanliness, decor, comfy beds, great location, wonderful friendly staff. Classy but not at all stuffy, easy access to the tube",5,2014,07,08
129,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on a trip to Wimbledon. The location was excellent with south kensington tube literally across the road. There are lots of eateries in the immediate area serving a great variety of food and drink. It's a nice area and all the major museums are just a walk away.

The hotel itself is very stylish as are the rooms which were immaculate. All the staff we met were professional and friendly, helping us with maps, directions etc. 

We used Apero, their restaurant, for cocktails in the evening and for breakfast in the morning. Both times the staff were friendly and efficient and the breakfast was ample with extra coffee refills.

We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone going to London.",5,2014,07,06
129,It's Like Home,"Excellent Hotel in one of the best location in London, South Kensington. Next to the Metro station and in front of a Bus Stop, both connected with the best destinations in London city. At our Arrival, we have been welcomed by an excellent Afternoon Tea (our lunch and dinner together) with Top Quality sandwiches and marvellous pastries and cakes. We drank the best tea of our lives in the beautiful tea room at the Hotel. Service is on top given by a very friendly and helpful staff. The Room was little but very clean, the Bed extremely comfortable and the towels smelled very good (a rare thing for an Hotel). What more could I say? It's like Home!",5,2014,07,06
129,Great Boutique Hotel in South Kensington,"The reviews are spot on. Lovely little boutique hotel! Pros: very clean and attractive decor, very attentive staff, lovely tea room, excellent restaurant (the porridge at breakfast was superb), only 100 yards to the tube station. Cons: unless you want to go to the museums nearby, the location is good but not great; while the bed was great, I didn't care for the pillows; the shower is very large by London standards but the temperature controls were confusing; not a lot of really good restaurants within walking distance but we did find a good Thai place nearby. We also stayed at the St. Ermin's and found these two hotels very comparable. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2014,07,06
129,Little gem in South Kensington.,"Chose this hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor and the location.  Lived up to our expectations.  Location, decor, ambience, staff, room and breakfast were all great.  Would liked to have stayed for longer, so we will be back !",5,2014,07,05
129,Superb boutique hotel in South Kensington!,"Superb boutique hotel in South Kensington! The staff was excellent, the room was surprisingly large and impeccable, and the insanely close location to the tube made our trip to London an unparalleled experience!! Definitely a hotel to use again!! We loved the personal touches of the postcards!! ",5,2014,07,05
129,THE place to stay in London,"A 1 minute walk to the nearest Tube station and very close proximity to all of London's main shopping/dining/cultural sites,the location of this hotel is one of the items of a very long list of reasons to stay here.
   On a recent trip to London as an engagement present,my dad paid for us to spend our one night in London at this hotel. Even though we arrived well before the advertised check in time,we were given immediate access to our Superior (upgraded) room. The decor is unique,the bed so comfy you might never want to leave and the heated tiles in the bathroom are that little something else that makes this hotel stand out from your other luxury hotels I have stayed in.
  Thoroughly enjoyed the continental breakfast - excellent range and quality produce,only downside was that I got full before I could try everything I wanted to!
   Both myself and my fiancee are tall so the upgrade to the Superior room was much appreciated as this would still have been on the small side if we had more than an overnight bag. 
 All in all would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a trip to London. Very,very impressed.
  The hotel is directly over an underground station so at times you get the rumble as a train passes underneath but this didn't bother us at all during our stay",5,2014,07,05
129,Very convenient for museums and tube,"We went to London for our anniversary in December. Check in was quick and easy. The room was a good size and nicely decorated (i think a deluxe room, one with the bird prints on the wall). The bathroom was nice and modern with a powerful, large shower head that I loved. 
Our rate did not include breakfast but there are lots of places to pick something up beside the tube station which is very close by - maybe a 2 minute walk. We visited Paul cafe one day and another independent cafe for a cooked breakfast another day. There are a couple of nice restaurants on the pedestrian street beside the tube station, including a tapas one where we ate dinner one evening and would recommend.
We chose the hotel as we wanted to visit the museums and Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park. We were able to walk to the Natural History, Victoria and Albert and Science Museum within 5 minutes and we also walked up to Hyde Park from the hotel too which took around 15 minutes.
We did not use any of the hotel's bars/ restaurants so can not comment on service there but we wanted to extend our stay by one night and the staff on the reception desk were very friendly and helpful. 
It is not a cheap hotel, but it was worth the money for the service,  quality, modern, luxury feel inside and the location. However it is a shame to spend so much money on such a lovely hotel and then spend all day and evening elsewhere out and about sightseeing! 
Only scored down on sleep quality as it is an old building and there are a few creaks and noises (particularly one like pipes from inside the wall near the bed) that disturbed me as I am a light sleeper.",5,2014,07,04
129,london 2014,"The Ampersand is located in the fantastic Kensington area.   You have easy access to parks, museums, great restaurants, and tube stations.  Staff was extremely nice, and tea room is lovely.
The only caveat is that the standard room is a tight squeeze for 2 people.  The dimensions are posted on the Ampersand site but when you factor in luggage + bed space, there is barely any room left.

129,Very rewarding,"I especially commend the reception staff, with an extra plus to Indira and Izabel.
      The hotel's location is very, very good, as I already knew from previous experiences in nearby lodgings.
I found prices somewhat high for my budget limitations - but overall I think it was worthwhile.",5,2014,07,03

129,Excellent Hotel!,"I stayed in a spacious Deluxe Studio with a comfortable king size bed & in-room bath.  Beautifully decorated, very clean.  Delicious food, reasonably priced, thoughtful touches.  Great stay!  Well done &!  ",5,2014,06,29
129,An excellent hotel,The Ampersand is a trendy - but unpretentious - hotel. The interior design is fashionable and the room was also well designed although very very small for two people! However it made use of the space in a practical manner which tied in with the overall design of the hotel - the breakfast room is down in the old cellar so all available space in the building is used. The staff are very very friendly and accommodating and go out of their way to help. I note that some other reviewers have mentioned noise - I specifically asked for a higher up room because of this and we were on the third floor and I got a good nights sleep. Also our room was very hot and you cannot open the window and the air con made it really cold so it was difficult to get a happy medium but these are just small gripes considering and it hasn't stopped me giving the hotel an overall Excellent rating.,5,2014,06,28
129,Boutique Hotel,"After a long flight from Australia we didn't have to wait long before our quiet and comfortable room was ready.  Thank you to the staff for speeding that along. The hotel is in a great location right next to South Kensington tube and a beautiful walk up to Kensington High Street.  I would recommend the Ampersand for that little bit of luxury. Thank you!

129,"Well-done boutique hotel, but several critical drawbacks","I previously lived in South Kensington, so I enjoy the location of Ampersand very much.  It's right in the middle of South Kensignton, close to Knightsbridge.  It's also right across from the South Kensington station, though I have found that many of the rooms in the hotel tremble when the train is passing - it's quite noticeable and hard to sleep!  I have stayed in the hotel a few times, and the rooms are very modern, well done and clean.  However, the difference between the smaller room and the larger one is huge!  The smaller rooms do not even have room to properly hang closes or anywhere to place large luggage.  Many of the rooms are also right next to the lift, and the lift makes loud mechanical noises!  I would only stay here again if I were guaranteed a room far from the lift.  Overall, the hotel is well-done, though the amenities are not are good as a ""full service"" hotel, which I would probably prefer for the price.",3,2014,06,26
129,A Nice Stay,"We recently stayed at the Ampersand prior to leaving on a cruise from Southampton. The location was very good. Near museums, food, Tube. The rooms are small (as expected in Europe), but very nice. The bathroom was spotless, the bed comfortable. The only negative was some noise from outside. Didn't keep me awake, but I could definitely hear people reveling outside. I would stay there again.",4,2014,06,26
129,Modern and unpretentious,"My wife and I stayed at the Ampersand for three nights in mid-March of 2014 when we visited our niece who was studying abroad in London. We took a Deluxe Studio room with a rollaway so our niece could stay with us if she wanted.

Every aspect of our Ampersand experience: from making the arrangements by email; to the location; the room, amenities, and common areas; and the friendly and helpful staff -- was absolutely wonderful.

We had hoped to find a small, stylish hotel in a central location that was still comfortable -- and that's exactly what we got. The Ampersand is modern without being pretentious, with original art and thoughtful design  everywhere: from the multi-story lighting in the stairwell; to the round leather seating in the lower lobby; the fabric and visuals in the tea room; and the incredible breakfast area! It's just a really nice place to be.

Our guest room was comfortable in every possible way with plenty of design touches of it's own (like a tiny hidden bookshelf with just five books on it), and the bathroom (sorry, the ""toilet"" ;-) -- oh my! Oh, and there is no charge for items from the mini bar -- one more small example of the Ampersand's class and good taste.

The staff were friendly, helpful and professional at every turn -- including making an excellent restaurant recommendation (and reservation). And the location is hard to beat, with the South Kensington tube station one short block away.

The Ampersand is not an inexpensive hotel, but it is easily worth every penny. I know where I'll be staying the next (and every) time I'm in London.",5,2014,06,24
129,A 5 star 4 star hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Ampersand. The staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful but not cloying. I don't think of this as a pretentious 5 star place that nickels and dimes you for every small amenity. There is free wi fi and some free nonalcoholic drinks provided in the guest fridge. There's a paper at the door in the morning. The light fixture in the stairwell is arty and classy. My superior room was small but comfy. There were nice touches like a robe and slippers. 
There are public rooms available such  as a library, bar and game room. I love the South Kensington location. Step out the door and there are buses, cross the street and you are at the Piccadilly and Circle line stops. Close to the Natural History Museum, the V&A, the Science Museum, Harrods and more nice shopping and restaurants than you will have time for. 
I hope to return.",5,2014,06,23
129,Luxury & Comfort,"Beautifully decorated and well appointed room (travel adapter, robes,minibar,newspaper etc). The hotel is in a great location & close to everything. Staff were very friendly & helpful. Highly recommended.",5,2014,06,23
129,Perfect for our Anniversary weekend,"Me and my husband wanted something a bit special for our anniversary and the Ampersand definitely did not disappoint. The decor is lovely, the staff are so friendly and helpful and the little extra touches helped make it very special. We booked through small hotels and we were treated to champagne on arrival and a small box of sweet treats as a welcome gift. The room was spacious and the bed possibly the most comfortable I have stayed on in a hotel. The small bits to make up the extras in the room went beyond the usual 'vanity kit' and nice touches such as a loofah mit and a Ampersand rubber duck made us smile. 
It is of course in a fantastic location being so close to South Ken station and also right near the museum district. It is fab just to wander round this area anyway and if you don't want to be cooped up if it is a sunny day (it can happen!) then Hyde Park is an easy walk up Queensgate too.

If I had one potential thing for people to be aware of I suppose it would be that if you are an incredibly light sleeper then you may get woken once the tubes start up in the morning as you can feel them through the building, but this caused no grievance for us. With such a wonderful bed we slept very well!",5,2014,06,22
129,Everything was wonderful,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic.  We arrived by taxi and immediately someone was there to help with out luggage.  Check in was very efficient and our deluxe studio room was fantastic.  Very spacious with a large bathroom (with heated floor and choice of two shower heads) and very stylish.  The extra large bed was so comfortable I didn't want to leave it.  They have very thoughtfully provided all sorts of amenities such as bathrobes, hidden safe, power points for charging phones etc., nespresso machine as well as a regular jug, and even bathroom scales.  The location just a short walk from South Kensington Station as well and near museums and gardens is ideal for a first time visitor to London.  I would definately stay here again.",5,2014,06,21
129,Can't wait to return. An oasis among the hustle and bustle.,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my teen son.  Room was very clean, and well appointed for such a small space. Staff was excellent, friendly and helpful every time.  Jogging is just a few blocks away at Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.  Bank ATM just next door.  Tube not a block away.  Museums within two blocks.  This place had everything.  The gym was very small, but the equipment was well cared for.  Wifi reception was always good.  Not one complaint.  Can't wait to return.

129,Good value for London,"We stayed here in June for 4 nights with our 12 year old daughter. The hotel location is fantastic. There are many nice restaurants and great shopping in the area. It is on a busy road so you do hear a bit of the city sounds, but hey, you are in the middle of London. The room was spacious, the bed very comfortable. Only the additional bed for our daughter was terrible. It was almost impossible to sleep on, you could feel each and very spring through the thin mattress. At 42 Pounds a day for the extra bed, not nice. Otherwise the room was very nicely furnished with lots of extras, converter, cosmetic mirror, Nespresso machine, lots of TV channels, a nice big flatscreen, plenty of nice bath amenities. The staff was friendly and helpful. This is for sure a very good option for London, the location and value are excellent. Oh yes, also Apero the restaurant is very good.",4,2014,06,16

I had moved the tissue box to accomodate my things to another shelf and it was not moved back which was good as I didn't have to keep moving things around.

129,Exceeded expectations,"It's rare to find accommodation in London that combines style, comfort and fun, and so it was that I was delighted from the moment I stepped into the Ampersand. 

The walk from South Kensington Underground station took all of two minutes (and this was because the pedestrian lights were red) and the welcome from porter and desk clerk was 100%, plus smiles.

Public areas vary in design, which makes a wander around the hotel a journey in itself. The restaurant downstairs is understated and natural, while the Library/ Games Room is a peaceful escape if you have an hour free. 

Corridors are wide, clean and even interesting thanks to some inspired wallpaper, and the rooms are superb, spacious and modern, right down to the glowing blue light on the electronic card swipe to enter. 

Huge, comfortable bed, perfectly proportioned bathroom, a nice wide desk should a spot of work need to be done and a good, fast, free internet connection.

We had a breakfast included that was more than expected, continental but with croissants out of the oven right there. The hotel seems to have many business clients but for a couple vacationing... perfect too. The Drawing room in the front was also a nice addition, a lovely tea on our last afternoon.

Firstly location, just a couple of minutes walk to South Kensington tube station, restaurants and museums on the doorstep, a pleasant stroll to Knightsbridge.   The rooms, uber cool, yet traditional, a very clever combination of style and quality, not lacking in any amenity.  Dining, informal breakfast, bistro evening, all handed to you with quiet confidence.  Ordering theatre tickets, receiving your post, finding you a glass of wine - nothing was too much trouble and if you want to be treated as though you are a treasured guest in your own home well this place is for you.

Great location near Hyde park and has tube, bus bike hire and taxis all on doorstep. The tube runs underneath but we were on top floor so not an issue.cant really find a fault",5,2014,05,28
129,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Ampersand as a weekend treat; and a treat is what it was. The room and the hotel itself was excellent although we did not use all the facilities including the bar - which looked great on their site. As advertised, the afternoon tea was very good. Of particular note - and as mentioned by a number of reviewers - the staff were lovely. Helpful and welcoming without being overbearing or overattentive.",5,2014,05,27
129,Beautiful hotel but watch out for 3.15% charge for converting Stg to Euro,"The hotel was beautiful.  Great location.  Room 121 (a double delux) was quiet and quite spacious.  Lovely underfloor heating in the bathroom.  Bed very comfortable.  Breakfast was a delight.  Service was excellent.  The only issue was the 3.15% charge to convert Stg to Euro. There was no mention of this charge when I was asked which currency I wanted to use.  My mistake perhaps ??!! But even so it would be good policy to make sure the guest is made aware.

129,Would highly recomment,"I actually can't find any fault with the hotel, myself and my mums visit was flawless. It has a small hotel feel right in the centre of London. The staff are friendly without being over the top, the rooms are modern yet comfortable. The interior has been carefully thought out and it is a really relaxing space. Some really cool features in every room. Would highly recommend.",5,2014,05,27
129,Ideal for Chelsea show,"We enjoyed a 3 night stay here. Great location, helpful staff and the comfiest bed ever! Room at the back so no view therefore overpriced, but quiet.
Opposite S Kensington tube station, easy to get around London.

129,Cool and comfy London stay,"We stayed at the Ampersand on the last leg of our two week honeymoon for 3 nights. While we started out a bit rough, by the end of our stay we were regretting not being able to stay another night. Our first evening, we checked in late and grabbed dinner at the restaurant downstairs. Our room on the first night was on the 5th floor and was larger than we expected, but we had some AC issues and we had to call the front desk at 3 am because we were both laying awake from the heat. The front desk brought up a desk fan and told us they may be able to relocate us the following day. Sure enough, when we visited the front desk the following day they were happy to arrange a different room for us and offered to move our luggage while we were out. The decor is great, the beds are super comfy and the bathrooms are well stocked. While our second room was a bit smaller - we didn't have the room cleaned for 2 nights because we couldn't imagine housekeeping cleaning amidst all of our luggage - the view out of the large, street-facing window was a step up from the previous room. We didn't experience any hall or street noise and were overall very happy with our stay. Very convenient location - tube stop is across the street, museums are 5 minutes away, and shopping is very convenient. Great hotel and can't wait to visit again next time we're in London!",4,2014,05,26
129,superb afternoon Tea experience,"I had a guest from Zurich who wanted to have Afternoon Tea. I was recommended the Ampersand hotel by a good friend. I reserved the  Chelsea Flower Show Afternoon Tea. We were not disappointed at all. The hotel staff on arrival welcomed us warmly, rescued our very wet umbrellas and outerwear and secreted them away safely to allow us to enjoy our tea. The hotel d√©cor is fresh, clean and consists of a lot of indivisual pieces which all maacth up well. Very tastefully done... The Drawing rooms where we had our tea is a lovley space, but the seating is managed in such a way that no guests are in in each other's space. Perfect to be able to chat and enjoy my firend's company without realising they were other people in the room. The staff, were very very helpful and accommodating but wonderfully inobtrusive. The young waiter who looked after  us was very charming and attentive to all our requests. We had the  Chelsea Flower Show Afternoon Tea, so well done. The intricate details of all the individual petit fours which created the show piece was quiet something!  So creative. It was a montage of a spring garden with green grass and earth made from pastry goods, plus the violet macaroons. Almost too beautiful to eat!!! The scones were whit chocolate and perfectly made - light as a feather.. We had a thoroughly pleasant afternoon and I will be back, and happily recommend it to friends.",5,2014,05,26
129,great location and wonderful rooms,"The Ampersand is well located in South Kensington, near an Underground station and many buslines.   One can walk to many good restaurants and to the museums near Kensington gardens.  Harrods is not too far away.   The rooms have triple glazing on the windows so noise from outside is not an issue.  The hotel was obviously recently renovated and the rooms are very livable.  One touch that we appreciated was the complimentary minibar with cold water and soft drinks. The excellent wifi is also complimentary. ",5,2014,05,24
129,"Chelsea Flower Show Afternoon Tea at the Drawing Rooms, Ampersand Hotel","An amazing afternoon tea experience.  I had heard good reviews about afternoon tea at the Ampersand so was concerned that it wouldn't live up to my expectations but it did! I took my husband as a surprise and we both totally loved it.  When we arrived we were impressed immediately with the decor of the hotel.  Contemporary, stylish and quirky.  We were seated in a great position on very luxurious chairs and away from others.  Sometimes i find afternoon teas too crowded so was very pleased that we had privacy in the large spacious room.  The decor was beautiful.  We were particularly take with the artwork by Georgia Fiennes, a local artist who paints beautiful quirky animal prints in cocktail glasses, a unique quirky concept.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Although we don't eat meat, we didn't want to go for the vegetarian menu because I liked the look of the Chelsea Flower Show theme so we asked if we could have that less the meat and we were told that of course this would not be a problem.  The actual tea was delicious.  I had the ""rare afternoon tea"".  My only criticism (and is a very minor one) is that once our tea was brought, the waiter forgot the strainer and didn't come back again for too long so I had to ask another waiter for strainers.  He brought them and was very apologetic, so really not a big issue.  The food was lovely and fresh.  The sandwiches were actually savoury gougeres which were light and beautifully filled.  The scone was made with white chocolate and was really nice.  I don't like Chelsea buns but my husband ate both of ours and said they were delicious.  For the sweets (my favourite part) we had a green tea, jasmine blossom and ginger bread garden, a violet macaroon, a raspberry and rose layered cake and an elderflower rice pudding with rhubarb compote.  The cakes looked devine and tasted good.  Head chef Ji Sun Shin has done an amazing job.  We would certainly recommend this afternoon tea and will definitely go back again for another themed tea.",5,2014,05,24
129,not on the 0 floor!,"At my first visit at the hotel i stayed in superior room on the 4th floor. It was great. But this time i stayed in an ordinary room on the 0 floor (room number 014). It was awful. I'm light sleeper and there was noise all the night from somewhere so i didn't sleep all the night. The noise looked like somebody dropped smth constantly. Also the room had awful view. In the morning we were moved to other room (321) with not bad view. It's the closest room to the lift and you can hear lift working. It's not very noisy. There was no noise at nights but cleaners started working in the early morning so again it was not great for me. I advise you to book a superior room. The staff is very friendly and polite. We got room with breakfast included. But this breakfast is not very good since it doesn't include any hot food (like omelette for example). We ordered a la carte. Be aware that the earlier you come to restaurant for breakfast the better everything will be done. After 09:00 approximately a lot of people came for breakfast and the waitresses failed to serve in time. The last day we were waiting for a omelette for a long time and cancelled the order as a result. Come for breakfast earlier! The hotel is great. Location is very convenient. There are two parks near the hotel. There is a metro two minutes walk from the hotel.
P.S. I paid 200 pounds approximately for the breakfast (which was buffet, not a la carte). As far as i understood it was not the complimentary one although i'm a member of Small Luxury Hotels and such a benefit is authorized.",4,2014,05,24
129,"Great Hotel, good location a little noisy","We stayed here and chose a superior room.  It was very very nicely decorated, furnishings and bathroom were excellent and very comfortable bed.  We liked the complimentary soft drinks and fresh milk in the fridge especially as we had been on the go all day and needed a rest before going out for the evening.  Our room was on the ground floor and although very good it was rather noisy from, we can only think, was the air conditioning as it continued all night.  Worth a mention is that we were rather underwhelmed by the Apero for breakfast although the restaurant is furnished beautifully.

We will stay here again but ask for a quieter room higher up.",4,2014,05,24
129,"beautiful hotel, excellent service, great food","My daughter and I stayed at the Ampersand May 19-21. It is a beautiful boutique hotel, perfect scale for comfort and personal service. Continental breakfast was more like Italian than English-- cured meats, interesting cheeses, and very good coffee--best we had in England. We hadn't planned on an evening meal at the hotel, but glad we did. Food was delicious and beautifully presented, but the 'small plates' were quite large. We should have had three for the two of us as opposed to five. So close to V&A and Underground. On the Piccadilly line so extremely easy subway ride to Heathrow.

129,Excellent stay,Ampersand is a comfortable South Kensington boutique hotel. The hotel is super clean and the interior design is something to check out. Ingo Maurers lamp in the staircase is a nice touch. We also liked the restaurant downstairs. Location is of course excellent when arriving from Heathrow and the tube is next to the hotel. Recommend taking a morning stroll in South Kensington. We will definitely visit Ampersand as soon as possible again.,5,2014,05,24

morning and evening. Also we hope for a better service in the
Italian restaurant next time.

make this hotel a real first class hotel.

129,Brilliant choice. We would stay again.,"We travelled to London from the west coast of Canada and stayed 3 nights from Apr 28-30 (as Fate would have it, exactly during the Tube strike). After arriving jet lagged, we were welcomed with good cheer and professionalism, and shown to room 307 which was spacious, tastefully decorated, and stocked with cold beverages, teas and delicious cookies.

After a while we figured out that the momentary nightly building shaking was not small earthquakes but the underground Tube trains. This occurs for about 5 seconds quite regularly in the early evening, and eventually stops. If you are a light sleeper this may bother you, but truthfully, after a while we found it comforting. We were in London, afterall. I must say that we heard a bit of street noise as well, but again, we were not expecting complete and utter silence, being in a room that faced the street. The bed was very comfortable, and we were no more disturbed really than we are at home.

We appreciated the location as we always felt safe, happy and in the midst of local Londoners as well as tourists. On our 3 nights in South Kensington, we enjoyed dinner at Casa Brindisa (Spanish tapas), Apero (Mediterranean, in the lower level of the Ampersand) and finally Bumpkin, a comfortable British fare restaurant. One warm night we also journeyed about 20 minutes down Old Brompton Road to have a brandy and a cup of tea at the bohemian Troubadour Cafe, in honour of an old friend who used to frequent the establishment many years ago.

I read one reviewer's comments that it took about 10 minutes to walk to Harrod's. In my memory it was more of a 20 minute walk (and we are not slow walkers). But maybe we went the long way? In any case, we thought the lower level food halls were really impressive, but did not venture beyond that .... note, the memorial to Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayad in the basement is perhaps the tackiest thing I have ever seen. We went immediately back outside, where I subsequently nicknamed the store ""Horrids"" on our way back to the hotel ...where classy tea and cookies were awaiting us ;)",4,2014,05,20

129,"Great Location, Service was amazing, Only drawback is thin walls","My husband and I stayed at this hotel recently and we had a wonderful stay. It is in a great location (close to the South Kensington tube stop). Its in a great neighborhood and has a bus stop in front of the hotel so you can get to areas such as Chelsea and Battersea. Check google maps to see if taking the bus in convenient for where you want to go. My only complaint but minor is the walls are pretty thin so you can sometimes hear people above you or along side you. The service by the staff was amazing! 
A few recommendations in London right now:
1) Take Uber (it is much cheaper than a taxi or same price as heathrow express for two people) - this might change but this is the situation right now. A taxi from Ampersand to the airport was 30 pounds. A heathrow express ticket is 34 pounds roundtrip.
2) The tube on the weekends (like the subway in NYC) has lots of construction and not the best service. I recommend either walking, taking the bus or Uber. 
3) check out the Bluebird Cafe in Chelsea for delicious brunch and a fashionable scene. You can take the bus straight from the hotel. 
4) Brompton Market around the corner from the hotel has a cute garden area and lovely food. 
5) There are a ton of brunch options in the area of the South Kensington tube stop.",5,2014,05,19

In the heart of South Kensington, very close to the tube station. Beds very comfortable, bathroom is very good, and the cleanliness of the hotel cannot be faulted, such a welcome relief when travelling. 
The only room for improvement we would like to have seen was more consistently excellent staff service. Some were very attentive, others more interested in talking to each other. This detracted slightly from the overall experience. For example, despite four staff people standing in the foyer, guests opened the door for each other. Still a fab hotel, and highly recommended, and would visit again.

129,Prime location and comfortable rooms,"We booked our room through Mr and Mrs Smith. On arrival our reservation was missing so, after a bit of discussion from the reception staff we ended up getting put in a larger room. Our room was obviously a room designed for disabled access as there were cords and seats in the shower.

We were meant to get welcome champagne and petit fours as part of our Mr and Mrs Smith deal but obviously, as our reservation was missing this didn't happen (although the petit fours come as standard, I think).

The room and bathroom was beautiful and very comfortable. The bed was great and the headboard a great feature. We only stayed one night but both had a great sleep.

One thing we didn't really appreciate was just how well-placed this hotel is for the museums. They are right on the doorstep.

We would definitely stay again, although would probably double check a reservation with them if booking through a third party.",4,2014,05,17

My room was tiny, but every little comfort you could think of was in the room, making it a very comfortable 2 night stay.The bathroom was large, and toiletries very high quality. My room was quiet (I was on the 4th floor) and I could not hear the elevator or the neighbors. The lobby area has tea service in the afternoon - loved it! Museums and restaurants are within 2-5 mins away. Harrods is walkable as well (10 mins walk). Just the perfect hotel for a tourist or someone visiting for business.

129,The ultimate London hotel,"The Ampersand is what every hotel should aspire to be. The d√©cor is chic, well maintained and comfortable. The staff are the most sincere, happy, knowledgeable hotel staff I've ever met. The hotel is in a brilliant, quiet location, yet conveniently just around the corner from South Kensington tube station, (perfect for getting around as SK tube has three of the main lines running through.)

The room was perfect; luxurious bathroom (with a lovely heated floor,) the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and a lovely seating area to relax. At The Ampersand it's all about the little details too, from the books and magazines in the rooms to the turn down service, from the complimentary soft drinks in the minibar to the umbrellas should you find yourself stuck on a rainy day.

I couldn't recommend the hotel more. It's in a superb location for getting around London, is looked after by happy, helpful staff and is truly the most wonderful hotel I've stayed in. It's a bit of luxury to escape back to after a long day exploring London. 

I'll definitely be going back!",5,2014,05,16

Friendly staff, comfortable and stylish room (we had some trouble figuring out the intricacies of the light switches, but that seems to be the case at a lot of hotels these days), quiet enough location (at the back of the hotel at least), nice lobby and clever use of the basement for an intimate restaurant / bar / breakfast location, with reasonable prices esp. for breakfast from a continental European point of view.

I liked the touch of a book in every room. The room wasn't hot and the mini bar was free which I very much enjoyed and made use of. The location of the hotel was fantastic for what I wanted it for with knightsbridge and the west of London on you doorstep. We were able to visit the History and Science Museum spontaneously. Breakfast was very good, very typical of the fashionable breakfast places in the area. I would recommend this hotel for anyone needing to stay in the Kensington area.",4,2014,05,10

129,Super Charming,"This is a quaint boutique hotel in South Kensington - fabulous location. Loved the decor of the rooms. The bathrooms are smallish. The tub and shower combo felt like a safety risk climbing in and out of and there is only one sink. The toilet is also right there not separated with its own space. They do have a rubber ducky though, so points for that. 

The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The hotel also has a ping pong table which is fun. We ate breakfast in the hotel - very average and nothing special. The bircher museli was odd flavoured and the bacon and egg breakfast came with mystery meat that no one was brave enough to attempt (I think it was kidney). Eggs are eggs - hard to mess that up. But the atmosphere was lovely and homey.

This hotel really does have a nice vibe and super location in its favour. Staff are friendly and helpful too.",4,2014,05,07

129,Lovely Stay at the Amersand,"Hotel and rooms very stylish, updated look, friendly younger hotel staff. European clientele also very stylish. Located in the Kensington/Chelsea neighborhood perfect for limited tourist exposure. Convenient to tube, shopping and Hyde Park, great restaurants and shopping on Kings Road. Would stay here again.  Note -rooms are tight. ",4,2014,05,02
129,Great hotel in great location,"A wonderful property in a super location. Quality of rooms excellent and the staff could not do enough to help throughout the hotel. We will definitely return and recommend to friends !

Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to dine at the hotel, but the restaurant looked very good. An excellent choice of restaurants are also around the local area.

129,April in London,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Terrific service from booking the room all the way through to the moment we departed.  Excellent location near museums, tube and bus stops, nice rooms, attentive staff.  Can't wait to come back.

129,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Just returned home from a lovely stay at the Ampersand. Beautifully decorated through out, this is a chic boutique hotel with impeccable attention to detail. 

Located just opposite South Kensington tube station, this is a fabulous boutique hotel in a great location. Upon arrival, we were greeted at the door and we found the reception staff to be very welcoming and friendly. We were then chauffeured upstairs by another staff member and taken to our room. We managed to get upgraded to one of the superior rooms which was a lovely surprise and we were delighted with the attention to detail! Complimentary mini-bar, books, choice of magazines, bath robes and slippers and a bathroom equipped with a TV in the bath - oh so luxurious! Our room also appeared to have a botanical theme, which was simply lovely :) We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel based in the heart of South Ken; an area oozing with cosmopolitan appeal. 

The hotel also has its own restaurant, and whilst the breakfast did look lovely; we thought it to be a little pricey - however, there are lots of wonderful cafes and bakeries nearby if you'd like a bite to eat.

If we are ever in need of a hotel in London again, the Ampersand will definitely be our first choice and we'd love to come back - Highly recommend!",4,2014,05,01
129,Will be back,"Efficient and friendly service. Very convenient location. A little bit noisy if facing street. 
Ask for room facing back or high floor. Breakfast was good quality and reasonably priced. Excellent set lunch. We will be back .",5,2014,05,01
129,Great hotel in a great location.,The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and the bed super comfy. We found the bathroom a little too small though very nice. This hotel is in a great location for exploring Kensington. Breakfast was very nice. ,5,2014,04,30
129,Nice Boutique Hotel,"Quirky hotel, very comfortable feel to it. Staff were excellent, reception and concierge especially. Just be careful with room choice this is not a typical, every room a square box, hotel. Highly recommended.  
      ",5,2014,04,28
129,Excellent choice in London.,"Fine choice in South Kensington.  Facilities, staff and location are excellent.  Easy to get most anywhere, tube station is three minutes away.  Nice choice of small restaurants nearby.  Rooms well outfitted and wifi has excellent speed.",5,2014,04,28
129,Fabulous,"Had a marvellous stay here in March. My husband and I were in London on business and it was a welcome treat at the end of a busy day. We were upgraded to a beautiful room. Love the oversized headboards and the bath in the bedroom. The decor of the whole hotel is modern and fun yet cozy, it feels very welcoming, unlike some other big unfriendly anonymous hotels in the capital.
I ate with a friend in the restaurant downstairs - loved the mini beetroot burger! 
Only drawback is it's a bit noisy outside - but coming from the countryside anything in the capital is!",4,2014,04,28
129,Wonderful stay at excellent hotel,"We arrived on a wet afternoon to a warm welcome from the front dest staff. Excellent location, literally right next to the South Kensington Station but room was really quiet with such a comfortable bed. The room was a good size with elegant decor and complimentary non-alcoholic drinks were a nice touch. All staff were warm and helpful with information and directions but I would highlight the actions of an extremely helpful front desk female staff and porter on the afternoon of 24th April (unfortunately did not get their names). Our arranged transport to airport did not arrive and she kindly arranged another driver to take us to the airport within 15 minutes and matched the price quoted to us by the original hire car service. Would highly recommend her thoughtfulness and efficiency and also thanks to the porter for arranging us to have bottles of water while we waited. Thank you to all the staff for a memorable stay. Would not hesitate to return.",5,2014,04,28
129,Wonderful stay at an excellent hotel,We arrived on a wet afternoon to a warm welcome from the front desk staff. Great location-literally next to the South Kensington station. Good size room and tastefully decorated. All staff were excellent with information and recommendations but I have to highlight an extremely helpful front desk staff and porter on the afternoon of 24th April (unfortunately did not get her name). Our arranged transport to the airport did not arrive and she kindly arranged another driver to take us to the airport within 15 minutes and matched the price quoted to us by the original hire car service.

Would not hesitate to return on future trips.,5,2014,04,28
129,Amazing Hotel,"Yes, the hotel is pricy and yes the basic rate does not include breakfast but it is in an amazing location, basically just outside South Kensington station. There are some great modern features in the rooms including underfloor heating in the bathroom. French press coffee is a nice change from the normal instant coffee and the staff are friendly and helpful and the bed is definitely one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. We booked our open top bus sightseeing tickets from reception and the bus stopped right outside the hotel. Very convenient indeed. 

The laundromat mentioned in another review is closed so we found one a bit further away in Cromwell Avenue called Bobo's Bubbles. Really helpful. We also found a great bar about 650 m from the hotel called The Queens Arms. Definitely worth a visit. My only complaint about this hotel would be that the floors creak a lot when you walk around the room but this will definitely not stop me from staying here again.",5,2014,04,28
129,Great Stay at the Ampersand,"Our stay at the Ampersand was very enjoyable. Its location is excellent, the room was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much and it really made our visit to London that much more pleasurable.",5,2014,04,27
129,"Charm and efficiency, done well","Great hotel - combination of charm and efficiency, rarely done well. 
We stayed here for six nights - my son and I. Location across South Kensington tube station and proximity to Museums and Hyde Park is perfect for leisure travelers. Staff was very attentive and friendly, especially towards my 10-year old son. Room, while small, was well equipped and beds comfortable. 

Apero, the restaurant, does great breakfasts. Free Wi-Fi and mini-bar (only water and juice) are feel good touches that every hotel needs to follow

Two negatives:
1. The gym is small and dingy. Reasonably equipped for a quick workout, but no in a basement with no windows makes it uninviting. 
2. Room, especially bathroom, was smaller than expected and what it looked like on the website. We were offered a choice of better/larger rooms, we chose not to move.
",4,2014,04,27
129,almost prefect," reasonably priced for it's great location and for it's excellent  service, for the welcoming personnel,  a designer hotel , where the bedroom is designed for traveling with minimal amount of clothes (i.e. very little storage space) but for sleeping well! All in all , we recommend it ! ",4,2014,04,27
129,Highly Recommended,"We found the Ampersand delightful - very convenient; fantastic d√©cor; smiling, friendly and helpful staff. Surely this is more than adequate.  Why is it necessary to complete 200 characters in a review?
      
      ",5,2014,04,27
129,Fantastic Hotel,"We've just returned from London having spent three nights in The Ampersand. The hotel was faultless from the friendly staff, excellent service and fantastic room. We opted for the Deluxe Studio which had a bath in the bedroom and was more than large enough. We will definately be staying at The Ampersand again when we next visit London. ",5,2014,04,27
129,"Excellent hotel, staff and location","This hotel is in a great location - right outside South Kensington tube, really close to the V&A etc. and the Royal Albert Hall. The hotel has a really nice feel - has a bit of personality that is missing in many London hotels. Great rooms, spotlessly clean with excellent facilities.  What really makes it are the staff - each one of them seemed to actually enjoy working there and to really care that you enjoyed your stay. This is a trendy but at the same time traditional hotel which could easily have felt intimidating but the excellent staff made it feel anything but - will definitely be a first choice next time we're in London.",5,2014,04,27
129,Love this hotel,"This hotel is conveniently located near the South Kensington tube station (2 minutes walk). There are also a few bus stops nearby. You can visit 3 major museums (Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum) within 5 minutes of walk and if you like shopping, Harrods is around 15 minutes of walk from the hotel, and there are a lot of shops near the hotel also. 

The room was on the small side (standard for London) but beautifully furnished, very clean of course. The service was superb, the staff members were extremely helpful, friendly and efficient. All the drinks in the minibar were complimentary, and I think this is a very thoughtful touch. 

I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights, then went to a trip to another city for 3 days and then went back to this hotel for 1 more night, they were very kind to let me store my baggages into their storage. 

I tried the afternoon tea in the hotel restaurant, and it was good.

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, so glad I chose it, hope to be back soon!",5,2014,04,27
129,Romantic getaway,"Stayed here for a couple of nights after our wedding. Absolutely lovely staff, very friendly and professional. Room was upgraded without asking and received free champagne. Check out the bar/restaurant in the basement, very classy. Would recommend this place to anyone seeking a romantic break in London.",5,2014,04,27
129,Great place to stay..,"My fianc√© and I just stayed here for a single night as we were in the midst of a crazy travel agenda. The staff are fantastic, polite, immaculately dressed and more than helpful. We were upgraded to a 'Superior' room which was nice, a touch on the small side but the bed was big and filled most of the room, the bathroom with heated floors was great, the shower head was fantastic. I'd highly recommend staying here, close to the tube, easy to find and fantastic service.",4,2014,04,26
129,Nice Boutique Option,"We stayed here for one night and the service was fabulous, as well as the decor, with quirky little touches like rubber ducks in the bathrooms.  We had a room behind reception on the ground floor which was reasonably small (pretty standard for London) and whilst beautifully decorated you could heard the sound of the tube faintly and there was a slight smell when we first checked in, so I would recommend a room on a higher floor.

The only other piece of advice I would give is based around location, whilst it is reasonably central (walking distance to Harrods) it does really depend on why you are visiting London and where you want to go, for example we were going for dinner off Oxford street so with the cost of taxi's each way there are other comparable hotel options much closer to the centre and whilst these are slightly more expensive they are balanced by the fact you don't need such an expensive taxi ride.",4,2014,04,25
129,The best,"It is my best hotel, the staff is very kind and friendly. The standard room is small but it's very very clean. I like it also their cosy tea room, we got our afternoon tea in the last day and we really enjoyed it. In addition to the area around. The underground station is few steps from the hotel.",5,2014,04,25
129,Excellent hotel - excellent staff,"This is a great hotel in a central location and a short walk from the tube station, providing easy access to all London.  The rooms are excellent and very well maintained.  The staff are genuine and extremely helpful.  It requires real diligence to create a quality establishment and a comment to service at the standard that is achieved at the Ampersand and we will reward that with our repeated patronage and recommending the hotel to everyone we know travelling to London.",5,2014,04,25
129,Just Perfect,"Perfect location, just meters from South Kensington metro station.  The hotel is modern, hip and cozy, Everything you need you have it.  One of the best hotels I stayed in.  Service is superb. I definitely recommend it.",5,2014,04,24
129,Top trendy experience in a top trendy location,"I really liked this hotel - the location was just brilliant almost opposite South Kensington tube station (you could get a train to virtually anywhere with just a few stops, the museum quarter was just a short walk around and the whole area is quite upmarket) and the staff were really good in all areas of the hotel.

Check-in was really friendly but efficient, and I'd been told that I'd got a free upgrade from a Superior to a Deluxe room; a nice touch. I had seen the price of the hotel drop by ¬£10 the night before, so I was going to question it at check-in, but the upgrade was worth about ¬£30 so I was happy with that.

I was shown to the room, which was good because the corridors are somewhat sprawling. But I've never quite seen hotel corridors done out like these, very stylish.

The room itself was pretty small with no view (just onto another brick wall at the back of the hotel) but since I was just sleeping in it then it was no problem; I think seeing how busy the main road was at the front of the hotel it's worth asking to be at the back if you like your slumber. The room was well finished off, not overly fussy or too much in it but solid and clean looking decor. The bed and the oversize headboard were lovely. There were some free drinks in the mini bar, incluing real milk for tea/coffee. A proper size tv too.

The bathroom was also a little small, but it was very well decorated with a bath, lots of toiletries and underfloor heating, which was really nice underfoot. Fluffy towels, fluffy bathrobes and & branded slippers too.

I didn't eat dinner in the hotel, but did pop down to the restaurant. The menu was largely based on tapas and sharing dishes, and since I was on my own for business I just ate out although I did grab an evening club sandwich on room service. I chose to have room service breakfast too and that was delivered promptly on time and was very good quality ingredients.

Check-out was very smooth and also very friendly. There were always lots of staff around the hotel opening the doors, meeting and greeting, it felt like a very friendly and upmarket place, more like a [trendy] 5 star hotel in every aspect.

The only reasons I didn't give it a 5 circles on this review was because I thought the restaurant could offer some more mainstream dishes, even if just steak etc, and being conveniently near South Ken tube did mean that the hotel was on top of the line and until midnight and from early in the morning the hotel would rumble with the trains underneath - not a real problem, it did wake me on a few occasions, am just not used to living out in the West Country!",4,2014,04,24
129,GREAT,"We had an amazing stay at this centrally located (near South Ken. tube) hotel. The look of the place was ""big box hotel"" , however the atmosphere and service are what you would get when staying at a small country hotel . Congratulations on making us feel so welcomed! Our room, was not large, but for a stay in London when you're out most of the time, that doesn't really matter and the bathroom was perfect and CLEAN. This is a design hotel with a heart and soul, which is not an easy mix. We would highly recommend it",5,2014,04,23
129,Wonderful hotel,"Staff was amazing and helped us book tours and plays. The rooms and hallways were beautiful and wonderfully unique. The hotel made the trip even more fantastic! They had thought of everything in the rooms - so high tech!
      
      ",5,2014,04,22
129,Absolutely wonderful!,"Couldn't ask for anything more.  The room was large by London standards and beautiful.  The lobby, drawing room and restaurant were lovely and chic.  The service and staff were so kind and helpful.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2014,04,22
129,Heated bathroom floors,"I stay at a lot of hotels in London. Ampersand is the only one that reliably provides a heated bathroom floor. This sounds like a small thing, but it is one of the most luxurious amenities imaginable.",5,2014,04,22
129,"A modern, classic, comfortable stay","A family tour to London.  A four-day stay in this lovely hotel - warm, modernly equiped, classically decorated, professionally served, conveniently located (just next to South Kensington station).  Love it.",5,2014,04,22
129,"Great location,comfortable stay","Excellent location in the museum area, lots of nice restaurants near by. This hotel ""gets it""  with free wifi and a simple but much appreciated complimentary mini bar. Modern rooms and comfortable beds with a gentle ambiance. Feels trendy with genuine warmth to the guests.  ",5,2014,04,21
129,Perfect Location,"We recently stayed at this hotel and really enjoyed it! The location is ideal if you want to be situated in the beautiful borough of Kensington. It is directly across from the tube stop, which is very important in London. There are lovely cafes, an Irish bar and wonderful restaurants within walking distance. The rooms were a good size, loved the heated bathroom floor, our view was fabulous and the staff was very nice. My only negative comment is that they weren't very helpful with suggestions or directions. Fortunately, our daughter is studying there and knows the city rather well. I would recommend staying there again.",4,2014,04,21
129,Nice experience,"We had a wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel. Our Room was very nice and clean and the suport at the Hotel lobby was great. We only can recomend the Ampersand Hotel and for sure next time we travel to London we know what Hotel we will chose.
      ",5,2014,04,21
129,Superb,"We love this hotel
The staff are all so friendly and efficient, nothing is too much trouble
We have stayed in many london hotels but this one is definitely our favourite
Love the extras eg newspaper, complimentary soft drinks etc
Great area of london too, safe, convenient, quaint",5,2014,04,21
129,One night everything we needed,Just stayed here one night after returning from Scotland. Excellent location close to tube station and bars/restaurants. The room was just the basic double but had everything we wanted and under floor heating was good in the morning. Breakfast was good. Overall will stay here again. ,4,2014,04,20
129,"A bit Whimsical, Very Comfortabe","A lovely, whimsically designed modern hotel in a historic building a block walk from the V&A and Natural History Museums. Great location, extremely comfortable. Highly recommended. Sufficiently pricy to be snobbish, but too young and trendy to let it show. ",5,2014,04,20
129,Well located,"This was my 8th visit at the Ampersand. Location is perfect next to South Kensington Station, which is very well connected. There are many good restaurants and pubs around. Harrods is a mere 10 minute walk away. It is also a perfect location for visiting museums. Some of the best are minutes away. The hotel has an unassuming entrance at 10 Harrington Road. Once inside you feel very welcome. The lobby is not large but very welcoming. The staff are fabulous. There is a small bar and tea lounge adjacent to the reception. Very classy. Downstairs there is a very nice restaurant both for breakfast and all day dining. Food quality is good. There is also a fitness room on this floor that is OK. The rooms are comfortable. Minibars are included. Cleanliness is fine. Amenities are both nice and a bit funky.
I keep coming back because the location is good and they always make me feel that this a real home for me in London.",5,2014,04,19
129,Cool in Kensington,"Lovely outside of building, situated a minute's walk from South Ken tube station, cheerful greeters on the door and great quirky interior to the lobby. There was a problem with the key card to our deluxe room, so they took me up and let me kn personally. 30 minutes later the reception called and said that they needed to get an engineer out to fix the keycard system for our specific room - I wasn't fussed; the reception could have just let us in and out but the lady said she would upgrade us for the inconvenience to a suite. Well! Very happy with this as the suite was lovely - amazing, large, firm bed, little balcony, nespresso machine and rainfall shower. Great service and immaculate rooms - I love the quirky wallpaper and furniture, and the bar downstairs was buzzing too. I would stay here again for sure, and Muriel's Kitchen cafe across the road does great breakfast and cakes too...",5,2014,04,18
129,Cute new boutique hotel,"Fantastic location right near the South Kensington stop on three tube lines (including the Piccadilly for easy access to Heathrow).  Cute, chic rooms with nice touches like heated bathroom floors and great rain shower.  Single rooms are very small, however, with not much space for hanging clothes.",4,2014,04,18
129,Family day out/sleepover,"Lovely hotel and good experience but was marred by a few irritating factors: 1.Unable to check in at 2pm and were kept waiting until nearly 3pm. Quite irritated by this as although we were given tea in the Drawing Room, this then spoiled our 3.30pm booking as we'd already had the experience whilst waiting for our room. 2.Were offered 'Mr and Mrs Smith' complimentary champagne and then had to ask them to take it off the bill on check out. 3. Had allergic reaction to the feathers in all the mountain of pillows in the room, but they were very prompt at bringing replacements. Good size room for a family. All other service/room cleanliness etc was a very high standard.
      ",4,2014,04,17
129,"Beautiful hotel, exemplary service","We were on a five day trip to London to visit family and spend time in the city. The location is perfect, the staff faultless (supremely helpful and friendly) and the hotel itself was a lovely blend of the contemporary and classic. Our Deluxe Studio was spacious and modern with a gorgeous bathroom and a comfortable bed/sofa for our eight year-old.",5,2014,04,17
129,Good for kids,"We stayed here with our in-laws and three rowdy nephews and nieces under ten.  The basement of the hotel had a huge games room (with table tennis, board games, jenga, PS3, videos etc) which was fantastic for keeping the children entertained on cold winter night and the restaurant was happy to serve kids meals there.   There is also a big library next door where we were able to have breakfast together as a group.

Location was great: sightseeing bus stop directly outside, tube 150 metres away, shops and cafe nearby, and many museums ten mins away.

Rooms were clean, modern but maybe a little small.

Staff were extremely helpful.",4,2014,04,16
129,A Gem in South Kennsington,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Ampersand! Our expectations were exceeded  in terms of both hospitality and service.  We felt so at home for the 5 nights we stayed while in town for a conference at the ExCel.  We literally felt like we were at home at the Ampersand. Service was impeccable.  On par with every 5 star hotel we have stayed in worldwide.  Greatly appreciated the greeting every time we walked through the door.  Facilities were beautiful.  Room was small, but as expected.  We booked the superior room and barely had room for both of us to move.  Although very cozy, the bathroom size was generous and we survived. If you can afford a bigger category I would go for it.  If not, be prepared to snuggle.  We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel. Gym facilities were wonderful, mini bar great for our stay and the location can not be beat.  Steps from the tube, walking distance to Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Harrods, multiple shops and restaurants.  Fabulous neighborhood.  We will absolutely stay at the Ampersand again when visiting London.  Wouldn't look anywhere else!",5,2014,04,16
129,Wonderful weekend,"This boutique hotel is so lovely, intimate and warm. Service is impeccable. This was a second visit and the service and quality is consistently good. Definitely my go to hotel in London. Lovely to walk to the V&A etc.",5,2014,04,16
129,Excellent Value,"Pound for Pound, the best hotel I have experienced. Upon entering you straight away feel satisfied with the ambiance and character of the hotel. Staff are very welcoming and knowledgeable and the room was fantastic.
      
      ",5,2014,04,15
129,Brilliant experience,"Loved everything about staying at the Ampersand. Great location for the museums and tube. The staff are very professional and friendly, and our Superior room was spacious with the most comfortable (v large) bed we've ever had in a hotel. The decor is very stylish and everything is geared to comfort of the guests as well as aesthetics.

Would recommend the uber-cool cocktails at the Apero bar - a great place for pre- and post-dinner drinks. We didn't eat dinner here but if the breakfast was anything to go by I'm sure it would be amazing.

Will definitely be back.",5,2014,04,14
129,My Favourite,"Fantastic hotel, amazing service,great location.
The staff are this hotel's best asset. Rooms can be small but very well appointed. Very close to South Kensington tube which goes straight to Heathrow and is well connected to central city.
Always feel welcome and ''at home'' at this place.

129,London-April,"Hotel was great, chic, friendly, rooms were very clean and the Tube was just less than one block away. So many choices in area for food and dining.  The Wifi in the hotel was excellent for business. I would recommend highly for leisure or business.

129,ampersand hotel,"This is a brillant hotel, so very modern and lovely room sevice, it is in a great part of town and the T.V. in the bath is a great expreince. The style is fantastic and I think that the nespresso coffee machine is excellent.",5,2014,04,13
129,Excellent,This was a birthday treat from my sister and it really was a treat. Had a fantastic stay and the staff were so helpful. I had tried to book afternoon tea and for whatever reason this had gone wrong but the manager made up for this at every opportunity with little extras. I loved the way the hotel and been decorated. Would definitely visit here again and would highly recommend.,5,2014,04,13
129,"Elegant hotel, charming staff","We stayed here very recently and we're really impressed with this hotel. The staff were really charming and helpful and nothing was too much trouble; we were upgraded because they discovered it was my birthday and then when we discovered that our new room didn't have a bath, they upgraded us again to accommodate this. A complimentary glass of champagne at the bar also went down very well. Rooms are gorgeous, and really we'll appointed. Enormous beds! The bar area is beautifully done, some very clever interior design work. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,04,12
129,Nice Hotel,"Good location! Very convenience to go to central London. Though the restaurant in the basement is not good, but there are lots of small restaurant around that area. The room rate is a little bit high, but it is great if it included the breakfast. One thing I concerned was the room a bit small if I have big luggage. But I definitely will come again.

129,London across from south kensington tube,"Great location. 
Quiet on the top 5th floor
Bed comfy but king size leaves little room for a closet, tea kettle boils in the closet!
Or room to close and get by the bathroom door. Would prefer more room and less bed!
Staff super helpful with tickets, reservations etc
      ",5,2014,04,10
129,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is beautiful. The decor is very tasteful. Staff are friendly and helpful. Very useful to have the gadgets in the room explained to us on arrival. Great location as close to tube station. Will use again.
      
      ",5,2014,04,10
129,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"We went for a 'science' afternoon tea here and it was a wonderful experience in a great location (very close to South Ken tube).  The hotel is beautiful with the decor and design being spot on - I saw an earlier review that said it was luxury without the pretentiousness and that pretty much sums it up. The interior is stunning but also comfortable and relaxing. It can be quite difficult to make afternoon tea something different but they definitely managed it with the 'science' tea.  It was an homage to the surrounding museums - for instance a cake shaped like a planet, a drink in a lab beaker, etc - but it was all done absolutely beautifully and wasn't just quirkiness for its own sake. There were some niggles such as no refill for the tea without asking and a general lack of smoothness to the service but this hasn't stopped me giving a five star rating as overall it was fantastic and the staff were very friendly and willing to help. We've been to lots of afternoon teas and this was definitely up there with the best of them.",5,2014,04,10
129,Birthday Treat,"We stayed for three nights and booking through SLH got an upgrade to our room, which was wonderful. The bed and pillows were so comfortable! We had breakfast once in Apero  which was very good. Prices are OK - just remember there is a 12.5% service charge added. The hotel is well situated for local eating places as well as the tube station. We would stay again.  
      ",5,2014,04,10
129,Stay in South Kensington,"We had a wonderful stay at this modern, chic hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and the bed was superb.  It was conveniently located near a tube station and many museums. I would happily stay here again.",5,2014,04,10
129,Fantastic,"We stayed at the Ampersand Monday March 24 to Thursday March 27, 2014 and couldn't have been happier with it. Very clean and modern, in a great location, steps from the South Kensington Metro station.

The staff was very friendly and courteous but a special shout out to Eli who went over and above for us. We were humbled.

We will definetly be back on our next trip to London!",4,2014,04,09
129,a truly beautiful hotel,"It is very rare that you find a hotel that had been furnished using extremely meticulous attention to detail in an environment that has strayed from the convensions of usual London hotels that present a corporate feel or mere replicas of other luxury hotels accross the world that I find are a repetition of one another with detail, service and hospitality. Ampersand has been brave and bold enough to stray from those conventions and deliver the most unique inner city hotel I have stayed in accross the world. It is luxury without the pretentiousness. It is awe inspiring attention to detail yet understated. It doesnt try hard to be overwhelming or have a wow factor, yet it does, in an appealingly quirky manner, from the moment you step in to entrance lobby.

I would strongly recommend a stay here, its within close proximity to S. Kensington tube station, the museums, within walking distance to Knightsbridge and of course Hummingbirds bakery! I would avoid the double room as it unresevedly small in size and pay the little extra for an upgrade, it is considerably worth paying the extra.

The hotel operator, interior design team, management and staff ought to give themselves a very well deserved pat on the back. This hotel is a truly magnificent place to stay, thank you for your hospitality. ",5,2014,04,09
129,Great location and size,"Can't beat the area for restaurants, tube access, museum access.  Hotel staff is very helpful, beds very comfortable.  Only complaint is that the room was very small and pricey (but typical for London).

129,Great hotel in a superb location,"Really enjoyed our two days at the hotel.  We had a private dining experience on the first night in the Wine Room and on the second day, after breakfast at the Wolseley, we went back to the Ampersand for champagne, tea and cakes in the afternoon.  The staff are friendly, courteous and very helpful.  If you need help with any events speak to Francesca Casale, she really helped make our stay superb.  This is a great hotel in a fantastic location.  Enjoy it!",5,2014,04,09

129,Nice hotel but payment problem,"I never write reviews but now I'm disappointed. 
Nice hotel except a payment problem: the hotel blocked the whole amount when I checked in although I informed that we were going to pay with another card when we checked out two days later. No problem, they said, we just take your card number for authorization. And when we checked out and payed with another card two days later they didn't unblock the amount from my card. When i realized this 4 days later I called the hotel to ask why. They said that that I hadn't asked for them to unblock the amount from my card when we payed with another card! Hello?!? And for this hazard they didn't offer anything as compensation, just ""Sorry for the inconvenience""!",3,2014,04,08
129,wonderful stay in London,"The Ampersand Hotel is in a perfect location and superbly run.  We travelled with two teenage children on a 5 night  holiday to London  in March and found the Ampersand very accommodating to our needs. Prior to our visit, the staff were very responsive to our email  request for two twin beds for our children and a King for parents ( not an easy feat to do in Europe) We were also insisting on a quiet room above the ground considering the reported Tube noise from the South Kensington stop only 50 yards away. In addition, the front desk allowed us to check in early upon arrival after a red eye flight from the USA. They even had welcome notes and gifts for our daughter's birthday! Both rooms were clean, comfortable  and cozy.Our rooms had a music theme with musical notes on the wallpaper and interesting books about classical music- in deference to the V and A Museum and Royal Albert hall nearby.  The beds were divine as were the plush towels and toiletries. There was  daily free water, coke, coffee and tea along with daily biscuits or cookies. Our rooms were tucked away on a hallway away from the noisy Harrington road and had  view of a school. The rooms were an oasis in the midst of a vibrant and busy South Kensington, The HVAC was efficient but quiet.We did not sample the restaurant but the afternoon tea looked delicious in the lobby.
The gym was small but had refreshing water. The South Kensington location made it convenient to run in Hyde Park and by Kensington Gardens.There was also a game room with games and  ping pong table for entertainment.
Overall we were pleased by the value, style and cleanliness of the Ampersand - it seemed a perfect spot from which to enjoy London and its culture with our family .On departure, we even took the direct Piccadilly Tube to Heathrow from South Kensington.- very convenient. We would definitely consider staying again at the Ampersand in the future.",5,2014,04,07
129,"Beautiful hotel, great location",My husband booked this as a surprise for my birthday and I could not have been more delighted.  We had a complimentary glass of champagne in the lovely bar and the bedroom was a good size.  The hotel was well placed for Chelsea and we will most definately be back.,5,2014,04,07
129,Excellent!,"Hotel is excellent. The reception from the staff on arrival was great, with all members greeting with a smile. The rooms are of a very high standard and the breakfasts outstanding. The whole place just has a really great atmosphere that makes it a lovely place to stay.      ",5,2014,04,07
129,Thumbs up all round!,"When i made my booking, i got a free upgrade + a baby cot so things already got off to a great start!

Spent 2 nights at the Ampersand. In terms of location, it was right next to all the museums that we wanted to visit and just 2 mins walk to the South Kensington tube.

Service was impeccable, Georgia and one of the other guys provided genuine and helpful service throughout the stay. 

At its price point, 

Highly recommended for anyone visiting the city!",5,2014,04,07
129,Wedding Party,"My son and his (now) lovely wife stayed at the Ampersand Hotel, along with other family members as part of their wedding celebrations.  We all had a wonderful time, particularly the happy couple. The hotel staff could not have been more accommodating which made the stay even more special. All the rooms were great as was the food, the service and attention to detail. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to experience a memorable stay in a central London hotel for a special occasion.",5,2014,04,05
129,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,Enjoyed everything about this hotel except for the coffee in the room.  A Nespresso machine would be much nicer.  Comfortable beds but the room was hot and stuffy so we opened a window but noises from people on the street kept us awake.  Couldn't seem to adjust the temperature of the room.,5,2014,04,03

129,Superb,"We cannot fault this hotel. Beautiful furnishings, warm very comfortable bed, extremely welcoming and very friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble and always willing and eager to assist and make your stay enjoyable.

129,Perfect stay,"We stayed in the Ampersand for three nights in March and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. The room was extremely comfortable with beautiful decor (love that they include a cafetiere for in room coffee) and the staff were extremely attentive. My husband is a celiac and the reception staff ensured that the restaurant staff were aware of this for breakfast. We simply told them our room number and they ensured he knew what options were available to him. 
I can't wait till our next stay.",5,2014,04,01
129,Birthday treat,"Had a upgrade on arrival to a suite which was a nice surprise as it was my husbands birthday.the rooms were very small and dark,lovely bathroom with free standing bath. Don't know if I would pay the extra as the room we originally booked would have been larger! Had a good stay.

129,great for us!,This was the perfect location for a museum trip to London. Minutes away from the V & A and more. Across the street from the So Kensignton tube so accessible to transit. Lovely boutique hotel. Very helpful staff [theatre tickets].,4,2014,03,31
129,LRL74,This was our first visit to this hotel having previously staying in neighbouring hotels of the same rating. We found all of the staff very helpful and the room of very good quality. The location of the hotel is also very good just a 2min walk from the tube station.,5,2014,03,30

129,Excellent for family,"We stayed here with 2 kids (teens) in adjoining rooms. The rooms (one Superior with 2 Twin beds and one Deluxe with a King bed) were in a corner location with a common outer door the shared inner doors. This arrangement worked out very nice. The location of hotel is great. So easy to get to the Tube that is just a block a way, and only a few blocks walk from museums, restaurants, etc. The service was excellent. My daughter needed a power converter for hair straightener (who knew) and they brought one promptly and let us keep it the whole time. We did not do breakfasts at the hotel, but lots of coffee shops nearby that are a better deal and gets us out into the community. Cost is not cheap, but nothing in London is. To get enough room and great service and a great location is worth it to us.",5,2014,03,29
129,nice hotel,"stayed here for one night. we are members of SLH so we were given a free upgrade from a double to a superior room. the hotel is small and feels cosy, staff are friendly. the room was beautiful, not huge but this is london. Ensuite small but adequate, tea and coffee available in room, bed very, very comfortable and adequate air con. Would certainly stay again. we did not eat here but the tea and cakes in the drawing room looked very nice!!",4,2014,03,29
129,"Fantastic Hotel, select breakfast carefully","Stayed here for one night on a business trip. Great location and really comfortable, modern room and bathroom . Faultless. But beware breakfast. The dining area gets very busy and my partners order came almost straight away. By the time she had finished, some 30 minutes later, the cooked breakfast had still not arrived. People that arrived after us got their cooked breakfast after 15 minutes. 30 minutes later we age up. Not what you would expect from a hotel of this standard. To make matters worse, the staff in the restaurant didn't seem bothered at all.",4,2014,03,28
129,Expected better,"Stayed Friday and Saturday night whilst visiting family in South Ken, a theatre night and some shopping.

Location - brilliant, very convenient 
Reception and Check-in - very efficient and friendly 
Rooms - clean with modern fittings (maybe a little dusty on the bathroom light fittings but thats being pedantic).  The key problem with the room, room 14, was the view or lack of it!  I saw the scenic picture of air conditioning units all weekend. 

We didn't use the bars or restaurants as we had reservations elsewhere both nights so can't comment on these

Other Items

Housekeeping arrived at 17:00 on Saturday to make the room up, however that was far too late in the day as we'd already returned and were in the room  getting ready for the theatre.  We ended up making the bed ourselves and surviving without a replenished mini-bar

Finally the newspaper we requested wasn't delivered at all on the Sunday morning.  The lovely lady on reception quickly got a copy of the Times when this was highlighted however it was just another element of service that was not upto scratch for this level of hotel.  Overall quite disappointing ",3,2014,03,27
129,delightful,"As a couple, we only stayed here for one night but would have been happy to have stayed longer. We stayed in a Deluxe Room and found it quite spacious. The bed was at least a Queen size and, in addition, the room had a settee, a desk, a formal chair and an armchair.

The decor of the hotel is stylish modern, lots of black and white and many examples of quality artwork. 

The staff are a delight. Dressed in waistcoats and smart jeans they exuded warmth and efficiency.They couldn't have been more helpful and I trust that their managers appreciate them.

Well placed for the museums and with a tube station within two minutes walk this is a hotel to savour.",5,2014,03,27
129,Home from home.,My wife and I stayed at the Ampersand at the start of a 25th anniversary holiday. We have stayed at this hotel before and it is our first choice when visiting the city. The staff are so friendly and helpful and really make you feel at home. The rooms are lovely and the location is excellent with an tube station just across the road and plenty of restaurants nearby. The major London museums are a short walk from the front door. I highly recommend the Ampersand.,5,2014,03,27
129,Still a few kinks but very nice,"Very pretty hotel - particularly the shared spaces - and the location is great.  Service was a bit spotty. Staff was very friendly and offered to help but had a bit of trouble actually getting things done. Food was okay - not great

The beds are extra comfy. Food is also great, be in cafe/snacks/tea in an bright lounge, or breakfast/dinner in the restaurant, which is in the basement but still with windows and not dark at all. Great value for money compared with other boutique hotels in London.

129,Another wonderful stay,They say the little things in life are the biggest. It's the little things like the complimentary soft drinks in the room fridge to the copy of the Times hung on my door in the morning that keep me coming back.

129,Excellent hotel,"Recently stayed for a week, it being the second time that I have stayed here. The hotel is superb; very high standard of decor, excpetionally friendly, professional and welcoming staff, very comfy beds and stylish bathrooms. Little design touches in the rooms and the public areas make this hotel standout from others. Being relatively new, the general standard remains high. Food and service in the restaurant are excellent having dined for both breakfast and dinner. Others have commented that the rooms are small, which they perhaps are, but no smaller than most other central London hotels. If staying for a night or two the superior rooms are fine, but any longer I would suggest a deluxe or studio deluxe, unless you don't intend to spend much time in the room. Overall, this is perhaps my favourite hotel in London, also helps that it is in a good location in South Kensington and right next to the tube. Just note that the Drawing Room gets quite busy at weekends with people booking afternoon tea, but is much quieter during the week and a seat easy to find at the spare of the moment.",5,2014,03,18
129,Great stay and customer service 2nd to none.,"Stayed the 1 night in January in a Deluxe Studio which was massive (unknown for centre of London).
Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out, staff were genuinly friendly and obliging unlike your sterile chains.
Unfortunately we slept through breakfast the bed was so comfortable but will try next time we come down and stay over.
Close proximity to everywhere and just round from South Kensington tube station.
Would reccomend to anyone busibess or pleasure.
Complimentary in room fridge soft drinks which is a first.",5,2014,03,18
129,One of the Best in town,"The first night didn't go quite as well as it could have as our room wasn't ready when we checked in at 3PM and the allocated room (which we given when returning to the hotel that evening) was very very small for a twin (a superior room).  No place to put our 2 large cases.  But the following day we were relocated to a larger room without charge and it was perfect.  The staff were extremely helpful in organising this change and generally extremely cheerful and friendly.

As others have said the location is superb.  Very close to the tube station (Piccadilly, Circle & District lines) which made it easy to get from Heathrow on the tube and around London for all our excursions.  Great selection of restaurants and cafes in the area.  A lively and safe neighbourhood.  

Free and fast wifi connection also a bonus, as was the complimentary soft drinks in the mini-bar.  This hotel also has some smoking rooms, which are becoming hard to find in London, which is also a plus point for us.

Would definitely return to this hotel but would book a larger room next time should we need a twin.",4,2014,03,18
129,Wonderful Stay,"Really lovely. Great location. The bedroom was really nicely set out, well maintained. The bathroom was spacious and clean, nice quality toiletries. The bed was nice and comfy, had a really good nights sleep. ",5,2014,03,17
129,Great Experience,"The hotel staff was very friendly a smiley. We used the bar and the restaurant, the food at the restaurant was of very high standard. 
The decor was fantastic and our room featured a bath tub in the room itself, by the window which we found super lush!
Highly recommended

129,Outstanding Top-Notch Boutique Hotel,"We booked a 3 night stay at the Ampersand Hotel in March 2014. Our stay coincided with the marriage of my eldest son who got married in Mayfair. From the moment we arrived at the Ampersand we were pleasantly surprised. We arrived in time for lunch and enjoyed a delicious two course meal in the modern Apero restaurant. The service and the food was first class. Our bedroom was a de-luxe studio, the room was spotlessly clean, and more than adequately supplied with all the little extras such as a Nespresso coffee machine and a well-stocked fridge of free soft drinks. I particular enjoyed the high quality Miller Harris toiletries. Our bedroom overlooked the main road, which on the first night was a little noisy at times. I purchased some earplugs from a nearby chemist and slept in blissful silence for the rest of the stay. The evening after the wedding we all came back to Champagne, canap√©s and savouries which we enjoyed in the Drawing room. On the Saturday evening we met for cocktails in Wine room. I must say I was impressed to see Falernum which was in one of the most delicious cocktails on the list. All of the staff were friendly, professional and courteous. You got the impression that they really enjoyed working at the Ampersand. The location of the hotel made it excellent for walking to nearby Sloane Square where 16 of us met for breakfast at the Botanist. We also enjoyed the exquisite international food market near to the Saatchi gallery. In summary, the Ampersand was a high class, first class, top of the class superior London hotel experience.",5,2014,03,17
129,Impecable,"Everything was perfect congratulations to the hotel and the staff. I will visit the hotel again for sure. The room was really good. The staff very friendly.

129,Excellent Location Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here for a business trip in February 2014. As I was doing most of my commuting via the Tube I could not have found the location more convenient. An added bonus of being near the South Kensington Tube was the great concentration of restaurants and coffee shops there.
The hotel itself is very stylish and chic, but done in a classical style so the feeling is always comfortable and understated. My room, while not huge, was big for this area of central London and designed very well to feel even more spacious than it was.
The front desk staff and others in the lobby were all very helpful and kind. I will definitely come back next time I need to be in West Central London.",5,2014,03,16
129,Overnight stay for 2,"Really excellent hotel. Very stylish and comfortable.

And getting a room with two beds was very tough ---Our room had two tiny twins, not very suitable for adults. As other reviews say, the rooms are very small, but have nice amenities and quality linens.  Heated bathroom floors are nice, and free in-room beverages are great.  Recommend you stay on higher floor to avoid traffic or subway noise.  Great location right across the street from tube station and surrounded by fabulous restaurants, both eat in and take away. The afternoon tea was nice but way expensive; almost $90 for two people, it would have been even more with a glass of champagne.  
Very nice staff, young and eager to please.

129,The perfect London boutique Hotel,"We have stayed at the Ampersand on two occasions and each time was really perfect. The food is excellent, the rooms clean and comfortable and the staff warm, friendly and always there to help with any requests. The tea is absolutely delicious and the breakfast in their restaurant Apero is just the way to start a day.",5,2014,03,11
129,Loved every minute of my stay,"Decided to stay at the Ampersand on business, so it was for a single evening only.

Organised a mid-afternoon meeting at the Drawing Rooms and we settled on afternoon tea. Impressed with the ambience, quality of the food and overall experience. Good value, too.

As for the hotel? There's very little to fault at all! It's that good. Received an unexpected room upgrade, room was incredibly clean and, for a hotel in the centre of London, surprisingly quiet. I was at the side of the hotel, which might have helped.

Definitely recommended. Staff are very friendly and helpful.",5,2014,03,11
129,Beautiful hotel but some rooms small,"I recently enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel after becoming an SLH Club Member, which gets you a free upgrade. The rooms were well clean and well appointed with each level of room featuring a specific theme pulled through in all the decor (e.g. paintings + bedside table book). The bathroom was wonderful, with a great shower and those luxuries you wish you had at home, like a heated floor and mirror. The service was excellent and no detail missed (e.g. slippers on a mat by the bed), and the restaurant looked delicious, though I did not try it. However, the smallest two room types are rather tiny; although typical for London, it can make it feel difficult to settle in. I recommend booking a deluxe room (or whatever the second rate level is) after joining the SLH club and getting an upgrade to the Superior room.

The location right by the South Kensington tube is convenient for the museums and shopping in Knightsbridge, as well as for getting around, but may make the hotel less useful for work travelers. In addition, the immediate area isn't the most lovely, though a few blocks in either direction do put you in a rather posh part of town.",5,2014,03,11
129,Great location: a young artistic hotel!,"We have been there for a short two days romantic week end.
The hotel is located nearby the tube station in a very nice area close to King's road. staff is young, efficent and smiley. the athmosphere is artistic .... Rooms are small but comfortable. Gym is available. Parks can be reached nearby for running.Shopping and eating near by...Strongly reccomended.",5,2014,03,10
129,Perfect Christmas Weekend,"We stayed here the weekend before Christmas 2013 and the Ampersand could not have been a better base for a Christmas weekend. The location is right next to the tube meaning access to central London is very easy and convenient. The room was incredible with supersize king bed and free minibar with soft drinks, snacks, tea and coffee and juice restocked daily. The bathrooms with the rainforest shower, complimentary toiletries and luxurious robes along with heated floors were also perfect. The speakers in the shower were also a nice touch. Nothing was too much trouble for the porter and receptionists who arranged all of our dinner reservations and onward travel. Breakfast is expensive and so we went to Muriels Kitchen at the end of the road (3 doors down). This was a family owned diner and the food was great. Overall a great location in Kensington and a fantastic hotel.",5,2014,03,10
129,Very stylish hotel in an  interesting part of London,"The Ampersand is in a cleverly refurbished building, decorated with much more panache than the average London hotel. The lobby and bar area are light and spacious, the reception friendly and helpful. I was given an upgrade to a deluxe room, not large but with an enormous and very comfortable bed and a great bathroom - mostly black but well lit and ultra modern fittings. The only let down was room service, smoked salmon and cream cheese on sour dough turned out to be good smoked salmon but horrible, soggy focaccia style bread. I didn't have breakfast there so don't know if this was an aberration or their usual standard.

The area is very convenient for the smart bit of West London, and there is a range of good places to eat within a few minutes walk of the hotel. It's also two minutes from the tube and there's a taxi rank right outside. ",4,2014,03,10

The area is phenomenal, beautiful and with plenty of amenities.  Steps from Royal Albert Hall, the Science Museum, cafes, restaurants, etc..  The staff cannot be friendlier or more helpful.  Our room was extremely comfortable but on the smaller side.  Appreciated the complimentary mini bar stocked with waters and sodas and the free wifi.  Small things, yes, but becoming increasingly rare these days.  What makes this place is the location and that they cannot do enough to make your stay pleasant and comfortable.  The Ampersand is a real gem and we will be back!",5,2014,03,08

129,Loved it ,"We stayed here for two nights. From the moment we walked to the front doors we were greeted by very pleasant attentive staff. I loved the decor, I loved the rooms, the bar and the cocktails. 
The drawing room is a must , coffee or tea and cake. I can not fault this hotel. We will return, I hope ! ",5,2014,03,05
129,Gorgeous and luxurious,"Excellent location and extremely helpful and friendly staff. The atmosphere in the hotel was stylish and comfortable and would love to try the afternoon tea at the next visit. The room was spacious and very comfortable, quiet and peaceful. Top rating

129,Feb 2014,Stayed one night. Great service at the front desk. The receptionist was very polite and attentive. Booked us an excellent tapas restaurant at short notice. Great location. Rooms are fine. Cost of the room is predictably high for this part of London so by definition not expensive in relative terms. Would recommend. Cannot comment on food as we did not eat in the hotel. ,4,2014,03,05
129,Very stylish & great location,"I love the style of this hotel (a bit Scandinavian) and the location is just perfect (South Kensington tube station) with the museums as a backdrop. 
Although the breakfast restaurant is in the basement, is has a nice & relaxed atmosphere. There could be a bit more choice at the buffet, but then it's a smaller luxury hotel with a very fair price, so that's absolutely fine.

Only 'negative': As with many upper-market hotels, many of the staff are ""over-friendly"", which feels fake, including unnecessary small-talk. I prefer a more authentic, down-to-earth style of service (which can still be very kind and caring).

In total good value-for-money! (Hey, it's London and the Ampersand is a high-class hotel with a perfect location. Believe me, I've been to other much more expensive hotels in London, which offer less while charging more.)",4,2014,03,02

129,Lovely,"I recently spent 2 nights at The Ampersand and it was great. The hotel is really quite easy to get to from Heathrow. I took the express train to Paddington and then the subway and was there is no more than 30 minutes. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was much better than I had anticipated. It was about the size I had pictured. The bed was very comfortable. The best part was the bathroom. They have radiantly heated tile floors. It may not seem like much, but it is a very nice touch that adds to the comfort of the room. The restaurant provided a very good breakfast before heading out to see the town. The only minor quibble I could see someone having is that you can sometimes feel the trains rolling by beneath you. I had no problem with it but I could see some people being put out. But there really isn't anything that can be done about that. I would not hesitate to recommend The Ampersand to anyone wanting to find a great hotel in London.  

",5,2014,02,25
129,Excellent,"Just stayed a single night, but the hotel was wonderful! An superb room, friendly staff, and unbeatable location (the tube is 2 minutes' walk). Not cheap, but worth the money. A few minor quibbles about the room: the sound-proofing between the floors could be better, and the TV in the bath(!) was a bit temperamental. Would definitely stay there again.

Excellent restaurant -Aperro, well stocked library, and spacious games room.  Very well located near a variety of museums, shops, restaurants and cafes.  I would highly recommend it!",5,2014,02,24
129,Half term visit,"This hotel is excellent. Very well located. Near everything you could possibly want. I highly recommend this hotel. Rooms are a wee bit small but the quality is suburb. It is near the tube line and there are many coffee shops/restaurants in the area

129,Lovely Hotel,"The Ampersand is in a great location for the Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Victoria & Albert Museum as they are only a 5 minute walk away.  For those wishing to go to Harrods, that is only a ten minute walk away.  In the surrounding area are numerous cafes and restaurants catering for all food tastes.
All members of staff that i dealt with were incredibly friendly and helpful and the hotel itself is incredibly clean.  My room was lovely and had the best shower!

129,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff,"This was a great hotel! The staff were wonderful, very friendly, and extremely helpful! There was an offer that was listed through trip advisor (you had to call to claim the offer) and they could not find what offer I was talking about but they upgraded my room anyway! The location is wonderful! It is very close to the South Kensington tube station and plenty of cabs right outside the hotel for your transportation needs. The bathroom was amazing and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The room was large and the wifi was dependable. The hotel is beautifully decorated and that carries into the rooms! I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2014,02,23
129,Fantastic,"As always I'll keep this simple and straight to the point.
1. Lovely looking hotel - inside and outside. 
2. Small lobby area with a boutique feel. Great looking dining area although we didn't eat there. 
3. Very friendly reception staff who greeted us each time we passed their desk.
4. The rooms are quite small and we upgraded to the deluxe room (1 up from standard). However, they are modern, with a modern well kitted out bathroom and a TV which is easy to navigate and has the channels you would want to watch.
5. Taxi rank directly outside the hotel.
6. 20 second walk from South Kensington tube.
7. Ample bars and restaurants just outside the hotel door so plenty of options for drinking / eating.

My only gripe.....

1.  Every couple of minutes you detect the room vibrating ever so slightly which I am guessing is a tube train approaching/leaving S.Krnsington station. I was concerned this may keep me awake or wake me up in the morning but it didn't.

Would I stay here again? YES I WOULD. DEFINITELY. ",5,2014,02,23
129,Excellent stay,"All over our stay at the Ampersand was excellent.

But I'm a little disapointed that we didn't get an upgrade on our room, since I'm a member of Small Luxury hotels of the world, and they promised an upgrade if available on our first stay.

Otherwise the hotel was very good, the staff was very service minded and had a good knowledge of absolutely everything I asked for :)

There were some noise from the traffic outside our room, but during the night time there were mostly a few buses and some taxies that passed through.

I would highly recomend this hotel for everyone :)

129,A jewel,"Friendly, accommodating staff and modern touches were a real plus during our stay.  A unique hotel. A terrific location near tube and museums.  Would definitely stay there again.  One tip-  ask for quiet room as there is a noisy nightclub across the street with drunken rowdies howling into the wee hours on weekends.  Otherwise, a jewel of a place.  Restaurant delightful also.

Almost everything we needed was in the room and whatever wasn't was there within seconds with a quick call down to reception who couldn't do enough for you.

Its very easy to fill out these surveys giving the same rating to every question, but never have i stayed somewhere i felt deserved full marks in every aspect from service to amenities to comfort. I am already planning my next booking at The Ampersand.",5,2014,02,18

129,everything is perfect,"The hotel is excellent! It looks like after renovation. Like a new one. The staff is very friendly, polite and attentive. Although we got an upgraded room it was small enough. When we entered our room we found a postcard with a greeting written by hand. They offer a delivery of fresh newspapers in the mornings. Also you can find newspapers in Apero restaurant. Air condition system works well. The room had very good acoustic insulation. The floor in the bath room is heated. Breakfasts were not included in the price room but we had breakfasts at the hotel restaurant (Apero restaurant) at own expense. Also we had dinner there. Everything was excellent. The restaurant is very good and cozy. Food is great but they had a very restricted beer choice, mostly Italian (as far as I understood). There is a dining room in the hotel where you can have a cup of tea with cakes. The decoration of the dining room is excellent. The staff in Apero restaurant and dining room is very affable and polite. Location is great. Exhibition Road is a 5-minute walk from the hotel. There is a tube station and a bus station near to the hotel. There are a lot of museums and notable residents not far from the hotel. Hyde park, Green park and Piccadilly are also not far from the hotel. 
The hotel offers a transfer from/to Heathrow airport (45 pounds one way by e-class Mercedes) or from/to Gatwick airport (80 pounds one way by e-class Mercedes). 
There a lot of umbrellas at the entrance of the hotel and in the rooms. It‚Äôs very prudently since the weather is rainy. Wifi is good and free of charge. Juices and water in a room is free of charge. Not counting the fact that the room was very small everything else in the hotel is perfect.",5,2014,02,17
129,Really great stay!,"The Ampersand hotel is very conveniently located, has friendly, professional staff, a great restaurant and tea room, and well-appointed rooms. The best part about my stay was the amazingly comfortable bed. I actually cancelled plans to take a nap in this comfy dream of a bed. The hotel is whimsically decorated, and each room has a fun theme related to the nearby hotels and gardens. There are free drinks in the rooms, a morning paper, and the provided toiletries are nice as well. The staff were always there to answer questions, and always said hello or offered a little conversation. The only downsides were the occastionally slow WiFi and fairly high prices for food (but it was all yummy!). All in all, a really great stay!",5,2014,02,17

The suites and rooms are lovely and spacious. We stayed here with our friends, who also loved it.

Very clean, modern, and nicely decorated!  Definitely a 5 star experience!",5,2014,02,12
129,"Affordable, clean and comfortable","I visited the Ampersand Hotel with my boyfriend and another couple for 1 night.  We parked directly beside the hotel and a member of staff parked our vehicle in a nearby car park for us. We were both upgraded to suites upon arrival.  

The suite was compact but fully equipped with an open plan kitchen and living area, bedroom and bathroom.  The non-alcoholic drinks and snacks in the mini bar were complimentary.  

I found the grey carpet in the living area a little dark for the space but otherwise the hotel is tastefully decorated.  The light fitting at the heart of the hotel is a beautiful feature.  The library and games room is a fun touch.

I loved the provision of reading materials in the rooms, including magazines and a number of books.  On the bedside table was an enduring hardback containing bedtime stories.  The bathroom had excellent facilities, including a free standing bath with television and free standing shower.  Again, nicely decorated but quite compact.

Breakfast is served in the quaint restaurant, however, it took a long time to arrive after ordering.  We had time to finish our coffees and orange juices and order a second round.  

I would recommend staying here if you are looking for an affordable, clean, comfortable hotel, that isn't the main attraction of your trip.",4,2014,02,12

To make my Dad's 80th extra special, we were upgraded which was a fantastic way to start our stay. The decor of our rooms and the entire hotel is fabulous: bold, arty, creative and colourful. And the whole place is immaculately clean.
We all commented on how comfortable the beds were, how quiet the hotel was despite the central location, and we also LOVED the afternoon tea in the hotel. The cake and sandwich selection was impressive, fresh and tasty.

129,"Fantastic service, super friendly staff!","This was our first stay booked through Small Luxury Hotels and it exceeded our expectations. The most noticeable difference was the good service and very friendly staff, from the greeting at the front desk to the door staff every time we left and returned. We were in a deluxe room which was still relatively small but just enough room for suitcases and 2 people. 

I relieved my scones craving in their Drawing Room for afternoon tea and it was delicious - we were also given a complimentary glass of Mo√´t champagne for booking with SHL which we could have anywhere at anytime. Breakfast was also by good but not included in our room rate as we thought there would be better food options outside the hotel but we did end up having breakfast on our last morning - we ordered a la carte (turkish eggs, bacon sandwich) and it was tasty,as good as any cafe nearby. 

I am often in London for business and have stayed in many 5* star hotels but for pleasure, this was a definite winner - for location, service and general ambience. I wish this hotel was on our corporate travel list! If coming back to London for leisure, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,02,05

129,The loveliest English hotel!,"If you're looking for a nice hotel where you can feel you are most welcome, don't miss the Ampersand. GREAT Staff, everyone, I mean every single person was extremely kind and helpful. I would like to thank them all for their smiles and their guidance. We stayed for 9  happy nights. We had asked for a smoking room and these are at the top floor. The first room we were shown to had a very small closet so we asked for another. They immediately showed us a new one which was larger but still small closet! It seems that all this floor has this problem as our daughter's room which was smaller had an adequate closet. But we preferred to stay at the top floor as my husband is a heavy smoker. This was the ONLY problem in this hotel, but you must abstain from smoking if you want the best room. As for the rest of my review, very nice design, the lounge is  so cute, the hotel is very clean and... the best is the food! They have got a great restaurant, the Apero that we fell in love with. I am going to review it right after this as it really deserves it. One more very important thing, great location as it is a few meters from the bus station, the taxi station and the underground station where you can take all the destinations you need. I must also say that were not disturbed by the underground sound as was relayed by some persons on TripAdvisor but maybe you should ask for this as we did stress on this point when we made the reservations. Very long review but they deserve it.   Great job, the Ampersand!",5,2014,02,02

129,The Best in London,"This hotel was a wonderful find (thanks Tripadvisor).  I traveled alone and decided to go all out for my first solo trip to London.  I had dreamed about it forever so I wanted everything to be perfect.  The Ampersand Hotel was the best hotel decision I could have made.  The staff was amazing, went above and beyond to help make my stay an absolute dream.  I was in London for 8 days and his was my second hotel there during this trip.  Let just say that this hotel was leaps and bounds above my first when it came to service, cleanliness and location location location.  I checked in a bit earlier than my room was ready and the front desk took care of my luggage.  I walked around the area and realized that I was just a hop and a skip away from the South Kensington tube station and just a few blocks away from the natural history museum, the V & A , Harrods and so much more.  I walked around and found charming little cafe's and restaurants and had lunch at a cute little Thai place called Patara.  When I returned my room was ready and I was in heaven.  I had gone all out and booked myself a deluxe room and I was in for a treat!  It was beautiful with images of birds and books on Ornithology.  The best part was when I stepped into the bathroom and discovered that the floors were heated!  I was in heaven! There was a rubber ducky in the bath, which was a cute touch.  Being from out of the country, I was living on WiFi and imagine my surprise when they told me that the WiFi was complementary along with the minibar which was stocked up with juices, water, milk and soda!  The small complaint that I have is that there was hardly any closet space for my dresses, but honestly, I feel like such a brat complaining as this place was like my very own private palace.  I was on the fourth floor and there was a school right below my window so in the mornings I'd wake up naturally at around 8 am from the sound of children playing. That part of the hotel is nice and quiet at night and I much preferred that to being in one of the rooms closer to the street.There is so much to do around the neighborhood and the tube is in such a convenient location.  The room was nice and big and so very clean and the staff were all so sweet. I felt very safe coming and going and always so very welcome even when I asked dumb touristy questions.  I won't be staying anywhere else the next time I go back to London.  The Ampersand spoiled me completely and I was so sad to leave.  I definitely recommend this hotel as it is worth every penny.  Well done Ampersand.  You'll see me again!",5,2014,01,20
129,Great Location,Fabulous hotel in a great location. Attention to detail is spot on. If you like a hotel with an intimate feel this hotel won't disappoint. My only advise is to opt for a superior room as any room below may feel a tad on the small side. ,5,2014,01,20
129,Great location,"For our visit to the Albert hall this was a great location.  The public rooms were very elegant and stylish.  our room was a little on the small side and rather dark.  No bath, only a shower.  I was looking forward to the tearoom, but when we arrived feeling hungry it was rather chaotic, so didn't bother again.  Breakfast again, was rather chaotic with odd systems in place, and having to explain at length that we had booked and who we were, and the ordering system very confusing as to what was included etc.  again, we didn't bother after the first day.
On the positive, the quiet at night was truly impressive for a London hotel, which for me as a light sleeper was very impressive.",4,2014,01,19
129,Wonderful hotel staff and service,"My other half booked this for my birthday and was terrified as I do site reviews of five star hotels for a living. I'm very pleased to report that he had no cause for concern at all!
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel like we were the only people in the hotel. We got there a bit early and were offered complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby (proper tea leaf tea too!) and we barely had time to drink it before our room was ready. My husband had happened to mention when he made the booking that it was my birthday and just before we went up to our room the delightful receptionist discretely wished me a happy birthday and offered us complimentary champagne - how lovely!
The room was a very pleasant surprise - elegant decor, a good size, fabulous comfy king size bed with pristine linen and delicious amenities in the bathroom. The room service menu was comprehensive and inexpensive. The hotel itself is ideally situated just a minutes walk from South Kensington tube station so a perfect location from which to explore London.
Every time I left or returned to the hotel that day the doorman and reception staff smiled and wished me a happy birthday. I couldn't have been made to feel any more special. This level of customer service is something that every hotel wishes they could produce but only a rare few actually manage it. I would return to The Ampersand in a heartbeat!",5,2014,01,18

129,Tastefully Done,"While Ampersand is commonly reviewed on its small room size you won't end of minding it a bit.  Like many hotels in Europe the room is indeed quite tight but the efficiency of the space is genius and we weren't at all uncomfortable.  In fact we were more comfy in this beautifully designed space than most larger accommodations.  And we stayed here a full week!
The service was friendly and welcoming and the location was perfect in every way, close to the tube, great restaurants, a breakfast place across the street and great shopping.  In the evenings we took a stroll past the Victoria and Albert Museum, enjoying the architecture at sunset.  We will definitely stay again.",5,2014,01,15
129,An excellent hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights in Jan and were upgraded to a higher quality room because of my husband's birthday.  The room itself, the food and the staff made staying at The Ampersand a wonderful experience.               
      ",5,2014,01,15
129,Better than Expected,"Location was super just a stone throw away from the South Kensington Subway and moving around London become so easy. Taking a train back to Heathrow was easy too and if you pay about 55 Pound by London cab you will be in airport within less than 40 min.

Stay only 1 night was really a pity however, we manage to took 2 hi-tea in the hotel. The Hi-Tea lounge is highly popular among the local thus is better to book in advance and the spread is really good. Great Ambience and with lots of modern painting. 

From the front desk to the room, we are so surreal by the hotel decoration and service render.
Staff always eager to help and make our stay so comfy. They even ensure we had 3 sets of all amenities when they learn we are a group of trio travelling. 

I definitely will recommend my friends who's travelling to London to stay this property.",5,2014,01,14
129,Lovely Boutique hotel,It is a beautiful hotel with excellent facilities.  The bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept in whilst travelling.  Professional courteous staff.

Close to South Kensington tube, Museums, Hyde Park , Albert Hall all very close. Harrods just up the road

129,Whimsical Boutique Style in Superb Location,"The Ampersand Hotel is one of our favourite hotels, with a unique style, an excellent location and friendly, helpful customer service.

We spent 3 nights in a Deluxe Studio room which we found to be larger than we had expected for London and very, very comfortable. We had an excellent sized bathroom with shower and bathtub, together with built in TV. Our bright and airy room had windows onto Harrington Road, yet we experienced no street noise at all, making for a very pleasant stay.
 
We had dinner at Apero, which had a lovely menu - breakfast here is also very good, and the Drawing Room lovely for Afternoon Tea. 

We would stay at the Ampersand again in a heartbeat - so well located and comfortable, and we love the decor and the themes throughout the hotel.

We are returning to London again this May and would love to stay here again, but sadly the rates have increased significantly since our last stay several months ago. I guess this is not unexpected though, given the fabulous reputation the Ampersand has gained since first opening.",5,2014,01,08
129,Design with a homy feel,"I chose The Ampersand Hotel for my husband's Birthday weekend in London. Apparently the deluxe room was not a good option as it was very small, pipes in the bathroom were making horrible noises ans the windows let the rain water get into the room. So we were moved to the suite and from this moment we experienced such a nice stay in the hotel. We loved the design yet the homy feel of the interior, service is very nice and helpful and you can really feel welcomed. I definitely recommed, even if the first experiences were not quite ok.",4,2014,01,08

129,An exceptional London hotel in South Kensington,"I was taken immediately by this hotel's look when I perused its website photos.  The decor looked stylish, fun and very tasteful. The location was exceptionally convenient-- just across the street from the South Kensington tube which whisks you straight to the city's prime locations for fun and shopping.  It is a few blocks from the major museums near Kensington Park and a nice 10-minute walk from Knightsbridge (Harrods, Harvey Nichols) and Sloane Square.  The menus for its tea salon and restaurant looked great. 
The anticipation was such that I hoped the Ampersand would actually live up to expectations.  It exceeded expectations.  The service was top-notch from the moment I first sent an email inquiry. The staff helped procure some hard-to-find tickets for the Harry Potter studio tour during the height of holiday season and also made some excellent restaurant recommendations that fit exactly what we were looking for.  A sign of the hotel's commitment to hospitality is the free juices, waters, soft drinks and cookies that it offers in their rooms' minibars daily.

The food in the drawing room (for tea, coffee and exceptional pastries), the restaurant and through room service were all excellent.  Wonderful cafes for alternative eating are a stone's throw away.

I cannot say enough about the decor.  You just have to go online and check out the photos. The style was whimsical, fresh and tasteful--- in the rooms as well as the common areas. Everything was high quality.  We loved the library and game room downstairs with old-fashioned games and even a ping-pong table that pried our teenaged sons off their electronics.

It is quite pricey as all good London hotels are, but you get what you pay for. I was able to give it five stars for value as we were able to take advantage of their three-nights-for-the-price-of-two special.  It was worth the splurge and the staff could not have been more welcoming  or helpful.  We would stay at The Ampersand again in a heartbeat",5,2014,01,04
129,Outstanding,"This is an exceptional hotel with a quality of room that exceeds almost every room I have stayed in.  If you get the chance stay in room 117.  Would recommend to anyone if the price was right.  Outstanding!

129,Perfect Location!! Comfortable Rooms + Great common area,"We stayed here 2 nights on a recent trip to London.  We wanted to stay off the beaten path and yet have access to all what London has to offer.  It doesn't get better than this location - right on the Piccadilly line (with access to Circle and District lines), run paths through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, gastropubs and bars in close proximity. While the rooms itself were smallish, they were perfectly appointed and the common areas including the game room and library in the basement were perfect for late night hangout post partying in the area.  I could definitely see ourselves staying here again.  ",5,2014,01,03
129,Ampersand (Dec 2013),"This is a gem, a well-looked after hotel in a great location. My room was cozy and welcoming, and well-heated. The complementary juices/soft drinks were a nice bonus. Hotel staff were helpful and efficient.",5,2014,01,03
129,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here on new years eve with my boyfriend. We were welcomed by a friendly girl on reception and she checked us in very quickly. The room was modern, clean and I loved the speakers in the bathroom! We enjoyed breakfast in bed - which wasn't too pricy. Parking was not a problem as we managed to park down the little side street next to the hotel and pay on the meter. I would highly recommend.",5,2014,01,03
129,Uber stylish and fantastic location,"I was sold as soon as I saw the Ampersand hotel website. For a London boutique hotel I really thought the room prices weren't too expensive. The Ampersand is really targeted at people who don't want to stay in your bog standard chain hotel and want something with a little style and like thought to have been put into its design.

The service was fantastic in my opinion. Front desk at check in and check out was helpful and professional. The bar and wait staff were friendly and again very professional. 

I booked a double room for myself, which I will admit was on the small side but I knew what to expect when I booked the room so had no complaints about the size. Bed was super comfortable, good quality linens. Only negative feedback I have is that there wasn't enough lighting in the room. It didn't get a huge amount of natural light and the lighting available still kept the room a bit dark, but that wasn't anything major.

The location is unbeatable. The hotel is literally across the road from South Kensington station that is on the Picadilly (Heathrow) and District/Circle line so you can pretty much get yourself wherever you want. I walked to Knightsbridge for some shopping and it took me less than 10 minutes. Hyde park and museums are also within walking distance. 

Oooh food, I didn't get a chance to eat at Apero or have high tea - that is my one regret. When I was researching hotels to stay, it was the menus at the hotel that really tempted me. The breakfast spread was delicious (try the Caramelised Pear & Creamy Fudge yoghurt - amazing!) and there is a seriously good variety for you to choose from. 

I was travelling alone to London for a friends wedding and could not have been more happier with the Ampersand. I like pretty things, I like to treat myself, I like being treated well and it ticked all of these boxes. Highly recommended, just be realistic about London prices and the size of hotel rooms and you won't be disappointed :)",5,2014,01,02

129,Second stay and still impressed,"We chose this hotel for our NYE's stay as we have been here previously and really enjoyed it. We booked a Deluxe room again as these are more spacious than the standard rooms, this time the room was actually bigger than last time. Couple of things if you haven't been before, most rooms only have a shower so speak to them in advance if you want/need a room with a bath. The rooms don't have irons in them but within 5 minutes of requesting. We had breakfast in the hotel this time and it was really nice and reasonably priced for a hotel, the main restaurant was really busy so they served us in the drawing room upstairs which was actually nicer than being in the busy restaurant! The only thing that let them down was that we reported one sink in the bathroom was blocked before we left for dinner and reception said they would get maintenance to look at it while we were out, I don't know if they came or not but it was still blocked when we got back! I still think this hotel offers the best value 5* in London.",4,2014,01,01

129,Excellent hotel with an excellent location,"I stayed here with several friends during the week of thanksgiving (in the US). Two of us stayed in the superior room and the other in a deluxe room. Even though we were members of the slh loyalty program, we were unable to get an upgrade at check in. The hotel was actually sold out for the weekend, but never crowded. The superior room was nice. A bit small, but still had plenty of room. The bathroom was large and had a nice walk in shower. The floors were heated, so you never had to worry about bare feet on cold tile. The mini fridge in the room was a nice touch (with complimentary water/juices/soda) as was the free wifi.  The bed was comfy and had plenty of pillows. The only ""problem"" we had was trying to figure out the thermostat. It was quite warm in our room and we had trouble getting it to cool down. After calling downstairs, we had our answer and the room became a comfortable temp. The location of the hotel was perfect...across the street from a pret and Starbucks (quick breakfast) and steps from the Kensington station tube stop. Three great lines run through there, so we never had a problem getting around. The hotel was also surrounded by bus stops....which was great if you needed to catch a bus, but impossible to get picked up or dropped off. Minor inconvenience for a great location. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,12,30
129,Overpriced and underwhelmed,"My daughter and I arrived mid December for an 8 day stay. The service in the hotel was non existent. The door person never opened the door, the wait staff were actually quite rude until they found out we were in house guests and the front of house spoke to us twice in our entire stay. We had arrived from an 8 day stay in Paris and the difference in the level of service was immense. I would not recommend this hotel. ",2,2013,12,29
129,very nice hotel,"We liked our stay very much. The hotel is very well located and you can walk to V&A, National History Museum as well as all shops in Knightsbridge within a view minutes. The room was stylish and clean and the whole hotel is very tastefully decorated. The staff has been very friendly and helpful, everything that we asked for was organized promptly and the have been very friendly too. The food at the restaurant was delicious! The only downside was that one could hear the tube rattle underneath us but it was ok, not too loud and sleep was no problem at all. We will come back next time as we did like it very much, but ask for a room on a higher floor. ",4,2013,12,29
129,Great Location with Fun Decor,So glad we happened across this gem of a hotel. Only spent one night but will definitely return on future trips to London.  Wonderful shower. Close to the South Kensington Underground stop and therefore all the museums and shopping. Would give 5 stars however I am against rating inflation. ,4,2013,12,28
129,Short Stay,"Having found this on-line for a one night stay in London it was certainly a good choice. We didn't actually use the hotel that much as we were out and about most of the time but the service was very good, the room very comfortable including a fantastic bed. Normally staying in hotels for a night or two I don't sleep so well in a strange bed but this bed was so comfortable that sleeping was no problem. I can also highly recommend the breakfast, a good range to choose from and mine was well cooked and very tasty!",4,2013,12,27
129,Highly recommended hotel,"I normally stay for my business trip but this time I took my young son with me for vacation. As usual, the high standard of hospitality made our stay very comfortable and happy.

129,A small luxury hotel that lives up to its description.,"This hotel is a haven of calm in South  Kensington with impeccable service and a warm welcome. We were upgraded on arrival, which was a lovely surprise and, as I travelled ahead of my partner, I really welcomed the personal and attentive service on checking in. The staff on reception went out of their way to help, even by running out into the road to flag down a cab for me later in the evening.
The room was well designed and had all one could need with nice touches like a small carton of fresh milk in the mini bar, and included complementary soft drinks and fresh coffee with luxury biscuits on the tray.
Breakfast is taken in the basement caf√©/bistro and I have to say was the nicest atmosphere I have ever experienced in London. We were ushered to a little bay (very special and cosy) - milk was in the little school milk bottles (memories of primary school!), the selection of food was excellent and the service helpful and polite.
Would we return? Yes, absolutely we will!",5,2013,12,23

129,Great location (if you can tolerate noise),"This hotel has a great modern feel to it, with a keypad to get into your room. The room my wife and I stayed in was good for two people. As Americans, we were excited to see the hotel already provided an adapter for all of our electronics.

The main issue with the hotel is just the noise from the street below. It wasn't bad enough to wake us up at night or too early in the morning. But be prepared to deal with some noise if you stay here. 

The staff were very friendly and had great knowledge of the area. If you are looking for a smaller hotel for a more romantic experience then this is a good place to stay. If you are traveling with a large group of people, I'd look elsewhere. 

This hotel is maybe 30 seconds away from the South Kensington tube station, and maybe a 15 minute walk from Harrods. The location is quite good.",4,2013,12,22

They did not receive the company prepayment, they gave me the smallest room I have ever witnessed, avoid room 417, your suitcase does not fit in the room and has to lie on the floor of the both room, which by the way is not big! When I asked to change room they gave me the one for people on wheelchairs ! 
The personal is efficient but super snob, hey they are in South Kensington! Which I do not care for, central London I will be back , so many great hotels there, where room may be small but properly thought through, Nordic design vs British 10-0!",1,2013,12,21

129,Brilliant hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel in the heart of London.  My wife and I spent a couple of nights here, enjoyed a Christmas afternoon tea that would put the Ritz or Savoy to shame and the staff were just wonderful.  The only slight let down was the breakfast where the best bet is to go a la carte unless you have a huge appetite for the full English or want to pay ¬£12 for a somewhat disappointing selection for continental breakfast.  Apart from this, fantastic!",5,2013,12,20
129,Not as good as I thought,"Stayed in the cheapest double room, priced at ¬£174 for 1 night (booking.com). Not that cheap if you ask me. And the room is very small! The room hardly fits a double bed, a small double bed I might ad. The smallest hotel room I have ever seen! The bathroom however is not small but ok.

The room is nice designed. Desk is like the room, very small! There also is a window in the room. Yeah you guessed right, it's very small too! I ordered a steak from roomservice. And ""surprise"", it was also very small. But the bill was not... It was very expensive food, ¬£20,80! It was too much muchrooms and the chips were way too big. I like my chips ""Mcdonald's size"" not ""tree size"". Chips was not so good either. But the steak was good.

WARNING:
They rip you off when you pay. They didn't ask me if I wanted to pay the room with my local currency or ¬£, they choosed NOK of course. If I pay with my local currency (NOK) they earn more money (depends on how long you stay). It's not loads of money but it's important how you are presenting yourself as a hotel to the customers. And this is very unprofessional! This is only the second hotel I've experienced in all my life who has done this! Only when I asked I knew that I was paying in NOK, I told the guy immediately that I wanted to pay in ¬£. He was not happy..

I have stayed in many hotels all around the world. The bed is very important and for the most part I sleep very well in all hotels at all price ranges. Only a few times the bed has not been good and it happened again at this hotel.

Even though at times I could feel the vibrations and hear the hum of the underground trains, this did not disturb me. I found the afternoon tea better value than the breakfast: my friends and I agreed that the scones were the best we've had in a long time. The young folks at the front desk were cheerful, helpful and contributed to the overall relaxed atmosphere.  I am looking forward to returning in the summer.",4,2013,12,20
129,ICDP London WS,"Short Business trip, served purpose well... Would consider booking for personal vacation as well.Great Location, comfortable beds, helpful staff. Breakfast buffet so so, but the French Toast on the menu was excellent
      ",4,2013,12,20
129,Best hotel ever,"We stayed here for five nights but I wish it had been longer. The staff here catered to our every whim, even when I wanted cornflakes and bananas at 7pm. They even came to help us with our plug converter. The room was unbelievably comfortable, maybe a bit small but that is probably because the bed was so massive and lovely. Everything was modern and very clean and the bathroom had under floor heating. Fresh bathrobes and slippers were provided every day, along with massive bath towels. The location couldn't be beat, and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. I felt so comfortable here. The only thing I wasn't super impressed with was the restaurant downstairs but the room service food was excellent. I will stay here again every time I am in London.",5,2013,12,19
129,Nice Relaxed Ambience,"Good area ""petit France"" with good selection of cafe's restaraunts close by, as well as Natural History Museum, the V&A and Harrods (Taxi from Paddington c ¬£12)
The hotel food offering was very high quaility, nice dining area, very good breakfast/lunch etc 
Decor and ambience very pleasing, and staff relaxed and friendly.
Comfortable beds, good sleep quality - despite the odd ""tube rumble""
Minor drawbacks were - Room size of standard twin - very small (as small as I have come across in numerous stays in London) which was disappointing.
General cleanliness very good, only let down by some minor housekeeping issues.
Overall would return, but would specify a larger room next time.
A very nice area / hotel for a couples / friends weekend.  ",4,2013,12,18
129,Luxury,"On arriving to the hotel we were greeted by not one but two doormen. Check in was a breeze and the rooms were to die for, under floor heating in the bathroom, which was such a treat! We had a deluxe room and it was spacious as city hotels go. A highlight of our stay was the comfyness of the beds and pillows, this might sound odd. I don't normally take too much heed but they stood out we even found ourselves talking about the comfyness during the day and looking forward to getting into bed that night! The staff at the ampersand were unreal, so friendly really made you feel like VIPS. You WILL NOT regret booking the ampersand!",5,2013,12,17
129,Wonderful boutique experience,"In this imaginatively and beautifully decorated hotel you will receive a warm welcome from friendly staff. My room had a music decor and nice walk-in rain shower. Location is great right accross from SKensington tube station.
I greatly enjoyed the drawing room where I enjoyed a drink, tea looked delicious! I recomend the hotel for business, couples and families alike.",5,2013,12,16
129,Great value for money boutique style hotel,"Professional, young, helpful and enthusiastic staff. Nice rooms, with good quality beds and pillows. Nice bathroom with shower. Good airco system. Breakfast room also very nice (not standard), good choice and quality of food. Also good place for business meeting or relaxing with coffee and pastries. ",5,2013,12,16
129,"Central location, fantastic staff","We stayed at The Ampersand as a belated 40th weekend away for my husband, we went up with another couple. 
We booked through Booking.com as a package as we went to a show while we were in London.
The rooms that were available when I booked were 1 x standard double and 1 x superior double. The only criticism I have for the whole weekend/hotel is that the standard double (room 2) was tiny and the view was not good. The superior double was a much better room size and a great view (room 514 I think it was).
However on saying that we did not spend much time at all in our rooms. 
The staff were so lovely, very polite and helpful and the overall experience of being at this hotel was excellent. 
It is walking distance to The Natural History Museum (which was beautiful with all the decorations up for Christmas), walking distance to Knightsbridge and the South Kensington tube is very close to the hotel. 
Lots of amenities close by.
The restaurant at the hotel where we had brunch was also excellent with very polite lovely staff.",5,2013,12,15
129,Superb all round hotel,"Brilliant location and service. Well worth a visit. Close to the underground and near to lots of good restaurants. Staff very helpful. Good value rate and very nice rooms. Great cocktail bar with good choice.

129,"Great location, great decor, great staff",I always choose to stay at The Ampersand when visiting London. It's a beautifully decorated hotel in a great location and the staff are very friendly and professional. I've never had any disappointments during my stays there ,5,2013,12,15
129,Indulgent weekend at The Ampersand,"It was our annual get together, my daughter and my sister and myself. We normally stay in Edinburgh but we decided to indulge ourselves with a stay at The Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington. The hotel was meant as a perfect base for a visit to the museums, but the hotel itself turned out to be a wonderful experience. We stayed in one of the suites which was ample size for the three of us. The Drawing Room was wonderful - all those cakes -and the waiter extremely patient and helpful. We also sampled the good and cocktails in Apero downstairs. Again, our experience was first class. The hotel were most helpful in arranging a driver to collect my sister from the airport, which saved a lot of stress on both sides - though we were right across the road from the tube station as it turned out. Overall - a bit on the pricey side - but for a one off treat - definitely worth it.",5,2013,12,14
129,Pros & Cons & More,"Pros: Great Area - south kensington tube nearby, several museums, restaurants and coffee shops
Cons: traffic is a mess there - use the tube, if it is working

Pros: Allowed me to checkin early
Cons: Charged me to do so = 1/2 of room rate for checking in 2 hours early

Pros: forgot my charger - allowed me to use one no charge
Cons: none

Pros: Clean Superior Room - nice bathroom.
Cons:LOUD WALL SHAKING NOISE AT 1 AM!!! This continued off an on for about an hour! Called the front desk - I put the phone to the wall, desk manager said he could hear it - it then stopped, he said to call back if happened again - I did - they didn't seem surprised. Offered to move us to another room to sleep - really @ 1 AM!  We said no - just make the noise stop! They should NOT have sold that room aware of the noise!!! 

Can't fit a chair in front of the desk - NO ROOM! A desk where you can NOT sit to do any work - really???
There is not enough room between the end of the bed and the desk to fit a chair! Barely enough room to walk. But too much room to sit on the bed and work at the desk! Take some room from bathroom, so a chair can fit at the desk!!! 

Just 2 bath towels for 2 people in bathroom. Don't take a shower at night and AM or you will use the same damp towel in the AM!!! 

This is a cute themed boutique hotel in a great area. Make sure you are not in  room 509 or higher!!! There is a noise in the wall that wakes the dead!!

Not well insulated - we could hear street noise quite clearly.

Employees are very friendly and nice.",3,2013,12,14
129,Birthday Treat!,"We stayed at the Ampersand for my husband's London trip birthday treat last week. The hotel was just wonderful with delightful, helpful staff who made our stay so special and the most fabulous bedroom!!!
We would recommend the hotel to any couples on a short break.
Thanks again Ampersand!",5,2013,12,14
129,"Small rooms, nice hotel","Tiny room but completely forgiven for having a very comfy bed and great shower.  Only had breakfast, but it was nice to have my order taken and freshly made food rather than the standard buffet.  Very friendly staff - will be looking to book again next time I am in big town.",4,2013,12,14
129,good but not enough,"The level of the attendant at breakfast room and at the bar must be improved.
 A concierge service will be also better organized. The continental breakfast could also more rich even the quality is very good.

129,A lovely time out at the Ampersand,"Go to the Columbia road on Sunday morning. have a trip on the river Thames.
A diffrent view on new buildings. A walk in hyde Park or a visit to Kew Gardens.
Admire the Christmas decoration in Regent Street.
      
      ",5,2013,12,14
129,Good place to stay in South Kensington,"Booked the hotel for a 4 day long weekend based on a recommendation from a friend who had just returned.  Location was extremely convenient, staff friendly, room and bed very comfortable.  The restaurant worked out great for dinner and breakfast....  I read in some reviews about hearing the underground which to an extent is true.  Its just a low rumble which is barely noticable.  I am a very light sleeper and really didn't hear it and it certainly didn't disturb my sleep.  Same could be said about the traffic as we had a street side room.  Never heard it either.  Would definately stay again.",5,2013,12,13
129,Cool boutique hotel by South Kensington station,"Nice boutique hotel.  great tea room and place for meeting.  avoid room 7, it is too close to tube and too loud.  place looks really nice.  guest rooms are spacious.  beds were comfortable and liked the in-room complimentary beverages (water, soda, coffee)",4,2013,12,13
129,Fabulous stay in London,"The hotel was beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  The room was spacious and also beautiful and clean.  The staff was AMAZING. So friendly and helpful, and they treated us so kindly as we both celebrated our birthdays there.  They added so many special touches that we will never forget. Thank you Ampersand Hotel!",5,2013,12,12
129,Great location & excellent coffee,"Spent a long weekend (5 days) at the Ampersand, and in short, this is my new go-to location in London. The rooms are excellent, very spacious for London (had a Deluxe studio) and with very nice (design) touches. Nespresso in the room, some cookies, some interesting books. The tube station almost next door makes it great for going into the rest of London.

The espresso and cappuccino at breakfast are excellent, which is extremely rare in London (I've never had the pleasure of good coffee at a hotel in the UK I fear), the buffet is a little bit limited in its choice if your vegetarian, good quality though.

The only thing I found a little disappointing was the restaurant, it is good, however at a hotel this good I would expect a restaurant of similar statue. That said, it is great if you are there with kids or want something a little simpler in between all options the Michelin riddled neighborhood offers (strongly recommend Launceton Place at a 15 minute walk (or quick taxi ride) from the hotel",5,2013,12,12

129,A relaxed and indulgent stay!,"I booked this hotel for my Husband's 40th Birthday treat after reading previous reviews and was not disappointed. We had an excellent stay. We had a deluxe room as, at over six feet, I was worried my husband would not fit into a smaller one! The room was lovely and comfortable and we had a good 2 nights sleep even with a bit of traffic noise outside. Probably due to the very comfy beds and just feeling very relaxed there.
We ate in Apero, which was excellent and we will definitely be going back there to try the rest of the menu. 
Lunch in the drawing rooms was also good. 
The service was excellent and I can't fault our stay.The little box of petit fours for my husband's birthday was a nice surprise too which we ate in bed with a cup of tea the next morning! ",5,2013,12,12

129,A great hotel for a trip to London,I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. Staff were very professional but friendly. Rooms were lovely and very comfortable. Ideal position for many attractions. Apero restaurant menu limited at dinner,5,2013,12,10
129,Excellent service and great location,"We went over for a pre-christmas weekend and got us a deluxe room on a 3 for 2 nights deal. Unfortunately we were delayed a day because of weather but got the stay extended for another night by the great and very helpful staff.

The hotel is perfectly located by the south kensington tube station and is only a ten minute walk from harrods. They have the most service-minded hotel staff I have ever met including great concierge service and 24 hour room service. All this while remaining a cosy and comfortable hotel for all walks of life.

The rooms are on the small side, and typically british they lack a propper shower. But still stylishly decorated with comfortable bed and nice amenities including complimentary mini-bar and wifi.

Highly recommended and we are coming back. Though a pricey room we were very pleasantly surprised of the prices for room service and breakfast.

Tip - Keep an eye out for 3 for 2 and other deals as it is a pricey place.",5,2013,12,09
129,Lovely stay!,"I really liked everything about this hotel. Very clean and good service, great location The staff was very nice at all times and breakfast was just to our taste. I can't say that I found anything negative to say and I'm usually quite picky. We stayed in one of the larger rooms.",5,2013,12,06
129,"Great friendly hotel, professional and comfortable","A great boutique hotel, rooms very comfortable and modern, although not large have all the business traveller would require. Free wifi throughout. Friendly staff, clad in smart jeans and white shirts, that pay close attention to detail. Breakfast was good too, a nice continental spread at a reasonable (London prices) price. ",5,2013,12,05
129,Great location and very good hotel,"I stayed in the Ampersand in Oct or Nov (cant remember the exact date as im a frequent traveller) and was very impressed.

The hotel is right next to south ken tube so great access to the whole of London.  Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Chelsea and Kensington all within walking distance.  There are an abundance of places to eat, museums, bars and shops all around so you will be spoilt for choice.

I have stayed here twice and the rooms whilst lovely with great facilities are a little on the small side.  Its a new hotel so everything is immaculate inside.

Would recommend to stay here and the price was excellent for a 5*!",4,2013,12,05
129,Incredible Stay,"This was my first stay at the Ampersand. It got off to a slow start but that was made up for in short order. 

We arrived after a long trip from California on a Saturday morning around 11. The room was not ready (to be expected at that early hour), and the very friendly staff arranged to hold our bags while we went out to do some things and pass the time. Long story short, our room wasn't ready until after 2. Even though the staff at the desk kept asking housekeeping to make that room a priority, others kept getting ready before ours. That wait felt like an eternity, but once we got to the upgraded room, we had a heavenly stay. 

The great experience started with the fact that every person there was friendly and helpful. They even knew how to be helpful before I knew to ask a question. In addition, the meals we had in the hotel were delicious. The down comforters were wonderfully warm and light. The bathroom very modern. The TV provided not only access to many channels, but you could also use it for direct access to the internet, facebook, youtube, etc. 

Finally, the location is superb for all sorts of activities: musuems and parks are just minutes away on foot; the South Kensington Underground stop is a one minute walk...one and a half if you don't catch the traffic lights just right; there are nice restaurants and coffee houses a stone's throw away; in short, you just can't go wrong staying here. I will definitely make it my go-to hotel in London.

Thank you, Everyone, at the Hotel Ampersand.",5,2013,12,04
129,"Lovely hotel, great location","I have just returned from a great stay at the Ampersand. It's a well decorated, clean and modern hotel. The rooms are well designed - in particular the bathrooms. The staff are all very helpful. The room service food is great. The location is fantastic being just a few steps from South Kensington tube. 

I would definitely stay again. ",4,2013,12,04
129,Mixed experience,"This is our second stay at the Ampersand  but my first review. We were happy to go back and stop having had an excellent experience on our first stop in August this year.
 We  booked a basic room this time for a 1 night stop - off to Jules Holland at the RAH. We were upgraded to a superior room although this was very small so difficult to imagine what the original room size would have been. 
Check in was fine and the room was ready just into the afternoon which was great. As part of our package we were to get  2 glasses of champagne and petit fours - no sign of the champagne and petit fours arrived early evening   (And consisted of half a  mini cake , another small cake and a meringue. )
My biggest problem though was with the temperature of the room and the quality of the window . It was very cold and there was a terrible draught  coming from the window . We were on the first floor and  the lack of a decent window meant the room was very noisy indeed, but it was the uncomfortable draught which definitely spoilt our stay. I did mention it to the reception staff on check out but they did not seem very interested-  I said I would not accept that room if we stayed again and they said thy would put a note to that effect on our profile. Maybe they have regular complaints hence their apparent disinterest? Certainly didn't have a similar problem with our previous stay.
On a positive note, breakfast was fab. They have an excellent range of foods as part of the buffet and the quality of the food is good. 
We would probably stop again  but maybe this is a hotel to stay at in the summer  to avoid the cold.",3,2013,12,03
129,Impeccable | As good as it gets...and then some,"We're Asian, with 2 kids (6 & 2 year old)...but the service from the doorstep of the hotel, check-in, and up into our rooms was just impeccable. The receptionist, looking at our 2 kids, immediately recommended an itinerary for them (Science museum, Carnival up at Hyde Park), and asked whether she can make any dinner reservations and such. Service is top notch, and delivered with a genuine willingness to be helpful.
Room was very clean, elegant and homely. The TV in the bathtub was an added fun for the kids, who keep wanting to take a bath every time we head back to the hotel. Location was just unbeatable, walking distance to V&A, Science museum, Hyde Park, shopping via several stops by bus, and Tube is just steps away.",5,2013,12,03
129,Ampersand = Amazing,"From the moment I arrived, the service level was outstanding. Florin, Daniel and Alessandro all really helped me out. The design really comes together well with the different themes. The location is perfect. Tea in the Drawing Room was fantastic and the perfect way to wind down and spend my last day in London. My room was clean, spacious, and the heated floors in the bathroom were an added bonus!",5,2013,12,02
129,Easy choice,"After reading reviews on Trip Advispr we booked this hotel. In a nutshell; wonderful location, well appointed rooms, sparkling clean, charming staff, superb amenities, incredible restaurant downstairs, inviting Drawing Room... For South Kensington it really doesn't get much better. ",4,2013,12,01
129,One of the very best in London today...very thoughtful..,"Less than five minutes walk from South Ken tube station this is a very well located hotel indeed. It has been open for a little over a year now since a complete top to toe refurbishment which has been done to a very high standard indeed. Met at the door by a really helpful concierge type person who took my bag and took me across the hall to check in. This was done with care and real friendliness with questions designed to help. I felt easy and 'at home'. I was then shown to my room and the facilities explained fully, this is worth doing as it helped me understand the pretty hi tech facilities 'in room'. The room numbers are on a digital LED panel outside the room that you just have to put your room key up to to gain entry - no putting cards into slots here. Worked a treat as did the smart TV complete with keyboard which is hidden away very tidily. Wifi works well and is fast.

The rooms are very hi spec in all respects, hugely comfortable beds with duck down and feather mattress toppers - sublime.

Now, the bathroom was a total joy - all the major chains could learn a thing or two here as most of them demand that you get a dousing of cold water before getting the shower temperature right! Not here: the shower controls are sited so you can get the temperature just right before getting in and wet! Someone has clearly thought a lot about all of this and spent a deal of money getting it right and this comment is worthy of the rest of the room fixtures and fittings too.

So, what you get is windows you can open if you want to, super quiet AC, great beds, no noise, great bathrooms and robes and a Nespresso machine plus a fridge stocked with complimentary soft drinks that includes fresh milk - wow and golly, no sub standard UHT portions here. The unexpected turn-down evening service was a joy, I was out of the room at the time and came back to replenished tea and coffee and the cushions taken off the bed and the duvet 'turned down'. Just great.

Now to the Drawing Rooms on the ground floor: well I didn't take afternoon tea there but I saw it in action - quite a stupendous buffet of decorated cakes, canape stands 'like what' you used to find in 5 star hotels all those years ago - lots of happy faces partaking here in comfortable sofas and arm chairs.

Did I enjoy it here - yep, you bet I did and found no faults at all and went out of my way to say so on check out which was again oh so friendly and helpful. I was genuinely surprised at how good this hotel is and I will certainly be back.

We dined in the restaurant on Saturday evening - I will review this separately but do not miss out on this as it is again surprising and very, very good.

Sunday breakfast: a joy - unusual dishes and a great buffet. I had the Turkish poached eggs with chilli yogurt on crostini with a side of smoked bacon and a double espresso - nice, unusual and yep one of the best ever.

Thanks to all who make this hotel what it is - pat on back people, you deserve it.",5,2013,12,01
129,The best,"From the amazingly warm, helpful welcome all the way to check out this hotel was absolutely flawless.

It is a beautiful hotel with the most friendly, helpful staff who are happy to go the extra mile to ensure that your stay is perfect.

The room itself was spotless, very comfortable environment. Amazing bathroom and other facilities such as complimentary mini bar, french press for coffee and a robe and slippers all made nice touches.

Room service was excellent in the evening and the continental breakfast in the morning was most impressive.

I would not hesitate to return to this hotel, I even look forward to it.",5,2013,11,30
129,We loved our stay at the Ampersand,"We just stayed at the Ampersand for 3 nights and loved the hotel.

The staff was very sweet and helpful. 
 The hotel is brand new and nothing looks worn.
The rooms are small, but since our stay was only 3 nights it was big enough for us.
We loved the free wifi and the small fridge with complimentary water and sodas.
The location is great, right across the road from South Kensington Underground station and with a lot of food options in the neighbourhood.
I feel pretty sure we will stay here next time we visit London.
",5,2013,11,28
129,Excellent hotel & service!,"The hotel was amazing, greeted as we walked in, checked in in minutes.
The room was very nice, heated floors in the bathroom were really nice! 
The Staff were great too, we asked about any London by night tours and within minutes they found us a really brilliant tour and booked us tickets.
It was also very close to the tube station, we spotted it as soon as we got outside which made it finding our way around very easy.",5,2013,11,26
129,One of the best hotels I've stayed in London,"Location is excellent - can catch the Picadilly Line all the way from Heathrow to South Kensington and come out of the underground and there is the Ampersand right across the road.  

The reservation and front desk team were so helpful, polite, warm and friendly.  The room was comfortable, clean and warm - important when it was so cold outside!  Had 2 excellent nights sleep, although on our first night a guest inadvertantly set off the fire alarm and we ended up having to leave our room and go downstairs to the foyer, where we were informed it was a false alarm.  Hardly the fault of the Ampersand, but one thing that did concern me was some of the Night staff at the Ampersand seemed a litte confused about what was going on and weren't really giving guests all clear directives.  In any case, a small matter, which did not detract much from the pleasant stay we enjoyed.

I will definately be back!",5,2013,11,23
129,"Wish we'd stayed at ""The Arch""","I was really excited about staying at the ampersand that I'd booked as a surprise for my husbands birthday as I consistently kept reading the great reviews. We've stayed in numerous boutique hotels, and having stayed at ""The Arch"" a few times when coming to London thought we'd try something different. 

The standard room IS small. There is about 2ft between the bed and the wall on all sides. You can only fit one person in the bathroom at a time. The glass light shades in bathroom were dusty, as was the top of the cabinet, there was a crack in the mirror on the wardrobe door and the highest temperature you could get the shower to I would describe as ""warm."" For ladies- if you need to use more than 3 face pads between the evening & morning you'll need to make sure you bring some with you as there are only 3 available in a tatty paper envelope at a time. 

The mini bar only had soft drinks available- with no alternative alcoholic beverages to purchase- nor any snacks to select either. The coffee/ tea facilities were tucked away in a tiny wardrobe which you would've had to take out to make- if you could find any room after you'd unpacked your things. The room service menu only consisted of a selection of 8 things. 

Lots of the reviews mentioned about all the friendly staff. Yes, they were polite- but not the friendly descriptions I'd read to in previous reviews. 

I guess if we hadn't stayed elsewhere in London then I may have enjoyed our stay more at The Ampersand more, however with The Arch as a benchmark and a comparison I would recommend to take a look before booking to stay here. 
",3,2013,11,23
129,Wonderful Hotel,This is a small but perfectly formed hotel. Absolutely lovely staff that are extremely helpful. Stylish rooms and public spaces. We stayed in a corner suite with balcony. Wonderful bathrooms and comfortable beds.fantastic location 1 minute from the National History Museum and 5 minutes to Harrods. Very close to S.Ken tube station.,5,2013,11,23
129,What else?,"Great spot, very pleasant boutique hotel. 
Rooms are spacious and well equipped with a fun decoration. 
There is also a small but well equipped gym.
The APERO restaurant is also a nice and trendy place for breakfast and dinner. Great staff.",5,2013,11,23
129,Charming Boutique in a Great Location,"As a Platinum Starwood Preferred Guest member, I have pretty much stayed at the St. Regis, Sheraton or Le Meridien while in London.  On this trip, I wanted to stay in the Kensington area and upon reviews, especially those on TA, made the choice to book the Ampersand.

Although the location proved to be ideal in so many aspects (tube really close, great restaurants close by, etc), the service there is what sets it apart from the others.  From the bell hops to the front desk, room attendants and restaurant staff, they were all top notch.  It remained that way throughout our whole stay. Helpful, friendly with smiles and all, I can say that the service there rivals that of the St Regis.  It was as I say, comfortable, cozy and professional, all which made for a great service experience.

Now for the facility.  Very good on all aspects.  Charming decor and although a boutique unit, the space had a better than expected layout and volume than what one would expect in this type of unit.  Very good and appropriate balance would best describe it.  Clean and orderly is also obvious here.  My room was a bit on the small side but as I asked for a room away from the street and lifts, it was appropriate.  Very clean and comfortable with a cool, chic design with subtleties. The Ampersand rubber ducky along with high end toiletries were very nice touches.

As prices for accommodations are, as we all know, steep in London, it is somewhat difficult to ascribe value here. Being a SPG Platinum member comes with great perks and I usually stay within the program's stable of choices.  Now with my experience at the Ampersand, when I return to London, It may be very likely that it will be my first choice.  All in all and referencing the above, I guess I must use the word  ""great"" in describing the value one would receive if staying at the Ampersand.",5,2013,11,20
129,Truly Excellent,"Glad we stayed an extra night as were very happy with the room and hotel.  We were on first floor at the front but had no trouble with street noise.  We drove there and found an excellent spot at the entrance to the Lyc√©e Franchaise next door off Harrington Road, where the parking was free after 1.30pm on Saturday and all day Sunday.  Nice touches included heated floor in bathroom, free soft drinks and tea and coffee in room.  Breakfast a steal at full English for ¬£11.50.  Super cocktails and the cream teas looked good.  Very friendly staff (Sam).  Reasonably priced.  Go there.",5,2013,11,19

129,Just perfect,"We had a great stay at The Ampersand. Perfect location, right next to the tube. In a bustling and very central South Kensington. Close to all the museums and other hotspots like Harrods.
Beautiful appointed suite! All amenities and some great attention to detail like magazines, chocolates on arrival and turndown service. Would really love to come back soon.",5,2013,11,17
129,Believe the hype,"I was so unsure that all the great reviews were true that I cancelled my first night here and chose another hotel. What a mistake! Ampersand has it done right: yes, the rooms are small (this is London, after all!) but they have everything you'd need or could want, the hotel decor is lovely, fresh, new and interesting, the food at the restaurant was surprisingly delicious. The location was terrific, just steps from the Underground. Hotel provided free tea/coffee/juice/water/soda in the room (minibar was complimentary, what a concept!) and I got a free, unexpected upgrade to larger room upon check in. Room (118) was on first floor but on side of building so very quiet. Modern and fresh, it still managed to feel 'English' (black and white striped wallpaper in bathroom, glossy black tiles in tub, wonderful detailing and killer high ceilings). I loved it. Great, convenient hotel in city of London with easy, free Wifi access and lovely amenities.",5,2013,11,14
129,I would recommend,"high quality, comfortable, and friendly staff...
a good hotel location...
very comfortable beds...
You can spend a good time with delicious cakes and wine next to the window case!
We had a very nice time...
The only trouble is poor little room wardrobe",5,2013,11,14
129,The good and the not so good,"We chose this hotel for location mainly to be near to The Royal Albert Hall and it's many good reviews,  the location is perfect both for rah and being near to the many museums, shops and restaurants etc 

On entering the hotel there are quite a few steps and we were surprised that  there was nobody to greet you or help with bags etc this could be a problem for some less able visitors and we would have expected this facility from a 5 star hotel. 

On entering our room we found the curtains closed on opening the curtains we found the reason a brick wall but although not the best view we were not staying long so would not be to much of a problem except we had to have the lights on even during daylight !  

The room was very small but nicely decorated the wardrobe also housed the tea tray not exactly ideal making a drink in the wardrobe!!!  The bed was comfortable and the linens etc very nice quality. The bathroom was lovely clean and well equipped,  toiletries very nice, lots of lovely fluffy towels. 

The not so good !!!  

the noise of the trains running underneath the hotel but if we had a higher room perhaps this would not be such a problem. 

 The disturbed night due to people outside our window laughing and chatting as varios times throughout the night, we wondered if perhaps staff used this area for their breaks as we were at the back of the hotel with no public access so resulted in very little sleep for us sadly and given the lovely comfy bed i am sure we would have had a really good nights sleep. 

The room was very hot and stuffy even after turning the air con up to make it cooler but the lovely toasty underfloor heating in the bathroom which we liked very much we could not find a way to lower so think this contributed to the stuffiness. 

The complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar was a nice touch appreciated. 
Could have done with some more tea bags as only 1 ordinary bag the rest were flavoured teas which is ok if you like them.  

All in all could have been a better experience for us regarding sleep which spoilt our visit somewhat!  

We would stay again mainly for location and the hope that given a different room (which we would make sure of on booking) that our experience would be much better, as this visit could have been almost perfect but for the lack of sleep.",3,2013,11,13
129,"Outstanding, superb, stay no where else","Just typing this review out in the apero rest. My stay has been outstanding. Free wifi throughout, complimentary water and juice in room, huge rooms, for London. Quite, quaint. The staff superb, knowledgable and super friendly.

Location is perfect. Hyde park across the road. Albert hall as well. 

Seriously don't stay anywhere else. 

I'm making this joint a regular.",5,2013,11,11
129,Brilliand and great value for the money,"I can only echo other reviewers: great design, helpful staff, proper shower and good bed. Only complaint would be the very small room, also by London standards. In my room 514 there was not place to hang jackets etc. But all the rest was just brilliant. I will be back.

They do have a good deal with a limousine company. A Heathrow transfer (we had E-class Mercedes with a very friendly driver) for 2 persons will be cheaper than Heathrow Express + Paddington taxi. As mentioned tube station is 2 minute walk and plenty of classy restaurants in Kensington area.",5,2013,11,10
129,Stylish,"Just had a lovely few days at the Ampersand. With it's great location and chic design it was perfect for a luxury base for our London visit.

The room, although small, was extremely comfortable and had all the accessories you would expect from a five star hotel.  All the staff were extremely courteous and friendly and always had a smile and a friendly word whatever time of day.  The bar staff in particular we're excellent and were chatty and friendly as they worked.

100 yards away from the underground station and surrounded by numerous caf√©s, restaurant and bars, it was the ideal location for our stay.

We would recommend the Ampersand to anybody.",5,2013,11,10
129,Fabulous place!,"I had a great stay at the Ampersand, and wish I could have stayed longer.  Location, room, staff, and restaurant were all excellent.  I had duck at the restaurant, and it was superbly prepared.  The cocktails were delicious, and the wine selection was good.  My room was lean, comfortable, and a good size (I had a double room).  The photos on the web site accurately represented the room I got.  I will definitely go back.",5,2013,11,09
129,Great for amenities lovers.... but what about the basics?,"The design details are really impressive, a truly British modern style with kind professional staff and superb continental breakfast; the lobby is comfy, bright and perfectly clean with fresh flowers and luxury details. The hotel is very centrally located at really few steps from the South Kensington underground and main bus lines. The real concern was  the single room which is as small as advertised: 11 sqm which means 9 sqm bedroom and 2 sqm bathrom but you cannot really understand it  till you're inside and you bump into the bed while entering! (no pics on the website). There is literally only 2 feet of space around the queen size bed. Not even enough room for the suitcase and the (many) extra bed pillows. No room for anything else at all including shoes.... Not even a hook on the back of the door for my coat (not needing space at all, therefore a real lack of attention for the single room). I was traveling on business for a 2-day trip but I could not put other clothes in the wardrobe if I would have stayed more. You can also hear all noise from the hallway (room 304). Moreover you need to carefully plan your shower before you enter the bathroom (the shower door does not open onwards for a standard size guest....forget it if you're overweighted!) .... Really not rewarding for the price you pay and for what you expect from a luxury hotel... I mean, these hotels should not offer similar inappropriate rooms to gain more guests. I also visited the superior double room, which is a standard room (regarding size) in any other 5-star hotel ... the problem is then the space and the number of rooms at any cost then.......Everyone loves the amenities (great! including the bath sets and the luxurious breakfast and amazing furnishings), but what about the basics? .... should make one think....",3,2013,11,08
129,Love it!,"My husband and I checked in yesterday. We picked this hotel because we wanted somewhere special for his birthday trip. I won't repeat what other reviewers have said. 

Service
Room wasn't ready even though we arrived after the check-in time. Front desk showed us to the cafe for a coffee while we waited. The guy Alberto who took care of our bags and later took us to our room was very pleasant and helpful. He later brought up a small box of sweets and a card with birthday wishes. However, the lady who checked us in I found to be a bit curt. Perhaps this is part of the culture, or perhaps I shouldn't compare it to the Osaka Ritz Carlton since the Japanese are well known for their warm hospitality and willingness to go all out. I'd asked her for a running map (I'd read that the hotel provides guests with a running map upon request) - the lady curtly said they don't have one, the park is a short walk away and that I could run as much as I want there. She then literally handed me a brochure which opened up into a massive london map without so much as pointing to me where the location of the hotel and the way to the park. I gave up after a few minutes and threw it away and decided google map would be a better bet. That was disappointing. 

Room
We'd booked a deluxe studio. We didn't get an upgrade like other couples who were celebrating something special did. But that's ok because we did pay for a deluxe studio. We had however hoped for a higher floor room for a bit of the Mary Poppins view the hotel boasts of on their website. Our room is in front so it is a little noisy and other reviewers are right about the sound of the tube and plumbing noises. But we're not too bothered by either with the curtains drawn.  

Otherwise, the room and bathroom are wonderful. Bed and pillows are softer than what we like but are incredibly comfortable. The room is like what all other reviewers say and is larger than what the photos show. The lights are a little odd but didn't annoy me like they did other patrons. There's a tv in the tub which is great. The toiletries are smell wonderful. A lot of thought has gone into the design of the room. There's ample storage space and plug points. We were pleasantly surprised to find the little book shelf with books which was only visible if one sat on the arm chair at the corner of the room. 
 
Gym
Gym is small but adequate. Each of the four machine has a working screen which provides tv, radio, games and web access. There're free weights and some sort of a weights machine. Water and towels are provided too. 

Location 
Location is perfect with lots of wonderful restaurants and cafes nearby and is so near the tube. 

I'd not hesitate to stay again in the future. ",5,2013,11,08
129,Special,"I booked The Ampersand through Mr and Mrs Smith and secured a great rate with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne thrown in.  It was a special occasion as it was to celebrate my husband's birthday.  From the moment we arrived, we were looked after exceptionally well.  All the staff are friendly and extremely helpful.  The hotel knew about the birthday celebration as I had mentioned it at the time of booking and on arrival we discovered that we had been upgraded to a suite on the 5th floor. This was a real treat......the suite was tastefully furnished with a little kitchenette with its own Nespresso machine, microwave and fridge.  All the soft drinks in the mini bar were complimentary and it made a nice change to have proper milk in the mini bar for teas and coffees. The Ampersand really know how to spoil their guests and ensure you leave feeling that your stay, for whatever reason, was good value for money and not a complete rip off. In our case, we left feeling relaxed and refreshed ! The Hotel is perfectly located near South Ken tube and is very central for Knightsbridge (15 min walk) or by tube to the Kings Road / High Street Ken. We would definitely recommend it and will most certainly return in the future.",5,2013,11,06
129,Traveller's dream come true,"The perfect place to stay. Outstanding service, staff, beautifully modern + stylish rooms, incredibly creative and whimsical design all over. Amazing little touches like the free mini bar. Spotlessly clean, too. 
Great downstairs'salon', the Drawing Rooms, as the heart of the hotel provides an oasis for guests at any time of the day, be it for tea or cocktails or simply for having a quiet read.",5,2013,11,05
129,Weekend at the Ampersand,"We stayed for two nights, the hotel had a relaxed atmosphere and was stylishly furnished. The bedroom was a little small for a superior double and was too warm. We booked a high floor as the feedback on Tripadvisor mentioned the tube noise, this solution worked well. Easy walking distances to lots of attractions such as the museums and good value for such a central location.",5,2013,11,05
129,Lovely modern and bright hotel in great location,"Was specifically looking for a hotel which could accommodate three of us (inc our 10 year old daughter). We saw the good reviews and as the hotel had a 3 nights for 2 offer, this seemed a good deal for us.  Many hotels were charging more as most required us to book bigger rooms and many nice hotels were charging well over ¬£300 a night.  We had a choice of deluxe studio or 1 bed suite and opted to pay slightly more for the suite. This mean up daughter would have a little privacy whilst being with us.

We booked our 3 night stay in Oct half term which was a busy time to travel and prob prices were higher.  

As we exited from the underground we immediately saw the hotel which was just down road.  We were there in about 2 mins and were greeted by a man on the door who asked if we needed help, we didn't.  He showed us to reception where we greeted by a friendly receptionist.  After a quick check-in the concierge man told us he'd take us to our room which was on floor 4. We entered and he talked us through the light system and all the facilities of the room.  We were immediately wowed by everything. We had 2 rooms separated by a small corridor. My daughter had a pull out sofa bed in what was the lounge and we had a room with balcony and fill length windows which made the room lovely and bright.  There was also a kitchenette which featured a microwave, nespresso machine, toaster, kettle and lots of glasses cutlery and plates. There was also a fridge which contained drinks. We were told we could help ourselves to soft drinks for free. 

The bathroom was lovely and modern and had a heated floor plus selection of toiletries and little extras. There were also 2 small wardrobes and a safe.  Our bed was extremely comfy as we're the lovely pillows.

We loved having the balcony as we could go out and look out onto the street - would be great in summer. We noticed not many rooms had balconies though so I guess they just come with the suites or maybe a handful of rooms.

All in all we had an absolutely fantastic stay. We were always greeted by the friendly staff. Our room was made up every day and fully replenished with new coffee, tea and soft drinks. I didn't like the earl grey and other teas on offer but left a message for housekeeping and that day got a good supply of English breakfast teas.

Also they bought up a box of biscuit treats for my husband as it was his birthday. We had only told them as they asked and this was a lovely surprise.

The hotel always seemed quiet and we never heard other guests.  The only issue was the road was quite noisy as the buses and taxis used it a lot and tended to hoot their horns a lot.  However the soundproofing was quite good and this didnt affect us too much.  Also we could hear the sound of the tubes and occasionally feel a slight vibration but again nothing that affected our sleep as they stopped around midnight I think.

For breakfast we tended to walk to the choice of lovely bakeries and bought food back to our room to eat in our lounge area where we had a table and chairs to sit at.  There was also a lovely cafe down the road but this always seemed very busy.

Location was great, very near tube and a short walk to natural history museum and other museums.

So would I go back.  Yes if we got another deal and if we could stay in a suite again as we had plenty of space.  Also we might consider asking for a room on the back as this would eliminate any noises from outside.  

We loved this hotel as it was modern and clean and bright. You are always going to get noise in the centre of London so I don't think we could find anything better for the price paid for the three of us.",5,2013,11,05
129,Stunning hotel,"We stayed for two nights whilst attending the Blues Fest at The Albert Hall - hotel is in a great location for TAH and PJ's is a good spot for dinner and within walking distance. Others have mentioned Muriel's for breakfast, our experience wasn't good - food cold on cold plates and drinks very slow, breakfast in the hotel was lovely and sensibly priced, albeit a bit chaotic! Hotel decor is stunning and staff brilliant, all helpful, friendly and genuinely keen to make sure you're having a good time. Rooms have hi-tech gadgets which were a bit challenging, but that was probably just me. Decent coffee and complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar an added bonus.

I'd have given this hotel 5stars, but our room faced the road and there was quite a bit of traffic noise, we could also hear the person above us walking around their room.....if that isn't going to bother you, then go you'll love it.

",4,2013,11,01
129,"Small Room, Very Convenient Location","My first visit to London, and I was left with wonderful impresion wanting to go back again and again. And The Ampersand was the right choice for me, in terms of location. I took the regular train from Heathrow Airport to South Kensington Station, and from the exit I can spoted the hotel right away. You only need to cross a street. So basically 2 minutes from train.

The reception was very kind helping us with our luggages.
The lobby is small, an the double room that we took is also small for 2 people to stay in. It was not a problem for us, since we are used to a small business hotel in Tokyo.
But their bathroom is nicely layout, stock up with Miller Harris products.

We have to close our curtain when we were in the room, since it's facing next building's window. But we were out on the town most of time anyway and we were able to sleep peacefully since no noise can be heard from the street.

The good thing is the Location. There was a bus stop right in front of the hotel. Once we took a bus from Westfield Shopping Mall with lots of shopping bags, and we got of from the bus, right at the front door of our hotel. It just can't get any better than that.
The red hop on hop off bus, stops there too, right outside the hotel door.

As i said previously, the train station that take you to the airport, picadilly/oxford, all those must visit places, is just 2 minutes walking from the hotel. and lots of eating places just outside south kensington station. Paul Bakery is there, if you need to grab your breakfast.

We pay around GBP175 per nite room only for our room. It is not cheap, but reasonable for London. Also, their mini bar stock with cokes, juices, water & milk are free and it's replinish daily.",3,2013,11,01
129,"Lovely stay , great location ","We stayed here for one night for our anniversary and we loved it. The hotel is perfectly located right in the hub of South Kensington. We stayed in room 104 which is a standard double room. Although compact, it was beautifully decorated, clean, well equipped and the bed was very comfortable. The complimentary mini bar was a nice touch and it was great that there was an umbrella in the wardrobe for us to borrow. We had a brick wall window view but it didn't bother us, nor did it affect our stay. We are fully aware that we paid for a standard room and we are in London so we weren't exactly expecting views of Hyde Park or the Palace! The receptionist was friendly and polite. The bell boy who showed us up to our room and offered to carry our bags was informative too. The only negative is the weird light switches. Overall it was a wonderful stay!",5,2013,10,31
129,Excellent hotel,"We spent a week-end with my wife in the Ampersand. Very nice experience. The hotel is very well located, easy to reach by taxi, bus or metro. It is very close to some museums and there are plenty of restaurants in a walking distance. The decoration of the hotel is very nice, and it has been fully refurbished a couple of years ago.The staff at the reception was very helpful and had very good restaurant's recommendations for the dinner. The breakfast in the restaurant which is downstair is good but nothing special. But again, you have plenty of options around the hotel.",5,2013,10,30
129,Great London location!,"I stayed in this hotel for one night whilst visiting family in London. It's in a great location, within yards of South Kensington tube station and is great for visiting the V&A museum, the Science museum, the Royal Albert Hall and the Natural History Museum. 
The room was so cosy and comfortable. All the details were perfect. The furnishings are modern and cool, but not too minimalist. 
I had my family visit me at the hotel.
We had a cream tea in the tea room, which was delicious and a good price. And we also ate dinner in the hotel, but in the restaurant in the basement. Again, the food was very good.
There is a games room in the basement with table tennis, and various board games. 
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,29
129,Loved the Ampersand,"This is a beautiful hotel in the equally beautiful neighborhood of South Kensington.  My husband and I stayed there for a week in September and I have to say the staff were wonderful and went out of their way to make our stay pleasant.  The room, although small was beautifully decorated and very clean and comfortable.  The spa robes and slippers were a lovely touch.  The location was perfect, right across the street from the South Kensington Tube Station, just a few stops away from the heart of the city and walking distance to all the museums.  So easy to get around.  There were plenty of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2013,10,29
129,Afternoon Tea,"As a birthday gift I took my friend and I to The Drawing Room at The Ampersand Hotel.

We arrived a little early but were made to feel very welcome and were offered drinks whilst we waited.  The waiter was very nice, polite and professional.  He even apologised to us for not being able to order sooner as all the goodies were still being baked.  Fresh, out the oven mouth watering goodies!

Once we had ordered, it wasn't long until this marvellous tiered eye-opener arrived.  We didn't know were to start!  Every flavour was delicious, the presentation was beautiful and you could see that time and care were taken in this afternoon delight. 

It was a wonderful day, surrounded by lovely d√©cor, tasty food and tea/champagne, good service and of course company.  Will definitely be back!  Thank you to all that made the afternoon perfect.",5,2013,10,28
129,great location for London museums and connections.,"Weekend in London to enjoy Museums and a concert at Wembley Arena. Two middle-years adults that stay in hotels rarely but value a great city-break.
First of all, I will pay for great location in major cities, and I rate The Ampersand as a top location. Real handy for Natural history museum and the V+A. South Kensington tube is 2 minutes away and is a good spot on the tube to get places.Good local eateries catering to most tastes, although we didn't go up-market.  Recommend Martha's kitchen for good wholesome food in a buzzy cafe atmosphere. 
The Hotel was good in every measure we have. Big comfy bed/ friendly check-in staff/ room felt like a ""comfy-cave"" / staff made things easy/ umbrellas provided at the entrance (handy..)
So 5 stars as we would only improve things by paying half the price, and that is fantasy land in London, quite understandably.
So if you value this location and want a great spot to bed-up, I heartedly recommend The Ampersand
Oh, and I got to learn what the name signified too, and it's great to learn something new every day.",5,2013,10,27
129,Great Hotel in a great loation,"Stayed at the Ampersand Hotel for the 3rd time, each time has been a good experience. Rooms have always been clean & well equipped, nice touch with a few drinks in the fridge. Little bit pricy but like they say you get what you pay for",5,2013,10,26
129,Good but not great....,"The Ampersand hotel is a nice modern hotel which i was excited about staying in, however it's not as polished as it needs to be (esp given the price). Great location, high tech gadgets in the rooms and decor is lovely. This gadgetry comes with a price as rooms are lit up like Xmas trees at night. They are noisy too with clicking and an air conditioning system you can't switch off. The tv system is also high tech but alas failed to work on our first evening. They fixed it but not before 2 staff fiddled about in the room (while we are sat on our dressing gowns). I have to agree that the staff don't seem well trained. Worse was breakfast. It was included on our rate. However when we came down we were met by what seemed to be some fairly miserable staff. Nothing was explained and I had to ask for a menu. Once ordered (bacon sandwich and salmon/eggs for my partner) we had some bread/pastries. We were then presented a bill. I said breakfast was included and they said yes but not hot items. Neither the check in staff nor the miserable breakfast staff cared to mention it. I complained and asked to cancel the order. They didn't really apologise but gave us the food complimentary. A nice gesture.... However while the salmon/eggs was ok the bacon sandwich was awful. The meat was extremely fatty (like 49-50% fat) however I decided not to complain further..... Would probably not stay again and given the price it was not nearly as good as it should have been.",3,2013,10,26
129,A wonderful place to stay; great location,"I stayed at the Ampersand from October 14-20 in room 120.  It is a brief walk from the South Kensington tube stop, with a British flag hanging outside.  Easy to find.

My room was a superior room, not cheap but for the quality of the room and bath, it was worth it.  My total bill for 6 nights was $2500 and I feel I got what I paid for.

First the staff and check-in was wonderful.  A truly lovely group of young people.  My room wasn't ready,  as was expected and they took my luggage and it was in my room when I returned.  I was so pleased when I opened my door and saw my room.  It was spacious enough, not huge, but I don't spend that much time in my room, but when I opened the bathroom door, I was thrilled.  It was huge compared to the last room I had in London and beautiful.  Brand new.  Beautiful tile and a DOUBLE shower. 

People complained about the noise from the school, but it didn't start that early because nothing opens early in London. I found it wonderful to hear young children having so much fun.  

Now for a couple of negatives:  They need to explain IN DETAIL how to use the lighting system.  I must have hit those switches hundreds of times for no reason.   And also, the system for maid service was difficult too.  That was my biggest complaint.

Did not use the food service at all.  The tea room looked lovely and the pastries looked delicious, but a little pricey.",5,2013,10,25
129,Very good for the price,We stayed here twice when visiting London. The hotel is well located with some good restaurants nearby. The staff are very friendly and rooms are very good for London standards. Our beds were very comfortable and linen was in good condition. Breakfast was excellent and gluten free was catered for. Would happily stay here again.,4,2013,10,24
129,"Spacious rooms, great locale - we will be back!","Really liked this hotel. Very cool lobby (hung out for a bit when i got there early and room wasn't ready yet). THe room is surprisingly big (with really high ceilings) - not just for London. Entry way had a great trunk of sorts for the suitcases. Across from that was a big closet, safe, mini bar (huge props for free water/soda/tea/coffee/etc!). Nespresso maker in the room (and the fastest tea pot ever!). Room had a desk, bed, bed side tables, tv, etc. The desk has a nice area for plugging in stuff (and they include a converter if needed). Bed was quite comfortable. Room had blackout drapes (ours faced the street). The gym looked nice and there was a cool game/library room downstairs. 

Bathrooms - good sized. Bathtub with the 3/4 glass shower door. HIgh/deep bathtub (if you have issues getting in and out of a slippery tub be careful). Shower had a rain shower head and a wand or something. Cute rubber duck. Huge towels (bathrobes & slippers included in room). Liked the toiletries and they refilled them as needed (much appreciated!). Only odd thing is that there is no plug in the bathroom (hair drying must be done in the main room).

Location - Super close (2 min walk) to the S Kensington stop. About a 5-10 min walk to Hyde Park (beautiful place for a run/walk). Near the tube stop is a Starbucks, Pret a Manger, and many other places to eat. 

The staff were all super nice and helpful. Very cool, hip hotel - I would definitely stay here when i get to go back to London!",5,2013,10,23
129,Quite peaceful,"For a Central London hotel this was lovely, quiet and not too big. Lovely lounge with great books. Bar and restaurant nice feel to it. Rooms not huge but warm and cosy. The staff were very helpful and friendly.",5,2013,10,23
129,We will be back!,"Hubby and my first visit to London and so pleased we chose to stay at The Ampersand. 

Great rooms, good size, good natural light, temperate - certainly didnt find the hook-situation a problem as the review below would suggest. Theres a whole towel rack/4 rails in the bathroom as well as three hooks! 

The hotel offers complimentary mini-bar and use of Umbrella's and international plug adaptors - it was the small things that made it such a pleasant stay. 

Staff were very accommodating and friendly.

Location was excellent - walking distance to great cafes and the underground. 

We will definitely be back!",5,2013,10,22
129,"Close, but not quite perfect.","Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Ampersand in September 2013. The location is excellent, just a short tube trip or Boris from all parts of central London.
However, each element was just lacking something to be awarded 5 stars.
The continental breakfast in the restaurant was very good. When ordered in the room one morning we had to specify every item, only to have to ask twice to receive it all.
The staff were friendly enough, but a bit reserved.
The bedroom was a bit small, but the King size bed was excellent and the decor a nice change.
The bathroom was OK, and the shower very good, but getting in without the door pushing you into the toilet pan was difficult, and we're not over average build.
",4,2013,10,22
129,A Hotel that ticks all the boxes!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night stay at The Ampersand. We received a warm and 
friendly welcome on arrival. The hotel is situated just across the road from 
South Kensington Tube station. Our room (a Deluxe) was very comfortable, very 
relaxing & very clean. The bed was supremely comfortable and luxurious. The 
complimentary water and soft drinks are a nice touch and the wifi worked well 
with no need to enter a password.
The bathroom was small but fine for the 2 of us. This was also very clean with 
all the usual complimentary toiletries and necessities. We had a continental 
breakfast delivered to the room which was just as you would expect and 
contributed to our relaxing weekend. All staff were very friendly, helpful and 
efficient.
If we had to point out any minus points - it was quite difficult to get out of 
the bath/shower after showering due to the slope of the bath at that end and 
there was no mirror accessible by a power point for using the hairdryer (I 
really am scraping the bottom of the barrel here!).",5,2013,10,22
129,Great city hotel,"Courteous and thoughtful front if house staff.
Great interiors. 
All rooms (with the exception of the smallest which I had the unfortunate experience of staying in on one visit) are well appointed and fitted.
We'll worth a visit next time you are in London.
      ",5,2013,10,22
129,Little disappointed,"We stayed at this hotel on a recommendation.  The location is great, rooms are gorgeous and the inclusion of beverages in the mini bar is also a plus.  Downside as far as room was concerned, but easily fixed, was lack of hooks in the bathroom to hang towels etc on.  Also, one would think if only the english breakfast tea was used in the mini bar, giving the guest more of that when replenishing supplies each day would make sense as it saves having to ring to housekeeping constantly to ask for more.

As far as service goes, some of the Reception staff, although not totally unpleasant, weren't very helpful or engaging and staff in restaurant seemed unorganised and lacking in good communication in general.  Food was very good though so congratulations to the chef.

I think the hotel will have to lift its game if it is to maintain its current rating as far as staff is concerned anyway, maybe more effective training would help?",3,2013,10,21
129,Beautiful Hidden Gem - Exceptional Staff,"I recently stayed at the Ampersand, and cannot say enough good things about it.  The rooms are tastefully decorated, comfortable, and the location is perfect.  The staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome.  Right down to the minute we checked out, the fellow working the desk - Cuban fellow - offered to get us some coffee before we rushed out to the airport.  Incredible service.",5,2013,10,21
129,My new London favourite,"A friend and I spent nine nights in this hotel in July during a ""girls only"" holiday in England and Ireland.
We had a superior twin room on the ground floor which was on the cosy side but had just enough storage for us, we each had a nightstand with storage, the closet was big enough and there were shelves above the tea/coffee area and mini fridge, plus some drawers on the desk. We made it work and the high ceiling and window that opened to a window box full of flowers made the room feel more spacious. The beds were made up with beautiful linens and were very comfortable, the bathroom was lovely with some nice touches.

We appreciated the free wi-fi (with no annoying pass code), the complimentary soft drinks and water replenished each day, with room in the fridge to store our own things and the newspaper on the door knob each day.  Some hotels at this level nickel and dime you to death for these things and have annoying mini bars with over priced items that mustn't even be nudged or you pay for them!

The decor throughout the hotel is gorgeous: chic and whimsical at the same time with not a hint of stuffiness. We loved that the young friendly staff members wore jeans and a vest; despite the casual appearance they were unfailingly professional, attractive and well groomed, helpful and genuine; some of the best hotel staff I have encountered anywhere.

The location was perfect for us, lots of restaurant choices, great shopping, the park was close, the V and A museum, we walked to Chelsea a couple of times and when we went further afield the tube station is right across the street. Absolutely love this area.

For breakfast we switched between Apero in the hotel and Paul just over the road. (great coffee and pastries, but you can't eat pastry EVERY  day!) My two favourite Apero breakfasts were the coconut porridge with caramelised bananas off the menu and the muesli/yogurt mix in the jar from the continental table. 
Cocktails at Apero were delicous and very well executed...hats off to Marek; especially loved the Summersip. (like a Pimm's only better)

We ate dinner at Apero several times and it was all delicious, especially the beetroot risotto.",5,2013,10,20
129,Chic boutique hotel in a perfect location!,"Took my husband to London for a big birthday and staying at this hotel was one of the best decisions made! As many of the reviews say...gotta agree that the location really is in a great neighborhood- right by the South Kensington tube so coming from the airport is super easy.  It's also right by V&A Museum among others. It was also perfect for a Fall stroll/morning run in Hyde Park.  Coming from a city and being a partial tourists- we considered it walking distance to some really amazing restaurants and fun shopping.  The best part (for me) was really the fab decor- the rooms were stylishly decorated and very well maintained.  It might have been because the hotel was fairly new then, but if they kept up the kind of superb service we got with handwritten welcome and thank you notes - just can't imagine staying anywhere else if we were to go back. To top it off the front desk and staff were helpful, friendly, and professional.  (The only thing I can't comment is the food- we never ate there.)",5,2013,10,20
129,Way short of perfect but quite good,"The Ampersand has a fantastic location and cool feel.  Where it lacks is in service and rooms which are actually meant to be stayed in by guests.  When we arrived the lobby was in disarray as overwhelmed front desk clerks struggled to check guests in.  Luggage was piling up every where and it was definitely not the feel of a high end boutique hotel.  The chaos with the front desk appeared to be a fairly regular occurrence as during our 4 day stay we saw this confusion every morning.  We had a studio suite room which was hip & cool and provided two small separate areas.  However, the entire decoration scheme was ""form over function"" and I literally had to move furniture to create room for ourselves.  The closet is MINISCULE -- and totally unsuitable for more than one persons clothes. The room has NO dresser or drawers beyond a decorative table.   The bathroom had NOWHERE to put toiletries and had little signs taking up the precious small amount of space.  It was not the type of room where one would want to stay for a number of days making it difficult to recommend it as a top hotel in London.",4,2013,10,19
129,Great boutique hotel in lively South Kensington.,"We had a lovely 2 days in and one day out during our London visit. South Kensington, a 5 minute walk has a street mall located at the tube stop,with lots of little restaurants and cafes including the wonderful little, restaurant Daquise, a London institution since 1940s.  The spotlessly clean hotel is near Albert Hall , some museums and embassies, as well as a fifteen minute walk from Harrods. Standard rooms are cozy, very clean and very modern but very tiny. You might consider upgrading to a larger type room if considering a longer stay. Decor is a lively ""British modern design"" with touches of art and colour. I would not hesitate to stay here again. The desk personal and management provide spectacular and cheerful attention to service.",5,2013,10,19
129,Great location,"I had a weekend break with my wife and 2 children (17 and 19) in London in June and we stayed at The Ampersand. It was really good. A great location in a really cool part of town, good sized rooms (for London), and pleasant friendly staff. We will certainly use The Ampersand again.",5,2013,10,18
129,Not as wonderful as hoped...,"The Ampersand is an interesting mix. When I first arrived, I was quite disappointed as there was no one at the front door and there was a flight of stairs at the entrance. I couldn't get my suitcase up the stairs alone and didn't know whether to leave the suitcase and get someone or not.  The front desk people were friendly enough, but not very helpful and an early check-in was not available. They are young and untrained.  Their uniform consists of a vest and jeans. 
But the room was very clean and modern- everything is operated by touch. The amenities were nice and replenished daily and wifi and bottled water were free. The location is central and next to the Tube-- so it is convenient if not particularly attractive when you walk outside.  The upstairs tearoom service was hopeless and the room service trays remained in the hall all day long despite requests to remove them. So - as you can see - a mixed experience.",4,2013,10,16
129,Almost perfect!,"Before starting this review, I was thinking if there was any negative point about the hotel, but I really couldn¬¥t come up with anything, well, almost anything.
The location is excellent. Just get out of the South Kensington and look around you, and you¬¥ll see the Ampersand. Nearby there is a lot of restaurants. On our first night in London, we asked the front staff an indication for a place do grab a bite, and they suggested: Rocca (an italian restaurant) or The Zetland Arms (a pub). Both were amazing, and we went there other 3 times, what shows how the staff is well informed about the area.
The hotel itself is really great. All the staff was very polite and very nice. The rooms are beautifully decorated, as well all the hotel areas. Unfortunately, our room had a view to a brick wall, wich was a negative point in our opinion.
The breakfast is not included, but if you choose to pay the price asked, it¬¥s worth it. There¬¥s a wide selection of pastry and many other options.
The drinks in the fridge (water, sparkling water, coke and diet coke) are complimentary, wich was a HUGE PLUS.
The other downside was that when we arrived, on a Saturday evening, the wi-fi wasn¬¥t working inside the rooms. We told the front manager, and she said they already called the maintenance company. By Monday the wi-fi was good, so I guess it wasn¬¥t a big problem.
When we were leaving to Heathrow, they offered a car service, wich was excellent, and the driver was really nice and polite.
We loved almost everything about this place, and wouldn¬¥t hesitate to stay here again, as long as not in the same room. But except for that, the hotel is really amazing.",4,2013,10,16
129,Two faultless stays at The Ampersand Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Ampersand in August 2013 and were delighted with the quality of the hotel, the cleanliness, the efficiency, friendliness and professionalism of the staff and the food was lovely too.  The location is simply perfect if you want to see some of the sights that London has to offer, or even if you just want to stroll through a park, or sit in cafes and watch the world go by.  The tube is a 30 second walk from the hotel so getting to and from it is a piece of cake.  

We loved the hotel so much we went back again in October 2013 and chose is not only for all the reasons stated above, but also because I was running in the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon.  The start line was a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel so there was no panicking about having to deal with early morning Sunday public transport.  

We had breakfast and lunch in the Apero restaurant/bar and both were superb.  The UnBEETable burger was simply delicious.  

I really can't fault anything about this hotel.  I will be back soon.",5,2013,10,15
129,Excellent boutique hotel in South Kensington,"Nice boutique hotel in South Kensington a very short walk from the tube station.  Close to the Victoria & Albert and other museums.  My room was small (as advertised), but had some charm.  Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was nothing special (weak coffee). However, there are lots of good restaurants and pubs in the neighborhood.  One of my favorites was Bosporus, a small kebab place around the corner on Old Brompton.  Lunch at the V&A is also nice (amazing decor in the dining areas).  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,15
129,A very good option in South Kensington,"Excellent location and good value for money. Very close to South Kensington underground station. Superior rooms are spacious enough and well equipped. Located at walking distance from museums, Hyde Park, Chelsea, Belgravia and department stores. I've chosen it for both business and leisure purposes (a short break) and I've been really satisfied. We're wery likely to come again in the future.",4,2013,10,14
129,Exceeded expectations,"I just returned from a 6-night stay in the Ampersand Hotel. The location is perfect - less than a block to the tube station, short walk to the V & A museum, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and Harrod's at Knightsbridge. Lots of good restaurants around as well, and in a very nice area. The staff were pleasant and knowledgeable. I never passed any hotel employee without them smiling and saying hello. My husband and I stayed in one of the Small Double Rooms. When I confirmed my reservation, the hotel advised that it would be small (which I knew from looking online). I knew it wouldn't be a problem - we spend very little time in the room when we travel and are used to smaller quarters - and was actually pleasantly surprised at how well equipped the smaller room was. There was a full length mirror, a nice little desk with a charging station for laptop/phone, plenty of storage in the small closet, and a nicely appointed bathroom. 

We couldn't have asked for a better experience!",5,2013,10,13
129,Amazing hotel,"Fabulous boutique hotel in the heart of Kensington. I stayed in the deluxe studio on the first floor. The decor was great, we had a small lounge area and a massive bathroom. The staff were attentive and couldn't do enough to assist us. There were nice little touches such as the ducks in the bathroom. The beds were huge and comfy and overall I think that for a 5 star hotel in London, the rates are very good. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,13
129,Single is tiny,"The design details are great. The single room is as tiny as advertised. There is literally only 2 feet of space around the bed. Just enough room for the suitcase and the extra bed pillows. No room for anything else at all. Not even a hook on the back of the door for my coat. The room would be impossible if I was traveling on business because there is no wardrobe. You can also hear all noise from the hallway. All it takes is for someone in charge to spend the night in a room to figure out what is missing. I mean I love the amenities, but what about the basics?",3,2013,10,13
129,Really nice hotel,"This hotel is a great base for a London holiday  - close to the tube, nearby cafes, museums, Harrods, and the hotel staff are genuinely friendly and very welcoming. Breakfast has some lovely selections, the coffee is good and the restaurant staff are great. Yes, the rooms are small and I think we only had one powerpoint, but the beds and  pillows are really comfortable. Will definitely stay again.",4,2013,10,11
129,Nice Boutique hotel in a good area,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights.  Good location, close to the station.  Noisy area, right next to a school.  Could hear the kids early in the morning.  Hotel had a lot of nice touches but the basic room is too small for two people.  Nowhere to put luggage or clothes.  The game room and the library were booked the two days we were there, so we didn't get a chance to see them. welcome chocolates, free wifi and complimentary soft drinks are a great benefit.  Bathroom was gorgeous.",3,2013,10,10
129,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"Being a seasoned traveller I know what I want in a hotel. The Ampersand certainly met my expectations for location, great service, well appointed room & immaculately clean bathroom. Staff were very friendly & ever willing to help.  Breakfast options are well priced and great.  The interior of the hotel was elegant and luxe without being over the top. My room overlooked Harrington Rd & I was not disturbed by traffic or noise. I was however disturbed by creaking floorboards from guest rooms on the floor above me - can't be helped given the building is well over 100 yrs old. Overall I had a great stay.",4,2013,10,10
129,Great Location,"I don't want to write the same review that everyone else does, but this hotel is in a great location. We stayed for 10 nights in early September. You can walk to Hyde Park--which we loved--and feel very safe. Neighborhood has great restaurants (Try DaSpago for good Italian around the corner) and good bakeries. We had a Superior Room which was small and no place to store your clothes.  Ladies---there is no plug for hair dryer in the bathroom. Every morning I had to take the table mirror from the bathroom, put it on the desk by the bed and blow dry my hair. There is an LED light on the ceiling that went on one morning at 5:00 am and woke us up.  No one knew what the light was for and could not get it to shut off. They offered to change our room but we only had 1 night left and didn't want to move everything. Light eventually went off about 7:00 am.We were on the second floor and could slightly feel the tube underneath---no big deal. Hotel is gorgeous, staff is very nice. Rooms are very clean. I would definitely stay here again, but I would upgrade my room. I also wasn't crazy about the light system they have to alert the maid that you're still in your room. I would much rather have a sign that says ""Do Not Disturb"".",4,2013,10,09
129,Fab Location & Beautiful Hotel,"Fabulous location, luxurious high spec rooms and polite staff who couldn't do enough for us... What more could you ask for..?This is our new favourite hotel in London and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others!!!
      
      ",5,2013,10,08
129,Perfect location,"We took advantage of a special 3 for 2 night offer at this truly wonderful small hotel. Yes, it's pricey, but well worth it. The best asset of this hotel are the wonderful staff members. Add to that it's location within a block of the South Kensington underground station and lovely (albeit very small, even in the deluxe category)!and you have a perfect combination. Apero's, the restaurant and bar at the hotel, are a great place to close off a busy day in London. Breakfast is expensive, so walk over to Starbucks and get your morning java there, less than a block away. 
Pros: great location and staff, very nicely decorated and furnished in a modern style, free wifi (slow)
Cons: rooms and baths are small, no full length mirror, no hair dryer plug in bathroom",5,2013,10,08
129,Great location and service,"We stayed for 1 night recently at this lovely boutique hotel. The rooms are small but well appointed, and the location is great if you wish to explore the Natural History, Science and V and A museums, all within easy walking difference. There is an underground station nearby enabling exploring afar. The breakfast was wonderful, and the service exemplary. We would happily return if we make it back to London.",5,2013,10,08
129,Gee thanks ... you remembered!,"Our last review of Amerpsand was a good one but cautioned against potential noise in one section of the city block.  Thus, we were surprised and pleased upon our check in September when the same lovely tall, dark haired front desk manager remembered and clarified that we preferred another section of the hotel and she made sure we were placed there.  Of course we love the hotel and given that you remember the little details that would make our stay even more special we have to say, we'll be back.   

This hotel is convenient to the subway system (The Tube) at South Kennsington, near museums and restaurants (yes a Starbucks is just across the way too) and a short walk to Harrods and the designer shops.  If you're there on business, the bus and Tube systems can take you anywhere you need to be.

Thank you for continuing to impress us Ampersand!  You are certainly our choice for hotel in London.",5,2013,10,07
129,Gorgeous,Beautifully decorated and stylish hotel.  The breakfast was probably one of the best hotel breakfasts we've ever had.  The room was very quiet. The location is outstanding.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended.,5,2013,10,06
129,"If my mom liked it, it was great!","My mom is very picky.  There were a few things that we could quibble about such as creaky floors and hearing the subway, but overall, she enjoyed the stay. So if she liked it, the place was great.

The room was very small but comfortable for both of us.  I have stayed in several hotels in Europe and I think this one was smaller, but to keep costs low, I ordered the standard (cheapest) room.  The bathroom was almost as large as the room, but I think it must have been a disabled accessible bath.  The front desk personnel were VERY nice and always attentive to our needs.  The place was clean and well kept.  There was a bank at the end of the street (for those who may need an ATM).  The hotel sat in the middle of the block and over in the next block was the South Kensington station along with a bunch of eating places.  When we sat in the room and listened very closely, we could hear the subway.  It was like the distant thunder on a summer day.  Thank you to those who suggested getting a room on an upper floor.  I called ahead to do so and had no problem getting one.  I think that might have helped keep the subway noise to a minimum. 

Overall, my mom had an excellent birthday trip and both of us were pleased with our stay at The Ampersand Hotel.  I would not hesitate to suggest this hotel to anyone -- the staff are extremely helpful and friendly and it is right at the S. Kensington station which is on several subway lines.  It is just a few stops from the major sites and about 10 minutes walk to Harrods.  By the way, there is a little french bookstore right across the street that you should check out too.",5,2013,10,06
129,"Doggy freindly - super cute, cosy and friendly hotel","I had to travel with my beloved dog back to London from Dubai due to nasty landlords out here.  It's a temporary solution while we buy a property in France - doggy will be staying with family, running like a nutter in their lovely big garden for the next few months.  I decided to stay my last week with him for the transition and looked for doggy friendly hotels in London.  I came across this one and was impressed by the reviews and fantastic location. Booked, arrived with the little munchkin and from the very beginning we were made to feel super welcome - especially my cutie little shadow, who everyone made a big fuss about (what dog owner doesn't love it when everyone coos over their cute four legged best buddy???).  The room we stayed on was small but more than comfortable - super cosy.  The bathroom was really lovely - perfect for the two of us, and the location couldn‚Äôt have been better.  All in all, a fantastic little city pied a terre, and perfect home away from home if you decide to take a city break with your dog :).  We will definitely be staying again!",5,2013,10,06
129,What a great stay!,"We booked this hotel based on a friend's recommendation from several years ago, and we could not have been any more happy about the hotel and the service that we received.  We arrived early in the morning and of course our room was not ready, but they have nice waterclosets (about 5 or 6) that you can use to freshen up (we flew overnight), change, etc, and they kept your luggage until your room was ready, and when we got back to the room, our luggage was already in our room.  The location is wonderful.  Right neat the South Kensington Station, and there are tons of coffee houses, dessert places, and restaurants within walking distance.  It is only a couple of blocks from Hyde Park and the museums. The front desk personnel could not have been any more accommodating and were so friendly each time we interacted with them.  There was one female attendant (whom I can't remember her name, but know she is from Scotland) would always remember what we were doing and ask us specifically about it when we got back.  I almost wanted to hug her when we left!  I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London.",5,2013,10,04
129,Ridiculously small room,"The hotel is pretty, good location, great staff, but the room was simply too tiny. We had been traveling for 2 weeks already so we had decent amount of bags and could barely move and we are not large people. If we had been staying more than the one night, I would have asked to be moved. The size of the space was insulting. We travel a lot and I don't mind small rooms, this was absurd.",3,2013,10,04
129,A small paradise in a big city,"Everything was amazing right from the beginning! A bottle of champain was waiting us with a greeting card in our room. The location is ideal, just a few seconds walk for the underground station and a bus stop just outside. Extremely clean and cozy!",5,2013,10,03
129,Fantastic hotel and very friendly staff,"My daughter, her future mother in law and myself stayed at the ampersand last week but unfortunately for only one night.  The hotel was Absolutely First Class, the staff were very friendly and professional.  The bedrooms were really well equipped, comfy beds and pillows and a real treat after a long day wedding dress shopping in London.  Breakfast was first class and before we left for the train we enjoyed cakes and coffee (and a little prosecco to celebrate).  Will definitely stay there again when we return for the second fitting!",5,2013,10,03
129,Start of the Honeymoon,"Lovely, newly renovated hotel, close to South Kensington tube station.  Nicely appointed rooms and facilities in the Lounge and games room.  And, of course, a great restaurant for breakfast downstairs.

We stayed at the Ampersand for our wedding night  -  Although we were happy enough with our room, we were a bit disappointed that no extra effort at all had been made, despite earlier informing staff.  Also, we had booked a Deluxe Studio, but were not given one of these which had the bath in the room (which I had viewed earlier), and seemed to be a smaller room in comparison too.  In my view, this is a different class of room, so be sure to confirm this when you book.",4,2013,10,03
129,Fantastic location and great decor,"I sound like a broken record, but yes, I chose this hotel based on the TA reviews.  Also, my sister told me South Kensington is a great location when staying in London.  So, this was the hotel we picked for our first time ever in London.  Of course, with the overnight flight from the states, we got to the hotel around 8:30 and, not surprisingly (I was expecting this), our room was not ready.  Being the planner that I am, I figured we could hit the V and A museum (a short walk away) and then, hopefully, the room would be ready.  The hotel stashed our bags and we sat down for a few minutes to get our bearings.  Before we could head out to the museum, they told us our room was ready.  Nice surprise.  Off we went to our room. I found it, and the whole hotel, very chic and inviting.  Obviously, this is an older building (which you would expect in London), but the way they renovated was, as they say, quite smashing.  Whoever did the design in the room to the right of the check in, should get an award.  This is the room where you apparently get breakfast and coffee. We later had tea here.  Back to our room...it was small as expected (it's Europe!).  However, the bath was bigger than what I expected. Also, they had a window we could open in the bath, which I always love.  Two sinks in the bath, which was quite a surprise.  They also had the wonderful Miller-Harris bath products from London.  Great choice; local and smells great!  The service in this hotel was great at the front desk.  We tried the tea on our first afternoon and it turned out to be the best hot tea I've ever had in my life (the lemon tea).  I couldn't believe how great it was. Of course, we ended up going back for tea the next two days, even pretty late in the afternoon.  I found the service interesting in this area, though.  Although they were always quick to greet us and get our order, once the tea was brought out, they were gone, never to come back and check on us.  The servers were all very nice; it seemed they just didn't get the concept of checking back to make sure all was well. Fortunately, we didn't need anything, but still...  All in all, the tea was so great, I would go back there again in a heartbeat.
I should also mention what a great location this hotel is. I found it to be perfectly situated for sightseeing in London.  The tube station is right around the corner.  There's a really good breakfast cafe' called Muriel's that serves fresh OJ and fantastic coffee. This is about 40 seconds from the front door of the hotel. Be forewarned; it was always busy.  The icing on Ampersand's cake was a Ben's cookies just 2 door down from Muriel's.  These cookies are amazing!!  Hot, fresh and very interesting flavors (but, they still have the good ol' standards, which I love).  Do not go to Ampersand without stopping for cookies to go at Ben's.",5,2013,10,03
129,Elegant hotel in a lovely area,"We stayed at the Ampersand in September. 
What a beautifully appointed hotel! we loved our room which was light, airy and the details were beautiful! The free mini bar was great and a lovely touch. The bath products were also nice. The tube is about a 1 min walk and everything we needed was just a street away. The staff were lovely and friendly. We also had high tea at the hotel which was nice. Nothing was too much trouble for the wait staff. We would stay here again and it made our stay in London one to remember.",5,2013,10,02
129,"Whimsical, well-appointed hotel in a great London location.","A modern hotel with all of the amenities one could ask for. Less than a block from the metro, the location was very convenient to accessing all of London. The area around the hotel was active with shops, places to eat and museums.

The physical plant is modern,clean uses the ampersand in amusing ways around the facility. My wife and I stayed in a superior room with a king bed. The room was too small for the bed. A queen bed would have made the room seem more spacious. We stayed for 4 days and had inadequate shelf storage for our clothing. The staff was friendly and solicitous. They assisted us with directions, restaurant recommendations and were a,ways amiable no matter how trivial the issue. Prior to arrival the hotel arranged for car pickup at the airport.

The hotel bar and restaurant were always busy. We stopped in once for breakfast but left because it was too busy. We enjoyed ending or evenings with a nightcap at the bar. 

We would definitely consider returning to this hotel next time we are in London.",4,2013,10,02
129,"Elegant, classy and modern","Last night in the UK and we were pleased we picked this hotel as the good bye present to ourselves. :) 

Classy, modern, elegant and stylish. 

Staff are the key to a very good hotel, and this hotel excels at hiring good, decent, and top quality staff. You just know that the staff were hand picked for their exceptional skills! 

The concierge was amazing! She is not only a fantastic front for the hotel but was helpful, knowledgeable and nice to talk to as well! 

We stayed in a room that was equipped with everything that we needed and more! 

Very large and very comfortable luxurious bed, fresh and crisp linen, soft pillows, lots of cushions (always a bonus for me), soft headboard (so you do not need to prop up heaps of pillows if you're sitting up in bed), electronic light board beside both sides of the bed that control all the lights in the room as well as the WC if you need a late night toilet run. 

TV was large, modern and very good reception, all channels worked, signal strong. Wifi was strong and worked throughout the whole room. 

The little touches were great! Luxurious bathrobes with very thick and soft slippers, plunger coffee with decaf as well as caffeinated coffee available, mini bar stocked with fresh milk, free still and bubbly water, free juice and free coke. 

Loved the chaise lounge, very modern and quite comfortable. 

Bathroom was large, two shower heads for a couple to shower together, disabled friendly (which we were happy to see as my husband is slightly disabled), fold out bars and a fold out chair for in the shower area. Lovely luxurious bath towels, soft citrusy soaps, and plenty of extras if you need them. 

Room service was top quality, excellent customer service, brilliant food and lots of it! 

Downfalls - windows probably needed an extra glaze to remove outside noise however if you have earplugs, then it shouldn't be too much of a problem. (maybe as a curtesy the hotel could offer them to rooms next to the street?)

We loved this hotel and will stay here again if we were to ever go to the UK again! ",5,2013,10,01
129,Excellent,"Absolutely perfect stay at the Ampersand. If you are looking for reviews to help you make a decision whether to book the ampersand or not, just do it, you won't be disappointed! Nothing is too much trouble for the young vibrant staff, decor is fresh and thoughtful, tube stop is steps away as is the V&A which is def worth a visit.",5,2013,09,30
129,What a great hotel this is.,"I cannot fault this hotel in any way. Although you may noticed I marked it only 4 out of 5 for sleep quality, this was nothing to do with the hotel (the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in), more the traffic noise outside but this is a big city and you just have to deal with it (we always pack ear plugs). The hotel itself was spotlessly clean. Every single member of staff we came across was helpful and courteous. Our continental breakfast was included in the price but if you opt not to eat in the hotel there are numerous eating places locally. Getting to and finding the hotel was simple (come straight out of S.Kensington underground station and it's about 100 yards away).
When we have to stay over in London we will definitely re-book here.",5,2013,09,30
129,The second visit was as good as the first!,"When my daughter-in-law wanted to take a friend to London for an overnight stay on her birthday - I didn't want her to stay anywhere else than The Ampersand. Based on my husband's previous visit, we knew the location and service would be outstanding. She couldn't compliment the hotel and staff enough!

My daughter-in-law commented on the comfort of the room and how pretty the decor was. Purple is her favorite color, so the deep purple tone of the deluxe accommodations were perfect for her. 

Prior to the trip, I had many long-distance contacts with the Ampersand reception staff. they always answered my questions and requests promptly. The staff arranged for a driver to meet the small group at the airport and bring them to the hotel. A short delay in returning to the airport was immediately addressed by the hotel management.

There are many wonderful hotels in London, but there is a good reason why The Ampersand is getting so much notice in travel magazines and well-rated hotels. We would be disappointed if we had to stay elsewhere when visiting London.",5,2013,09,30
129,"A great newly refurbished modern hotel, beside South Kensington underground.","From the quote's adorning the walls to the music in the bathroom, this is a great boutique style hotel. The dinning area is very cool, with an old school vibe.  I don't know how the price compares in London but at ¬£250 a night per room it was probably right. ",4,2013,09,30
129,Comfortable & cosy,"Enjoyed our week's stay. As we arrived there were new mattresses being delivered...very comfortable beds after some long site-seeing days. Lovely little restaurant downstairs...had tapas the evening we arrived and was a perfect start to our London experience. Breakfast buffet available, also handy to Pret a Manger, Starbucks and other amenities. Friendly knowledgeable staff...booked hop on-hop off for us and bus stopped right in front of hotel. South Kensington station near by...bought an Oyster Card at station and travelled all around. Hotel offered bright small rooms downstairs for relaxing, playing cards and billards. Free computer access...2 terminals downstairs.",5,2013,09,29
129,Ampersand Hotel -- perfect for a London stay,"Perfect London holiday at the Ampersand.  What more can I say in terms of what hasn't already been said.  Great location, very helpful and youthful staff, clean and nicely appointed rooms, etc.  We arrived late on a Sunday evening and stayed 4 nights.  No problems and very pleasant accommodation.   Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,09,29
129,Perfection,"How do you spell perfection ? Easy :  A.M.P.E.R.S.A.N.D.  Everything you read about the Ampersand Hotel is true. I stayed at the Ampersand for 6 nights in last August and everything was perfect. We booked a Deluxe studio room which is spacious and well designed. Loved the turndown service. We were on the third floor and we could barely notice the Underground. South Kensington underground station is just across the street and you can easily access all of London's major attraction. There is also a taxi station right in front of the hotel, which is very convenient. South Kensington is great for visiting London. Easy walk from the hotel for many restaurants and pubs. Service at the Ampersand is superb. Rooms are quiet and confortable. Go for the Deluxe studio room, you won't regret it. The Nespresso machine is a nice touch. All in all, our stay at Ampersand hotel was perfect. My only wish is to return at the Ampersand sooner than I expect. Thank you Ampersand !  Don't forget the little blue ducky when leaving.",5,2013,09,28
129,An excellent choice for a London stay,"We just returned from a weeks' stay at the Ampersand. All in all, we had a wonderful experience there. We appreciated that a room was ready for us when we arrived early in the morning.  The staff was friendly and eager to help. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds ever. As others have said, the location is great-- very close to the tube, a few stops away from most major attractions, but in a nice little neighborhood to come back to at the end of the day. It's a bustling area, but without the masses of tourists as you'd find right by the prime attractions. 

The room (deluxe room) was clean, cheerful, well-decorated and had some nice technological amenities.  It was fairly small, but we expect that in Europe. The only thing that kept me from giving the hotel 5 stars, though, is that there was pretty much NO room to store clothes. No drawers. One shelf in the tiny closet. I could only unpack some of my things (and we traveled relatively light) and my husband lived out of his suitcase. Not optimal for a weeks' vacation. Even in a small room, there could have been some more clever storage.  We would absolutely stay here again, but would probably upgrade to a deluxe suite.",4,2013,09,28
129,Cool design and great service,"Stayed here for 4 nights. This is a big hotel but the design and service excellence of the staff made it feel like a boutique. The location is great for the Piccadilly Line so you can get here easily from Heathrow. The staff were helpful with theatre tickets and when there was a mistake with the price they remedied it quickly. The rooms are beautifully designed and fitted out. The road can be a little noisy but nothing out of the ordinary for a city hotel. The only reason I didn't rate as 5 star was the value. It is in a very pricey area of London so I would expect it to be expensive, however as a very experienced Traveller who has stayed in London before it seemed a bit high. If the breakfast was included in the rate rather than a paid extra I think the rate would be more reasonable. Regarding the breakfast, we had it there 2 mornings and the continental spread was 2nd to none, absolutely excellent. Overall this hotel is highly recommended.",5,2013,09,26
129,"Great location, helpful staff","We stayed at the Ampersand for two nights in early September. Beautiful hotel and very helpful staff. Close to the underground which made getting to the sites of London very easy. We did have a problem in our room both nights in which a closet light would come on by itself at about 4am. Although the staff did try to fix it, the problem was not resolved. They did give us some compensation for the inconvienence. We stayed in a superior double which was plenty roomy considering we weren't in the room that much. Little touches made for a very comfortable stay like the free mini bar and very nice bathroom with robe and slippers (and yes a rubber ducky!) We didn't try the restaurants, but would recommend a stay here. We will mostly likely choose to stay here again if we find ourselves in London again. ",4,2013,09,26
129,Perfect London Getaway,"We stayed 4 nights in the hotel. Loved the location, close to everything, however in a quiet neighborhood, Loved the decor, and the bedroom was amazing, from the miller harris products, to the rubber duck, to huge and conmfortable bed, to the Nespresso machine. But this, probably because we asked for the room with the free standing bath. It was expensive, however we think it was money well spent for a getaway that was ment for mainly for rest and a little sightseeing. 
Apero's food is amazing, good and fullfiling, and not expensive at all.
We do recomend this hotel, and have really few, if no critics to make. (We would like fresh orange juice everyday, that was only served if we specifically asked for it). See, a really small critic. :)",5,2013,09,26
129,Fabulous hotel!,We loved this hotel!  The staff were friendly and efficient!  The decor was lovely!  We were very impressed by the little touches in the rooms.  Good car service from the airport . Great location! We ate at the restaurant and had a delicious dinner with great service by Joseph!  Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2013,09,26
129,Comfortable Hotel,"We enjoyed our recent three nights at the Ampersand. The location is perfect for for sightseeing. We took the Tube from Heathrow to South Kensington (with only a few dozen steps from the District Line after transferring at Hammersmith) and the hotel is steps away. We stayed in a deluxe studio - a comfortable large room - which was beautifully decorated. We had dinner one night at the hotel restaurant, Apero, which was very good. One word of warning - this location can be noisy. There is a lot of traffic in the area which can be heard even with double glazed windows, and on the first floor the rumbles of the Tube were clearly heard. These noises didn't bother us too much, but if you are used to very quiet night you might want to specify a room in the back on a higher floor to get a good night's rest. ",4,2013,09,25
129,Very good location,"Stylish and quiet hotel. Very new. Small rooms but with everything needed in the room. Very beautiful bathroom. Very tasty breakfast. And a great location. A two minute walk to the tube station. Near Victoria and Albert Museum, Harrods and many other interesting places.
Next time will stay here only.",5,2013,09,25
129,Wonderful stay,"We stayed for 3 nights in this wonderful hotel.  The rooms were clean and well decorated. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the staff was excellent.  LOVED the free mini-bar (sodas and water, not alcohol) and the service.  Location is pretty good, very close to the underground but sometimes felt a bit far from the major attractions.  However, everything was still easy to get to.",5,2013,09,25
129,Afraid to tell anyone about this gem!,"One of my favourite hotels of all time - charming decor, delicious food and wine, great location, clean and safe.  Where the Ampersand excels, though, is in the small touches - a rubber ducky in the bath, complimentary soft drinks, coffee, and cookies in our room, heated bathroom floor, and an umbrella for a walk in the rain.  I'm afraid to tell anyone of this gem - I want to keep it to myself!!",5,2013,09,23
129,A real Gem with exceptional staff,"My husband and I were celebrating his 60th birthday by spending a week in London exploring the city. We decided on the Ampersand based on recommendations by our travel agent and the reviews on Trip Advisor.  The reviews were spot on, the location is great as you have access to #3 major Tube lines at the South Kensington station across the street. There is a bus stop right outside the front entrance that is convenient(unless it is around rush hour and you have to try move through crowd to get to the front door)A Tesco express is nearby in case you need some groceries. There are several restaurants on Old Brompton a couple of blocks away as well as a very busy local pub. The best place for breakfast or lunch is the Raison D'Etre on Bute St right around the corner.  The owner, Matt, is French so the pan chocolat, croissants or sandwiches on baguettes are exquisite.  
The hotel is new and well maintained, pop for a deluxe room if you need a little more space. Housekeeping keeps your room immaculate, the bed is very comfortable and the bath towels are very plush. The complimentary wifi and refreshments in the fridge are a plus.The staff is friendly, efficient and very professional.  They go out of their way to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.  Visit Marek in the Apero Bar if you want friendly service and entertainment when he makes one of many designer drinks out of the fresh produce and potions he has behind the bar.  Pay attention to the rave reviews and book this hotel, you will not be disappointed.",5,2013,09,22
129,Very Nice Hotel- Great Area,"We just got back from a 20th Anniversary trip to Paris and London. The 1st week was 8 days in Paris and then 5 in London at the Ampersand Hotel. The Hotel went through a major renovation last year and it looks great. The front desk always had very happy smiling people to check you in and help you during your stay. The beds are very comfortable and bathrooms very modern. I wish hotels would get rid of the high bathtubs you have to climb over to get to the shower. The 
""ONLY"" complaint is the tube noise that roars through the hotel till midnight and resumes at 5 in the morning.  The hotel is in a great location with a lot of very good restaurants and museums in the area.",4,2013,09,21
129,A wonderful oasis,"Had a great stay at the Ampersand, returned 3 times, it is right In the centre of South Kensington, but peaceful, friendly and attentive staff, and gorgeous deco.  Rooms are comfortable and spacious.  A real gem of a hotel.",5,2013,09,21
129,Ampersand Hotel Review,"We are currently billeted at the Ampersand.  We stayed here for 3 nights last week, moved out to another hotel in the City for 2 nights to be near my husband's meeting venue and moved back again to the Ampersand for another 5 nights once those meetings were done.

We are very happy to have chosen this hotel.  It certainly deserves all the great reviews it's been getting.  We are staying in a deluxe studio, which is supposedly bigger than the deluxe room.  TIP: We were able to get better rates directly from the hotel website by booking 3 nights for the price of 2.  Funny thing is that the deluxe studio rates were better than the smaller deluxe rooms on certain dates so we took advantage of this.  

I ordered something from Amazon before arriving and emailed the hotel to ask if they could keep the package for me.  They responded promptly and positively.  Upon arriving at the hotel, the package was already waiting for me in the room.

Plus'
(i) new and hip interiors
(ii) heated bathroom floors
(iii) complimentary coke, juice, water, cookies which are regularly re-filled
(iv) complimentary wi-fi
(v) accessibility, right across from South Kensington tube stop
(vi) friendly, professional staff
(vii) near bakeries, restaurants, Pret a Manger, etc.
(ix) 5 mins away from Museum of National History, Victoria & Albert
(x) very clean and well-maintained

Minus'
Can't think of any

Would certainly recommend this hotel.  Glad we discovered this gem of a hotel.",5,2013,09,20
129,Perfect Boutique in Kennsington,"Recently stayed at Ampersand in early September 2013.  The room appeared to be recently refurbished and wasin excellent condition (more spacious than expected).  The hotel is an effortless walk from the Underground S Kennsington station.  Also, the mini fridge is stocked with a complimentarybottle of still water, sparkling water, orange juice, apple juice, coke and diet coke (small bottle of each).  A nice gesture when compared to the $4 and up mini fridge prices in most hotels in the States.  Definitely would recommend a stay at Ampersand on your next visit to London.",5,2013,09,20
129,Fantastic,We had an amazing time in the Ampersand hotel. The location was perfect. The staff were attentive. The rooms had everything you would expect plus a few pleasant surprises. The internet allowed me to continue conducting business. I will be coming back with my family!,5,2013,09,19
129,A wonderful boutique hotel,"My husband and I were treated to a night at this lovely hotel by our daughter and son in law ,as we had arranged to meet relatives visiting London from Australia, The hotel is close to South Kensington tube station , near to shops, pubs and restaurants and a short walk to several   museum's and a stroll to Knightsbridge for Harrods, Harvey Nichols etc. Our room was on the second floor and although not as roomy as some hotels we've stayed in was well appointed with a comfortable bed and in the refrigerator was complimentary fresh milk, water and soft drinks.  We decided to have a drink at the end of our day in the Apero ,which is also where we enjoyed a great breakfast. We would definitely return to enjoy this hotel again and I would like to compliment all the staff we encountered from reception to housekeeping, everyone we saw smiled, spoke but also seemed to enjoy their employment which helped to make this a very pleasant experience.",5,2013,09,19
129,Fabulous Hotel,"I stayed at the Ampersand with my family in September/13. The staff was exceptional. Very helpful and knowledgeable.  The room was fabulous...large for London standards and very clean.  Everything was taken care of, we never had to ask twice.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,09,19
129,Great find,"Loved the location which is quite close to the tube station.  Everything about the hotel is very good from responsive reception to organized check out. The room size and bathroom was adequate.  Why not put in a plug in the bathroom so the hair dryer could be used in front of the mirror instead of standing in front of the closet?  The breakfast service was a little slow with the coffee, but pretty good.  Could use a better cereal selection and fewer sugary baked goods. If you're a light sleeper, the tube does run underneath the hotel.  Our room was on the 4th floor and I still heard it rumbling to life every morning at 6:30 AM.",4,2013,09,18
129,Delightful Hotel in great location.,"My husband and I just stayed two nights at this delightful hotel. Our room was a junior suite we were upgraded on arrival.  We had a spacious bathroom, comfortable bed and a mini bar that was filled with non alcoholic beverages, juice and milk that were complimentary.  The breakfast was more than just a continental we had a complete menu to choose from. The location is a short walk away from the underground and a few blocks from Kensington gardens, The V and A and the natural history museum. There are a number of coffee shops, pubs and restaurants just down the block. I would say that this hotel is a modern update to British hospitality and priced well. For those women out there that have never been to England, there are not outlets in bathrooms to dry your hair. You are give a small mirror and are expected to dry your hair with out a full vanity. This is safety policy in all the hotels we stayed in.",5,2013,09,18
129,Wonderful when staying in London,"My husband and I had stayed at this hotel several years ago and after looking for a place to stay this trip we decided to stay again and are very glad we did.  They  recently renovated this hotel so the improvements were a nice surprise. We stayed for 4 nights and had no complaints at all.    The room was quiet, comfortable and very clean.  We found the room size to be very good.  The bed was very comfortable.  Wonderful location if you are staying in London, you can walk to  a lot of places, the tube station is right beside the hotel, and easy access to the buses. We found the staff to be very nice and helpful.  Breakfast was very good.",5,2013,09,18
129,Very nice hotel,"The hotel has a perfect location - everything you need is nearby, buses and underground 100 metres away. The hotel is tastefully furnished, the rooms aswell - but our double room was very small. This is London-style - in other cities we would have expected a few more square metres. Comfortable beds! Friendly staff, lovely afternoon tea etc etc. Go for it, you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,09,18
129,Yet again a 5 star luxury experience,"I have already done a review for this hotel on my first visit last November & as it was yet again so superb I just had to do another! A different twin room on the ground floor this time which my sister & I thought was even nicer than our previous room. The politeness & friendliness of the staff in this hotel is 2nd to none. Nothing is too much trouble, their knowledge of the hotel & surrounding areas is superb & they make you feel very special & at ease without being over fussy. We were going to see the David Bowie Exhibition at the V&A & if you want to go to the V&A it couldn't be better placed ....a very short walk. The cleanliness of the hotel & rooms are perfect & when asked for an iron it was there almost as soon as I put the phone down....The whole weekend experience could not be faulted & again in our eyes is one of the best comfortable, trendy, value, unpretentious hotels in London. Well done again The Ampersand!! 10/10",5,2013,09,17
129,5* As It Should Be,"I'm not often a fan of these review sites as my general opinion is that people have become way to pre-occupied in finding fault in hotels and restaurants rather than enjoying their experience to the full however on this occasion I feel utterly compelled to share my experience of the Ampersand Hotel. 

Upon arriving at the Ampersand the perfectly presented exterior of the beautiful  ""what I assume is"" Victorian building is impressive in itself but once you set foot inside the true experience begins. The staff, well what can I say, every member of staff we had any interaction with were attentive, kind and polite to a level rarely seen in modern hotels these days. All too often these days we experience scripted welcomes, & disingenuous attentiveness however this was quite the opposite. 

Now on to the internal d√©cor, well there are internal areas of this hotel where quite frankly the attention to detail leaves you speechless; the bar / ""Apero"" restaurant is something to behold. With its design /  d√©cor & the first class, laid back but super efficient service mixed with the outstanding food & wine it makes for a great place to spend a lovely long afternoon or evening.

I could pretty much go on for ages but rather than make this some long winded appreciation exercise to which other readers may in fact find disingenuous in its self, I would simply like to thank The Ampersand and all of its staff fro truly living up to what a 5* hotel experience should be, uncompromising in quality down to every last detail. Keep up the great work! 

I'll be back as soon as I have worked off the extra pounds gained by the amazing cakes!!!",5,2013,09,16
129,A fabulous hotel,"I stayed overnight at this hotel for a conference in London the following day. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the rooms luxurious, spotlessley clean, well equipped and the staff friendly and professional. It is the ideal choice for a stay in London if you plan to visit the museums and shops close by. The restaurant is also a great choice - nice menus and competitively priced for  this area of town. I don't hesitate to recommend it to you if you can afford the room rates. It's lovely.",5,2013,09,16
129,Beautiful,"Elegant, in an ideal location. The rooms are beautifully furnished and make for a very pleasant stay. 

Excellent breakfast, with prompt service.

The ducks in the rooms are a very nice touch. However, there were no power points close to mirrors. This made it very difficult in preparing for the day - hairdryers etc. We were able to procure one from housekeeping but this is a particularly poor design.

 There was only one issue with reception, where multiple guests pushed in front of us, as my friend and I looked a lot younger than the average clientele.",5,2013,09,15
129,warm and classy boutique hotel,The Ampersand looks both classic and edgy and feels both friendly and sophisticated.  It is in an excellent location very close to the South Kensington Underground station and also in the heart of a wonderful area for dining.  Rooms are not large but are totally adequate and are tastefully appointed and comfortable.  It was a bit of a challenge trying to coordinate the use of the hairdryer with a mirror in our room but not a problem in our friends' room.  The staff are more than willing to provide any information anytime and it is a treat to be welcomed back to the hotel with friendly smiles every time you return.,5,2013,09,13
129,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"If you would like to stay in a very unique hotel in An accessible part of London where there are friendly staff ,good food and comfortable beds,then go to the Ampersand.
It is very close to the South Kensington tube,museums  and numerous good restaurants.The decor is most unusual ,with relaxing public rooms and comfortable but compact bedrooms with little extras like free soft drinks and robes and slippers.U have eaten in the restaurant downstairs,good tapas style food,regular price for London,great restaurant staff.All in all a little gem.Oh and do try the cakes and coffee in the drawing room!",4,2013,09,12
129,We didn't want to leave...,"My boyfriend and I have just got home after a weekend in London and a three night stay at the wonderful Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington.  Wow, we loved it!  I umm-ed and ahh-ed over booking it about a month ago because of the price (nowhere near unreasonable, but expensive for a young couple) and eventually decided to go for it as a special treat for a special weekend - we were there for a wedding.  It did not disappoint.  We arrived very early on Friday morning into London City Airport and it was an easy journey by DLR and then district line and once off the tube at South Kensington a 30 second stroll across the road.  Check in is 2pm but the helpful and very friendly staff looked after our bags and we went downstairs for breakfast at Apero then out for the day.  The breakfast menu is fantastic and extensive.  Our room (a deluxe studio on the 3rd floor) was beautiful and spacious - I had read that rooms were on the small side but we weren't disappointed.  It was beautifully decorated and clean and had the comfiest bed I've ever slept in!  We could hear the hum of the traffic outside but this wasn't a problem for us as we live in a sleepy ski resort in Switzerland and relish city life now and again!  I believe the rooms are soundproofed anyway.  Also the tube vibrated slightly up through the floors but this was exciting, although that may sound strange!!!  I imagine on a lower floor it could be louder and more disruptive.  We were blown away by the TileVision TV in the shower and the little extras go a long way - free soft drinks in the mini bar, a Nespresso machine (yes, really!) including fresh milk topped up each day.  Even a little rubber duck as a gift, or so we assumed as we have brought it back with us!
I was confused by the high tech door lock and wasn't sure if I had pressed no to the cleaning service.  By 5pm my room hadn't been cleaned but I explained my mistake and asked reception if it could be and a cleaner was in there within 20 minutes.  There was even a turn down service - small touches which make all the difference.
We ate in Apero on our first night and were served by a delightful and informative waiter and the meal was fantastic.  I've heard the afternoon tea in the drawing rooms is a must but we didn't manage it this time so I look forward to our next visit.  Despite the price we had a wonderful stay and definitely won't be staying anywhere else the next time we are in London.  We checked out very reluctantly on Monday morning... Thank you Ampersand for a fantastic weekend.",5,2013,09,12
129,Bootique hotel in South Kensington,"The location is very convenient right next to South Kensington station and the museum district. The hotel is new, clean and quite stylish.  We liked the room decor - which helped since it had a view of adjacent wall.  There were many little extras that made the room even better, like free soft drinks, heated floors, nice toiletries and a rubber duckie.  
The service was good, very helpful with suggestion and recommendations.  There was a small glitch when our room was not ready when promised (or they didn't call us as promised - the outcome is the same).  If not for that I would have given it 5 stars.",4,2013,09,11
129,Great new find in South Kensington,"My old standby, Aster House, was full so I opted for the fairly new Ampersand hotel nearby. Small reception area but very friendy, professional, and welcoming staff, all neatly groomed and most -- surprisingly -- quite young. Got upgraded which was nice. Room was very spacious, faced the front street (but sound-proofed by the windows) and high tech -- took me a while to figure out some of the switches but that was a fun challenge. The air-conditioning is a plus during the summer heat especially because it was too noisy below to open the window much of the time. And the TV in the bathroom was an unexpected plus. Didnt sample the breakfast as there are too many good eateries nearby, including Paul Bakery at the South Kensington Tube stop a block away. Overall, a quality etsablishment with great service. I'll definitely return here in the future (but dont tell Leonie at Aster House I said so!).",5,2013,09,10
129,Knock out reception desk,"Registration personnel made our experience in London easy.  Directions and recommendations were spot on!  Fantastic location to the tube without the noise.  The restaurant down stairs was accommodating to my wife's vegetarian diet, serving a 5 star menu with a friendly hospitality.  The owner was onsite and attentive.",5,2013,09,10
129,Best hotel in London,"This is my third stay at The Ampersand Hotel and it just keeps getting better. It is situated ust across from South Kensington tube station - an ideal location if you're visiting places like the Natural History Museum, V&A, Royal Albert Hall, Hyde Park & Harrods - all within walking distance! The rooms are so stylish with lots of lovely little extras - robes, slippers, lovely toiletries, free soft drinks, rubber duck in the shower to take home - cute! The bathroom is really spacious too, with a large shower and under floor heating which was fab. We also booked afternoon tea which I cannot recommend highly enough, Ji Sun the pastry chef is incredibly talented - you MUST book in for this if you stay here...it's worth every penny and is perfect for a special occasion! All the staff are so helpful and really make you feel welcome - can't wait for my next stay!",5,2013,09,10
129,Great Modern Hotel,"I booked this hotel for somewhere special to stay on the last night of a 3 week trip and was relieved to find it was absolutely lovely. The staff were fantastic and the air-conditioning was a welcome relief from a couple of hotel stays without it. It was a wonderfully unique hotel with high tech gadgets and great decor. The bed was comfortable and bathroom was lovely. I also appreciated the fridge with free water, softdrink and juice. If I was to get picky the light switches were a bit confusing, the room a bit small and the cupboard was only half length so I couldn't really hang my dress up. That was more than made up for with the wonderful bar, great location near South Kensington tube (on Picadilly line for those coming from Heathrow) and museums like the V&A and excellent staff though. I would definitely return and recommend it to others staying in London too.",5,2013,09,09
129,very good hotel in an excellent location,"I stayed for two nights at the Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington. The hotel opened about a year ago after a total refurbishment of the builing, of the rooms and of the common parts. My experience was really positive. Common parts are very clean, bright and pleasant. My room (a single room) was very small (too small?) in the sense that, apart from the big and very comfortable bed, there was really very limited space. But all amenities were present, including a well funcioning and silent air conditioning system. The bathroom was proportionally quite big and very pleasant, with a big shower. Again all amenities were present. If I can make a comment, I would say that there was too little light in the room. Some more lamps could have been useful.
Breakfast was good although I was slightly disappointed by the cereals, especially considering the cereal-culture of the UK. Cereals were slightly too much of the sweet type.
Staff was very nice.",4,2013,09,09
129,Exquisite Antique Science Chic,"We've stayed here twice now, and absolutely cannot say enough good things about The Ampersand. The location is perfect, the staff impeccably helpful, the restaurants AMAZING and don't get me started on the decor! It's beautiful without being stiff, and upon closer inspection, you realize the delightful scientific themes of the different floors, which seem to echo the several centuries of exploration and discovery of our natural world that are so beautifully presented at the Natural History Museum nearby. And the guest rooms (or the two we've stayed in) each keep to the floor's theme in some way, complete with a brilliant bedside reading book. For science geek guests like ourselves, I don't think we've ever been more impressed.  
 
Our advice to other travelers is to DEFINITELY have a drink in the bar downstairs - the waitstaff there can be a bit hit or miss, but the beverage concoctions (and food) are not to be missed, and again, the interior design really shines.",5,2013,09,08
129,"Comfortable, great location","Friendly staff at all times but not sure about the casual dress. We had executive room .. So spacious, comfortable, loads of gadgets, nice spacious bathroom ... Nice toiletries, bathrobes, slippers, free soft drinks, tea and coffee .... In room. Did not eat in restaurant but understand continental breakfast not worth price, so went out each morning to coffee shops around ... Great location for Sth Ken tube and many bus routes ... Very much liked this hotel ... Would say a good 4 star but not 5 like Ritz Berin!",4,2013,09,08
129,An absolute gem,"I stayed on my own at the Ampersand for two nights in August and I can't fault it. I had discovered the hotel by accident in June when I tried to stay in a hotel around the corner and it was fully booked and they said why not try ' The Ampersand'? So I went in, and even though they had no free rooms I could see immediately what a cool beautiful place it was, and even though i could not stay there that time the staff were so friendly that i stayed and had a pot of tea and admired the decor , the paintings and the cakes and vowed that on my next trip i would book ahead and stay there. it did not disappoint. A luxurious comfortable boutique hotel in a fantastic location just across the road from South Kensington tube station. From the start the staff are extremely friendly and can't do enough for you. Everyone smiles and chats. When I mentioned to the girl on the front desk how nice it is that everyone is so friendly and smiley she told me that it is because they absolutely love working there, there is a good team who've been working together for a while, and it absolutely shows. My room was a small double on the ground floor facing the back of the hotel. It was decorated beautifully, clean, very comfortable bed and sheets and pillows. Free soft drinks in the mini bar. Lovely little bathroom with nice products and a rubber duck! It felt like a real haven and very luxurious. I used the room service twice as I was very busy with paperwork and had no time to go out, and both times it was delicious and very reasonable prices. The first night I was there I thought it would be cheaper to go and eat out - I went to Muriel's Kitchen across the road - which was lovely - I would recommend that place too - but the second day lunch and dinner I stayed in my room working and ordered the room service and it was cheaper than going out. I had a chicken burger which was delicious and easily big enough to be filling even when I didn't eat the bread because of my diet!
Above all I found the staff to be so nice that it really felt like a home from home. The decor throughout is fantastic- I loved the paintings - and the bar at the front of the hotel is a jewel. I had a pot of tea there one afternoon and chatted with the lovely guy and girl who were working there, and drooled over the beautiful rustic table groaning under the weight of the most beautiful array of cakes and pastries and glass jars and lollipop cakes, which looked like they had come straight off the set of the film ' Marie Antoinette' - almost too beautiful to eat. A feast for the eyes!

What a treat the whole place is. I will DEFINITELY be regularly coming back with my husband to stay at the Ampersand as our London bolt hole. I'd better start saving up!",5,2013,09,06
129,Great Decor and Amenities -- Convenient Location,"We had a room on the 4th floor with 2 twin beds (my 12-year old son and I).  Cozy, as most London hotels are, but extremely well-appointed.  Nice linens, beautiful, modern decor, everything worked and lots of nice details.  Tea/coffee service (with biscuits), complimentary beverages in the fridge, no-fog mirrors, power adaptor, newspaper daily, umbrellas, robes, etc.  Restaurant in the lower level (where we had only breakfast) was delicious.  Staff were super nice and helpful.  Loved, loved the proximity to the Tube and there are also lots of great casual restaurants in the neighborhood.  Taxi stand right in front of the hotel as well.  Only nitpick is that they didn't do a turndown service (but I bet they would have if I had asked).  All-in-all, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,09,06
129,"Fantastic room, some services fall short","We had a superior room on the second floor for our 4 night stay.  The room was fantastic, with a double sink in the bathroom, TV in the tub, no-fog heated mirror.  It wasn't a huge room, but felt spacious, with enough room for a sofa at the end of the bed, an entry hall with a double bench across from the closet to accommodate two large suitcases, an armchair with a floor lamp and a separate desk with chair.   Free wi-fi in rooms and throughout the hotel.  Tea and coffee (and milk) and bottle water and sodas free in the room.  Loved the room.  Loved the Oyster Card style keyless access.   The somewhat complicated ""do not disturb"" light system meant that housekeeping did not clean our room the first day, but did come in to return our clean laundry.  The second day they only left towels for one person and did not provide the requested iron and ironing board.  They did, however, take the gratuity and note with the request.  The third day they took away the iron and ironing board we had gotten the front desk to deliver.  

Others have said that breakfast was good.  We don't agree. On this trip we traveled in England for 15 days and stayed at 7 hotels, including the Ampersand.   The Ampersand was one of the most expensive, but the continental breakfast was next to last in variety.  It was a very Italian breakfast, with an assortment of sweet pastries, but not enough assortment or flavor in anything else.  Typical white and dark bread slices to toast yourself.  Dry and tasteless ""sourdough"" bread.  Banana bread was missing flavor, too.  Raisins and/or nuts for your cereal, not available.  High fiber option for cereal,  not available.  Insipid fresh fruit salad, made up mostly of underripe out of season fruit.  We ended up buying glorious fresh British strawberries and blueberries to bring to breakfast.  The only hot meal option I ordered was eggs, they were fine.   The breakfast room staff was very sweet and worked hard at their jobs, but the room was understaffed.   They did know our names and tea/water/sweetener preferences by the second day.  The small service staff was responsible for seating people, taking orders, service, handling orders from and delivering room service breakfasts, and taking care of morning coffee/tea in the lobby lounge.

The hotel location is great, just across from the South Kensington tube station.  Arrival by car service was a little complicated because there is a bus stop immediately in front of the hotel, with a no stopping area.  The hotel does not have a doorman or bellman/porter, so I had to run inside to request help with our luggage, while my husband and the driver quickly unloaded to the curb.  There are steps into the hotel, also a challenge with the luggage.  Similar challenges at departure time:  no doorman to tell us our car had arrived, the driver ran in frantic, afraid to leave his car unattended,  nobody available to help get the luggage out, so the driver grabbed a piece as he ran back to the car, and my husband grabbed some as did I.   If there was a better way to get the luggage out, the staff who brought it down from our room did not suggest it.   He had returned to his regular job, at the front desk.  

Such a great room, nice amenities, comfortable lounge.  Service falls short of making this a great hotel.",4,2013,09,04
129,small luxury hotel at South Kensington Tube,"If you go to London, you will be using the Tube a lot, including going to and from Heathrow.  So unless you just have a backpack, and are dragging luggage, you need to be close to a Tube Station.  Ampersand is about 150' from the South Kensington Tube.  Very nice small luxury hotel, very attentive staff.  Bathroom floors heated, a nice touch.  Free WIFI.  There are a lot of nice little sidewalk cafes adjacent to S. Kensington, so it's easy to catch dinner or lunch.  Note that the exchange rate is awful now, so this is pricey.",5,2013,09,04
129,Great hotel in great location,"I cant add much to previous reviews.  We loved our 2 nights here - its in the best location making it easy to get everywhere. The car wasn't a problem.  The staff were fantastic, rooms comfortable, quiet and the windows opened, tea/coffee in the room etc. Basically all well thought out for the comfort of guests.   Our daughter had a tiny tiny room but it was for single occupancy and the bed so comfortable she absolutely loved it!  We would stay here again for sure.",5,2013,09,04
129,"Very nice boutique hotel, great location","The Ampersand is a very well decorated boutique hotel, kind of HIP, with a very lovely and helpful staff. The location is at the heart of South Kensington, ver nice neighbourhood, with many restaurants and cafes. The hotel is just a minute walking distance to the metro station, which makes the hotel much more convenient. 
The tea room, at the entrance floor, is a great place, especially for the afternoon tea. When I first saw ""reserved"" signs on the tables at 2pm, I thought is was a joke. But after a while, all the tables were really full, people enjoying their teas, coffees, and very delicious cakes!!!  
Our room was a deluxe one, with enough space (regarding London fact), it was comfortable, with the decoration and amenities. 
What was a little disappointing; even though I informed that this was our anniversary, by email few days before arrival and received a reply, no one looked aware, and there was nothing special, which is quite common at all the hotels.  
But it was a nice stay overall",4,2013,09,04
129,A boutique Hotel that lives up to it's reputation!,"We considered this an outstanding hotel for our 7 day stay in London. A great location with super helpful and friendly staff. Weeks before our visit, the concierge helped us arrange a car from Heathrow, several restaurant suggestions, and even suggested what train and tickets we needed for a trip to the country. The hotel is full of unique art work and sculpture making it feel hip yet unpretentious. The same restaurant that is used for breakfast doubles as the bar for late night. Good, solid food and drinks. Room service is limited, but very tasty. I would absolutely
stay again next time we are in London.",5,2013,09,04
129,LOVE this hotel!,"No need to get to the nitty gritty, this hotel is amazing. Great location, nice rooms, reasonable pricing, beautiful lobby and bar. Just stay there!
Try Muriel's kitchen next door, they have the best breakfast. Also close to Starbucks and Paul, which make the best pastries. ",5,2013,09,03
129,Great place to stay,"The first thing I want to mention about this hotel is how great the staff was.  Any request was greeted with "" our pleasure"".  Being our first time visiting London,  we had many questions and were open to suggestions on where to eat and what to see.  All of which the reception desk was glad to help us with.  The superior room was big enough for two. We did have the desk store our empty luggage for the week which freed up some space.  The heated bathroom floor was an unexpected delight. The hotel was immaculately clean. It has a very cool decor which has you finding something new and interesting to look at everyday. 

The location was very convenient to the south kensington underground. The station is not as busy as other stations which allows you to purchase daily passes very quickly without waiting on a long line. 

There are plenty of caf√©s and restaurants within walking distance. 

We ate in the restaurant Apero,  located on the lower level of the hotel. The food was very good with very interesting preparations. The food is served tapas style but the size of the dishes are large for tapas. The breakfast was also very good.",5,2013,09,03
129,Delicious afternoon tea in wonderful surroundings!,"We celebrated our daughter's 18th birthday with a group of her friends at the Ampersand Hotel. it is conveniently situated opposite South Kensington station. We opted for the classic afternoon tea with a glass of champagne, having found a good deal on the Afternoon Tea.co,uk website. Everything was perfect from start to finish. The interior decor is truly beautiful, combining beautiful shades of cornflower blue and scarlet with stunning monochrome wallpaper and wonderful hand-painted canvasses. A bird-theme predominates!  This far surpasses any other tea-rooms in London by miles. 

Now, down to the food. This was excellent. Lovely open sandwiches were a change from the usual fare, followed by fresh scones with delicious jam and clotted cream. Some wonderful little pastries finished things off very well. There is a choice of teas, or you can have coffee of hot chocolate, or juice. The champagne was just perfect and the teens and adults had a great time. No-one hurried us, or rushed us out for another sitting, unlike some more expensive establishments. Background music was playing on a CD player. 

You can also pop into this hotel for just a pot of tea if you like which starts at around ¬£2.60 a pot. Considering both the location and the surroundings, this is tremendous value. You are very close indeed to the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums.",5,2013,09,03
129,Great family hotel (if the game room is available),"Very close to South Kensington tube and musea, convenient hotel with kids (they loved the ping pong table in the gameroom but unfortunately it was only available on Sunday). Helpful staff, not so impressed by the restaurant. Overall a great stay",4,2013,09,03
129,A boutique hotel with a great location,"This hotel has a great location - just across the street from So Kensington underground station with easy access to buses to Harrods, Picadilly, and the theatre district.  The rooms are small, but  with modern amenities and a super comfortable bed.    The breakfast is quite good and is served in a pleasant and welcoming space.  I wouldn't say the staff is warm and fuzzy, but they a certainly accommodating and helpful.

I'd stay here again.",4,2013,08,29
129,"Nice stay, value for money","Stayed here last month. The hotel was lovely, friendly staff and helpful. The room we booked wasn't as big as it looked from the pictures. The location was good and we were able to check in early. Would stay again",3,2013,08,28
129,What a joy to stay at!,"I had high hopes of the Ampersand due to the reviews on Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed. On arrival we learnt that we had been upgraded to a Superior room which put both my husband and I in fantastic moods for our night away in London. The room whilst not massive was perfectly big enough for the two of us for a night with room for our cases and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was small but amazing, and provided luxurious bath products, dressing gowns with came with a rubber duck which was a wonderful surprise as was the heated floor! The bed was so comfortable; we literally sunk into it after a tiring day of sightseeing! 

The staff were a absolute delight, allowing us to leave our bags before we checked in and after we checked out to allow us to go and explore London free of baggage! Every member of staff we encountered was polite, chatty and helpful which really enhanced our time at the hotel. 

The location is perfect, 2 minutes walk from Kensington Tube Station.",5,2013,08,28
129,"Great location, great hotel, small room","We really liked the hotel, it was in a great location very close to the tube. The design is lovely and teh breakfast was good too. It was clean the staff was super helpful and lovely they even attempted some German with us. 

However the room was super small, there was just enough space to squeeze round the bed (widths of the side table) and the bathroom (shower room, again small) was starting say a good 50 cm from the end of the bed, which was also a small ""english"" double which is only 140 cm wide. We would have appreciated to be informed more about the size as we would have upgraded to a normal size room instead of a cupboard.",4,2013,08,28
129,A little Gem,"Stayed here for one night on 24th August, what a great hotel.  Perfect location, walking distance to The Kings Road, Harrods, South Kensingnton Station, Natural History and Science Museums.  Lots of lovely restaurants in the area.  Staff are very friendly and helpful, we were able to check in early, whch was really handy for us, the breakfast menu is lovely as is the breakfast room.  Our room was a small, but lovely all the same, bed was uber comfortable.  Very good value considering location.  Will defiantly stay at this hotel again.",5,2013,08,27
129,"Excellent hotel, great location","Stayed here for 1 night as a place to recuperate after a very long flight. We arrived a little early before the check in time of 2pm, the staff were very helpful and took our bags to our room whilst we went for a coffee nearby. 

The hotel is less than 50 meters from South Kensington tube station so is excellent in that respect and obviously being in South Kensington you're within walking distance, if not a short tube ride from many of London's top attractions. There's also a host of high end shopping and restaurants close by.

We had the ""Standard Double"" room at ¬£174 a night excluding breakfast. The hotel markets this on their website as ideal for single travellers or short stays but we found the room exceeded our expectations in terms of size given that it is central London and matched it in terms of comfort and decoration, although the lighting was a little on the dark side. Not much of a view but it was one of the ""cheap"" rooms. The bathroom was superb, great shower with an oversized head. Nice touch with complimentary soft drinks in the fridge and various bags containing travel items dotted around the room made it feel somewhat like a treasure trove. Clearly a lot of effort has gone in to this.

Highly recommend this place and would stay again!",5,2013,08,27
129,Very artfully designed hotel.,"There are many good things about this hotel. First of all, the design is very artful. It was clear that a lot of thought was put into the design of the hotel. And our room was very tastefully decorated. And the location is also fantastic. It is a 2-minute walk from the South Kensington tube station. And South Kensington is one of the nicest areas of London, with a lot of restaurants and cafes nearby and two major museums within walking distance. The service was also very good. They let me store a big suitcase with them for a week before I checked in and for another 5 days after I checked out. I felt like I exploited them as a storage space. If there is one complaint I can make about the room, it is the room size and view. Our room was located on the ground floor and faced the next building. So there was absolutely no view and hardly any light. The room was also rather small. Once my friend and I lay out our suitcases, there was hardly any room left in the room and we could barely move around. But all in all, this is a very good hotel and I would recommend it.",4,2013,08,27
129,Great stay,"Stayed aug 23 & 24 rm405. This is an extremely nice hotel. Friendly staff, very clean comfortable room with all amenities (bathrobes, free juice & water, etc). Afternoon tea was delicious. The location is fantastic! 100m from south Kensington tube station (Piccadilly line healthrow). Flew overnight from Canada and arrived early. Staff went out of their way to accommodate us while getting a room ready (by 10am) Even though Hotel fully booked for Bank holiday weekend.  This will be our landing spot in London on future visits! ",5,2013,08,27
129,Great choice for a family,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite and it was perfect.  The location is unbeatable, the service is excellent and the room was very stylish and modern.  The kids loved the TV in the bath! Yummy breakfast too!",5,2013,08,26
129,Great hotel,"Perfect hotel for a few nights in London. Great location, 50 m walk to the subway of South Kensington, 5 min walk to the Victoria and Albert museum, 15 min walk to Harrods. Perfect! Service in the hotel is fantastic. Good and friendly staff. Breakfast is awesome!",5,2013,08,26
129,My Favourite Hotel to date,"I did a flying visit to London for one night before heading to Ireland from Australia. I was beside myself with excitement to stay at The Ampersand after reading so many fab reviews. It did not disappoint. From the minute we arrived it felt like home. Service was second to none. The room whilst small was fine for one night stay. Amenities were amazing. We had breakfast in the dining room and it was delicious. My dad has not stopped raving about the little museli yoghurt mix in a jar. The bell boys were lovely and very helpful with directions etc. If you need somewhere for lunch I can suggest going to Dinner by Hestons which is only a few blocks away. AMAZING!!! Overall I could not fault one thing. Now my favourite hotel in London, actually anywhere!",5,2013,08,24
129,Location is everything,"This hotel was just what is needed for a perfect stay in London. The room was very clean and comfortable (we were given an upgrade because we had to wait a very short time for it to be ready when we arrived).  The bed itself was extremely comfortable. The mostly young staff were very friendly and as helpful as they could be, although some local knowledge was a little lacking. The real highlight was the location. Just metres from the South Kensington Underground station which connects to three lines.  Buses literally outside the door which travelled in to central London and out to Kensington High Street and far beyond. Walking distance from the Victoria and Albert and other museums. Many, many eating options nearby. Minutes from the buzz and excitement of the city but far enough to get away from the chaos. Will happily stay there again when next in London. ",5,2013,08,24
129,Wonderful boutique hotel in South Kensington,"Lovely interior design, brilliant service, professional staff and great location.
Hotel locates just a few minutes walk from the South Kensington station and from several museums: Victoria & Albert Museum, Natural History Museum and Science Museum for instance. There are marvelous restaurants Apero and The Drawing Rooms in this hotel. Apero requires previous booking, The Drawing Rooms welcomes you any time.
I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there next time I‚Äôll visit London.",5,2013,08,21
129,Nice but small,Loving clean hotel in a good location but room even for city standards was small. Staff nice and helpful but could not find two items for me one being skimmed milk two being an iron I was allowed to keep in my room but overall a nice place to stay thanks,3,2013,08,21
129,A haven in London,I stayed at The Ampersand in April - & it was an absolute delight. The rooms are beautifully appointed with great amenities & the staff are very welcoming & knowledgeable. The location is great - & breakfast is fab. I can thoroughly recommend it.,5,2013,08,20
129,Great hotel,"Friendly staff. Beautiful room and very spacious. The most comfortable bed we have ever slept in and hotel in great location. Just around the corner from great shopping, close to the underground and lovely cafes across the road.
Arrived early and room was made available within 15 minutes.
Would stay here again.",5,2013,08,19
129,Pretty much faultless,"I've just spent 3 nights in a Deluxe room here and I have to day that it was fantastic.  The staff were friendly and helpful and every request we had was met promptly (including an ice bucket and glasses for the champagnes we'd brought with us).

The room was clean and, for London, fairly spacious with a lovely modern design which has some lovely little touches.  The hotel itself is in a great location, literally 30 seconds walk from South Kensington tube station.

My only complaint is that the bacon sandwich I ordered as breakfast one morning wasn't quite to my taste.  Other than that it was perfect.  Would most definitely stay again.",5,2013,08,19
129,Perfect boutique hotel,"I stayed here for 3 nights in July with my husband and stayed in a deluxe room. It was perfect.

The room and hotel were both stunning and the beds were so comfortable. The service from all the staff was impeccable and the reception staff were very friendly and welcomjng. The hotel was classy but not at all stuffy. 

We had breakfast at the apero each morning which was delicious and good value. We also had an evening meal there which was superb, especially the beetroot risotto and the red mullet.

The location is fantastic especially for the museums.

We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others and will stay again when back in london",5,2013,08,17
129,"It's got everything - service, location, luxury!","Flying into London early one freezing June morning, I arrived at The Ampersand Hotel at around 6.30am.  The night staff were still on duty and quickly arranged a cup of tea in the lounge and shortly after a room in which I could shower and change.  Over my 3 night stay, the staff consistently offered outstanding service.  Arriving back from a day of sightseeing my Deluxe ground floor, front room was available.  The room was beautifully appointed and spacious.  The bathroom was large and wheelchair accessible (not necessary for me).  Unfortunately this room felt like it was directly over the subway (the hotel is conveniently close to the South Kensington tube station).  Heading back to reception, I asked if it was possible to change rooms.  Again, the staff were delightful.  They didn't have a room available in the Deluxe category but were very happy to show me a smaller room on a higher level and then move me to a larger room for the remaining two nights.  I accepted!  This room was much smaller and towards the back of the hotel but certainly adequate for 1 person (although my suitcase had to sit in front of the entrance door).  I wouldn't recommend this size room for 2 people unless they travel extremely lightly!  My (Deluxe) room for the remaining two nights was at the front of the hotel on a higher floor and was extremely comfortable - it looked exactly like the photos from their website.
The only meal I ate at the hotel was breakfast, choosing the buffet option, which had a great range of cereals, pastries, fruit and dairy.
I used the gym on only one day and to be honest, this was the only disappointing aspect of the hotel's facilities. It was in the basement, with no natural light and not enough ventilation (it smelt damp & mouldy).   As stated on the hotel's website, there a 3 pieces of cardio equipment and a free weights area.  The latter was tiny and really only enough room for one person to workout (there were 3 of us in the gym at one stage).
The location in South Kensington is so convenient with the tube a two minute walk away and so many of London's attractions at or close to your doorstep. 
My experience at The Ampersand was wonderful.  Highly recommended!!!",5,2013,08,15
129,Brilliant!,"My partner and I stayed here for one night on a trip to London for my birthday, and I may be slightly biased in my review as my boyfriend proposed to me on the balcony of our room :)

Quite apart from the proposal, we found the service to be wonderful and the room gorgeous - huge bed, two televisions, a well-appointed bathroom with fantastic toiletries and of course the balcony with a beautiful jasmine bush in bloom was amazing. And it's only a few minutes walk away from South Kensington tube station and several restaurants and cafes for food. 

Next time we're in London we'll definitely stay here!",5,2013,08,15
129,Charming boutique h√¥tel,"The Ampersand is a charming boutique hotel in South Kensington most conveniently located just steps away from the South Ken Tube station. We stayed in a Deluxe Studio which is spacious, having its own sitting area and a king size bed. The decor is modern baroque in strong primary colours. The bathroom was particularly huge, which is unusual for London. Loved the cute baby blue rubber duckie that you could take home. The hotel is located in an area filled with restaurants (the hotel has its own restaurant in the basement but we didn't eat our meals there other than for one breakfast) and is minutes away from The Natural History Museum and the V&A. Hyde Park is a 10-minute walk away and there are quite a few Barclays bike stations near the hotel if you feel like renting a bike (which we did). Would strongly recommend staying here.",5,2013,08,14
129,Perfect one night stay in London!,"My husband and I stayed here for one night in November last year, it first caught my eye as it had been recently refurbished and was in a nice area of London close to the tube. It did not disappoint, it was a lovely modern hotel, the decor was gorgeous and not overdone. The basement was home to the restaurant and I would highly recommend, our food was delicious. The bedrooms although ours was a bit small was very comfortable and had everything you needed. I would also recommend a little cafe opposite the hotel across from the tube Muriels kitchen which was also delicious for lunch or a coffee, if I was to visit London again I would definitely stay here, no question!
",5,2013,08,13
129,PERFECT hotel in a perfect location,"The hotel, from the first greeting to the last check out goodbye, is a winner.  Staff are friendly and helpful, the restaurant fare, including high teas, are worthwhile.  The rooms are classical yet modern, with the bird and music theme keeping an air of lighthearted comfort.  Easy access to the museums, South Kensington station, and Royal Albert Hall, all made this hotel doubly perfect.  The neighborhood is fine, with shops, bus stops and restaurants.  We are pleased that we chose the Ampersand Hotel.  When compared to other equally convenient accommodation locations, the value for this hotel is excellent.",5,2013,08,13
129,superb,"this hotel location really good.rooms very big and comfortable.everthing very close,the staff friendly and helpful,you can use the public tranport with in 2 minute.amazing breakfast and food also very delicious.we highly recommended to others,",5,2013,08,13
129,Really great stay,"Loved ths hotel, modern, individual, not remotely corporate, great service, super room with everythng we could want and staff so helpful.
We spent our anniversary weekend here and were really pleased we chose the Ampersand.",5,2013,08,11
129,Boutique perfection!,"This is such a gorgeous hotel in a great spot in south Kensington. We checked in at 5.30am after flying in from Australia and they had our room ready which they had upgraded to a suite. Check in night staff were delightful and so helpful. Massive room with bath in the window and probably the most comfortable bed of any hotel ever. Huge plush bed head and carpet, heated tiles in the bathroom, free wifi, nesspresso and cup of tea on arrival ;) the bathrooms were stunning with beautiful toiletries and loads of towels even a blue ampersand rubber ducky! The decor in this hotel is worth it just for a look. Very clean and well presented with loads of quirky art work, lighting, wallpaper and furnishings. A must stay for London and certainly one of my favorite boutique hotels. ",5,2013,08,11
129,Great location and atmosphere,"The Ampersand was definitely swanky and did not disappoint!
* Perfect location just around the corner from the South Kensington tube stop. 
* The room was London-sized (so smallish) but very comfortable. 

A minibar with free water, juice, and soda was hidden in a nightstand and the desk had an assortment of power and video plugs. The tiled bathroom featured some great-smelling soaps that were taken home, and a fun rubber ducky! Their restaurant looked nice when I stopped in for a whiskey though I did not try any food.",5,2013,08,09
129,I cant wait to go back.,"This is a wonderful hotel, with top notch customer service.  The hotel is modern while keeping a nice charming atmosphere.  The standard room was very comfortable and had a fabulous bed.  I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.  The room was equipped with all the amenities that I needed along with complimentary drinks in the minbar.  If/when I return to London, I will definitely be staying here again.",5,2013,08,08
129,Superb location,"Hotel booked thanks to great reviews on Tripadvisor and the hotel certainly did not disappoint.  Room, although on the smaller side (only a double) was beautifully furnished, clean and plush.  The communal areas were also impeccably furnished.  The bar in the lower ground floor area was also a delight, the staff were great and service second to none.  Unfortunately we did not get to eat here, but other guests were and the food looked delicious.  Slight gripe was that there was no bath in the room, just a large shower and getting the temperature right was quite an art.  

Also, if I'm being picky the lifts were a little slow and sometimes just one was in operation.  

All this can be overlooked when the general standard of the hotel is so high and the location!  It is pretty much the best hotel location in London!  You can easily access all that London has to offer but without the hustle and bustle.  I used to work in South Kensington many moons ago and the area is amazing now for eating out and drinking.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone, it really is that good!",5,2013,08,08
129,"If it wasn't for the small rooms and awkward heating system, I would have given it an EXCELLENT review","I stayed twice at this hotel. 2 Weeks in November 2012 and a week almost in February 2013. The hotel is new the decor is impeccable and most impressive were the staff and service all levels. All were GENUINELY friendly and very smart compared to most hotels. Certainly none of the staff came across as dull in any way. By that alone I enjoyed my stay. Another impressive feature, when I stayed the first time in the Delux Room (don't remember if that applied when I stayed in the Standard Room), all the mini bar beverages, except alcohol were free!! Amazing. The restaurant in the lower level was one of the best price to quality restau's Ive been to. No wonder it was always full, but guests were always prioritised. 5 Star meals for 2-3 star prices. The lobby cafe every day has a selection of great pastries prepared by their own pastry chef. 

On the downside, the standard room is very small. I thought could have been a little bit bigger. And the heating system is strange. I believe the room is heated through the floors and walls and to control the heat you need to switch on the AC. Besides these two issues which I didn't find really a big deal given the service and amenities and location I would highly recommend this hotel. 

Finally location, being in South Kensington just 20-30 meters from the Tube station and the abundance of good quality cosy restaurants and cafes in the area made my stay an even more pleasurable experience.",4,2013,08,08
129,&:-)&:-)&:-)&:-)&:-)&:-)&:-),"Wonderfully hospitable staff who couldn't be more helpful. We travelled with our little baby and enjoyed an impromptu family meal in The Library. Attentive waiter and yummy food. 

Unfortunately the fuse went in our air con during the night (hottest day of the year 2nd Aug, but this was reflected when settling the bill. We would love to return in the future. ",5,2013,08,07
129,A slice of heaven in busy Kensington,"Stayed here for a weekend in town to celebrate a big birthday. Location was a surprise until the day before. Despite not having heard of the hotel (I do a lot of work with London Hotels), I was bowled over by it's quirky style, beautiful finish and great staff. It felt like a chilled retreat amongst the hustle and bustle of South Ken. Would certainly go back, and recommend.",5,2013,08,07
129,A lovely stay!,I took my husband to London on a surprise weekend for his birthday and booked this hotel.  Was not disappointed.  The hotel is really lovely with a lot of quirky charm.  We booked a standard room which was smal (as the hotel indicates on their website) but the room really makes the space of the room available.    The room itself was very comfortable with great amenities (complimentary soft drinks in the minibar/lovely toiletries).  The bar downstairs makes lovely and unusual cocktails which we enjoyed.  The staff were all lovely and friendly an the check in-check out process was hassle free.  If I were coming back to London again I would definitely stay here.  The location is fantastic - only a very short walk from South Kensington Station so it is an ideal base for a tourist.,5,2013,08,06
129,"Lovely hotel, great service and perfect location","My husband and I stayed for one night and were very pleased with the Ampersand. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was lovely - clean and very stylish. The only downside is that it was very noisy on the street in the middle of the night - next time I would ask for a room at the back of the hotel. Overall, very impressed. ",5,2013,08,06
129,Buzzing boutique,"A wonderful hotel in a fantastic location, within view of the south Kensington tube station. The decor and ambience in the hotel is cool, quirky and laid back and staff were very helpful. Everything was perfectly clean and of a high standard, from the orange juice for breakfast to the cocktails in the bar. There's a good restaurant, games room and library and even the lobby toilets were very nice! I stayed in a standard double and it was compact but comfortable. A fantastic bathroom and complimentary soft drinks went down very well.  The only one thing I was unsure about was the mirror being on a door where you can't actually look into! Otherwise perfect and good value for money considering the position! ",5,2013,08,05
129,Loved it,"Had the most fabulous weekend here.  Everything was perfect, the welcome, the service, the room, the food.  Absolutely loved it.  We had a superior room which was very comfortable and quiet, the bathroom was very spacious with lovely toiletries included.  We had complimentary champagne as part of our deal which was delivered to our room within 3 minutes of our call to reception.  The staff are all very friendly and very helpful.  We didn't have an evening meal but we did have breakfast which was delicious and very reasonably priced.  The location is perfect, a stones throw from the tube station and within walking distance to many attractions.  We left at the end of our weekend feeling totally relaxed and thoroughly spoiled.  If you're looking for a hotel in London you should seriously look this place up!",5,2013,08,05
129,Impeccable service& fantastic location,"What a lovely hotel- every aspect is well thought out from the appointments of the rooms, to the well placed &'s!! The staff greeted us each morning, encouraged us on our morning runs in Hyde Park and handled our left luggage for us. The room was comfy with a great bed, free water, juice and sodas in the mini bar and French press coffee with real milk. We will go back!!",5,2013,08,05
129,Fantastic!!!,"I took my Fianc√© to London as a surprise for his birthday and could not have asked for a better stay. The staff were lovely and friendly; and on telling them that it was my partners birthday, we were provided with 2 glasses of complimentary champagne, which obviously we couldn't say no too. The staff were brilliant in advising us with somewhere to eat, and also booked the table for us. I had read on trip advisor that the rooms were very small, which was something that I was concerned about; however, I need not to have worried as we found the room was a good size and that we had plenty of room without tripping over each other. Nothing was too much trouble and I would definitely stop here again; would recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2013,08,05
129,Just perfect,"I come to London very often and have to admit this stay was the best experience in the city: good location, modern and well designed room, great breakfast, well equipped fitness room (though quiet small), friendly staff...nothing to add really. would definitely come back!",5,2013,08,04
129,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"I stayed at the Ampersand for 4 nights and it was a wonderful experience. Room sizes vary but i was lucky to get a very nice sized room that i call the Music Room (see pix). Room service no matter what time or day usually took at most 15 mins. They were always very quick with the food. The entire room was electronically controlled in that i jokingly called it a ""Smart Room"". There is a touchscreen console outside your door where you hold up your key/badge to access your room, ring the doorbell, or where you can see cleaning services are requested or Do Not Disturb (pix below). Inside the room is a similar touch screen console that lets you select if you are in DND Mode or want cleaning services for your room. The bathroom floor is heated, and there is a switch that allows you to control the volume of the TV in your room. The mini bar is stocked with bottled water both still and sparkling and other non-alcoholic beverages and is restocked everyday and is 100% COMPLIMENTARY!!! The Tea room is beautiful and full of delicious baked snacks that you can have sent to your room, the gym is small but adequate for a quick workout complete with all machines and free weights, and Apero was wonderful. The bar tenders were so kind and funny to talk to and even let me take the Apero dinner menu and breakfast menu to my room to order from so I wasn't restricted to the Room Service menu (as long as I order before Restaurant closes at 1030pm). Everyone made my stay extremely enjoyable and they even provide eye makeup remover wipes (for girls), the shower cap comes with a hair tie, and many other things. The level of detail to a guest's needs is impeccable. Highly recommend. And the best part? It's literally across the street from the Picadilly, DIstrict and Circle Tube Lines at the South Kensington stop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",5,2013,08,03
129,Whimsical  boutique hotel,"What a delightful  Lux boutique hotel. What  more could I say about a room that includes (how refreshing) a Nespresso espresso machine fully stocked?  A fridge with free beverages?   And chef prepared culinary wonders -  still warm and fragrant, fresh baked treats- offered at check in?   Attentive, polite staff?  Classic, perfect British Afternoon tea in a whimsical, yet upscale setting near the lobby?   Superb location? Can't wait to return.",5,2013,08,01
129,almost 5 star,"The hotel looks great. A lovely blend of historic detail and whimsy with contemporary amenities and style. The front desk staff were very friendly. Had there been no service issues or small problems this would probably be a perfect review. However there were a couple of problems that eventually got resolved to our satisfaction but it was bumpy. 

The positives: A+ location, very quiet at night, great looking space, delicious breakfast.

The negatives: After a quiet night's sleep in a comfortable we were shocked awake by, drilling, sawing, hammering and all sorts of construction that sounded like it was right beside us or under us. We called the front desk, they claimed no knowledge at all of any construction. The noise continued and then they said ""yes, there are some renovations being done to a few rooms, sorry. You can have breakfast on us"". 

Arrived in the restaurant at 10:31 and the server told us the kitchen was closed. We were welcome to see what was left at the buffet. I asked what time the kitchen closed because we were brought to the restaurant by a member of the front desk staff who had offered breakfast. The response was ""kitchen is closed now, it closes at 10:30"" 

Wow. so we proceeded to leave when another server said ""wait, I just asked the chef and he said fine"" so we come back. The other server says ""NO! the kitchen is closed"" rudely. I look at my husband and say "" I feel uncomfortable, let's go, I know they offered us breakfast but I'm ready to go elsewhere"" Then a manager appears. Very apologetic. She says ""of course stay, please it is fine, our chef can wait, we just closed service two minutes ago"" She brings us back to the table we sit and that server rolls her eyes at me and starts laughing. All the other staff apologized but i felt really awkward.

Morning number Two. We wake to hammering. Again!! Another call to the front desk who again claim no knowledge of any construction. Again a weak apology that yes there is work being done. 
Why put us in a room adjacent to renovations? no response.

We leave for our day out and come back at tea-time. Finally a manager sits down with us and makes it right. We just felt that despite the friendliness of the staff they lacked a level of service. It felt like the place was being run by a bunch of friendly students. 

The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were quiet. As parents of three young children on  a short break away we really wanted that sleep in! Unfortunately that did not happen.

With some proper customer service training to all the staff, especially in the restaurant this hotel could be 5 stars.",4,2013,08,01
129,Beautiful and Friendly,"This is a lovely hotel with such friendly staff! The room was comfortable, modern, and you could hardly hear the street noise! It's ideally located almost across the street from the tube station! The restaurant near the lobby serves an excellent afternoon tea. I highly recommend staying here and will stay again when we return!",5,2013,08,01
129,"Great Boutique Hotel, Great Location.","Stayed at this fantastic hotel for 3 nights in March. It's perfectly located in South Kensington just across the street from the tube station so within easy access to all of London's attractions and a short walk to some great museums. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in close proximity including Muriel's Kitchen which I recommend for breakfast/brunch and Pierino a nice little Italian restaurant. The decor of the hotel is very modern which you would expect to find in a boutique hotel and is finished to a very high standard. The room was spacious for a London hotel and again finished to a high quality. Free soft drinks are available from the mini bar which is a nice touch. Would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel, we had a perfect stay in a perfect hotel in a perfect location.",5,2013,07,31
129,Beautiful boutique hotel conveniently located to everything London.,"Beautiful boutique hotel situated in South Kensington right across from the super easy to use London tube. This hotel has been superbly renovated and finished to a very high standard. The bed was very comfortable and we slept so soundly except the sun rises around 4.30am and I thought we had slept in! Lovely upholstered bedhead in a deep purple, feather cushions and a black and white bathroom added up to a luxurious package. Fridge is stocked with non-alcoholic beverages that you are free to consume without charge. Good free wifi is available. We did not have breakfast at the hotel preferring the better priced option at the amazing Pret coffee shop across the road (also with free wifi). The London tube is very easy for a novice to use and it's best to purchase an Oyster card that you can reload anytime. Tube trains are colour coded with their handrails and are very efficient. If only every city had this train system we wouldn't need cars! A tube station is situated just across from the hotel and we felt very safe using it even late at night. Hotel staff are very knowledgeable and are very helpful. Each bathroom comes with a rubber ducky you can take as a souvenir. This hotel offers luxury and the comforts of home and is so well located. The hotel considers the small differences that make it an excellent place to lay your head at night. My only negative is that a good sized mirror near a power point should be standard to accommodate female guests who need to use a hairdryer or straightener.  There is a small one but it needs to be bigger and hung on the wall. Overall, an excellent high quality boutique hotel - would definitely stay again.",5,2013,07,30
129,Darn near perfect,"For London, this hotel is darn near perfect. Someone below commented that this place was 'almost perfect.' Well, I'll take a step further toward perfect and say it's darn near. All the things you probably care about are way above average here. Location? Check plus. Staff? Check plus. Room cleanliness? Check plus. Room size? Check plus. Bathroom? Check plus. On-site restaurant? Check Plus Plus. In fact, the food was quite remarkable for London. Very thoughtful, somewhat healthy and organic, with a creative flair and great atmosphere somehow even though it's 1/2 floor below ground! The staff at the restaurant could have been a bit more friendly perhaps, if I were to quibble a bit, though the manager was great. It's not cheap, but you do get what you pay for and I really appreciated being able to get a very good meal in a casual, fun, rustic - homey (French country?) atmosphere. In fact, the restaurant would likely be the prod or hook to get me to stay here again. Even when I find a great hotel in London, I somehow prefer to try another on my next visit. I might break this pattern and stay here again. The location is so close to a very good tube stop, the Albert and Victoria museum, Science Museum and Natural History Museum. As the Brits say, our time here was good fun.",4,2013,07,30
129,Fabulous,"We stayed here for 6 nights in a deluxe room and found it to be Perfectly located. Across the road from Sth Kensington tube station, bus stop in front and taxi rank right outside. Many cafes and restaurants close by. Our room was adequately spacious but was on the 2nd floor facing Harrington street which did create a fair bit of noise especially given our room was right above the bus stop. So ask for a higher room and perhaps to the side or rear of the building if noise bothers you at night. Otherwise we can't fault our stay here. All staff were very friendly, warm, welcoming and always helpful. The decor is beautiful.",5,2013,07,29
129,Very nice great front desk staff,"Stayed July 2nd to 5th. This is an upscale hotel in a great location. Rooms are very nice and clean. 
Staff was terrific helpful and friendly. If your room faces the street and you are a light sleeper, can be to noisy at night.",4,2013,07,28
129,More Civilisation in South Ken,"We very much liked the Ampersand - not cheap but exceptionally civilised!  Excellent towels and toiletries in the bathroom, free water and softdrinks in the minibar, tea and coffee facilities in the room, (with quality teabags) interesting quirky decor and on the bedside table, an excellent book about birds (a decoration motif throughout the hotel) - my bird-watcher spouse loved it!  Location couldn't be better for the Tube, shops, restaurants and the V&A - a major target for us.

Small, but carefully designed rooms - fine, once we figured out how to use the cupboards to empty our luggage - a large comfortable bed and good chairs.  Some noise from the tube trains.  And an electronic 'do not disturb' system!     Very pleasant breakfast area with a good buffet.  

We'll be back!",5,2013,07,28
129,"Gorgeous afternoon tea with champagne cocktail,wonderful!","I was given a travel zoo voucher for my recent 50th birthday to experience afternoon tea at the ampersand hotel in south kensington,  We were not disappointed . What a treat, and what a find.
The plates given were, two plates savory, to one sweet, which was a good balance.  Small bites sized pieces of food was more than enough. The food choice was different to the normal sandwiches.  Savory filled profiteroles, along with wafer thin crisp breads covered with parma ham, very different. loved it, and will go again.",4,2013,07,22
129,a wonderful place,"Found this place on Tripadvisor, and the reviews were spot on. I wont repeat a lot of what's been written. But I will note a few key things.
  The location is superb. Thirty steps to the South Kensington tube station is ideal. The stop is right on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow, so it's a straight shot in and out from the airport. A short walk from Hyde park, there is a nice variety of shops, restaurants, conveniences, and culture just a short walk from the hotel.
   We stayed in a superior level room, and there are a couple things to note. The rooms are European small. There was not a formal place to stow suitcases, we shoved them under the little writing desk at the foot of the bed. There is very little storage/drawer space for clothes. I ended up stacking most of my stuff in the little wardrobe by the door. Once you have things put away though, the room is definitely comfortable, clean, with a superb bed and linens. The down filled pillows and duvet were wonderful. The bathroom was comfortable stocked with top notch toiletries and towels. Even the floor was heated. 
   The staff were great, and everyone was friendly and helpful. We didn't eat in the hotel, but the breakfast and tea service sure looked excellent. 
   Unless you need screaming nightlife right outside your door, this is a wonderful place from which to explore, and enjoy a visit to a truly world class city.",4,2013,07,21
129,A good hotel... but not perfect!,"First impression was just ok; a small check-in desk and a lounge full of uncleared tables. But staff were friendly and polite. No car park but valet parking offered, we used a temporary car park 100m away. We stayed in room 009, very high quality and comfortable but a shame it was so small! We paid ¬£216 for the night. Check-out was impossible, too many customers and that tiny desk manned by only 2 people! Overall a good hotel but not perfect. ",4,2013,07,21
129,Excellent hotel which we can highly recommend,"Brilliant hotel close to the big museums,the Albert Hall, Harrods and many many excellent restaurants.

Very close to South Kensington tube station and loads of taxis if you need them.

We will be returning to this hotel lots of times in the future.

Highly recommended.",5,2013,07,21
129,First Class London hotel,"I was after a special hotel for my husband and I to stay in for our first wedding anniversary and we definitely found it here!  A brilliant hotel in a excellent location - tube stop minutes away from the hotel entrance.  Loved all the little touches in the room (Deluxe Double) such as the free soft drinks, which were soon replenished when we asked at Reception.  Bathroom was a great size and even had a flat screen TV in it!  Bed was huge and super comfy.  Staff were all very friendly and we're able to give good suggestions for places to visit in the local area.  Overall a hotel I would quite happily recommend to friends and family and hopefully one day we'll get to stay again.",5,2013,07,21
129,Loved my stay!,"I loved my stay at the Ampersand. The area was perfect - steps away from South Kensington tube from which it is so easy to access most parts of London, lovely restaurants, museums and shopping nearby. It was such a treat to be able to walk to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. I tried the continental buffet at the hotel which was excellent and pretty good value, but there are also good options close by if you are looking for a change. The hotel is wonderful with a relaxed rather than stuffy luxury feel. My arrival was very disappointing - there was no-one at the door to help with my luggage, my room wasn't ready until after 4pm and the allocated room was very noisy despite my having asked for a very quiet room. It seems they were having a bad day because the next day I was re-allocated to a very quiet room and found everyone to be friendly and helpful from then on.",5,2013,07,20
129,Peculiar layout of suite,"We stayed here for one night recently and although all the staff were very friendly, I found the suite disappointing.  It was not well laid out at all, and although spacious, we found ourselves trying to crowd down a corridor between bedroom and lounge on several occasions.  The room lacked warmth and soul and there was just something lacking in it altogether.  I also found the breakfast a bit disappointing as tables still had crumbs on and there was nobody to greet us when we entered so we were not sure where to go.  However, the lounge was great, with its tea and cakes!",3,2013,07,18
129,Lone Aussie Senior,"I was staying a couple of nights in London on my own and wanted a touch of luxury and security. The hotel was this and more. Room was single, boutique but had all that was needed. My request for shower room was granted, all the staff were more than helpful with advice on transport, booked tickets for me which was a great time saver, helped with my luggage problems, and were always welcoming. The position of the hotel is across the road from the tube. Bus stop, including hop on hop off bus at front door. This is a very high class hotel, very comfy bed, all looks as it does on the website ( not always the case). Breakfast reasonable, Lounge areas comfortable and welcoming. Would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2013,07,17
129,Great choice in London,"The Ampersand is my new choice for a place to stay in London.  Terrific location just yards away from the South Kensington tube station and close to Hyde Park, stylish rooms, friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast - we couldn't have been happier.  Complimentary soft drinks and wifi were welcome.",5,2013,07,17
129,A Gem in a big city,"We stayed at The Ampersand 4 nights. The staff were excellent, the airline lost my suitcase, the staff organised to courier it on to me after I had checked out, they followed it up with a phone call letting me know all the details.  The hotel is quiet and in a great location right near the tube and some great restaurants and cafe's. I thought the complimentary soft drinks in the minibar a great idea and well utilised after a warm day out in London. The rooms are small as in most big cities but the bed is very very comfortable.",5,2013,07,17
129,FAB HOTEL,"Excellent hotel, Staff were very accommodating nothing was any trouble.  Beautiful rooms, superb location.  Tube has 3 lines going from it and is a couple of minutes walk away.  This is in every way a posh hotel without you feeling you need to be posh.  The staff are so friendly and make you feel very comfortable.",5,2013,07,16
129,"Yep, this works. They remember small details that other hotels ignore.","This was a refreshing change from some of the poky horrors that you can expect to find despite paying substantial amounts for central London accommodation. Based in South Kensington, and not far from Old Brompton Road, you can walk to Harrods or travel a couple of stops on the tube. The area has great connections for the museums and masses of restaurants etc. Previously (or maybe still) known as the French Quarter, expect to find good bread and pastries here. 

We travelled to London with business meetings and shopping on the agenda and were returning to an area that we had once lived in. This hotel has been given a facelift with unusual, light and clever design incorporated into both the reception area and the rooms. 
The receptionist was young, helpful, polite and friendly and we were welcome to check in early. A true professional, she avoided that infuriating nonsense you sometimes encounter in certain hotels where the receptionist wastes time flirting with the males in the group while being condescending towards the female guests.

So to the rooms. These are not huge (this is after all, a town house) but they are quite fine. With clever use of colour, design and fabric, The Ampersand makes the most of the space available by cleverly drawing the eye towards the high ceilings. Flat screens, good fast internet connections and plenty of sockets scored high points The bed was really comfortable, towels super fluffy and the toiletries provided were elegant (the type of stuff you would happily have in your own bathroom). Again, somebody had been thinking carefully in that they provided both hair scrunchies and loofah gloves so you could turn your shower (with a huge shower head and decent water pressure) experience into a mini-spa. 
The complimentary teas & coffee provided were organic and Fair Trade was not forgotten. Soft drinks were good quality.

What sets this hotel apart was how accommodating the staff were. Suddenly finding themselves without an office in which to hold an important strategic pre-meeting, our assembled group were invited to use an area where we were left in peace for hours and without extra charge. We then needed lunch having travelled from 3 different countries with varying levels of jet lag and no energy to wander around London. No restaurant had been booked and again the hotel came up trumps, quietly suggesting their lunch. Again that understatement, and again - at approximately ¬£20 per head - far exceeding expectations. 
We had five courses; Soup, served correctly in a tureen brought to and left on the table so that we could ladle as much as we wanted onto our plates. Beetroot risotto was delicious, no watery vegetarian slop either but perfect, tasty risotto with the right consistency. Generous meat course after this. Then a pudding. Then a selection of cheese(s). And finally coffee and chocolates. Excellent value and quality making us recommend this restaurant whether or not you are resident. There is somehow, a good feeling about the Ampersand. 

Just one tiny security minus, but an important one. We found the distance between the room door and the bedside table nearest the door was too short even with the door chain applied. A stealthy forearm inserted through that space can easily reach items left on table while you sleep. The hotel needs to change the position of the door chain raising it to well above the level of a bedside table.
Otherwise, great place!
Wandering Celts.",4,2013,07,16
129,Nice place,"Good Hotel. Room are not very big, the bath was small, and they were a very very small closet. So it was good just for a few days. Nice view on the street and Lycee Francais. Room #118. People at the desk were nice and helpfull. The breakfast is great and not expensive.",4,2013,07,16
129,Great hotel in South Kensington,"We stayed five nights here and found the location very convenient with South Kensington Metro so close. We had a deluxe room which was at the back of the hotel and rather compact. However, the bed was  one of the most comfortable  we have slept in - and the request for sheets and blanket rather than a duvet was noted and the bed properly made on our arrival. Amenities were top quality and the complimentary soft drinks and tea and coffee (french press) were a welcome touch.
Apero, the restaurant downstairs, was a great surprise. Food and service are excellent and value good for London. 
There is a little gym - nice to see as gyms are not common in London.
Service was pretty good - and the staff pleasant. Some technical problems with the room key cards on the first day but that was resolved pretty quickly. 
We also found a self-service laundromat about 200m west along Harrington Road that was welcome after 3 weeks travel.
I would recommend the hotel - it is charming and a nice staff and good restaurant downstairs.",4,2013,07,15
129,Heaven in South Kensington,"Absolutely amazing. Myself and a friend went with our mothers for 1 night and the Ampersand is possibly the best hotel experience I've ever had. It was exactly my cup of tea - contemporary but elegant, classy but not stuffy. We met the chef - a very talented and super friendly guy - Chris Golding - who made us the most fantastic lunch (even though the restaurant was closed!) The cakes and cocktails in the Drawing Rooms are amazing. The staff are professional yet very friendly - nothing is too much trouble. My only slight criticism is that the Superior rooms are a tad on the small side (I was expecting something a little bigger) but the beds we extremely comfortable and the bedding was felt luxurious. Bathroom was absolutely spotless with lovely Miller Harris toiletries. Plus I loved staying in Kensington - brilliant shopping without the horrendous crowds of Oxford Street! I very rarely stay in the same hotel twice as I always think there is so much of the world to see..but I'll definitely be tempted back here.",5,2013,07,14
129,Worth the stay!,"Stayed as a couple for 3 nights. What a lovely hotel with excellent everything. The staff are friendly and courteous, the hotel is tastefully decorated and the restaurant great. We purchased Oyster Travel Cards and found that the South Kensington station very conveniently connects  to all the lines and major attractions. You can also take the train directly to Heathrow, a 45 minute journey.",5,2013,07,11
129,Simply perfect,"We were attracted to The Ampersand through the brilliant Mr & Mrs Smith travel website, and were pleased to find the hotel exactly as it was described. This is a true gem, ideally located in beautiful South Kensington, close to musea, parks, shops and pubs, beautifully decorated and supremely comfortable. Best of all is the ever friendly staff who really make you feel like home, and do all their best to treat you like old friends. Contrary to other 5 star hotels, prices for food and drinks are very acceptable, and there's even a free minibar. We stayed for 3 nights and were very sorry to leave. This is definitely a place where we will come back!",5,2013,07,11
129,Great Location and Hotel,"We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and it met our expectaions, a great place to stay.

the location is excellent immediately in front of Sth Kensington tube station, so if arriving in London at Heathrow a direct train ride in. The building is very well renovated and the quality of the furnishings and service is very high. The staff were warm and friendly and I would certainly stay again.

One point to note as commented on by others is that between about 5am to midnight you can hear or rather feel the passing underground trains. Its not a big issue, but may be an issue for light sleepers. We were on the fourth floor and it wasn't a problem.",5,2013,07,11
129,Great hotel in perfect central location,"A refreshing change from the 'cookie cutter' hotels that dominate much of this area of London.  The public areas are bright and interestingly decorated, taking inspiration from the various nearby museums. The room was a little compact but in central London and I guess that's the norm. My only other slightly negative observation was the discernible rumble of the underground trains passing beneath the building at regular intervals and the noise from adjoining rooms, thin walls.  Overall though a great hotel in a good location",4,2013,07,11
129,You can never go wrong by staying here! Fabulously wonderful hotel - couldn't get better!!,"This was one of the highlights and perfect ending to my summer vacation! Like my title says - u really can't go wrong by staying here. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, its worth every penny. I loved this hotel, its got everything u might want - the English atmosphere you'd want to feel in London yet with a chic retro-ish twist, terrific friendly service, perfect location. The upside of it being a boutique hotel is its got its own uniqueness which u won't find staying anywhere else in London - and also its got the luxury as one would expect (but don't always see) staying in a 5 star hotel. I loved it...loved loved loved it. Can't say enough great things about this place...if ur trying to find a hotel to stay at THIS IS IT!! 
Upon arrival the lady at the reception greeted us warmly & explained whats around and things like that, then gave us our key. Daniel - who's also so sweet & helpful, showed us to our room & explained a few things. He also gave us tips on where to watch the final champions league game. The room we stayed at was the Deluxe Room - it was fabulous. When I saw it I was overjoyed. Its a really beautiful spacious room, so warm & cozy, it has the most comfortable bed ever, its actually hard to leave in the morning. There are tea/coffee making facilities available, with home-made type delicious daily cookies. Their mini-bar is complimentary (water, sparkling water, juices, milk, coke/diet coke), and whenever something runs out u can just ask for more (which u won't actually need). I love those added things, they really make u want to come back to a certain place. The bathroom is also great, very spacious and has everything u need. The robes are so fluffy & even their slippers are too comfy. I was a little worried when I looked out the window & saw the view to be right next to a primary school, but trust me u can't hear a thing. It's not the least bit annoying, u can't even tell unless u look outside & for me it was actually a happy thought watching the kids outside. Rooms get cleaned twice a day. The free hotel Wifi is really good. The people at the reception are wonderful, so friendly and they do their best to help u out. Everyone's just super, always greeting u with a wonderful smile. Because it was mine & my husband's 3rd wedding anniversary they sent us a complimentary small box with the yummiest biscuits - so scrumptious. It was such a sweet gesture of them, I was even more ecstatic then & just felt like I'd already got my money's worth - these small details really do matter. I would recommend booking directly through the hotel, use the 3 for 2 nights offer. Its really really good & u save a lot if u want to stay here, we stayed for 7 nights (had to pay a lot more for the 1 extra) - but like I said its worth it. We didn't get breakfast included in our rate, i'm sure theirs is tasty but if u like trying out different places then this is the perfect location, there are so many delicious places around u can go to for breakfast or anytime actually. 
The tube is literally just down the road, like less than 2 mins walk u just have to cross the side road. Around the tube there are loads of quick eats, really good breakfast places, many restaurants. There's a really delicious bakery/cake shop. There's also the usual Starbucks & Pret A Manger across the street from the tube station. 
One of the hotel staff members - I can't remember what his name was, maybe Thomas, was so helpful in trying to get us last minute tickets to the lion king musical. All in all it was a perfect stay - I will definitely be back...hopefully soon (can't wait to come back)! I'm already recommending it to friends who might be going soon.",5,2013,07,10
129,Fantastic boutique hotel in London,"From the perspective of this frequent business traveler, this was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a very long time. The location was perfect. The rooms were small but comfortable (with a complimentary minibar - who gives you a complimentary minibar???). The staff were to a person pleasant, helpful, friendly and engaging (and seemed genuinely interested in every traveler and their trip).

The value was incredible. London can be so expensive and this was so reasonable. I would have expected a price twice as much as we paid.

The neighborhood is great. Lots of food choices very closeby as is the Underground (South Kensington station, a direct connection to Heathrow and Picadilly Circus). The hop on/hop off bus tour stops outside the door.

I cannot think in one thing I would change about it. Perfect!",5,2013,07,10
129,Great hotel small rooms,"The hotel was really nice, it is located next to the south Kensington tube, and for those who haven't been to London this is a very pretty neighborhood. It also has a bus stop in the corner where you can go to and from Piccadilly at day or night.

The people who attended us where great. The breakfast is good as well.

We couldn't use the game room because the room was occupied due to some external events  :(

The room was small but very nice, bed was big, the bathroom had independent sound so you could hear the tv from inside, the bathroom floor had heat so it was a warm touch, the decoration is very nice.

Overall great choice",5,2013,07,09
129,Wonderful place in London,"I have stayed 3 days at this great hotel, conveniently located next to South Kensington tube station (if you arrive from Heathrow airport the tube will take you here in 30 minutes), the Victoria & Albert Museum, Knightsbridge and Harrods. It is a beautiful place, with free WiFi, a complimentary mini-bar and great facilities. The area is very lively and full of restaurants, bars and cafes. Staff is friendly and the tall red haired lady at the Reception is  a God-send.
Can't wait to be back!",5,2013,07,09
129,Delightful hotel in Perfect location.,"Firstly, the location is perfect for accessing all areas of London by tube which is really nearby. The staff were lovely, pleasant and friendly,the decor was fresh and dean but in a cosy way. Max had arranged for our  room ready for us to use to freshen up after our flight as we going to Wimbledon as I had emailed them the night before. Will definitely be back!",5,2013,07,07
129,Boutique chic with personality,"This has to be the quintessential boutique hotel - stylish and chic without pretension. The room was spacious and comfortable, the service warm and friendly and decor exquisite. A short stroll from South Kensington tube stop and close to the museums and high street shopping. The tea salon or drawing room is gorgeous and the library is stocked with the most interesting reads, all selected by a local book seller. The breakfast in the basement eatery was terrific, original and simple. The decor and objets d'art flavor the decor and make this a unique experience. Sure, its not at the cheap end of the range of accommodation in London but worth it. Also surprisingly quiet given the buzz in the streets around the hotel.",5,2013,07,07
129,CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN,"I spent three weeks at the Ampersand in May and found it to be an excellent hotel in every way.  Firstly, and most important I think, the location was excellent.......1 minutes walk to the South Kensington tube station (on the Piccadilly, Circle & District lines,) 1 min walk to bus stops servicing several areas of London and a taxi rank right out the front of the hotel.  My room was lovely, being fresh, modern & clean.  Beautiful bed & pillows (I even looked at the brand tag to see if I could buy them in Australia), and a modern bathroom with a great shower nozzle plus an extra hand-held spray, heated flooring and heated mirror as swell as a magnifying makeup mirror.  Fresh milk, water, juice and soft drinks were complimentary and re stocked every day.  It is these little extras that make a difference I think.  The restaurant, bar and tea room were wonderful.  I often sat in the tea room with a cuppa late in the afternoon writing in my diary whilst waiting for my daughter to meet me after work.  It was fun looking out the window watching the world go by.  What can I say about the staff?  Well, they were really lovely people.....very friendly, courteous and helpful (Hi to Sam, Alberto, Thomas & Miriam).  Can't fault this hotel.",5,2013,07,06
129,Little gem in South Kensington,"Our hotel was The Ampersand, a stylish new boutique hotel in the middle of South Kensington. The convenience for a theatre-goer of being on the Piccadilly line will never be underestimated again! ‚Äì it was always just a few tube stops to get home after a show. We booked a deluxe studio room, the vibrant royal blue accents of the luxurious plush headboard and cushions provided a striking contrast with the soft greys and white of walls and furnishings ‚Äì the jet-black, glossy tiles in the bathroom were attention grabbing, too! The room was really well designed, from the extra wide luggage rack with a long cantilevered shelf above for ‚Äòstuff‚Äô, to the double-sinked bathroom with plenty of shelf space and a set of scales! The only gap I could find in the whole place was the lack of a magnifying mirror in the bathroom for those of us with eyesight issues to apply our makeup. Others on TripAdvisor have commented that the rooms are small, especially the bottom of the range single and double rooms. Our deluxe studio had the feel of a regular decent sized hotel room about it, and when shown inside I made the mistake of thinking that we had been checked into a smaller room in error, so if you can afford to up grade, go for it (we had a stay 3 nights, pay 2 deal).",5,2013,07,05
129,great hotel in South Kensington,"We couldn't have picked a better hotel or a better neighborhood.  

The location was fantastic!  We took the Piccadilly line right from Heathrow to get to The Ampersand, which is a block away from the South Kensington station.  There are so many museums (V&A, Natural History, etc.) and restaurants and eateries nearby (Spanish, Lebanese, sandwiches, a creperie -- the hotel itself has a great restaurant on premises - Apero).   

The hotel was great.  Front desk was very helpful.  Our room was not ready when we got there (we weren't expecting it to be since we arrived much too early) but they happily took our bags and brought them up to our room once it was ready.  We got a Deluxe Room, 416, and it was very nice and clean, and pretty.  Loved the bathroom - amazing shower.  The room was facing the back, not the front, and so it was nice and quiet.  The bed and pillows were so comfy.  

We loved our six-day stay, and we would definitely stay at The Ampersand again.",5,2013,07,04
129,"Great Location, Beautiful Hotel, Tiny Room","Stayed for one night in a Single Room on a recent stay in London. First off: the single rooms are tiny. They are well-appointed, and there is a sense of light in the room, and space provided by the high ceiling, but there is not more than a foot-and-a-half of space either side of the double bed. I thought about storing stuff in the bathroom. For one or two nights a single room would likely be ok, but any longer - go for a bigger room.
Having said that, this is a really lovely hotel. It is light and bright, with funky design elements throughout. It is a non-classic hotel in a classic building. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy, bags stored with no issues. Complimentary wifi is quick and easy to use. Room service was very quick, and there is a complimentary non-alcoholic minibar which is really helpful in London!
The location is fantastic - South Kensington tube is across the road, about a dozen of yummy eateries in the immediate area, ranging from Starbucks/Pret A Manger to groovy wine bars, and then the Victoria and Albert Museum around the corner. Kings Road shopping is about a 10 minute walk away.
I'd definitely stay here again. It's a great hotel in a location that really encourages you to explore London on foot.",4,2013,07,03
129,Perfect For A luxury Treat!! :),"I booked a surprise stay here for my girlfriend & I, and what a treat it was. The hotel staff were helpful in every way and couldn't do enough to make sure we were happy. We were upgraded upon our arrival without even asking to be. The room was wonderful and as for the bed. I don't think I have ever slept in such a big comfy bed as the one at this hotel. 
We had a great weekend in London and we will most certainly be staying here again when we next treat ourselves to a romantic weekend away.",5,2013,07,03
129,The kind of place you don't forget,"My wife and I stayed here in May and I've been meaning to write a review since, it's just that kind of place.  We loved the decor, relaxed atmosphere and excellent service.  We got several excellent recommendations from the very helpful staff including a show (39 steps, which was hilarious), restaurants and ways to save money on tourist attractions.  It's a great location, right beside the tube and there is a fantastic Tapas restaurant a mile down the road!  Try the cocktails in the bar they are superb.  We'll be back!",5,2013,07,02
129,I am brilliant...,"for picking this hotel--or at least my family thinks so.  Posting this review may not be such a good idea, because I suspect it will only get more difficult to reserve.  The Ampersand is so new that your cab driver may not have heard of it...just give it time.  

The decor and comfort level of the rooms is top notch--very stylish and well-thought out.  The breakfast in the Apero was delicious and tea in the Library was delightful.  Service was excellent from the entire staff.  Will return in a heartbeat.",5,2013,07,02
129,weekend away with friends,"Fantastic hotel, brand new, very beautifully furnished, bedrooms were very comfortable and I would definitely stay here again! Our friends were not happy with there breakfast and mentioned it to the reception and they got the chef to cook a special breakfast the next morning FOC with all the trimmings!",5,2013,07,02
129,"Very Good Hotel, Great Location","Pound for pound this is the best hotel we have stayed at when in London. 

It is within about 100 metres (110 yards) of the South Kensington underground, this is on the Piccadilly Line, that is the line easily accessed from Heathrow Airport and costs about ¬£3.50. This is fantastic value compared to using the Heathrow Express and there are no changes involved and hence faster.

The Ampersand is very close to the Science, Natural History and Victoria & Albert Museums as well as the Royal Albert Hall. If you are keen on walking, Harrods is only 20 minutes from the hotel.

The room we had was a good size, the bed was fantastically comfortable and the bathroom, with under floor heating, is modern and well apportioned, with plenty of bench space and all the usual condiments plus loofah (ask your wife).

The minibar is stocked with a variety of soft drinks, water and juices that are free and restocked each day.

The provision of two lifts as well as an elegant staircase made access to our 3rd floor very easy.

In the basement level there is an Italian theme bar/restaurant as well as a gym, library (quiet area), business area and a gymnasium. The two computers along with a printer in the business area are free to use with the added attraction that the computers are Apple, but give the user the option to use them in either Apple or Microsoft mode. WiFi is also free and works adequately.

The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to assist with any request.

All in all a very pleasant 5 nights was had by all.",4,2013,07,02
129,Awesome place!,"I am going to describe the couple of things that went wrong here, only to highlight how quickly and efficiently the hotel staff managed the problems.  I made my reservation over the phone and requested a room with twin beds as my mom and I were travelling together.  After about a week I hadn't received a confirmation via email so I called again and reiterated my reservation request and the need for twin beds.  A confirmation was sent, though no indication of the bed request.  I called again and was told it was all arranged.  Upon our arrival, they had no idea we needed twin beds.  Asking us to wait in the lovely parlor next to reception they got it worked out and within 5 minutes we were on our way to our room.  Small, as one expects in London, but beautiful and fully appointed.  This room was on the ground level at the back and was called a delux room.  That afternoon my mom and I noticed some strange loud noises but took it for regular London traffic and delivery/trash trucks.  That night however the noise continued and in fact seemed worse, it was a very deep noise that literally seemed to move the room.  It was inconsistent but never fully stopped.  My mom called reception and complained at about 12:00 am...they weren't able to make any alterations then, but asked us to check in the morning.  We passed a sleepless night and talked with reception the following morning, they assured us that they would locate another room, we packed our bags and left them in that room and upon our return we were on an upper floor!  It was great service.  I will say that one could still feel the motion of whatever was under the building (I suspect it was the Tube), and the only real frustration is that the staff simply acted as if they didn't know what could possibly be causing the noise.  At any rate, the new room was as wonderful and even larger.  The staff were as kind as possible and helped us with times for services at Westminster, arranging a car to Heathrow and a variety of other small questions.  Literally every member of staff that we encountered were attentive and in good spirits.  I hope to make The Ampersand Hotel my home away from home anytime I'm in London!",5,2013,07,01
129,Unexpected treat,"My expectations of reasonably priced London hotels are not high. This however proved to be a very unexpected treat. The hotel has recently been refurbished. It is a beautiful building which has been decorated sensitively but has all the high tech, mod cons you could want. They have thought of everything from the cafetiere's to the complementary soft drinks mini bar including fresh milk (no uht cartons here!). The room we had was of a reasonable size for a London hotel and was remarkably quiet. The staff were helpful and attentive. The tea room was beautiful I am just sorry we did not have time to enjoy afternoon tea. The choice and quality of the breakfast was great and the restaurant was quirky and fun. The proximity to South Ken tube was an added bonus. The area around the hotel has plenty of cafes and restaurants and is a lovely stroll to the Fulham Road, Sloane  Street  and the Kings Road. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning in the future.",4,2013,07,01
129,Good South Ken locale,"This recently opened hotel was quite good. Received a room upgrade on check-in so can't comment on standard room. Even so the room was quite small. It was on the top floor under the roof so there were oddly angled walls/ceilings. The bed was interposed between a wall and a wide column. The bed was literally in contact with both the wall and the column. At first I was concerned that I wasn't going to even fit in the bed (I am over 6 feet tall), but I managed. Having said that the bed was very comfortable.  There was a large flat screen TV hanging just over my feet so I didn't have any problem seeing it!  The room was well appointed.

For those that are easily disturbed it should be noted that the district and circle underground lines run immediately beneath the hotel just below street level and you can feel vibrations from passing trains even on the top floor. Service stops at midnight so probably isn't really an issue for most and it is barely perceptible. 

The neighborhood is very vibrant with lots of restaurants, museums, parks, and shopping.",4,2013,07,01
129,It's all be said before :),"From The Ampersands stylish decore, location, quality of the rooms to it's service, it's a great place to stay! I chose it based on it's reviews and we were very happy with it. It's close to the South Kensington tube station, museums, London Imperial College, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. The Ampersand is a great location to start exploring London from, most attractions is only 10-15 minutes away.",5,2013,06,30
129,Lovely hotel and perfect location!,My husband and I were guests at the Ampersand Hotel for three nights.  The hotel is nicely decorated in a quirky but cute style. The room was small but nice- the heated bathroom floor was a pleasant surprise. Its location was perfect-just a block from the South Kensington tube station and is within walking distance to fantastic shopping and numerous museums. The hotel staff was very helpful in suggesting local pubs and restaurants as well.  If there is a runner in your group Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are only a few blocks away with many trails for running (or biking).  I would love to come back to this hotel!,5,2013,06,29
129,Love this hotel,"Not only does this hotel have the cutest, most stylish decor but the location is perfect for so much. Our room is adorable and we love the high tech features and heated bathroom floor. Nice breakfast. Lovely seating area for tea or a chat. Very close to the tube, great restaurants and a bus stop at the front door. ",5,2013,06,28
129,Exceptional Service,"My Sister and I stayed at the Ampersand following a three week trip in Europe. The location was perfect with museums close by as well as restaurants and Royal Albert Hall. Within four hours I had badly sprained my foot and ended up spending two days in my room with my badly swollen extremity iced and elevated. The staff was more than helpful. Ice without asking, offers of medical assistance, complementary cappuccino to my room. I felt badly about abandoning my plans since my Sister was new to London but the staff helped her with directions and even fetched her a pillow so she could enjoy her cream tea in pampered comfort. The young woman at the desk tried unsuccessfully to cancel our Swan Lake tickets and we were happy they were used by a member of this delightful staff. I look forward to healing and really taking advantage of the hotel and its location.",5,2013,06,27
129,Lovely Stay,"My family and I stayed there for 7 days total - great hotel with a a very friendly staff.
Location was within walking distance of the tube and some great museums and other sites.
Room where clean and the restaurant was great - Even my 10 yrs old daughter who can be hard to please enjoyed herself.   If you stay check out the food cooked by Head Chef Chris Golding - he does a great job there.",5,2013,06,26
129,Excellent Location and Service,This Hotel is amazing! I highly recommend it for a short business trip or a long stay if you're on vacation. The service is very good and a special shout out to Daniel who did an excellent job in assisting me during my stay. I will definitely be staying there again soon.,5,2013,06,26
129,"Excellent hotel, fabulous location","We stayed in a deluxe studio for 3 nights - fabulous stay.  The location is just fantastic, loads of cafes and restaurants on the doorstep, 5 mins walk to Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, 10 mins walk to Kings Road and ample choice of buses and tube station just nearby.  Staff were all very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

The rooms were all very clean, lovely bathroom and with the studio we had free Nespresso machine and soft drinks. Afternoon tea was far too tempting, and I have to rate very highly the cooked breakfast too!

If you can get a special offer (we had 3 nights for the price of 2), or can afford the rates then I totally recommend it. Otherwise it is expensive sadly.",5,2013,06,24
129,Wonderful Hotel/Book a Deluxe!,We stayed at the Ampersand for 5 nights earlier this month and had a delightful stay!  Our standard room was very small (and my fault  - it is clearly explained on the website the size of the rooms and I did not realize quite how small the square footage was - I'll upgrade next time) but it was very clean and well appointed.  We faced into the garden and were able to keep our window open every night - very refreshing!  The bed was comfortable and I had the best sleep of our vacation while we stayed here.  The hotel even provides umbrellas for the rainy London weather.  The staff was very welcoming - we got there very late in the evening and room service made a special order for myself and my 9 year old and the food was wonderful and a bargain! the hotel's location to the South Kensington tube stop allowed us to have London accessible to us for our stay and we took full advantage of it.  The neighborhood around the hotel is delightful and full of shops and restaurants.  I will definitely stay here again when I next visit London.  My only regret - I really wanted one of the Ampersand rubber ducks and completely forgot about it in the chaos of trying to get up early and make our train to Paris!  Would have made a great London souvenir!,5,2013,06,24
129,Perfect Sunday to Thursday!  Beware Friday and Saturday!,"We arrived on a Wednesday and thought we‚Äôd found the hotel of our dreams in London!  Conveniently located near South Kensington station, we found the Ampersaud Hotel very pleasant with large, well decorated rooms and we just loved the heated bathroom floors!

From the front desk staff to the Doormen, all were wonderful, efficient and pleasant.  We do offer a special call-out to the tall lady with short dark hair at the front desk.  She handled a difficult situation so smoothly that the irritable guests could only smile and think their every wish had been answered!

The staff are dressed in their uniform of jeans, white shirt and black vest.  It lended a casual, yet sophisticated air to the hotel.  The art was fun and made you smile while every staff member, from housekeeping to the managers, made a point to stop and say hello, asking if they could help with anything.  They made you feel welcome and wanted.

The business centre downstairs was convenient and always had a computer available.  The library was compact but efficient and the playroom lots of fun!  The main floor tea room was convenient and the restaurant a good average meal and handy to have downstairs.

We must say the Ampersaud is a wonderful hotel Sunday to Thursday but beware that everything changes Friday and Saturday when the Bar across the street is open ‚Äì IT IS LOUD!  I didn‚Äôt sleep at all Friday night and thank goodness we left Saturday morning.
  
This hotel is almost perfect through the week but stay at your own risk when the neighboring bar is open on weekends.",5,2013,06,24
129,"Excellent stay, would recommend it to anyone if they don't mind the cost","My wife and I stayed six nights at the Ampersand hotel in the summer. It was a most enjoyable stay. Just as good, if not better, than the Langham in Hong Kong. The staff were very nice, and even offered to call restaurants which I had made reservations at in order to get a better time. The rooms were excellent and very clean. Location is literally a minute walk from South Kensington station, which is brilliant.

My only (minor) complaint was that the Air Conditioning was a bit strange. On some days which were particularly warm, I turned the temperature down but it still felt rather warm and stuffy. I had to open the windows to get the cool air to come in, but this made it slightly noisier. Still, a minor issue, and I might have just not known how to work the a/c.

Highly recommended to anyone staying in London.",5,2013,06,24
129,Great stay in So. Kensington,We stayed in a Deluxe Studio and added a rollaway bed.  Room was extremely comfortable for 3 adults.  Bathroom was luxurious.  Great location.  Only steps from So. Kensington Tube Stop and lots of charming restaurants/neighborhoods.  Staff was extremely helpful and courteous.  Downstairs restaurant was charming and a great spot for breakfast.  Would definitely come back here!!!!,5,2013,06,24
129,What an enchanting place!,"We were charmed by The Ampersand's website, and it was even better in person. Fabulous decor - I could have moved right in. Attentive service from the friendly and incredibly competent staff, before, during and after our visit. A delightful oasis in the middle of a hip urban setting. Don't miss tea in the Drawing Room!",5,2013,06,23
129,A beautiful stay!,"After reading the reviews, I was expecting a cramped room with the sound of the tube echoing through the day.  But the great experience started from check-in when we were unexpectedly upgraded.  Okay, even the upgraded room was a little on the small stay, but the room was extremely tastefully decorated and there was absolutely no tube noise.  (Though a big plus for the hotel is both its South Kensington location and the fact that it is literally steps from the tube.)  The staff in the hotel was extremely friendly - both the front desk staff and the staff in the other parts of the hotel, who offered us a short lovely tour of the ""Library"" and restaurant.  We will certainly be back!",5,2013,06,22
129,Convenient,"Location 
Just 2 mins walk from the station

Breakfast

129,Everything was perfect!,"The Ampersand Hotel is a real gem.   We love the So Kensington location, away from the crowds but right next to the underground station.  The hotel staff couldn't be faulted, from start to finish.  The room itself, while a bit small for an upgraded room, was otherwise just what we needed, with an amazingly comfortable bed, a lovely view, and a terrific rain shower. We loved the sunny Drawing Rooms, where we enjoyed several mid-day treats.",5,2013,06,20
129,room difference,"good sides: perfect location (close to the tube and the bus) and a cool neighborhood. clean hotel, helpful staff, nice cafe/bar.
bad sides: first we stayed at the deluxe room, everything was perfect, on our last night we moved to a regular double room at the fifth floor. The wifi signal was so weak that we can say it internet doesn't exist at all :(. Also the double bed in the room was pretty small compared to the one in the deluxe room.
go and stay at this hotel but stay at a deluxe room, if you want space and internet!",4,2013,06,19
129,Excellent stay at the Ampersand,"My wife and I made the Ampersand our hub of operations during a week-long vacation in London.  We arrived early on a Sunday morning after an overnight flight.  While there were no rooms available at 8:30 AM, we were given one of the first rooms to be cleaned and were able to unpack by about 11:00, much earlier than the regular check in time.  They even called us when the room was available.  Great service.  The staff were always friendly. 

While our standard room was small, there are upgrades available with a bit more room.  However, for the price, the hotel is a good value with comfortable and high quality furnishings.  

We took advantage of some of the spacious common areas, such as the library and game room.  It was nice to be able to stretch out a bit while relaxing after exploring all over London.

We did not eat in the main resturant, Apero, but we did have afternoon tea (twice) in the Drawing Room, the patisserie.  Again, very good and friendly service.

Location is another quality this hotel possesses.  In literally two minutes you can be inside the tube station with access to all of London.  Definitely pick up the Oyster card for weeklong access to public transport.  It's also an easy walk to the Museum of Natural History, the V&A Museum, Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Harrod's, etc.

We have stayed in Mayfair several times because of the location.  However, the Ampersand in South Kensington feels just as central to attractions because of the easy access to transportation.  There are plenty of restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, and markets in the area. On Saturday morning there was a nice Farmer's Market across the street.

The hotel is also near embassy row, some residential areas, and the Charles De Gaulle french school is next door.  Walking in the neighborhood was interesting and felt safe. 

We highly recommend the Ampersand and hope to return on another trip.",4,2013,06,17
129,A Gem!,"Our week-long stay at the Ampersand could not have been better. Every member of the staff at this hotel was professional, helpful, and very friendly. The hotel has a youthful, somehow whimsical ambiance coupled with topnotch amenities. One example of the ambiance is the unique lighting throughout the hotel - starting with the central lobby multistory fixture with ""winged"" light bulbs... The room decor was also creative: our room's wall-covering had subtle bird designs, and the book on the bedside table was an anthology of poems about birds. The theme of the decor in our daughter's room was astronomy. The ampersand motif appears in the decor throughout the hotel. (The beds were super comfortable. The rooms were very clean.) A helpful amenity was the car service that the hotel arranged from the airport. Arriving from the U.S. on an overnight flight, we were met by the driver and the cost was charged to our room so that we didn't have to fumble with currency.  The food in the restaurant was excellent. Our afternoon tea or drinks in the drawing rooms were a pleasure. This hotel is a true gem.",5,2013,06,17
129,Wonderful staff and the lap of luxury,"I arrived at 630am after a very long haul flight.  The night staff were still on and they were absolutely fantastic.  They'd prepared a room for me which I could check straight into, despite the fact that I was checking in several hours early.  They were charming, funny and obviously worked together superbly as a team.  I felt very welcome.  

I was staying for one night only before travelling on for business so had booked a smaller double room (the astronomy theme).  It was on the ground floor and so had no view, but this was not a problem for me.  The bed, which I fell into as soon as I could, was very comfortable.  The bathroom was compact but not squashed at all.  The rainforest shower with additional handheld piece was lovely (don't laugh - showers are very important to me).  Toiletries, robes and extras were high quality and all useful (every hotel should offer a loofah!).  I confess, I took the rubber duckie from the shower since he was too cute.  There was enough space for my giant suitcase and to move freely around the room, admittedly I was by myself.  The workdesk had adaptors and powerpoints of all types.

The location is superb, very close to the South Kensington underground station (I travelled directly from Heathrow to there).  For a flying visit it was very handy to Harrods, the V & A museum and all the things that make London a great place to visit (minus the traffic hassles).  The staff offered me an umbrella for the slightly inclement weather.

I went to high tea, after sleeping through breakfast, and it was tasty and varied with lashings of fat and sugar as it should be.  If you are on a diet, this is probably not the thing to do.  The service was prompt and unobtrusive.  I ended up having a good conversation to the waiter about life, as I am a fairly chatty type.

I would not hesitate to stay here again.  If I had company or was staying for longer I would consider a bigger room.  However the double was perfect for my needs at the time.

P.S. sorry night staff I was so jetlagged I forgot to tip any of you.  Please don't think I'm cheap...",5,2013,06,17
129,Charming hotel in wonderful South Kensington...,"My husband and I were celebrating our May birthdays in Europe (London-Barcelona-Lisbon-London) and The Ampersand was the perfect base for 2 nights before our long 9-hour trip back home.

These are the highlights that make The Ampersand a top-notch hotel we would certainly ago back to:

LOCATION
* fab location in the vibrant South Kensington neighborhood 
* South Ken tube station only a few steps away (tip: get an Oyster card)
* 5-minute walk to Victoria & Albert (V&A) museum, 15-minute walk to Harrods

ROOM
* amazing bed (I completely forgot to ask what brand it was so I could look for it back home)
* wonderful Miller Harris (Citron Citron) toiletries
* complimentary non-alcoholic beverages in room fridge (still/sparkling water, apple/orange juice, reg/diet coke)
* turndown service - always nice to come back to the room after a full day of sightseeing and shopping
* walk-in shower (divine!)

DINING
* Must not miss afternoon tea in The Drawing Room! This was one of our most memorable dining experiences throughout our entire trip. Everything we had was oh-so-good, from my lemon verbena tea to the array of delectable little sandwiches and pastries, to the clotted cream and the best jam we've ever had.
* Full English breakfast - another yummy offering at the hotel, this time in their basement restaurant Apero. Amazing value at only ¬£10 (don't bother paying for the room with continental breakfast rate!). 

There have been numerous comments about the size of the rooms. We stayed in a superior room, and yes, it is smaller than what we are used to. With 2 sets of luggage, extra square footage would have made the room more comfortable. Overall, however, this did not take away from our experience and we will most likely consider booking a (bigger) deluxe room the next time we visit. 

",5,2013,06,17
129,Small & perfectly formed,"Ampersand you are brilliant! We loved staying with you - the staff were superb & the decor is gorgeous & the breakfast was perfect (best granola I have ever had!!) & the bed was super comfortable & loved the bathroom ( especially the wooden loo seats) & toiletries. The ornithological references throughout the hotel are charming. The location is amazing - right beside South Kensington tube station so you can get around the city very easily. We stayed 1 night in a Double and 3 nights in a Deluxe room. The Double was cute but very small - however partly that was because the bed was huge - and for one night it was fine. The comfort of the bed and the excellent bathroom made up for the small size of the room, as did the wee box of welcome sweet treats, the complimentary glass of champagne and the delightful staff. The Deluxe room was gorgeous - upholstered velvet bed-head to snuggle up to, excellent storage, quality bed linen. You pretty soon realise that the ""ampersand"" branding on all the amenities reflects more than just the hotel name - rather it symbolizes all the additional extras that combine to make this hotel the perfect city nest. We will be back in November.  ",5,2013,06,17
129,Great renovated property! Afternoon tea was a delight,"My husband and I stayed here on our first trip together to London in October 2012. I found a deal through the travel website, Jetsetter. I was so happy with the room, I immediately took photos. This hotel is not only super clean, shiny and newly renovated, it is very convenient for seeing all the sites in London. Perfect homebase to explore. We relied solely on the tube for transportation and found it very easy to get to this hotel from the airport with our luggage. It's a very short walk from the Kensington station tube. We also felt very safe is this lovely area of London walking around during the day and night.

About the room: We stayed in a superior room. We really loved the bed! The wingback, cushy design is very chic. It's so comfortable that we literally did not want to get out of bed in the morning. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was a large and luxe glassed-in and tiled stall with an upgraded shower head. It was spotlessly clean and the cozy robes and slippers were a nice touch. There's also a french press in the room that we enjoyed for our morning coffee. I had also read that there might be an issue with noise as the tube supposedly runs under the hotel, but we found the hotel quiet and peaceful. 

About afternoon tea: We also took part in the afternoon tea with champagne on our second afternoon there ... it was a real treat! We found a deal for the tea on the Lime & Tonic website. I really loved the decor of the tea room with its cushy, upholstered red chairs and teal accents. Very nice. The trays of goodies were also scrumptious (macaroons, cream and biscuits and so much more) and way more filling than we anticipated (my husband was actually full). The tea was delicious of course, and the service was fabulous. We really enjoyed our waiter--I wish I remembered his name. 
 
All in all, we will definitely stay in this hotel on our next trip to London. I found its service and rooms to be far superior to those of the bigger hotel chains at the same price point. Loved it! Keep up the good work, Ampersand!",5,2013,06,16
129,Great boutique hotel in perfect location to explore London,"The Ampersand lived it up to its wonderful reviews. We stayed twice in two weeks while travelling through Europe and managed to get the same deluxe suite with balcony. The rooms are very modern and so clean and beautifully presented. Monogrammed towels, books by the bedside and even a cute little rubber duck in the bath as well as complimentary wi-fi and drinks in the mini bar. The hotel chef even made us a delicious meal that wasn't on the menu after we arrived from a long flight. The underground and plenty of restaurants/cafes are just steps away. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Ampersand - just wish I had of had enough time to stay for the High Tea!!",5,2013,06,14
129,I adore this hotel,"I just absolutely love the Ampersand. I found a great 3-for-2 deal on their site and decided to book based on so many positive reviews. Those reviews weren't wrong. I also booked an extra night as I was landing very early in the AM on Tuesday so I wanted to be sure I got a nap in after a long, overnight flight from NYC. 

Well, that quick nap actually turned into 5 hours. lol. The bed is so comfortable, I just melted into it and was out like a light. Seriously, that bed is fantastic. But I have to also note that the staff is so kind & helpful. What a lovely welcome at the front desk and they were great about answering any questions I had about how to get around or where to direct you for things/restaurants. 

I also had my very first Tea at the Ampersand. It's one of the things I'd never gotten to do on previous trips to the UK and Afternoon Tea at the Ampersand was lovely. We really enjoyed it and I've become quite the fan of it!

In the room itself, it was well sized for London. Now, being from New York, I'm used to tighter spaces so for me, the Deluxe Room was quite perfect. I would have loved a dresser in the room but it wasn't a big deal as I was only there for a few days. There is a French Press for your morning coffee. I could have squealed at the sight of it. Many places give you the instant stuff. Ick. The shower was as wonderful as the bed. Good water pressure is really important. They also had nice little touches like a loofah scrub and a sewing kit and anything else you might have needed. 

On top of how great the hotel & its staff are, the LOCATION really can not be beat. It's right next to the S. Kensington station which gets you into the heart of most of the places you want to go or easily connects. There are many many options for food in the area as well. It's very close to museums and Hyde Park, about a 10-15 min stroll. And what a lovely stroll it is. 

All in all, I'm really glad I chose the Ampersand for my London stay, and I'll be back there on my return to London. Highly recommend.",5,2013,06,14
129,Great time,We stayed 4 nights at this excellent hotel. The staff is young and enthusiastic about the hotel. The restaurant was outstanding both for breakfast and dinners. The tea room is lovely. The location is great. We spent much time at the V&A museum and at the Kensington Palace and gardens.,5,2013,06,13
129,Simply Brilliant,"Amazing hotel. We stayed 3 nights in June and although having booked  a deluxe room, upon arrival we were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a huge studio room. Friendly, helpful staff at reception 24/7, spacious lifts, immaculately clean rooms with high quality furnishings and products and loads of unexpected extras. Perfectly located in South Kensington, steps away from the tube with direct access to Heathrow and St Pancreas via the Picadilly line. Ten minute walk to Hyde Park. Wouldn't stay anywhere else!!",5,2013,06,12
129,Well located hotel for a London Stay,"This is a great hotel well located in South Kensington, very close to the tube station. The rooms are very well appointed but on the small side in the UK/European tradition.  Note quite a 5* hotel but very comfortable. Recommended.",4,2013,06,09
129,New Years Eve Trip,"We stayed in this hotel for one night on new years eve . The hotel is lovely the staff were wonderful. The decoration in the hotel is lovely and the rooms to. We went to the bar and had two glasses of champagne which was included in our room price. The location of the hotel is great and although it is on a very busy road there was no evidence of noise in our room, I hope to return to this lovely hotel.",5,2013,06,09
129,cant wait to come back,"we are part of 4 couples staying for 2 nights to celebrate a 50th birthday
great location, a hundred metres to south kensington tube station
natural history museum only 5 minutes walk 
beautiful rooms small but superbly furnished, very helpful friendly staff
this is a perfect hotel to base a visit to London
see you soon !",5,2013,06,09
129,Will definitely be back!,"We booked a night here to celebrate our anniversary and were not disappointed. The hotel is in a fab location in South Kensington, the tube is a 2 minute walk away and as soon as we entered the hotel we were impressed.

The hotel is decorated extremely simply but looks so good! The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a Superior room as part of an offer online, and whilst the room could be considered a little small it was extremely well decorated, with an exceptionally good walk in shower (bathroom too small for a bath).....I wish my shower at home was that good. The other amazing thing in the room was the bed....as soon as our heads hit the pillow we had the best nights sleep in ages. 
There was also a complimentary mini bar in the room with a few soft drinks which was really good after a day out and in London. 
We thought that the Ampersand has lots of charm and the exceptional staff mean that we will definitely be staying here in the future.",4,2013,06,08
129,Delectable,"Gorgeous hotel, extremely handsome staff, very helpful in every way. The rooms are tiny but ultra chic; the best bathrooms with under floor heating and the most amazing shower head - this rates among the best showers - and especially in England where water pressure can be totally rubbish - this packs a punch. The rubber ducky is a cute addition. Huge bed and so comfortable.
Fortunately I was upgraded to a larger room on the top floor; though even from here you can slightly hear traffic noise and feel/hear the tube running below the street.
Super sexy furnishings, decor, restaurants and afternoon tea areas - this is a shmick fit out and one that invites you back for more/longer stays.
Ideal location; such a fitting end to an amazing holiday.",4,2013,06,05
129,Can't wait to return,"If you are looking for a perfect holiday hotel, Ampersand hits the mark ..... The first thing that grabbed my attention was the wonderfully comfy beds and pillows. Jet lag wasn't a problem because I just melted into the most comfortable bed and pillows and lights were out for me in seconds.

The decor of the hotel and rooms are so different to many hotels I've stayed in. It's well laid out, great amenities and I love the way they package the bathroom essentials, not forgetting the rubber duckie!

Location is always important for travelers and the Ampersand is perfectly located in the middle of terrific range of restaurants and cafes e.g. Carluccio's, Hummingbird Bakery, La Pain Quontidien and I highly recommend Maxela for steak lovers - it's an Italian restaurant that serves 40 to 50 day aged meats from Piedmonte. Service here is excellent too. There's also Lebanese, Polish, Japanese and Moroccan eateries. 

I love walking and it's a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. I was even able to walk right up to Marble Arch. Transportation is very convenient - the South Kensington tube station is 2 minutes round the corner as well.

Only recommendation I have is the service in the Drawing Room can be better. My husband and I waited 15 minutes to be served one evening. 

Cant wait to return to London because of Ampersand !",5,2013,06,05
129,Lovely Addition to the London Hotel Scene,"This is a charming hotel! I was most impressed with the warmth of the staff...every time I would return I honestly felt as though I was coming home. Everyone at the Ampersand aims to please. 
My room was the most basic category and was quite small however it really had all the functions of a great guest room... The bathroom was lovely and I adored the heated floors in there... great spot!",5,2013,06,04
129,Perfect Stay,"I've just returned from a wonderful 9 day stay at the Ampersand in South Kensington. It has lots to recommend it. 

Location: In a great neighborhood that is a mix of lovely streets, pretty houses, easy walking distance to Knightsbridge, V&A Museum, Natural History Museum. Across the street from the South Kensington tube (on the Circle, District and Piccadilly lines), with a taxi queue across the street. Despite being near the tube and on a main bus route, the hotel is very quiet and hardly any road noise can be heard from inside.

Hotel: Our room on the fourth floor was very quiet, with a wonderful bed, large bathroom and lovely fixtures/appointments. Very posh inside. The tea room, bar, restaurant, lounge areas, gym are all lovely.

Nearby: There is a charming pedestrian cafe spot behind the tube station with cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. The V&A Museum is wonderful, not to be missed. A short walk to Sloane Square is fairly easy, and is a neighborhood worth exploring. 

Some favourite restuarants/bars/shops: Polpo Covent Garden, Hawksmoor Seven Dials, Daylesford Organic, The Orange Public House, Electric Diner, Comptoir Libanais, Jamie's Diner, Mishkin's, La Fromagerie, Marylebone Pub, The Port House and Dishoom.",5,2013,06,04
129,Ticks all the boxes,"Everything suited me during a four night stay last month.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful if required but in no way obtrusive.  I had a standard double room which was perfect for me alone but may be a bit of a squeeze for two people.  The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom excellent.  Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel (including the bedrooms) which I did not encounter in any other UK hotel I stayed in, newspaper delivered to the door and free local phone calls.  I had a light lunch in the Drawing Rooms one day and it was beautifully served.  All of that combined with the closeness of the South Kensington tube and useful buses and lots of good eating spots make it easy to recommend.  And it is so tastefully and interestingly decorated making it a pleasure to walk into.. I loved it.",5,2013,06,04
129,Heaven!!!,"OMG! I don't know where to start as I am so exited to be writing a 'top review' & this doesn't happen very often with me!
Booked for our Anniversary after reading nearly every hotel review in the 'Big Smoke'
So pleased that I went with my gut instinct & booked the Fantastic 'Ampersand'
Located about 20 secs walk from South Kensington Tube station, practically opposite a Lamborghini dealership-what a fantastic location, one stop from Green Park (I believe) & one stop from Knightsbridge-great for Harrods, Harvey Nichs.
Buzzing, lively atmosphere with plenty of great Cafe's & Eateries on your doorstep!
Hotel was beautiful, newly opened last August I believe, prominent place on the street, painted in a lovely grey colour - look at me, I'm even getting excited about the exterior!!!
Reception was cosy & clean & modern & the staff are amazing, so helpful & genuinely friendly, not stuck up like so many places are.
Oh forgot to say my experience with Reservations was the best service I have ever received anywhere, lady was fantastic, took her time & was lovely, ensuring I got a room with a walk in shower & at the front of the building!
Was shown up to room which was lovely, very modern-you just hold door card infront of panel to open! 
Room was stunning (Room 207) A corner deluxe room which was large for London, I did upgrade to this room & could not have been happier!!!
Bed-Fantastic, Sound system in shower room - Fantastic, actually everything was fantastic, complimentary soft drinks in fridge etc etc....won't say much more as it's nice to sometimes experience things without any preconception! Just one thing...a soft close toilet seat would be good!
No noise from other rooms-maybe we were just lucky? Good sleep apart from the traffic noise outside but hey you are in Central London practically & you could feel the underground quite frequently-must run directly under Hotel?
Ate out at Petrus that evening but next time would like to sample their own restaurant.
Ate breakfast at hotel, good but quite expensive ie 2 eggs were ¬£5!!! if adding on to your dish.
Really truly madly deeply loved this hotel & would not hesitate to return, would not even bother searching for another hotel & have already recommended to friends & family.
Lovely boutique hotel for that special occasion or any occasion ;)
Loved, loved, loved!!! Left with a smile on my face.",5,2013,06,02
129,"Lovely hotel, excellent service","Stayed at The Ampersand for 4 nights and strongly recommend it for the following reasons:
1/ Location: very well located in London, closed by shopping area, museums and subway.
2/ Hotel itself: new, stylish in a british traditional way, furbished with taste, very well maintained
3/ Bedroom: I had a Deluxe Room, well furbished, bedding is very comfortable, bathroom a bit small but that's was ok.
4/ Dining: excellent food variety and quality
5/ Service: all were extremely friendly, smiling and ready to assist
6/ Gym: small but well equipped
To conclude, well done and thank you all for a lovely stay, I will be back!",5,2013,06,02
129,Boutique hotel in great location,"Recently stayed for one night at The Ampersand after flying in from dubai.

Location - excellent with 1 minute walk from south Kensington tube and plenty or shops/eateries close by

Rooms - small but very cosy, nice touch with the free soft drinks in the fridge in room
Comfy beds, soft pillows and large bathroom if not as big as the bedroom with double shower. Underfloor heating was good too, would come in handy in the winter months.

Staff- So so friendly and professional, very informative and helpful.

Thanks for a good night in London,

Would recommend, you won't be dissapointed

129,"Afternoon Tea at The Drawing Rooms, The Ampersand Hotel","We enjoyed one classic and one chefs afternoon tea at The Drawing Rooms, The Ampersand Hotel in Harrington Road right by South Ken tube. The room and decor are lovely, service was very good, there is a selection of coffee table books to browse and newspapers (including the Guardian). I had the classic afternoon tea and my friend Rooth had the chefs which meant slightly different cakes and scones and sandwiches. My sandwiches were open whereas Rooth's were in profiterole cases! Different and light. As a veggie they gave me cheese and pickle, cream cheese, cucumber and tomato/olive, they could probably improve on this a bit and make sure there is at least some cheese or egg on each piece of bread but the scones and cakes and tea were exemplary and our tea pots were refilled several times as part of the afternoon tea. We were only charged extra when Rooth switched types of tea. The hotel itself is very modern and bright, its a handy place to know if you're in the area and you can just choose individual cakes from the delicious looking display. The only thing I'd say is more choice for veggies please! Otherwise a delightful and affordable afternoon tea! Toilets appear to be unisex which is a little odd in a fancy hotel!!",5,2013,05,30
129,Fantastic location and very modern/comfortable,"The tube is less than a block away and there are several bus stops in the area that take you quite far. The staff was helpful and nice. I didn't ask many questions but they were able to arrange a car ride to the airport and charged it to the room which made it easy. The free internet is actually really good. I was able to watch HD youtube videos everyday but a couple days. I did report some internet problems and they were resolved the next day. I had room 001 which is a wheelchair accessible room. It was the only free room when I showed up so I took it because of a long flight. It wasn't bad but the view was of a brick wall. It was pretty quiet other than occasion trains. The bathroom was nice and big because its accessible. It has heated floors (except for the shower part), rubber duckies, and speakers for the TV in the bathroom. I originally booked a single knowing it was small and the staff reached out and suggested a double due to the length of my stay. I did upgrade the room and appreciated them reaching out. The fridge next to the bed was super nice too.",4,2013,05,29
129,Great location and excellent rooms,"We loved our short stay at The Ampersand Hotel.  Design is gorgeous, staff attentive and the location cannot be beaten.  We stayed 3 nights in May and it was the perfect base to explore the Museums (David Bowie Exhibition a highlight) and eat at London's great restaurants.",5,2013,05,28
129,Excellence pesonified,"Booking a single room can often lead to disappointment, and when the hotel makes it clear that the room is small I was prepared to be slightly disappointed. I shouldn't have been. Yes, the bedroom was small but absolutely superb. A full sized, very comfortable, double bed, fridge with complmentary soft drinks, tea and coffee making facilities, multi channel TV, complmentary newspaper, excellent en suite shower - the list is endless. The hotel is a minute's walk from South Kensington tube station but being at the back of the hotel there was no noise whatsoever. On top of all that, the staff were excellent and the cleanliness was of the highest standard. Not cheap, but  excellent value for this part of London",5,2013,05,27
129,A seriously good hotel,"After several visits, we're in no doubt that the Ampersand is one of the best hotels in the UK.  Imaginative in conception and scrupulously professional in delivery it's the best combination of old-fashioned hospitality and modern style.  Rooms are compact but beautifully-finished, hotel facilities are thoughtful and elegant and the in-house restaurant mixes the unusual and the classic in a textbook example of value and service.  To sum up: the hotel's maintenance staff seem to be constantly at work keeping everything like new - an apt example of the philosophy of hospitality and high standards that seems to be the Ampersand's guiding principle.  Not cheap - but great value.",5,2013,05,26
129,A birthday treat for our Son,"We booked this hotel on a 'room only basis'  Really love this hotel and would highly recommend to this for people with families as it's ideally located for all the museum's.  

They had placed us on the top floor, and we had our own balcony which was an added treat.  The room was a good size and with a bed put up for our Son, still had room.  The room was lovely, so clean and fresh.  A good amount of towels and toiletries are provided.  Hairdryer is provided and should you need it an umbrella in your room!  The tea/coffee making facilities are excellent.

We had initially booked this as mentioned earlier on a 'room only basis' however, we ended up ordering breakfast and had it delivered to our room the next morning.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, nothing is too much trouble.

A very moden, clean, fresh boutique hotel.

Will be going back.",5,2013,05,26
129,Very nice hotel experience in London,"Super service from incheck to outcheck, friendly helpul staff. Charming place in all aspects. Situated in a very nice area of London for us very convenient and close to the Chelsea flower show and Victoria Station. Srong reccomondation from our side.",5,2013,05,26
129,Great stay at the Ampersand,"Loved this Hotel! Excellent Location and service!!! This property is a great find for anyone travelling to London! I stayed for 5 nights and loved it! The beds are amazing! The decor is gorgeous! the room was spotless, the bathroom was lovely, floors heated and excellent shower!! The staff was extrememly accoomodating and very helpful and efficient!!! the breakfast that was included was ample and delicious. the drawing room was beautiful and although i never had tea or a drink there, i did check it out and it looked fabulous. I loved my stay here and I highly recommend the Ampersand!!",5,2013,05,24
129,As good as it gets!,"From the minute you arrive to a great welcome and reservation process, the entire experience is so relaxing and rewarding. Service, room, bed, cleanliness, food, the wonderful drawing room.... I could go on, but as a frequent traveller far and wide, this was as good as it gets. Just perfect.",5,2013,05,24
129,Fabulous Hotel,"Great Hotel, excellent staff and first class service.  Spent 11 nights at the Ampersand and enjoyed every minute of it.  Lovely room, great bed and shower.  Quiet room. Extras such as free juice, pop and water in mini bar really appreciated  Staff made you feel very comfortable and at home.  Restaurant and room service excellent. Great location near South Kensington Tube, museums, parks and lovely area to walk around. Love to stay again.",5,2013,05,21
129,PERFECT!,"Booked this hotel for a 3 night trip, encouraged by the raving reviews. 
Location is ideal: right across the street from South Kensington Station. Although the tube takes you straight to Heathrow or Harrods, Picadilly Circus, Leister Square and Covent Garden, I would recommend taking one of those famous busses.
Deluxe Studio was nothing but perfect. Didn't hear a single sound from the street, hallway or other rooms. Bed was extremely comfortable, complementary drinks a nice bonus.
Loved the decorations and boutique extra's which really made this trip perfect.",5,2013,05,21
129,Thoroughly Lovely!,"Because I was arriving in London early in the morning after a LONG flight from Australia and had a full day planned, I contacted the hotel a few days ahead of time to ask whether there would be anywhere for me to shower and change in the case that my room wasn't available for check-in (this can be a problem for antipodean arrivals). The hotel quickly got back to me to say that there wasn't anywhere for me to shower and change, but that they would do their best to accommodate me. I got on the plane and hoped for the best.

I arrived later than expected after a delay to my already very long flight and was very pleasantly surprised to find that my room was indeed ready (more than four hours before the check-in time of 2pm) AND I had been upgraded! 

The staff were friendly and helpful. I stayed in room on the 1st floor, at the back. It was very quiet. The room was lovely, not huge - but this is central London, after all, but stylishly and comfortably decorated. The bathroom was not large, but did not feel small. It was an accessible bathroom, suitable for disabled guests, so no bath, but a good-sized walk-in shower. The bathroom's under-floor heating was very welcome, even in late April.

The location is excellent. Literally around the corner from the Victoria and Albert, the Science and the Natural History Museums. It's also very handy for some charming local eateries. The tube is just over the road.

Overall, I was extremely pleased with my choice of The Ampersand and would not hesitate to choose it for my next trip to London.",5,2013,05,21
129,"Impressive Hotel, Large Rooms, service could have been better...","The hotel was an accidental discovery as I didnt get any options during this very peak season. It was a great choice for us. For the price I paid, the rooms are a delight, the location great and the service was OK. All the little things missing from the service (like no bottled water in the room (had to ask every time), amenities not replaced (almost waited for the last drop of soap to get over and even then we had to ask for it to be replaced). Frankly, I was surprised. 

However, the hotel itself is quite a delightful design with very nice staff. We espcially loved the 'game room' where my son and I played chess all night long over spanish jazz in the background and the very comfortable beds.",4,2013,05,19
129,Good old fashioned service and modern living,"Fantastic hotel in my opinion the best location in London.
The room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable
The staff also could not have been more helpful.
Will be coming back and would have no hesitation in recommending this fabulous hotel.",5,2013,05,15
129,Great option in perfect neighbourhood,"Lovely reno - well appointed, if small, rooms.  Good bathrooms, lots of amenities and super comfy beds.  Windows open, great transit access. Very early check in after an overnight flight.  Couldn't ask for more.",4,2013,05,13
129,"Lovely, but very bijoux!","I stayed here for one night during a weekend city break in London with my husband. The location is perfect ‚Äì right in the heart of the museum district and very convenient for the tube, plus local bars, cafes, and restaurants. It's also handy for a walk in Hyde Park. The decor of the hotel is very stylish, and all brand new. I had expected a small room ‚Äì this is London after all ‚Äì but our room was very small indeed. Not that this mattered as we were out and about all day and it was simply somewhere to sleep. The bathroom was lovely, and actually a decent size compared to the room, and there are upscale toiletries and thoughtful touches such as free soft drinks from the mini bar. The staff are extremely polite and friendly. There is a nice bar/restaurant in the basement, and the lounge area appeared to be a pleasant place to have afternoon tea. All in all this is a lovely hotel, but if you are planning to spend time relaxing in your room I might advise upgrading to a superior room.",4,2013,05,13
129,"Outstanding, do not hesitate book now.","Simply wonderful. From start to finished we thoroughly enjoyed The Ampersand.
I would firstly like to thank all the staff, you couldn't have done anymore to make us all feel so welcome. We only eat breakfast however the food was outstanding. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked another stay at the end of may. If you are looking for a perfect friendly base to explore London, do not hesitate, book now you won't regret it. Once again thanks to all. Outstanding. The Reilly's ",5,2013,05,13
129,Fantastic location,"We arrived at Waterloo station and within 20 minutes via the tube we were a short stride away from our hotel. 

Checkin was effortless , concierge showed us to our room and demonstrated all the features with a friendly manner, we asked for an iron and within 2 minutes housekeeping delivered - staff were brilliant and all conveyed a very warm welcome when ever we came into reception.

Breakfast was disappointing for what you have to pay (¬£28 for two cooked breakfast with a coffee and an orange juice)  staff appeared very disorganised compared to the reception team and whilst food was perfectly edible there are local cafe's that can provide you with a much more economical way to start your day.

Our room was located on second floor at rear of building and we had zero traffic noise and only the slight rumble from the underground but then what do you expect when your so near to South Kensington station. Room had a lovely designer boutique feel to it and was fitted out with very comfortable furnishings.

One minor safety point, Watch the shower ! It would appear that somebody missed a few inches off the glass splash panel that is intended to catch the water and prevent the tile floor becoming as slippery as an ice rink. Will be interesting to see what condition the floor / door areas are in after a few years service.

We selected the hotel primarily for its location and room quality- we were not disappointed - ¬£5 in a taxi and we were at our concert at the Royal Albert hall and a five minute walk in the morning gained us access to all the museums. 

Would highly recommend if you want a great sense of style in a location that provides easy access to all the main attractions both local and via the tube network.",4,2013,05,12
129,"Deserving of 'small, luxury boutique hotel' title. Excels.","When I started my search for accommodation in London, my requirements were:
- a small, luxury boutique hotel, 
- located in the Kensington area, 
- with convenient access to a park and to public transport,
- with beautifully decorated and appointed rooms.

The Ampersand Hotel 'ticked all the boxes'. I loved staying there! 

I am a regular international traveller; years of experience resulting in my discerning standards regarding hotels. This hotel is newly renovated. The interior design is a joy to behold.

  My room had wi-fi connectivity, iPhone docking station, flat-screen TV, kettle, mini-bar, safe, underfloor heating in bathroom, ultra-comfortable bed with fluffy duvet and pillows, quality cotton bedlinen. Fittings and fixtures brand new. Quirky and charming decor themes. 'Apero' restaurant serves excellent food. 'Drawing Room' serves most amazing tea & pastries; High Tea a delight. Customer service impeccable in every sphere. 

The Ampersand will remain my preferred 'go-to' place in London.",5,2013,05,12
129,One of the friendliest hotels in London,"Chose this hotel for its location so near to the Albert hall and fell in love with it! We arrived a little early but no problem as we were taken straight to our room, which was a little on the small side, but that is my only criticism of this lovely hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful and the little extras (quality toiletries even down to makeup remover wipes and free soft drinks) made it a most comfortable stay. We generally tend to stay in the West End but I think you are more of an individual in these smaller boutique hotels in areas such as south Kensington so think we will be back to the Ampersand very soon. Nice to feel valued as a customer.",5,2013,05,11
129,"Great location, super stylish","The Ampersand has not only a great location close to tube station South Kensington and many bus lines that drive right into the heart of London, but also a great neighborhood: renowned museums like Victoria & Albert are just a few steps away and for foodies at Exhibition Street right around the corner there are many cute caf√©s and restaurants with outdoor tables.
The hotel is well designed and brightful colors add a lot to the atmosphere, staff are young,  very friendly and helpful.
We had booked two superior rooms. As everywhere in London they were quite small, but very nicely furnished, stylish, but small bathrooms with high quality amenities and bath robes. Very clean, great rain shower - close to perfect!
We had dinner at the Apero restaurant and it was a great experience: The food was high quality, cocktails and wine very good and not overpriced at all.
Only thing we really did not like: The noise in the streets - it was hard to find sleep all four nights we stayed. Anyway we'd definitely come back again.",5,2013,05,11
129,Great location. Great service,"Stayed two separate nights in a week.  It is a well designed, newish hotel in a great location by the South Kensington tube station. Easy for Heathrow, museums, shopping and lots of cafes/restaurants nearby.  The staff were very pleasant and very accommodating. They deserve a pat on the back for jobs well done.  The rooms are well equipped and nicely designed, although some on the higher floors can be small.  It has a really sweet 'tea room' and bar on the ground floor which proved a great place to meet people.",5,2013,05,11
129,Well designed boutique hotel in fab location,"Spent 4 days at the Ampersand in April and really loved my experience. The hotel is in a fantastic location right near the South Kensington tube station, near museums, the park, great shopping and a lot of restaurants. It's a great place to stay for pleasure or work. 

The hotel is beautiful and very well designed inside -- lovely art, and a very nice staff. The restaurant is excellent, and there is a nice tea room/lounge on the main floor. 

I booked a double room (for single occupancy)- I knew the room was going to be small (11M) which was stated in the booking. When I travel by myself that typically doesn't matter to me. I felt that the room, while small, was very well designed with a smart closet built into the wall on one side of the bed, high ceilings, a huge window and a beautiful bathroom with a spacious shower. 

My only issue was that the window looked out to another window and I felt like I couldn't leave the blinds open, or people would look right into the room. 

Otherwise, no issues at all. Highly recommend!",4,2013,05,09
129,Good hotel in a great location,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in April. South Kensington is always a good base from which to explore London, and the Ampersand is really conveniently located, being just a couple of hundred yards from South Kensington tube station, giving you access to 3 of the capital's principal underground train lines. In addition, it's just a 5-10 minute walk from London's best museums, and a 15-20 minute walk to sites such as Kensington Gardens, the Royal Albert Hall, Hyde Park, and Harrod's. The staff at the Ampersand really do strive to deliver great customer service. The hotel is relatively new, having taken over from a former hotel last year. In fact, our London cabby (taxi driver) who drove us there from St. Pancras station had not heard of it before - and it takes some doing to fox a London cabby! It's worth taking the buffet breakfast deal at the hotel; you can pay 10 pounds (about $15) extra for a cooked breakfast, but there is plenty from which to select on the buffet. Another reviewer mentioned "" a massive shower,"" and it would be good to ask for a bathroom with a walk-in shower, if you prefer that over a bath; I did (several months ahead of arrival) but the hotel could not accommodate that request. The room (a Superior) was comfortable, but (a point made by the same reviewer) ""a bit on the small side."" But this is usually to be expected with many London hotels. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would use the hotel again if staying in that part of London in the future.",4,2013,05,09
129,OUTSTANDING. Exceeded all expectations,"This hotel is sensational. Very easy to find from South Kensington station (on the District, Circle and Piccadilly tube lines), in a lovely quiet location. I stayed here for 3 nights of a 6 week round the world holiday- this was easily the best hotel I stayed in during the trip, and possibly the best ever.
The hotel facilities were fantastic- the drawing room, bar and restaurant were particularly lovely relaxing areas with great food, drinks and staff. In fact all of the staff that I encountered during my stay were wonderful- everyone from the reception team to the painters doing maintenance. 
And the rooms.....oh the rooms. Very comfortable with the absolute best of everything.
I'll be talking about my stay at this hotel for a very long time.
Thanks to everyone at The Ampersand",5,2013,05,09
129,Wonderful experience,"I stayed here with my daughter for a special occasion.  The staff went to so much trouble to make this a memorable occasion, and it was.  Our room was beautiful, the food for breakfast was excellent.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  Absolutely first class!",5,2013,05,08
129,"Location, Service, Location","South Kensington tube is the perfect location to plan and to ""do"" London and the Ampersand is located one block away! We had a delightful room under the eaves (507) with a sitting area and a cozy queen bed. Service is fantastic and the basement bar and restaurant a haven-try the lamb chops, fantastic. Sitting in the drawing room in the morning or afternoon is delightful for coffee or a cream tea. Many many great restaurants within walking distance and you can take the Piccadilly line from Heathrow right to South Kensingon-only 9.40 and 45 minutes, much faster and cheaper than the Heathrow Express.",5,2013,05,07
129,excellent staff & customer service,"this hotel is in a great position, just across from South Kensington tube. the staff area great, very helpful, excellent customer service.
we stayed in a standard double room, the room was a bit on the small side but then this is a city hotel. the bathroom had a massive shower in it, no bath but the bathroom was nearly as big as the bedroom. usual flat screen hung on the bedroom wall, sky sports etc. the hotel is spotless.",5,2013,05,07
129,"A great hotel, they've thought of everything!","We stayed here recently for a weekend and thoroughly recommend it. We had a superior room so it was spacious and had lots of nice little extras, fresh milk in the fridge, complimentary soft drinks, great bed and shower. We were on the first floor at the front and you can hear the road noise and a low rumble of the tube. But IT'S  LONDON!! I'm a light sleeper and none of this disturbed my sleep, good double glazing and effective air conditioning helps. We weren't aware of any guests around us either. From the minute we walked through the door to the minute we left every single member of staff greeted us and nothing was too much trouble. Don't get me wrong, you pay for it, but we've stayed in hotels at a similar rate and haven't had this from staff. Breakfast in the lounge was nice, you can have a bowl of granola or porridge and a piece of toast and you only get charged for the item, not the fixed rate some hotels charge. It's not a huge array of choice but plenty for most and you can go for the whole cooked breakfast in the downstairs restaurant if you want. The hotel is central for museums and parks and loads of cafes and restaurants. Any criticisms? Not really, maybe a few more tea bags in the room for the tea drinkers, they were always replaced when we asked, but only 2 or 3 at a time. Also one of the staff mentioned in passing that the standard rooms were small, but we didn't see them.  But I'm nit picking now. This is a great place to stay, treat yourself and upgrade if you can!",5,2013,05,07
129,What a lovely hotel to stay in!,"We stayed just one night for our wedding anniversary and wished we could have stayed for much longer.  We had booked a superior room and had requested a quiet location via the hotel's excellent guest concierge website, which you are emailed a link to a few week prior to your booked stay...  The request was promptly acknowledged and I had every confidence that we would be well looked after - but the icing on the cake was that on arrival at 11am to just drop off our bags, our room was all ready to be checked into and we had also been upgraded to a lovely deluxe suite!   

The staff were very friendly and efficient, the room was gorgeous with wonderful facilities and an enormous comfortable bed.  Despite being in the middle of South Kensington, the room was super quiet and we had a very tasty cooked breakfast next morning.  The location couldn't be better for the locality, Museums and the tube.  All in all a ten out of ten stay and we will definitely be back for hopefully a longer stay next time!",5,2013,05,07
129,Just the ticket,"Took my wife to London to celebrate her 50th birthday and also to meet up with my daughter and her boyfriend for one night to take her out for a meal for her 21st. So as you can imagine a lot of pressure to get it all right. 
After much deliberation I settled on The Ampersand as the rooms looked great the location, although a little away from the centre, was just a hop away on the Piccadilly tube. 
We stayed in a Deluxe Studio ‚Äì very spacious, really well decorated and looked like it had just been decorated to a high standard. We had a smoking room (no smell of old smoke) with a very nice balcony (we don‚Äôt like smoking in the room). Bathroom superb with a TV in the bath, heated floor and again really well decorated. Times delivered free every day, free non-alcoholic mini bar, free Nespresso machine in room, excellent bed, great in room entertainment with huge TV, Sky Sports etc. Staff were absolutely great, remembered everything I had been discussing for the previous month, so knew not to mention my daughter arriving in front of my wife. Nothing too much trouble and seemed genuinely interested in how our break was going. My daughter was totally enthralled with her room and the hotel. 
I feel not enough is mentioned by other comments made about the location. As I see it mostly you will be going east to Soho / Mayfair / Theatre land etc. so you can stay in that area and put up with overpriced totally tourist traps. Or move a little west to Mayfair and pay loads for pretentious pomp or look at some of the offerings in east London but be out in the sticks a bit. I thought that The Ampersand was going to be a bit far out of the way but thought the direct tube would compensate. There is just so much to do in the little area by South Kensington Tube. So may restaurants to suit all budgets and excellent value (Comptoir Libanais my fave) we actually came back to eat a couple of times. Great little club literally over the road and another just by the tube station entrance. The best cheese shop I have seen anywhere and a great wine shop. Best of all a great paved open area at the Exhibition Rd end with a multitude of restaurants and a great atmosphere, very close to all the big museums and Hyde Park.
Would highly recommend The Ampersand to anyone looking for high quality in a great location.",5,2013,05,07
129,VERY NICE STAY GOOD LOCATION,"Very nice hotel, great location. Staff very friendly. Excellant breakfast. Only negative rooms small and parking expensive if done by hotel. There is a NCP car park though down the road towards Harrington Gardens.",4,2013,05,04
129,Great Hotel,"This is a fantastic Hotel  is situated in a very good location.

The staff were very friendly and helpful I  could not fault anyone . They made you feel very welcome.
The rooms are great and you do not anything .  
I will defiantly book this Hotel and hope it will be soon.",5,2013,04,28
129,One word 'Perfect',"This place exceeded my expectation. The single room is too small but the beautiful decor, the location, the comfy bed, free minibar, and the attentive service had all made up for its size. The only suggestion that i have was that I wish for more lights in the room. Other than that, everything exceeded my expectation, they even had the room ready for early check in. So please don't look any further, this place is IT.",5,2013,04,28
129,Such a fabulous hotel!,"It took just one conversation with the reservations department at The Ampersand Hotel to assure me that this was going to be the hotel for me. The customer service is second to none, thoughtful, caring and most definitely customer-centered. We stayed for just 1 night this week but have already booked further nights for the coming months. Fabulous location in South Kensington, wonderful decor, friendly welcome and lovely rooms. We could not believe how quiet our bedroom was considering we were in central London. Yes it was compact for two of us - but there are plenty of larger rooms, and if I was staying longer than 1 night I would chose those. It is well deserving of the awards and I am really looking forward to my next visit.",5,2013,04,26
129,Look no further,"As with the other reviews associated with this hotel on tripadvisor, this property has almost everything that one would need when traveling to London. Location, convenience, friendly staff, free minibar. Rooms are small, so try to get the ones at the studio level or higher if space is required. It is not next to major shopping areas, but one can walk to Harrod's on a sunny day, or take the subway to Bond/Regent/Oxford Streets without difficulty. High Street Kensington and Nottinghill is not far away either. 3 subway lines run underneath the hotel (and you can hear it too), but convenience has its price. A cab ride costs about 10 pounds to Mayfair part of the city, but with traffic, the costs can go much higher. The tube is just the way to do it in London. There are smaller shops around the hotel that is worth exploring. Not a cheap hotel, but nothing is really cheap in London anyway.",5,2013,04,23
129,One of the best new hotels in the world,"I searched diligently for many hours on the Internet for the perfect place to stay in London. We were looking specifically for a very nice boutique hotel in a good area with space for my mom and I, for ten nights, at a reasonable price. We found it in the Ampersand. This hotel opened last August and has been winning awards ever since (recently voted one of the 2012 best new hotels in the world by Conde Nast Traveler). It deserves all commendations; this is an excellent hotel. Here are ten reasons why:

10. A perfect location just around the corner from the South Kensington tube station, near restaurants and within an easy 5 minute walk to some of the best museums in London, as well as to a large selection of Barclay Bikes that would be easy to ride to Buckingham Palace.

9.Online bookings and a strong social media presence on Twitter and Facebook, with a real person providing quick responses to questions and comments.

8.The drawing room. Just wait till you see it.

7.Complimentary upgrades to your room in some cases.

6.Very comfortable beds with luxurious long pillows and duvets.

5.Spotlessly clean bathrooms and excellent professional housekeeping during your stay.

4.Free wifi in the rooms with no passwords needed and a strong signal.

3 and a half. Chocolates and a handwritten note of welcome on our first evening.

3. Extraordinarily pleasant and helpful front desk staff.

2. Unique and whimsical decor throughout all rooms, a beautiful front lobby and sitting areas.

1. A little rubber ducky, with the Ampersand logos on it,  in the bathroom that you are welcome to take home with you after your stay.

I cannot think of anything they could improve upon. They arranged a very nice car service to Heathrow for us, which would have been a similar price for taking a taxi to Paddington station and then the Heathrow Express. Umbrellas in the rooms and at the front door were appreciated. 

Lovely hotel, I very highly recommend it, and I will absolutely return here during my next stay. Feel free to contact me through Tripadvisor if you have any questions.",5,2013,04,22
129,Beautiful base in South Kensington,"We stayed here for 4 nights, 04-05 till 04-09-2013. When we checked in, we were shown 4 rooms before settling on ours. We were told that as with many of the older buildings in London, the rooms on the lower levels usually came with higher ceilings (which gives the impression of more space) and the ceilings get lower as you go up floors. Unfortunately at this property, the rooms we saw on the first level also look out to the busy street and is exposed to all the foot traffic outside. As with most properties in big cities, space is a premium and our Deluxe room was small with an even smaller bathroom and closet space about the length of my forearm.

The chic-ness of this newer property (opened August 2012 ?) does make up for a lot as does the superb service from all the staff. A good restaurant is located in the hotel as is a pretty tearoom along with a cute library and games room and very efficient and tightly packed gym. 

The hotel is a two minute walk to the South Kensington tube station which hosts the Piccadilly line going to and from Heathrow. Labanese, French, Japanese, Chinese, eateries are all around for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",4,2013,04,21
129,"Great hotel, great location, great decor, great service","Fantastic hotel that combines large hotel luxury and amenities with boutique hotel character.  The location off the south Kensington tube stop gives quick and easy access to all central London sites. Room rate is on the high side, but includes the little things that many places nickel and dime like wifi and mini bar.  Rooms are thoughtfully designed with ample seating, surface space, outlets, lighting.  Bathroom is fantastic.",5,2013,04,20
129,A Fantastic Surprise,These guys really know how to look after you and the location is superb. My room was absolutely tiny but the bathroom generous. The staff were superb and ‚Äì for once in London ‚Äì really couldn't do enough to help without me asking or them charging for it. Couldn't recommend highly enough as long as you can get a good price and try to get a bigger room.,5,2013,04,18
129,brand new and very well located,"We had a very nice stay at the Ampersand and would definitely go back. The hotel is brand new, therefore it is modern, fresh and nicely decorated throughout. The staff is very friendly and helpful and we were welcomed even before arriving, by a mail asking if we needed any arrangements beforehand. We had a superior room which was very good size with a nice and modern bathroom. The bed was large and very comfortable.
The only downside was that there was not enough storage for our clothes,only two tiny drawers and no shelves, so we had to store some of our clothes in our luggage. The same thing at the bathroom, not even a hook to hang the towel next to the sink!",5,2013,04,17
129,Great five star hotel in south Kensington,"We stayed here for two nights based on previous reviews and were not disappointed . This is a really modern five star hotel providing five star service , and lovely modern rooms albeit a little on the small side but standard for london hotels , lovely big bathroom which was spotless and big spacious shower. The staff were helpful and courteous. The food in the restaurant was top quality . The location was great , right beside the south Kensington tube and only 10 minute walk to Harrods . We would definitely stay there again. ",5,2013,04,17
129,Wonderful hotel in great location,"We just came back from a delightful stay at the Ampersand in London. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room, which was absolute bliss. A big and very comfy bed, enough space for two and all our shopping as well as a very big bathroom. A lot has to be said for the warm floor tiles in the bathroom. Very enjoyable! We were lucky enough to be on the second floor, out to the side away from the kindergarten and the street. Slept very well, as it was not noisy at all. London is of course a very big city and some noise at night has to be expected, but we were pleasantly surprised about this. During the weekend we enjoyed our continental buffet breakfast in the Drawing Rooms, which are very nicely decorated and flooded with light. The Capuccino was very good and the breakfast selection nice. Some cheese would be appreciated, however, this is a personal remark... The other two mornings the same buffet breakfast was served in the underground restaurant Apero. Although nicely decorated as well, we felt that it was rather dark and a bit stuffy, we preferred the Drawing Rooms. Somehow, they seem to have a problem with the coffee machine in Apero as twice the Cappucino was extremely bitter and we had to re-order. Service was extremely friendly and helpful though, so no issue there. 

As we had originally booked a Superior room we asked whether we could have a look at one to compare the size with the Deluxe room. A lot of people have commented on the size of the rooms. We stayed in London a lot of times, used to live there for a year. One has to be aware that London hotel rooms are generally rather on the small side. Comparing the two rooms, of course the Deluxe was bigger and very comfortable, however, we felt that the Superior room was also very nice. It really depends on your preferences whether you would like to splash out on a Deluxe room or not. Bearing in mind that most of the time you may be out and about it may not be an absolute necessity. 

Location is key for a city trip of course and the Amepersand ticks all the boxes in this category as well. South Kensington is a perfect underground station, not a lot of stairs and very convenient for Heathrow and everywhere around town as it is on the Picadilly and Circle/District lines. A good number of restaurants are also in the area, so no need to go to Soho for dinner. And of course the hotel is very conveniently located to visit all the major London museums. Hyde Park is just a stroll away.

To sum it up: The best hotel we stayed at in London so far. We will definitely be back and can recommend it.",5,2013,04,17
129,A great stay in London!,"Dear Staff of Ampersand Hotel , 
thank you very much  for a lovely stay in your nice Hotel . We stay some times in London ( usually around of Kensinghton area that is my favorite location!) and we are very satisfy to find this hotel! 
We are sure that we cam back again for all times and we recommend it ! 
We are owner's  of Hotel in Venice and when we travel ,we  like  to see all details : cleaning room , friendly staff , nice location ...everythings is perfect!! 
Thank you again  and we hope to came back  again very , very soon!!.
Best Regards",5,2013,04,17
129,My second stay,"I stayed at this hotel about 6 months ago and my stay did not quite go to plan, this time round, things were much better. On my fist stay I was in the standard room which is little more than a shoe box, this time I was offered the deluxe room, it was total heaven, beautiful room, quiet, underfloor heating, good size, TV in bath, massive TV in room, books and high end glossy mags...a real 5 star experience, although the curtains did not totally draw together properly so the sunlight came through in the morning which was a tad annoying.

The reception staff were yet again all very nice especially Salvatore and the Afro-Caribbean lady. 

I have not given full marks as I have experienced the following on both visits, so assume this is the norm:

For a 5 star I do find it odd that there is never anyone on the door, especially given that there are a few little steps to access and the doors are not automatic, each time i have only had a small cabin bag, so not a major hassle for me (although the first time i did have my little one also) but i had witnessed several other guests fighting to get in/out with suitcases and we had to help each other so to speak.

Housekeeping...Why oh why do you insist on knocking on guests doors asking what time they will be checking out?!? This is not a budget hotel that has the ""get em in cheap and get em out fast"" approach so when guests are paying upwards of ¬£150 per night, one should not be harassing  guests asking when they are checking out so you can get your day over sooner. I  have hardly have this happen at budget hotels if I am totally honest.  On my first stay this happened (with the DND on)  at around 9am! this last stay it happened again around 10am?!? I can understand if it is around 11.30am, but 10am is unacceptable and I really hope this gets looked into. I was planning on staying another night, but this problem with housekeeping put me off as this really is a bug bear of mine.

Overall the hotel is a nice place to stay, very chic, modern and classy without the snobbery which is a rare find in the Kensington/Knightsbridge areas",4,2013,04,16
129,Customer Service a Priority,"Just returned from a weekend stay at the Ampersand.  From start to finish, friendly helpful staff who could not do enough to ensure your stay was perfect. Big comfortable beds, excellent bathrooms, free minibar with soft drinks and even an umbrella in the wardrobe in case it rains!  We do not normally bother with breakfast at the hotels we stay in, but the good food and efficient service meant we were happy to pay the extra.

Space in the room is slightly limited, we were upgraded to a superior double, but perfectly adequate for a weekend stay.  The evening bed turn down and a canister of ice was a nice touch and much appreciated.

Would we stay again - a definite yes!",5,2013,04,16
129,"Nicely located, modern - but room smelled","The staff was quite attentive but for my tase a little a bit too pushy. 
The room was decorated nicely and the furniture looks quite new. But there was a disturbing smell in the room (moist). The room towards the street was quite noisy.
The location is great and the hotel is surrounded by great little restaurants in a lovely area. The subway very close by.",3,2013,04,13
129,Style without Snobbery,"The dress code of the staff (Levis and crisp cotton shirts) reflects the attitude of this modern hotel; stylish but laid back, luxurious without being snooty. Without exception every member of staff we met was helpful and courteous both in the hotel area and restaurant, and we were made to feel very welcome. The location is great, with all the restaurants and bars of South Kensington outside the front door and it is a short hop from the tube station. The building has been beautifully restored and the decor is fabulous.
We had a superior double but the rooms are quite small; fine for a long weekend but it could be a little too cosy for a longer stay. With the wonderful high ceilings, I think our room may have been taller than it was wide! If the basic doubles are smaller they must be very cozy indeed. We booked this hotel on a great deal. If paying full price I would have expected a larger room, particularly for a superior. The room sizes are usually displayed on most booking websites, so be aware.
Overall I was very impressed with this hotel and its employees. If we saw a good deal I would stay at this hotel again.",4,2013,04,13
129,Book this one!,"Close to South Kensington Tube station, very safe area, lovely hotel. I stayed for 4 nights and on check-in I was told that I might want to change rooms since my room was small, but I thought I would check it out first. By London standards, my single room was not small! It had a double bed with big bouncy pillows and a tv with a little desk. There was coffee, tea and biscuits in the room, and the bathroom giveaways were too cute... there are even eye make-up remover towelettes! After a day, it felt like home.. and after pounding the streets, window-shopping, and doing some serious savings damage, it was lovely coming back to my ""little"" home.",5,2013,04,12
129,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed in The Ampersand for one night with my boyfriend a few weeks ago. When we arrived, although there had a been a leak or a problem with the hot water the night before, the staff were very pleasant and taking it all in their stride. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which was a very nice surprise. Although the room was not overly large, there was plenty of space for the both of us. The room itself was spotless, and there was a personalised welcome card and gift which was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable, and there were no noise disruptions even though our room faced onto the main road. 

The hotel is beautiful, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and calm. The location is brilliant- barely a two minute walk from the South Kensington tube station, and therefore very close to lots of museums and cafes. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,04,11
129,Highly recommended in superb location,"Great hotel in very good location close to the South Kensington tube. Nice modern rooms and fine breakfast vey well worth it's ¬£10.

The service is friendly and attentive.

A couple of Apple computers with free Internet (although free Wi-Fi is available as well), bar, games room etc. in the basement.",5,2013,04,11
129,"Great location, well-appointed","I was looking for an affordable but nice hotel in South Kensington, and The Ampersand was perfect. It's literally a two-minute walk from the Tube station (which is an easy regular-fare ride from Heathrow - cheaper and more direct than the pricier Heathrow Express). We arrived early, around noon, but our room was ready, and while it was small - which I was aware of when I booked it - it was truly charming. The decorators clearly figured out how to make the most of minimal space. Very well-appointed, with a kettle for tea, a heated floor in the bath, free juice and soft drinks in the mini fridge, and an extremely comfortable bed. Even the distant rumble of the Underground lent atmosphere - it was soothing, not intrusive. I would absolutely recommend The Ampersand to other travelers.",5,2013,04,10
129,Magic at the Ampersand,"Just returned from a week in London with a magical stay at the Ampersand.  This new boutique hotel lived up to its recent hype.  The rooms were beautiful and well appointed, right down to the rubber ducky for the bathtub and the Nespresso machine for the caffeine fix.  The staff is very welcoming and will attend to your every need.  Special thank you to Tommaso at the front desk who took great care of us.  In my opinion, this is now the only place to stay in London.  Loved it!",5,2013,04,09
129,Great location and gorgeous hotel,If you love boutique hotels this one is for you. It is the perfect location for events at the Royal Albert Hall and for visiting London's best museums. The decor in the hotel is gorgeous. The service is brilliant and a lot of attention has been paid to the little details. Loved my stay here!,5,2013,04,08
129,Brilliant!,"Simply great. 
Beautiful hotel, good location and great staff. Lovely tea room by the lobby and a very good restaurant downstairs. Stayed here before but this time my wife joined me. Nice walking distance to Harrods, V&A and a lot of nice cafes in the area.... 

The tube is right around the corner and there is a taxi stand just outside the door. Two stops from Victoria and a few more from Paddington.

129,Afternoon Tea @ The Drawing Rooms,"Came here with a friend for an Afternoon Tea, a deal booked through Lime & Tonic so was great value at ¬£16 per person. Really nice, relaxed setting. The cakes were good, though the scones could have done with being a lot fresher, they were quite dry and crumbly. 
Staff could have been a bit more attentive too, had to flag them down a few times to chase them for our champagne etc. But all in all a nice, chilled afternoon.",4,2013,04,08
129,Brilliant hotel in a great location,"Absolutely loved this restaurant. The staff were super friendly and the bar and two restaurants are lovely.

We were very kindly upgraded. The bed was huge and we had a great nights sleep. There are lots of nearby independant eatries if you want to eat near the hotel. 

Cannot fault it or the staff.",5,2013,04,08
129,Afternoon tea at The Drawing Rooms of the Ampersand Hotel,"Went and had afternoon tea with a group of girlfriends with 25% discount off the classical afternoon tea. We had a fantastic time. The decor of the drawing rooms very modern and chic, the sofa chairs comfy. Waiting staff were polite, attentive and courteous. There wasn't an extensive range of selection for teas like I've seen in other places but there was a nice variety from the ten or so to choose from. The sandwiches were served on a single layer of bread: smoke salmon with cream cheese, coronation chicken, ham and chutney, cheese and chutney. The scones were amazing! So soft and utterly deliciously with the clotted cream and jam. We were so stuffed by the end of it all. They were very kind to package the left over cakes for us. Would come back again.",5,2013,04,07
129,What you expect of a  5 star hotel,"Stayed for 4 night from 4-7 April 2013,Staffs at the reception is helpful and courteous. The bellboy was extremely helpful in explaining a few things I need to know on the room functions.

The tv remote control seems not functioning well and so does the aircon during my stay but it's a small thing.Room is a bit small but its Europe.The turndown were really appreciated and free minibar too. Breakfast seems decent enough and not extensive.

Overall, even though it's not like Ritz Carlton in Asia, it's a great hotel and deserved to be in the top list. Thanks a lot for making my days in London a memorable one.",4,2013,04,07
129,Couldn't Fault It,"I booked this hotel for 1 night for my boyfriends birthday as we were visiting the Royal Albert Hall. 

There is nothing bad I can say about this hotel. It's very well placed, right by South Ken. tube station and within walking distance of Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, museums etc etc. 

The hotel itself is beautiful, with very nice rooms and every little detail is stylish. We were given a free upgrade and the staff couldn't do enough to help. Good size room (I don't know what some people expect for their money in such an expensive area of London), very comfy bed, stylish and clean decor. 

They stay was very comfortable and we had breakfast the next day which was excellent standard too- although I did have to remind them I had paid for it already 2 or 3 times. 

We didn't use any other facilities but from the looks of it house keeping has anything you could possibly need, and I have no doubt that the staff would fulfill any of your needs. 

Ignore any bad reviews of this hotel I can do nothing but recommend it!",5,2013,04,06
129,Stylish in every way,"This was our second stay at the Ampersand and we'll be returning next time we stay in London. My favourite things in the hotel are the pictures in all the public areas, the quirky lights throughout, the amazing breakfast (make sure you try the banana bread) and the extremely comfortable beds.
Be sure to visit the loos on the LG floor to appreciate the wallpapers!
If you are a light sleeper ask for a rear facing room...or indulge in a couple of cocktails in Apero! The bar staff are brilliant and the cocktails are the best.",5,2013,04,06
129,Flawless (but ask for a rear facing room),"Just got back from a weeklong stay at this fantastic hotel in SouthKen, London. We had a deluxe room, and were able to secure a great deal on-line; book two nights, get the third night free. Came out to around L165/night. This is an outstanding value for the location and quality of the property. 
We arrived very early after a night flight from Brazil, and the staff had a room ready for us almost immediately. The reception area is small and modern with a pair of rooms off the reception area that are used for both light breakfast and afternoon tea. (There is a full restaurant downstairs that is quite good as well). 
Our room was spacious by London standards, with an extremely comfortable bed, linens and pillows. The bathroom is modern, rainshower head, black tile, impeccably clean and neat. Nice soft towels, robes and slippers. My wife thought the shampoo, soaps, etc. left a bit to be desired, but I found them to be perfectly adequate. There is a big flat screen TV that I think we turned on twice in the week we were there. The free wi-fi is accessible throughout the hotel and quite fast. In addition, they have a couple of iMacs down in the basement that can be accessed for free and there was never anyone using them. 
It was freezing in London during the last week in March, beginning of April, and the Ampersand was just such a warm and inviting place to come home to at the end of a busy day. It is about 50 meters from the SouthKen tube stop, with the District/Circle lines and Picadilly line. The V&A and Natural History Museums are both less than 500 meters away. There are several great eateries in the vicinity, namely Muriel's Kitchen next to the tube stop. No really decent pubs close by, but this is SouthKen, people.  
The staff is young, energetic, casually dressed (no hokey Beefeater doorman costumes) and eager to help. 
Literally the ONLY drawback was that our room, n¬∫ 308, overlooked Harrington, which is a fairly busy street with regular bus, car and foot traffic. It can get a bit noisy, so I would suggest either bringing ear-plugs or asking for a room facing the rear of the hotel. Obviously, the hotel is not to blame for street noise, so I give this property a solid 5 star rating. I have stayed at 4 different hotels in London, and I will never stay anywyere else from now on. 
Book it!",5,2013,04,05
129,"""A Great Find""","A girly trip to London in celebration of my Mother in Law's 80th birthday, The Ampersand completely exceeded my expectation. A stylish boutique hotel. Starting with a great location situated across the road from South Kensington Tube Station and in walking distance to places such as The Natural History Museum & The V & A. The staff of the hotel, and in particular, Indira & Thomas, were welcoming & attentive. The staff all work hard on giving a personal touch & nothing is too much bother. The rooms are well appointed, the beds very comfortable, the linen of excellent quality & everything is spotless - free WiFi too, which I personally appreciated. We ate one evening in the Apero Restaurant & the food was excellent. (& they serve great cocktails too!) All in all, I would highly recommend to the discerning traveller.",5,2013,04,05
129,Unique London hotel experience - at a great location and affordable price!,"Stayed two nights in a double room. Loved the hotel which is brand new with the latest techno-gadgets (iPhone docking, electronic AC, speakers from tv/music in the bathroom).

Fantastic location just by south ken tube.

Double room was tiny, OK for one person, but definitely booking superior or deluxe room next time!",4,2013,04,04
129,"Nice hotel, good location, very friendly staff","Why should you stay here?
Very friendly and efficient staff
Nice contemporary feel
The free Wi-Fi works fine
Good location, with the tube next door.
They do all the basics well: comfy bed, good shower, spotless clean 

Keep in mind:
Rooms are indeed rather small
Gym is ok but no daylight and small
Price levels in line with what to expect in London

Sure will come back",5,2013,04,04
129,Well worth considering this hotel,"I booked 2 rooms in this hotel for 3 adults. I chose this hotel because of its location and, for London and overall quality, a competitive price. 

We arrived at 1pm and were checked-in by an efficient and friendly receptionist. The reception was very busy and a lesser man would have been flustered so I was impressed.  Even better, our rooms were ready for us straight away, ie before official check-in time. 

We had booked 'standard' rooms, but we were fortunate to be given an up-grade on one of the rooms. Both rooms were small, the standard being really very small.  This was no surprise and was reflected in the price paid. My group only slept in the rooms so the size did not matter. It might matter if you had a big bag or were staying for more than two or three nights. 

The hotel rooms were attractively decorated and in new, immaculate condition. They were spotlessly clean. I asked for rooms at the back of the hotel, away from road noise and on a high floor, away from the vague rumble of the underground train. I'm glad I did this. 

The public rooms are also very attractive. We had tea-time snacks and a sandwich type lunch in the sitting room area off reception. We had breakfast and dinner in the basement restaurant. Service was efficient and friendly in both areas.  The price of food and drinks in both the sitting room and dining room were perfectly reasonable, standard UK prices. These areas were buzzy but not horribly crowded. 

I think the staff deserve a special mention. They were friendly, efficient and helpful to a fault, not necessarily what you expect in London. This hotel would not be anywhere nearly as good with less well trained and pleasant people running it. 

All-in all, I would definitely stay here again, and in one of their 'standard' little rooms. This hotel is good quality, in a very good location (recommended for single women), with really nice friendly, efficient staff, at an affordable price. The trade off is the teeny-weeny little  room and I'm happy with this.",4,2013,04,02
129,Pretty Good but........,"We stayed for 4 nights over Easter.  The hotel is very clean, comfortable and all the team we came in to contact with were polite and helpful.  The hotel is in a great location for Knightsbridge shopping, V&A and Natural History Museum.  South Kensington Tube Station is just outside as is a handy cab rank.

The rooms are small (or at least ours was and I had upgraded to a Deluxe so can't imagine what a Standard room is like) the plumbing is noisy and the doors bang constantly.  You can also feel the tube passing under the building (vibration) which continues until around midnight.  Obviously ( and no fault of the hotel) it can be noisy on the front with constant traffic well in to the early hours.

If the hotel was promoted as 4 star at ¬£120 - 180 per night I would have given full marks however it was sold to me as a 5 star hotel charging ¬£250 per night+, over ¬£400 for a suite. There is no lounge as such to sit in and relax, (The Drawing Room is small and open to the public for tea / lunch etc and so is constantly busy and you feel very unwelcome unless you order food or drink).

The gym is small but adequate and the small library and games room a nice touch.

There does not appear to be a B&B rate available on their website that includes full breakfast only continental and whilst this was very nice with great choice the A la Carte menu is over priced - you could easily spend an additional ¬£30 per couple to upgrade your breakfast to include hot items - I'm not mean but I refuse to pay ¬£6 for an egg!!! 

Overall comfortable, clean and well run but pricey for what they actually offer you.",4,2013,04,01
129,Birthday treat,Stayed here recently with friends for my birthday and had a great time.  The rooms are small but perfectly formed with lots of great features.  We had a deluxe room and the bed was very comfortable.  Breakfast was really good with a great choice available on both continental and cooked.  All staff are very friendly and approchable and even the workmen helped me when I couldn't get into my room.  Located very close to South Kensington tube and all the museums are right behind the hotel.,5,2013,03,31
129,London Elegant & Soft,"It's a real elegant and soft contemporary hotel. Personnel is very efficient and home feeling is perfect at tea time. Nice breakfast and wine area at lower ground floor. You will appreciate it.
Deluxe Studio is the perfect quality for value target. Deluxe Room is good too.
Very close to South Kensington Station.",5,2013,03,28
129,Fab London Hotel,"We spent 5 perfect nights at the Ampersand in March 2013.  We absolutely loved the hotel, gorgeous design, efficient layout and impeccable staff.  The caf√© and the Drawing Rooms were perfect for quick meals and afternoon tea.  It is wonderfully located in South Kensington just by the Tube Station, so exploring all of London is easy.  We absolutely will be returning on our next trip to London.",5,2013,03,25
129,Just perfect,"This is a great hotel; great service - not fussy but always attentive and nothing too much trouble; great location - near South Kensington Tube (35 mins to Heathrow), lots of restaurants nearby, and three World class museums; beautiful design and newly refurbished and oh so comfortable!

We will be back!",5,2013,03,24
129,"Class, Comfort, and Style",I used to stay frequently at the Grosvenor Hotel because of its proximity to the museums and South Ken tube station.  The staff were helpful and attentive but the decor had seen better decades.  I looked forward to staying in the new Ampersand following renovations.  The similarities are only two:  the address and a staff that is even more welcoming and helpful.  The new decor is clean and modern.  The furnishings are beautiful and the comfort of the bed matches exceeds any hotel I have ever stayed in.  My experience which was in December could not have been better and I have a new favorite hotel in London.,5,2013,03,23
129,A great mother-daughter stay,"My 22 year old daughter and I just returned from London and a 5 night stay in the double superior room at the &. We loved the design of this new artsy, well-appointed and luxurious hotel.  Our room at the & was a good size and very quiet; the bathroom was spacious with everything we needed.  The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.  Breakfast was delicious.  The hotel is very close to the South Kensington station and we used the underground easily to go to all points around London. The hotel is in walking distance of two great museums (The Natural History and Victoria and Albert - great fashion and jewelry exhibits), and to delicious Ben's Cookies and nice local eateries. We could not have asked for more from this wonderful stay at the &.  A memorable time.",5,2013,03,21
129,Has potential but some kinks...,"Arrived New Year's Day early am, which made me nervous and I had emailed the hotel prior requesting early check in due to our early flight arrival.  I was told there would be no guarantee but hoping for the best.

Upon arriving, at about 10:30am, we were told the room was not yet ready and it was vacant but needed to be cleaned and would be ready at noon for check in (which is their check in time).  We stayed in the lobby and crashed on the couch.  After us, I noticed another couple waiting too.  At noon, I went to the front desk and was told the room was not ready.  I could not understand why when it was just due a cleaning,  Certainly an hour and a half is enough time.  Obviously this wasn't the case - at that time I would have expected them to offer us a snack or drink in the restaurant where we went to eat in the hotel to kill time for another 45 minutes, but that was not the case.  Once checked in i was not going to let this bother me but share my experience for future bookers.

We had a Jr Suite which was very spacious, corner unit.  Heated floors in the bathroom were a plus with the 30 degree weather.  Bed was good, sheets & towels good quality too. The not so good was the thinness of the walls and the noise.  You could hear people when they were walking above & the floor made alot of creaking noises.  Windows didn't seem very isolated either.

Lobby had great area for tea, champagne and goodies - this was a plus.

Considering all, I would book again as long as it was on promotion (as we booked on promo).  I think rate was about $420 in US dollars, which was high for what we got but understand London is very costly and our dollar is worth less.",4,2013,03,20
129,"As good as it gets. Great value, perfect location, top notch staff","Stop browsing, start booking.

I spend 30-50 nights/year in hotels, and can confidently say that The Ampersand is one of the best hotels I've ever experienced.

I used to live in Kensington (lucky me) and was looking to stay in the area on a recent business trip to London. Ampersand was within my budget (about $250 over the weekend) and stylish. I like the staff's vest (or waistcoat as the Brits call them), tie and jeans look so much that I may adopt it as my own personal style.

Only complaint would be the lack of clothing storage space, but I had a small (ie: cheap) room and I'm guessing the bigger rooms might have more space. This issue is also fairly commonplace in London.

Location is perfect for exploring the museums, Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington and Chelsea, as well as being reasonably close to Westminster and Notting Hill as well.

London's best Spanish restaurant, Casa Brindisa, is right around the corner. Make reservations. There are unfortunately no truly good pubs in the immediate area (the Hoop & Toy is garbage), but the Anglesea Arms is a 10 minute walk away and is as Kensington as it gets. For another nice walk try to seek out Kynance Mews, which might be the most charming little street in London.",5,2013,03,20
129,"Gorgeous Hotel,Great Staff and Great location!","My mother, sister and I stayed at the Ampersand Hotel in South Kensington in February. We loved it!! The Hotel is in a great location,with gorgeous cafes, eateries,and museums at your feet. The Ampersand also has a gorgeous tea room and restaurant within the hotel .

The hotel is lovely, beautiful interiors and fabulous staff who were very helpful! I would definitely recommend staying at this place for anyone who likes a little luxury at an affordable price. 

I will definitely be back there each time I'm in London !",5,2013,03,19
129,What is not to like about Ampersand?,"I went for the ""stay two nights and get the third free"" offer. Considering how expensive London is, it was a very good deal as hotel is new, staff helpful and friendly, mattresses relatively firm (have real problems with soft mattresses but even in 5 star hotels in London, mattresses tend to be too soft...not worth paying a small fortune for a bad back the next morning!), delicious breakfast in the restaurant in the basement (fresh organic items) and a tea lounge to die for at reception level. Rooms have different themes and different configurations. My room was almost perfect except for the extreme tiny closet and lack of more lighting as curtains and headboard were of an amazing deep navy velour. I loved the walk in shower instead of the customary shower and bath unit commonly found in most hotels in London. Bathroom amenities were top notch and generously replaced. Difficult to resist the blue rubber ducks...home now with me! Decor and details definitely worth a mention (cheerful, whimsy and a good eye for smart colour schemes). Hope it stays as clean and well maintained. One area of improvement would be a porter stationed at the entrance to help guests with their luggages...some steps to negotiate if luggage heavy. Neighbourhood comes with a tube station right next door and a short walk to Fulham Rd. (buzzing with shops and restaurants). If Ampersand's rates remain as friendly and maintenance is not compromised, guests will want to go back. I would!",5,2013,03,19
129,Business stay,"It seems I am in London frequently, this time staying at the Ampersand Hotel for 4 nights.  The hotel was chosen with its status and the amenities in mind.

Firstly, a very pleasant hotel, the room I chose (Deluxe Studio Room) was excellent, well furnished and tastefully decorated - with ample space and functional areas.  It seems the room i was allocated had a bath in the room - very elegant and I am sure if not a business trip then a 'modern' and excellent feature.
The bathroom, cupboard spaces were very good and there was a Nespresso machine (very much to my liking) and free soft drinks.

I did not take breakfast as early to work, but i did eat in the Apero restaurant a couple of time - both choices 'lamb' and 'pork' dishes were very good and a good portion size.  Room service menu was very limited but you could use Apero (during restaurant opening times)

Front desk and concierge were very efficient, they were courteous and helpful.
I used the internal laundry service - functional and 24hour turn around - though I did struggle with language barrier.

The surrounding area has a number of restaurants and a couple of bars, it is literally 100 yards from South Kensington tube entrance and on a relatively quite road - room noise was minimal from the road.

Free wifi was a welcome, though I did find the service a little slow for work purposes

Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would consider another business stay at the hotel.  I would also consider the hotel as a tourist and it is very close to a number of excellent museums and attractions.

I will book again.",4,2013,03,19
129,Great hotel and fantastic food,After spending 2 nights at The Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge we tried out the Ampersand in South Kensington for one night. We were happy to get an upgrade to a suite - lovely furnished  2 rooms (with balcony) with a small kitchen including nespresso coffee maker. Nice bathroom with a lot of amenities (liked the little ducks!). We enjoyed a good continental breakfast in the drawing room. Perfect atmosphere. The service is very friendly and professionell (much better than in the Berkeley). In the evening we decided to have dinner in the Apero- which was one of our best ideas. Being fans of good and high quality food we were more than surprised. We loved it! Especially the straciatella cheese with chilli tomato sauce. We will come again.,5,2013,03,19
129,Cramped,"If you are lucky you will get a nice room with sofa, armchair and some space.
If you are unlycky you will get a minimal duobleroom with no furniture and the TV on the wall.
Dont expect to have the room displayed on the web. I didnt.
I know rooms are small in London but for this price and a doubleroom I expect more.",2,2013,03,19
129,"Great staff, good hotel","We really enjoyed our visit to the Ampersand, and could't fault anything about this hotel! The highlights for me were: the best martini I've ever had, in the Apero bar; the heated bathroom floor; and our room service breakfast (good value and delicious). However, it was the excellent and friendly customer service that really made our stay!",4,2013,03,18
129,The bed and the lobby bar,The Ampersand Hotel is superbly located by South Kensington tube station. The staff are very friendly and efficient but for me two things really stood out. Firstly the bar in the lobby is a lovely place to relax either with afternoon tea or early evening beers - great continental atmosphere and comfy chairs. Secondly the bed. If you are a fan of massive incredibly comfortable beds with crisp bed linen that almost anaesthetises you to sleep - and if not you are strange - then I would suggest that getting up in the morning will become a challenge on a par with trying not to eat a cake in the lobby bar. We stayed in a deluxe room - 3 for 2 at present on their website - Kensington has always been a lovely place and this is the perfect addition.,5,2013,03,18
129,FRESH BRIT STYLE,"In the well known district of South Ken, this is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for a classic British style hotel with a fresh touch of design.
The hotel is located 2 min walking from the tube station, very handy if you are reaching the city centre from Heathrow airport with the Piccadilly line.
The rooms are very clean, stylish and design for fitting all what you need during your stay, whether it is for pleasure or business. The bathroom are very chic with many more amenities than standards and displayed in a very posh way, but the very best feature is the heated tiled floor - WOW!

The staff are very friendly and helpful at all times. Highly recommended I will back for sure",5,2013,03,17
129,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff,"Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff. We did have a couple of minor issues not long after checking in. However these were efficiently dealt with which exceeded our expectations and it would be difficult to fault the hotel. Breakfast is by far the best we have had at any hotel in London. Fresh fruit and the variety of homemade breads and granolas were our favourite choices. Coffee was excellent. Rooms although on the small side are lovely and well decorated. Beds are extremely comfortable. Plenty of nice touches in the rooms to set this hotel aside from others - free mini bar soft drinks, decent tea and coffee, umbrella and plenty of toiletries to name a few. We were on the 4th floor and did not have any noise issues at all as noted by some other reviewers. All of the staff were very polite and professional and went out of their way to ensure your stay was perfect. Upon checking out the bell boy was not available to help me with my bags so one of the lads on reception volunteered - something I do not think you would experience in many other hotels. We will definitely be back.....",5,2013,03,17
129,One on my new favorite hotels in London,"Beautiful modern rooms, great location in London. Wonderful food and hotel restaurant.  Loved the restaurant staff. I ate there every morning for 5 days and they get to know you and your preferences.  I was upgraded on check-in as I belong to the SLH program.  My room was superb.  I had a great week there.

However, the hotel has some teething problems.  Nothing major but annoyances.  I had to call housekeeping almost every day for something. Towels not replaced. Carpet not vacuumed appropriately.  Items not replaced from the mini kitchen.  Confusion between room service and housekeeping on who was to do what here.  My phone wasn't working and called that in.  When I got home at night, it wasn't fixed and the desk person told me he was sorry but they had been very busy that day with flight cancellations.  Seriously was that an appropriate response?.  A repair man came up to repair and ultimately replace the phone in the evening when I was trying to relax.
At checkout - I noticed that the rate was different for several days. I told them when I booked through SLH, I had only been given one rate.  The front desk manager didn't handle this professionally and said it was what is was.  It may have been an issues with SLH booking, but I felt i was in an argument in front of other customers.  Eventually, he removed the fluctuating rate. It was such a small amount but he made the process uncomfortable and I left the hotel with a bad taste.  I asked him to email my bill to me.  I never received the email. I then emailed twice and eventually my bill was emailed to me.

So in summary.  Wonderful hotel.  Small issues that are easy to fix.  I will definitely return though and recommend this hotel.",4,2013,03,17
129,"Very good hotel, good location","Delighted to have found the Ampersand, as we are in London quite frequently. I love the location in South Kensington, very handy and we found parking nearby. The staff in the hotel were excellent, professional but still very easy going and welcoming. Our room was modern and comfortable. The hotel also has a cosy area to sit and have tea after shopping. 
If you want to relax and go to a local place for a late breakfast, the area is ideal. We went to Muriel's across the road which was great. We really enjoyed our night at the Ampersand and will go back in the next few weeks.",5,2013,03,16
129,Nice but room for improvement - noise issues,"This is a good hotel in theory and has a lot of potential.
The hotel enjoys a good location, good rooms, new and relatively crisp, also it's nice that they offer the minibar soft drinks for free.
That said, the elevator is incredibly loud, it sounds like there's a power drill in the other room. This might only be in the top 2 floors. The doors are also very loud when they open and close, and this is quite annoying when it's room service loudly opening and closing the doors in the early morning on a weekend. Finally, the blue LED lights inside the room for the control units shines very brightly also disturbing sleep.
Finally, staff has attitude, the hotel is getting a lot of business, but recommended to tone the attitude down a bit.",2,2013,03,16
129,Very nice hotel in a perfect location,"Quiet, elegant, clean and very comfy Hotel in a great location. Rooms (and bathroom!) on the smaller end but roomy high ceiling and generous bed-size in excellent quality. Very friendly and professional staff, in-room coffee and tea facilities. Free softdrinks (and beer!)",5,2013,03,16
129,& then there is The Ampersand Hotel,"Having just arrived back in the States yesterday from London I felt the urgency to write about my experience holding a meeting for 15 delegates at the Ampersand. From the moment we arrived at the hotel I felt that I made the correct choice. The staff(Tracy and crew) that greeted us not only were friendly but quite proud of the facility & as we were to find out over the course of the next two days had every reason to be proud.  The rooms while not large were wonderfully appointed.  The lobby offers a very nice sitting area off to the right to have coffee or tea or lovely pastries.  The meeting rooms were perfect for our group of 15, our CMO remarked that he never wanted to leave.  We arranged for a dinner in the room and the meal was spectacular with the restaurant manger himself(Joseph) tended the bar and treating us to incredible cocktails focusing on gin.  The lunch served during the meeting was a far cry from typical offerings at meetings where your palate is never challenged, at the Ampersand the attitude seems to be try your very best at all times.  
  The delegates that attended felt privileged to have been invited after the way that they had been treated.
  & you will not check out with the feeling that one can and often does at a large chain hotel that you will be forgotten as you walk out the door.  I cannot wait to get back to London.
  Side note hotel is very near to the South Kensington station",5,2013,03,15
129,Happiness in a hotel,"This is an extremely pleasant hotel.  All clean and new and the single (which has a double bed - yeah!) is comfortable, luxurious, and well thought out. Great bed and linens, TV has lots of channels, the plugs and outlets all make sense.  The closet space is tiny but the amenities and the fantastic bathroom makes up for it all.  Nice amenities and the staff is excellent.  Near South Kensington station makes transportation a breeze.",5,2013,03,14
129,"Hospitality&Decor, Location&More","What's not to love about the Ampersand Hotel? I stayed there for five nights in March & had an absolutely wonderful stay. The staff could not be more welcoming or accommodating -- friendly & attentive, but always professional. The decor is a fetching take on traditional English quirkiness, with bold patterns & bright colors, mixed with classic British accents. My superior queen room was more than adequate, with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in: bliss! The bathroom was large, bright, & spotlessly clean. The location can't be beat: diagonally across from the South Kensington tube station, just steps from cafes, boutiques, The Victoria & Albert Museum and an easy walk to Knightsbridge. The Drawing Room is a lovely spot to rest with a glass of champagne or a cup of tea before heading off for a night on the town. I've found my new London home. Can't wait to return!",5,2013,03,14
129,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights this past weekend and were not disappointed. We were originally looking at staying with one of the big chains to get points but none had good reviews. After looking at the reviews of this hotel I booked it straightaway. I completely agree with the other posters, the staff are really helpful and friendly. Before I even booked I called to ask which rooms had kingsize beds (as my bf is very tall) and the male receptionist gave me very detailed information. I knew then that I was making the right choice. 

I booked a Deluxe room B&B. The room wasn't too small for London and I only had carry-on luggage, I think if you had big suitcases you'd struggle to put them away. The room looked exactly as it does on the website so didn't disappoint. I loved the heated bathroom floors, especially that it was 1 degree outside! Continental breakfast was lovely and we ordered additional hot food from downstairs. 

Would definitely recommend and would stay again.",5,2013,03,13
129,OUTSTANDING,"From the moment you enter the Ampersand we were in good hands! The Hotel is beautifully decorated/furnished and the staff can't do enough to help!  The bedrooms are spacious and beautifully appointed, the food was excellent and have I enthused about the staff already? We were celebrating a 40th birthday out that evening & we returned at 3am with a few friends and were allowed to use the Games room to share a last drink. No trouble at all.

Stayed for 2 nights in the end and WILL be returning.  Stay here and check it out for yourself. Ask to be shown around and just enjoy!",5,2013,03,13
129,Relaxing weekend,"Fantstic hotel, great location, friendly attentive staff and comfy bedrooms.  Would recommend highly.  The food in the Apero was lovely and the service was great.  Cocktails worth a try too. South Kensington tube stop right by so travelling about very easy.",5,2013,03,13
129,5 star Boutique hotel in South Kensington,"I always look for boutique hotels in London that can offer personal treatment and unique details that makes my stay different than staying in big chain hotels where you are just a number. I found the Ampersand after reading great reviews on Trip Advisor and the reviews could not be more accurate.  This is a great option in South Kensignton located just couple steps from the South Kensington tube station and in an area full of cafes and restaurants and lot of people walking around.  It is a great place to stay away from the busy and tourist areas of Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus, etc... but still very close to all of that.  The Ampersand offers all the luxury you need in great style.  The hotel is very modern in a beautiful building and the rooms offer all high end details you will need to have a great stay.  The bathroom was amazing filled with high end toiletries and the shower was spectacular.  Just one thing to keep in mind: the standard room is very very small even for London standards.  I would not recommend that option for a couple since you won‚Äôt be able to accommodate your luggage.  The superior room which was around 50 pounds extra was way bigger, had a king size bed and lots of space for luggage. Also, make sure you ask for a room that is not facing Harrington Road since it is a very busy road and even with the windows closed you can hear street noise on your room.  Finally, had a little issue with the heat control in the room and complained at the check out and got 50 pounds off my bill for the inconvenience.  That is what I call great customer service.",5,2013,03,12
129,It's a new London Hotel.,"We stayed for two nights over a weekend. 
Being a member of SLH we were upgraded on arrival to a room on the ground floor and on the front of the Hotel, I asked if it would be noisey and the receptionist was very honest and said, yes it can be during the week but at weekends not usually too bad. We accepted we were in London and some noise is un avoidable.

However the underground noise was perhaps the thing we were not expecting and is certainly an issue for ground floor rooms.

The room it's self had really hight ceilings and huge windows, the bed was extremely comfortable, everything else functional.
The bathroom was a little dissappointing, two large monsoon shower heads and a tacky shower curtain which had no function, the room was set up as a wet room and basically flooded when you used the showers making the use of the othe facilities, basin and toilet, a rather damp expereince.

The Apero Bar and Restaurant, for us really good, very reasonable prices and excellent service and quality, having said that I noticed one previous comment about the breakfast buffet and choice of milks etc, this is the case but one thing I can add is that everything on the buffett table was really fresh and anything we asked for that was not clearly visible was brought to us, for instance there are no juices on display but are available on request.

The Drawing room and games room etc on the steet level are really nice, light spacious areas, the service again is really good, I could not really work out why the bar was not on this level as the waiter seemed to have to run downstairs everytime a alcoholic drink was ordered.

Overall, yes we would return, we found the Hotel situated really well, with very pleasant and friendly staff.",4,2013,03,12
129,Wonderful location! Wonderful hotel!,"Having just returned home from London, I have found the hotel that I WILL return to in the city! When visiting London we have always tried to stay in different areas of the city.  This, by far, is my favorite location and hotel! The hotel is located literally across the street from the South Kensington Underground Station (Circle, District, and Piccadilly lines). We arrived in London via King's Cross Train Station.  The cab ride to the hotel was 15 pounds. Harrod's, Harvey Nichol's, Burberry, Sloane Square, etc, are all within walking distance.  The Victoria and Albert Museum (a great place for lunch!) is one block away... as are other museums. The hotel itself is staffed with very friendly, helpful and competent personal.  The rooms are lovely and very clean.  The bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathrooms were stocked with lovely toiletries, plush towels bathrobes and slippers.  The floors in the bathroom have radiant heat. The refrigerator is stocked with complimentary, water, juice, Coca Cola, and milk. Tea and Coffee are also available.  Our room was on the front side of the hotel on the second floor.  We did not find it too noisy.  However, we were there on a Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday night. Another plus, if you choose to take the Big London Tour Bus, it stops right outside the front door of the hotel. After going to a show on the West End, we caught a cab back to the hotel for about 14 pounds. The hotel staff arranged for a car and driver to take us to the airport. That costs 45 pounds. (Well worth it in our minds.)
Just a little interesting note... I looked up the word Ampersand. Ampersand is a noun for the sign ""&"". I learned something new!",5,2013,03,11
129,Great Stay Great Location,"We just arrived from a wonderful stay at the Ampersand Hotel. The hotel is very new and has lovely interiors. Our executive room wasn't very big, but had enough room for us to move around and the decoration was realy nice too. The bathroom was spacious and the in bath TV was a highlight. Breakfast was very good as for the food we had one evening at the hotel restaurant. The room service menu is quite limited, so it works only if you're so tired you can't afford to go out. There are many good restaurants in the area. It's also conveniently located just across South kensington tube station, witch is great.
I would gladly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,03,10
129,Fantastic stay at the Ampersand,"Stayed for one night mid week with my husband for a theatre trip. Booked the Ampersand after reading the great reviews here, and we weren't disappointed. We were upgraded on arrival (I got the impression this was something they try to do with first time visitors, obviously keen to make a good impression!). Check in was quick and the staff were lovely. Room was great - decent size for London and well equipped. We also ordered room service, and it was a real treat to find something on the menu that  my ultra fussy husband would eat other than a cheese sandwich (this is EXTREMELY rare!). Food was lovely, as was breakfast which we had in our room.

Overall a fantastic stay, and we will definitely return!",5,2013,03,08
129,Contemporary & Lovely,"My husband and I spent a few days at the Ampersand when we first moved to London. It is located close to South Kensington station and it is surrounded by many restaurants and bars. The hotel was recently renovated and the decor is absolutely wonderful. The bed was cozy and we appreciated the complimentary mini bar drinks. The air conditioning is rather high tech and can be a bit inconsistent if you don't know how to work it properly. Americans may find the rooms small, but this is London and they all are!",4,2013,03,08
129,Great welcome in South Kensington,"Booked The Ampersand after reading reviews and assessing against similar ratings/cost. Spoke to the front desk team on booking - great customer service. Was upgraded on arrival. Lovely room, good facilities & fresh milk in fridge. Warm welcome from the staff. Was at front of hotel (3rd floor) so did get traffic noise but did not detract from a good stay. Would recommend and will return. Great bars and restaurants on the doorstep and few steps from museums..",4,2013,03,07
129,I just loved this boutique hotel,"I booked this place, just because when I saw the website and pictures over the internet, I knew it was going to be a match :-)
The place is just gorgeous, the service excellent and we had a chance to taste the food at the fancy restaurant downstairs : surprisingly simple and great taste.
They serve natural wines too, what we really enjoyed.
Excellent location, next to the South Kensington underground station and close to Hyde Park and High Street Kensington.",5,2013,03,05
129,"few teething problems, not 5 star","we chose this boutique hotel based on the great reviews on trip advisor. The hotel is 5 star and situated right outside South Kensington tube station which gives it an advantage over some of the other 5 star hotels in the vicinity.
The hotel was immaculately presented both in the communal areas and inside the room however, a few hours after checking in the cracks started to show...
there was no directory in our room to advise on services/costs etc. i found myself having to telephone concierge with every question, instead of having the information available.
The iron in the room was shocking, like an Asda smart price, my husband found it impossible to iron his shirt! the light switch in the bathroom was an open socket with electric wires hanging out. we didnt know the mini bar was free until we checked out and i asked for the bill...again because we didnt have any information in the room!
The breakfast was terrible, with little choice on the buffet. There was no fish available, my hot chocolate was luke warm and i had to send it back, the sausages were of standard cafe quality and there wasnt even a choice of milk for the cereal. The milk that was there wasnt labelled so i had no idea if it was semi/full etc. Surely this is basic stuff for even a 3 star hotel?
i must add that we did mention about the directory when we checked out and we were told that they were aware of a few rooms without one?! oh well thats helpful thanks! overall i would like to return to this hotel to see whether they have improved on the basics, and whether we were just unlucky on our visit.",3,2013,03,04
129,Wonderful stay. Have already recommended to friends.,"My husband and I spent a long weekend vacationing in London and chose the Ampersand based on the excellent Tripadvisor reviews. I was concerned that the small double room might be too small so I emailed the hotel. The person who responded,  √âadao√≠n, was extremely helpful! We selected the small double and requested a room located in a quiet area. The room was small but beautifully appointed and it was fine for the 2 of us. Noise was not an issue at all. The bed was very comfortable. Loved the radiant floor in the beautiful bathroom and also room key\lights out feature. My husband and I enjoyed cocktails in the bar. Wish I could remember what was in mine, it was delicious. I know it was pink and had grapefruit. Wide variety of eateries in the neighborhood and easy access to the Underground to get downtown or to the airport. Also enjoyed the ping pong table and the gym. Would definitely stay again and have already recommended to friends.",5,2013,03,03
129,Fab hotel,Fabulous boutique hotel for all the sights in this area. Extremely close to the underground. Some excellent restaurants close by.  Delicious cocktails in bar with uber comfortable bar stools as you watch them being made.  This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in and a very reasonable price for this wonderful area.,5,2013,03,03
129,"Ampersand is definitely ""and, and, and....""","This is a fabulous hotel.  The interior main areas and hallways with their whimsical wallpaper is worth the stay.  Comfortable and interesting rooms, wonderfully professional staff (a rarity these days) and a truly interesting restaurant and bar - Apero, couldn't have been happier.  The terrific location was a bonus.",5,2013,03,01
129,Best good value hotel in Central London with a huge heart,"Ampersand does everything right.  Best location in Central London.  The service is friendly and impeccable.  I was there for a few days in January and fell so ill I couldn't leave the room.  Called and asked for paracetamol and didn't leave the room for two days.  On checking out, the young man who brought me the paracetamal saw me at check out and came to ask if I was feeling better.  That is truly golden customer service.",5,2013,03,01
129,A True Luxury Experience in a Boutique Setting,"Too many so called Boutique describe themselves as 5* but simply fail to deliver in terms of service and well.. ""luxury""
The Ampersand does though in spades!! The rooms feel more spacious that they are due to immaculate interior design and outstanding equipment. From the jogging maps on the AV system to the rubber duck in the shower...the well chosen complimentary book by the bedside to the duck down pillows. This place get the room priorities right - an yes Miller Harris toiletries!!
Add to this a chef in the Spanish themed restaurant who is seriously ambitious and will be a future star of the future and staff that cant do enough for you and its a a London gem in SWK that is hard to beat. Go now whilst the promotional rates make a stay here the best deal in London!",5,2013,02,28
129,"Fantastic location, good hotel","This hotel is 100 yards from South Kensington tube station. It's on the Piccadilly, District and circle line. The area is brilliant for access to the museums and has local shops bars and restaurants. It is a fantastic location.
We stayed one night, a Saturday. I informed the hotel by email a few days ahead that we would arrive early and hoped it might be possible to check in early. They didn't commit themselves.
On arrival they were expecting us and our room was ready. We were able to check in at noon and that soooo simplified our weekend as we were going to Twickenham for the rugby so were able to change etc before heading out.
The room was quite small with just a large shower but for one night quite OK. If I was staying longer I would probably upgrade to a larger room.
The hotel is very new and nicely modernised, in fact very modern, something I like.
The bed was very comfortable so a good nights sleep on the first night in a hotel is often elusive, but not at the Ampersand. It was quiet and very comfortable.
Room rate was similar to lots of London hotels, ¬£204.
Overall I can strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,02,27
129,South Kensington Gem,"Beautifully presented and brilliantly located. Delightful lounge serving delicious cakes. Comfortable beds. The only downside is the tiny room we had but it was adequate for one night's stay. I would recommend this hotel but book a larger room for a longer stay.
      ",4,2013,02,27
129,"Well located, beautifully decorated and helpful friendly staff","We stayed at The Ampersand for a wedding anniversary 3 night stay and a big birthday. The staff were most helpful and trendily dressed in jeans and waistcoats. The entrance reception and drawing room are beautifully decorated in a refreshing modern but comfortable style and we were very pleased with the deluxe superior room with balcony. Albeit a smaller than preferred functional bathroom, the water was always hot, the towels and robes good quality.  The free wifi was a well received bonus and the huge tv screen made watching a few films and the rugby a pleasure. We struggled with the room service a little (only because things were forgotten) and there were a few minor irritations (no place to sit and dry long hair or do makeup, no sound to the bathroom tv and a lightbulb missing) - all in all we were delighted and we would definitely choose to stay here again with the same great offer. Within minutes of arriving in the room we were treated to two glasses of champagne and a chocolate written plate saying ""Happy Birthday"" and a small cake with a candle. Very nice touch after our tiring journey. The bed was really comfortable with good quality linen & the balcony which we had was nice to use. We always take room service breakfast and after the first morning we forgot about all the extras (shame there were no fresh croissants) and just took juice coffee and toast as we were eating out for lunch. There is fresh coffee, cafetiers, a nespresso machine and fridge with complementary soft drinks. We had several meals out locally, all within a ¬£5/6 cab fare distance. Staying over in Mayfair always irritates when paying expensive cab fares back to the hotel when shopping on Kings road and Knightsbridge so we kept our restaurants in the surrounding areas and had it not been such a cold weekend we would have walked to more destinations during the day. We had a fabulous weekend and although we declined the offer of a free upgrade to a suite, I'd like to thank the duty manager for offering this as it was a very nice gesture but for our last night I couldn't be bothered to move everything. The house champagne is Mo√´t (by the glass ¬£11) and hopefully they will soon stock a choice of beer for room service besides the Italian beer. The tweaks are so small to make this probably one of my all time favourites for a relaxed smart casual weekend hotel in town. The staff made our visiting family feel very welcome.",5,2013,02,26
129,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I spent a week here while we worked in London.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and serves a fantastic high tea.  We had a great time.  However, we initially opted for the cheapest room and had to upgrade due to the size.  There was literally no place to open up our suitcases other than the bed.",4,2013,02,26
129,WOW !,"Just came home from a weekend in London and we had booked two deluxe rooms - when we arrived at the hotel and entered the lobby area we just - WOW ! Cool ! Very nice. New, trendy, and Ingo Maurers bird nest lamps from cellar to top floor inthe staircase. Cool, trendy but yet very classic british ! 
30 secs walk to South Ken tube st. 10 min to Harrods and Kings road/ fulham rd and all shops you can dream of.
Afterenoon tea in the Drawing rooms at the hotel - so cool !
Rooms : Clean, warm, very tasty furnished - bathroom superb ! No problem with hot water ( have had that before in other London hotels )
Price - i think the price is very good - when you see what you get : location, a new hotel - trendy - and it is in the Small leading hotel of the world - club !
 - super service from all people we encountered working there!
This is my only hotel in London in now and in the future !
Thanks :-)",5,2013,02,26
129,An Ampersand with punctuation errors,"The Ampersand is situated very nicely in South Kensington - the subway station no more than two walking minutes away, and with Hyde park, several museums and just generally a very nice area in walking distance. The design of the hotel welcomes visitors - it is neither over-designed and sterile, nor too baroque. In the midst of the stairs (which of course one does not have to use) rises a pole with lights similar to an evergreen Christmas tree. The general hotel staff also does their best to make one feel at home - our pre-booked wish to have an upstairs room was followed with no problems.

While the rooms (we had a Superior Room) are not the most spacious and would be challenging for people with many and/or larger suitcases, their overall appeal is very polished, clean and warm. (Perhaps too warm, we'll get to that later.) The bathroom features two showers - one from above, one with a handle -, and the room is equipped with everything one expects in a hotel of this price category, including complementary non-alcoholic hot and cold drinks, a nice television including external audio and video connectors, a smartphone charger and an oh-so-comfy bed.

The climate control unit for the room looks very modern, but the room unfortunately was heated very inconsistently, meaning one side of the bed was too cold and the other too warm. Without changing the settings, this problem was not apparent the next day, so we did not inquire further.

The computers in the basement are a nice service if one needs to print out the boarding pass, but only one of them worked properly. However, the hotel offers a complimentary sign-up-free wi-fi in the rooms, which is great.

While the place as a whole is very appealing, we can by no means recommend opting for a breakfast in the place. The continental breakfast buffet is what passes for a normal breakfast at your average two-and-half-star place in Majorca or Gran Canaria, but entirely unworthy of a place like the Ampersand. A few pastry items that were occasionally re-filled from large paper boxes, some muesli and some yogurt; unfortunately, the second day, even the yogurt was gone, in addition to the orange juice. Despite the fact that the place was not crawling with dozens of hungry visitors, staff seemed hopelessly overworked, forgot to take orders at times, left tables with large amounts of food remainders unattended long. Individual orders for e.g. egg specialties (those cost extra) were both accidentally mis-configured and wrongly billed - once in the restaurant, once at checkout.

Overall, we were quite happy with our stay at the hotel, enjoyed our room and the place's incredible location. However, a hotel of this price league should pay more attention to details like a working infrastructure and really not present visitors with this sad excuse of a breakfast.",4,2013,02,25
129,Beautiful and elegant boutique hotel,"This is a gorgeous boutique hotel in the heart of South Kensington. A stone's throw from the tube station and all the museums. 

The hotel has been newly renovated and the rooms are immaculate. The attention to detail is impressive, from the free soft drinks in the mini bar to the gorgeous toiletries and rubber duck in the bathroom....

The staff are professional and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. 

A lovely break in a lovely hotel. Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,02,24
129,Almost perfect stay,"Located in the heart of Kensigton, the hotel offers design, modern, spacious room (well isolated for UK standards) with free Internet access. Breakfast was delicious but ""sweet only"", we ordered extra's (cheese, bacon&eggs...). We used the small gym area in the basement: tiny but with latest equipment.
The staff is helpful but needs a bit more training e.g they miscalculated the commute time to the airport and we had to wait 2h in the airport lounge for our flight; they also scheduled an early wake up call we didn't request...
Overall, I'd say the hotel is a perfect choice for a romantic long week-end, if you don't want to be botehred by tourists and enjoy a well designed room! Great restaurants are within walking distance. ",5,2013,02,24
129,A perfect stay!,"I could not fault this hotel. The room was compact but spotlessly clean and perfectly formed with lovely high ceilings and a large, clean window which could be opened. The room was lovely and cosy as the heating was easy to control and instant. The bathroom was clean and beautifully stocked with lovely toiletries. The bed was really comfortable and the bedding was crisp. The staff were helpful and accommodating and breakfast was delicious. My daughter had bacon butties and I had avocado on lightly toasted sour bread. The location is fabulous and only a minute from South Kensington tube station. There are lovely delis for snacks and lots of pretty Georgian houses in the surrounding area. The number 14 bus went straight from the hotel all the way through Knightsbridge to Picadilly Circus so loads to see enroute. The hotel is also very close to a fair few museums too.  A perfect stay!",5,2013,02,23
129,a really great hotel in super location,"My husband and I went to England this past January and stayed in London on our way to Italy...He had made a reservation at this hotel on line and had gotten an unbelievable rate ! We arrived at the hotel and were shown to our room which was very small but well appointed. We both decided that we wanted a larger room so he went down to the reception desk and asked if they had anything a little larger...they showed us a wonderfull room which was twice as large with a beautifull free standing tub in the window alcove in the main bedroom...the bathroom was large and wonderfull....filled with huge fluffy towels and lovely soaps, shampoos etc...Since it was an upgrade we did pay additional for this room but the cost was minimal in regard to the upgrade from the first room that we were in...
The staff at his hotel are all very friendly and especially helpfull...they make you feel welcome and all seem really happy to help you! The location is great as well...the tube entrance is right across the street if you choose to take it and there are car and drivers available provided by the hotel  or cabs.
I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great small hotel  with great service..We will be going to London next year and will certainly stay here again....",5,2013,02,22
129,Great Stay,"Stayed in the Ampersand for one night in a deluxe room which was comfortable. The pillows and bedding were very comfortable and overall I had a good nights sleep! The room came with a large TV which was a surpise and because of the high celings, it gave the room a feeling of space. The rooms to be honest were not the biggest so it will be interesting to see how small the singles and doubles would be so I would recommend choosing one of the larger ones. The decor was beautiful all the way through. The staff were excellent right through from reception to showing me to my room and even restocked the coffee in the mini bar on request! There was also a comfortable shower room and everything you would want in a hotel room. The location was excellent with access to Mayfair and surrounding areas.   Overall highly recommended and very relaxing. The only gripe, you can hear the tube at night.",4,2013,02,21
129,Top notch hotel with its own rubber duck,"The Ampersand is a delight. We were upgraded to a superior room on arrival which was a nice touch. The ceilings in the rooms are so high, and gives the impression of the room being double the size it actually is.

The bed was comfortable with bathroom spacious. The shower was wonderful, although trying to turn it on to warm up without getting wet is an art... We also found a rubber duck which just made our day! Shower and moisturisers were also high quality, and the nice little packages of items like a sewing kit was thoughtful, and reminded me of the W chain.

The hotel is incredibly close to South Kensington tube and makes it very accessible. Service was good, if not a little slow checking in.",5,2013,02,16
129,Excellent vacation location location location,"it exceeded my expectations, located two minutes walking from the south kensington tube. close to all major free museums to noting hill and to kings road. wonderful service and beautiful design rooms. I just loved the decor. the hotel has a beautiful breakfast lounge and cosy little restaurant
if you are looking for something different and you care about design this is the place for you.",5,2013,02,14
129,We may of had bad luck?,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at new year and overall had a good stay, we had a small standard room and found it perfect for a short stay but any longer would of been a struggle as it was so small and we were stepping over our cases and just fit out clothes into the wardrobe as it was. The room was very clean and cosy with very tastfull decore, the beds are also super comfotable. Only one small detail is there is no where to hang your coat!

All the staff seemed friendly and attentive apart from when we decided to have afternoon tea at the hotel, we were ignored by the waitress as were some other people and waited for around 10 mins, after which she served some people the manager had just brought in. We got up and left as we did feel we were clearly not as important as other guests staying at the hotel.
This was a shame as I would of given the hotel 5 stars if this had not of happened to us.

Also the room we had was so very noisy and I had to buy ear plugs after the first night just to get some sleep!",4,2013,02,13
129,Total transformation,"I stayed previously in a hotel on this site so it was interesting to see how much it had changed. Such a superb location for me as I was going to a meeting in the nearby Lycee and only a few steps from South Kensington tube. The hotel was fabulous and the staff were so proud of the hotel that they did everything to ensure that I had a really great few days there. The decor was bright and modern but in no way cold. The Library was well-stocked with a very eclectic mix of books. Although my room was on the 'bijou' side it was a quirky and comforting refuge and I really appreciated the stock of complimentary soft drinks in the bedside fridge, the fabulous range of toileteries, brilliant selection of tv channels and the easy to operate safe.
There was a good variety of eating opportunities - even at breakfast there was no need to feel forced into 'conforming' and lunch in the Drawing Room was a delightful experience.",5,2013,02,12
129,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"everything superb...but be warned..if you get a room facing the main street, take some ear plugs..remember London never sleeps and that goes for South Kensington..taxis and bus noises will keep you awake

the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly",5,2013,02,11
129,The Ampersand Hotel our Wedding INCREDIBLE!,"We cannot thank or praise The Ampersand Team enough.
From the moment we made initial enquiries, prompt service, care and attention to detail and time and effort given to making us feel special was evident.
Correspondence between myself and the reservation team was beyond satisfactory. Even inviting us down to view the rooms and entire Hotel was a wonderful touch, and something we are so pleased we managed to do prior to our bookings.
The events team too were extremely helpful.

When we visited the hotel we explained we would be staying for the duration of our Civil Partnership ceremony and celebrations. On our arrival, the incredible gesture of a room upgrade to a Deluxe Suite made a HUGE difference to us. Having the room of our dreams offered to us made our stay all the more special. The hotel staff not only listened and took into consideration that it was a special occasion for us, but did something out of the ordinary to make our stay extraordinary.
From the kind welcome from the gentleman at Reception who remembered us from our viewing, to the thoughtful card and box of chocolates congratulating us on our Civil Partnership from the team, to the bed turn down service every evening, to the wonderful attention from every other employee we had the pleasure of coming not contact with making us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel.
Everyone knew us, and was happy to help in any way possible. 
In addition, the hotel itself is impeccable ~ The room styling, AMAZING BED, wonderful restaurant and tea room, overall cleanliness and available amenities within. It also provided a remarkable backdrop to some of our wedding day photographs. We really felt we had the entire hotel just to ourselves. It was PERFECT!

There were also a couple of extra touches given to us on our wedding night, which were also something we hadn't expected at all. 

It is fair to say The Ampersand not only achieved our expectations~ but exceeded them in every way.
We cannot wait to stay here again and implore everyone to treat yourself to a visit to The Ampersand hotel; you won't regret it.",5,2013,02,11
129,A Gem in Kensington,"We stayed overnight for a wedding this weekend and we are so glad we chose The Ampersand. We got a great deal through lastminute.com and arrived an hour early to be greeted by friendly, relaxed staff who were kind enough to upgrade us to a deluxe room. The whole hotel feels luxe - it is impeccably designed, very contemporary and not at all pretentious. The attention to detail is flawless - from the Miller Harris toiletries to the Ampersand rubber duck, they have certainly understood the cheeky little touches that make a hotel individual and five star. As many have noted the rooms are not huge, but they are beautiful and practical and we were more than comfortable.  We were on the second floor in room 210 and there was some road noise despite the double glazing, but this is to be expected in London and didn't stop us sleeping well. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the robes and towels were plush and the free soft drinks/cafetiere coffee a welcome treat where other hotels charge through the nose. We didn't stay for breakfast but they serve it late until 11 which is great on the weekend, and our friends said the selection was fantastic and very reasonable at under ¬£20. There are so many places to choose in London but I would happily return to The Ampersand - they know what they're doing. Our thanks to the team!",5,2013,02,11
129,Great Full Service Boutique Hotel,"Great hotel across the street from the South Kensington Underground station.  Open in September 2012.  Our room was a nice size, very comfortable and with full amenities.  Great value and just a short distance to Knightsbridge and Kensington.",5,2013,02,10
129,A Revelation in the Heart of South Kensington,"Ultra fabulous new arrival in the heart of South Kensington. Excellent facilities, excellent food (try the pasta with truffles) great service.  And above all, cute little rubber duckies and Nespresso machines. I shall be back!",5,2013,02,10
129,Fabulous!,"Great location, wondderful staff, reasonably priced and gorgeous rooms! What is there not to like about this hotel? The free mini bar is a nice touch especially after a day of hiking around London. The hotel is directly across the street from the South Kensington tube station which meant exploring London and getting there to and from the airport was a snap. 
Just a wonderful experience! I would hightly recommended this hotel to anyone staying in London.
(My only fear is that this gem will get too popular and it will become too expensive and too difficult to get a room there!)",5,2013,02,07
129,Top notch hotel in perfect location,"I booked this hotel as a birthday surprise and had emailed the hotel a week prior to arrival stating we'd be arriving earlier than the official check in time and requested a quiet room.  We arrived to a warm welcome and our room was ready.  Deluxe room was at the back of the hotel so was quiet, super clean, spacious for London, great walk in shower and had all the trimmings you'd expect from a boutique hotel.  Staff were really efficient and friendly without being snooty.  
Some reviewers have complained about the size of the rooms - their website is honest enough and does actually state the size in square metres for each grade of room so if you want more space then pay for it!
They kept our luggage for us after we checked out so we could return to change downstairs after a formal event, again no problems.
Perfect location - a minute from South Ken tube, a plethora of lovely cafes and restaurants, I recommend Le Comptoir (Lebanese) a lovely family run restaurant with buzzing atmosphere and good old fashioned home cooking, oh and the best baklawa.
A well deserved Mr & Mrs Smith hotel.",5,2013,02,05
129,"Lovely little find -- location, location, location","We've now stayed twice at The Ampersand and I have to say it's a great little find. At the moment the prices are reasonable for its location but I am sure that will change as they finish working on the rooms and the gym. 
 
The location is perfect. RIGHT at the South Kensington Tube station. Literally on its doorstep. This is very handy. However, if you're a light sleeper be warned that you'll hear the first train of the morning -- it rumbles right underneath the hotel.

If you can, try to upgrade to a junior suite. We were shown two deluxe rooms but turned them down because they were small and had a tiny little window that overlooked a school (think noisy teens first thing in the morning). 

The room is fantastic -- the bed and linens extremely comfortable. It was hard to get up in the morning! The bathroom is well appointed with big towels and lovely soap/shampoo/amenities.

The staff are very friendly -- a nice greeting when you return after you've been out all day. Fast check-in and check-out.

Room service is very reasonable though slightly limited. Ten pounds for a full English breakfast. 

Will definitely stay there again. It was written up in Tatler (high end British magazine) so it will be interesting to see what happens with the prices.",4,2013,02,04
129,Bespoke service,"I stayed for 3 nights at The Ampersand, my travel agent Il Viaggio advised me about this boutique property, I must straight forwardly I am rather picky. The property lies literally 100 meters from South Kensington Station: the Museums and the Royal Albert Hall are a stone‚Äôs sthrow and Old Brompton Road‚Äôs bars and restaurants are nearby too. I was allocated room 318, a Deluxe Room,  on a quiet corner of the building. The room was spotless, everything was working fine, great wi-fi signal, incredibly comfortable bed and linen, and a petite-but comprehensive bathroom with a dazzling rainforest shower.  Amenities were first class, I think the The Ampersand epitomises the new British flair: witty but classy.
Breakfast was nice, but nothing to die for, also with Paul‚Äôs lattes a few meters away there was plenty of choice for meals.
The last morning I was awoken by some noise coming from the ceiling, on checking out I did say I was rather disappointed that my stay had been spoiled, so the manager-on-duty without further ado she took the whole night off my bill! I was literally impressed.",5,2013,02,03
129,London hotel with World Class US service,"My wife and I stayed a full week at the Ampersand hotel. We decided for a superior Studio Room about 30m2 big.
Included in the room rate was free soft drinks, Nespresso Coffee machine and many more small extras.

We felt at home from we arrived. All the staff were nice, smiling and very helpful. Everything in the hotel was kept very clean and tidy. The Afternoon tea Salon and the restaurant were excellent and fairly priced. The king size bed is the best bed we have ever slept in.
The room and bathroom are very tastefully decorated  and functional.

Ampersand is situated 2 minutes walk from South kensington Station, 8 minutes walk from Harrods and many nice designer shops and restaurants.

This is for sure our future hotel in London, it is simply a great experience.",5,2013,02,02
129,Fabulous couples hotel,"From the outset, this hotel was precisely what we were looking for. My girlfriend had booked us in for as a birthday surprise for me and the Ampersand did not disappoint. We were upgraded to a King Deluxe (from a double) and being both new in age and contemporary in style, everything worked extremely well with no leaks, creaks or annoyances. The mini bar was complementary, the bed was fantastically comfortable and at under ¬£20, the breakfast was both tasty and well priced. The staff could not have been more helpful and really added to the special occasion. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys slick styling, great service and a top location.",5,2013,02,02
129,Excellent Stay,"This hotel was fabulous. We got upgraded twice. The staff were so helpful and knowledgeable with great recommendations.

The rooms were gorgeous, beautiful and restful.

We can't wait to stay here again.",5,2013,02,01
129,Average hotel.,"We stayed at The Ampersand for a few nights in November, I had got a good deal seeing as the hotel had just opened. The hotel is very glamourous, the bed was comfy, the restaurant was tasty. 
However our room was tiny (the person showing us to our room had to 'reverse out' of the room before we could get into it. Also, the room was noisy. All night there was the hum of what must have been the air conditioning units/ boiler room. To add to that noisy, one night at around 12am, something started banging, as if doing someone was doing DIY and it went on for a few hours. Spoke to the staff in the morning and they didn't seem overly concerned. 
Of all the hotels to choose from in London, I probably won't be staying here again.",3,2013,02,01
129,Best hotel in London,"if you looking for a hotel Kensington look no further. The staff is attentive and accomodating. The decor was modern and new. Great Miller Harris bath products. I have stayed at a few Firmdale london hotels ( Number Sixteen, Knightsbridge hotel), Hotel indigo (both locations) and Hotel 41 and The Ampersand is what they all aspire to be. Great location near Royal Albert Hall and The Natural History Museum. 2 minutes from the tube station and plenty of bus service available.

The rooms are amazing, of course this is London and rooms are not huge but this was perfect size for 2 people. Great minibar, free of charge stocked with water, soda and juices. great little gym with the essentials and great room service menu. The best part was the room was wired for tech, a plug into the desk for USB, US converter, MIDI and audio output. Plus a dock for your iPhone or IPod . I will continue to stay here on my next visit.",5,2013,02,01
129,Stop looking and just stay here!,"My husband and two teenage children stayed at The Ampersand for 5 nights over the New Year period. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite for ourselves with an adjoining room for the children.  Everything about this hotel is fantastic - the decor, the location, the beds, the pillows and the breakfast.  Best of all were the wonderful staff who were on duty over our 5 day stay, they were all really friendly and helpful and a credit to this wonderful hotel. Since returning home I have recommended The Ampersand to everyone!!!!",5,2013,02,01
129,Loved it! Would definitely go back,"Stayed in room 409 for three nights from the 25th. I noticed a review below from someone staying in the room next door at the same time, who complained about the rumbling of underground trains. We didn't notice this at all ,though at some times during the night and early morning there were strange sounds which apparently were due to pipes expanding. Not too big a deal but we did call to ask about it as it bothered my husband a bit, we were offered a change of room but didn't bother to take up the offer and on check out our last breakfast was knocked off our bill for this inconvenience. We loved the hotel, very helpful staff and very good breakfast. We were upgraded from a superior to a deluxe room on arrival which was a lovely gesture. Rooms and ambience of the hotel are superb, looking forward to going back very soon.",5,2013,01,30
129,Wonderful.,"This is the second time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel. The rooms although slightly on the small side  (We have stayed in the standard and the superior) are very comfy. I have the best nights sleep when we stay. The bathrooms are nice and modern, love the shower. The Ampersand is only 30 seconds from the underground and about a 5 minute walk to the Royal Albert Hall with plenty of nice restaurants and bars in the area. Well worth a stay.",5,2013,01,29
129,What a fabulous hotel...,"Had two nights at this gorgeous hotel. Had a luxury feel at a very reasonable price. The rooms are fabulous with a little touches of luxury. All of the staff are friendly, helpful and efficient. This lovely boutique hotel is in a fab spot in South Kensington which has a great vibe, across from South Kensington underground station. Would highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to visit again soon!",5,2013,01,29
129,'Wonderfully comfortable and convenient',"I stayed three week nights - on arrival was upgraded to a deluxe room which was lovely, though I do wonder about the size of the smaller rooms since mine was not that generous. Rooms have recently been renovated so everything was in excellent condition. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I had a room near the rear of the building that was very quiet. Amenities were of a high standard. Service was very good, food in-house, both room serivce and Ampero and the Drawing Rooms was very good as well. The location is fantastic, and I found it very relaxing and seamless. Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,01,28
129,A little bit of boutique luxury goes a long way,"The Ampersand hotel is a recently developed/renovated boutique hotel just a stones throw from South Kensington tube station. As far as the location goes its perfect, less than 5 minutes walk from the tube station and right on the number 14 bus route that takes you into the heart of tourist London. The surrounding area has everything you could want with an array of restaurants, pubs, bars, the fabulous hummingbird bakery, museums (V&A and Natural History), the Albert Hall and even a Lamborghini showroom if you're looking for a new car!
The building and decor are beautiful and spotlessly clean, with sumptuous and gorgeous rooms that are both stylish and cozy, a very hard balance to strike for many modern hotels.
The hotel was booked as a romantic getaway and we couldn't have been happier with our choice. The staff were friendly and attentive, service was swift and the hotel had a general feeling of relaxed luxury and class.
The bathrooms have huge monsoon showers, fluffy towels and complimentary robes/slippers, and they even have little Ampersand rubber ducks for bath time!
The only negatives I could highlight to make this a fair and balanced review are that we were on the second floor at the front of the hotel and road noise was quite noticeable, with the bus stop and club opposite providing noise until late into the night. That said it did not cause too much disruption or detract from the enjoyment of our stay. Also I ordered room service, which provided very difficult due to an apparent problem with the phone line. Once I managed to order however, the food was delivered quickly.
I will certainly return to The Ampersand hotel on my next trip to London and recommend anyone else to do likewise.",5,2013,01,28
129,Simply the best,"Already upon making the reservation at this hotel the experience is brilliant. The concierge service of the hotel arranged my entire stay in London with musical tickets, entry tickets to London sights and restaurant reservations. They are friendly, attentive and pro-active. The service at the hotel during the stay was great as well. Enthousiastic and motivated staff is what made the stay for me just perfect. The hotel itself is good and comfortable. The location is fantastic.

Negative points were the fact that WIFI at the 4th floor doesn't work so I had internet only in the public areas. The gym has modern equipment but is very small (on the other hand the parks are close by if you want to run). Breakfast is nothing to write home about. 

The hotel has a good flat rate taxi service to the airport but the driver we had was crazy. Maybe that was just an incident.

I will most definitely come back to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone who plans to stay in London.

If you need to have things arranged during your trip then ask for Myriam. She was most helpful.",5,2013,01,28
129,I came for a shave,"Travelled down from Sheffield to London for a shave at the world famous G F Trumpers in Mayfair and what a fantastic experience it was.  We have Stayed 2 nights and have been very impressed. The decor is well put together and bright in the lobby, but subtle and two tone in the rooms. The staff were excellent and professional. When we asked if they were in a position to perform the complimentary shoe shine service (thanks for reviving my Redwings), they said ""madam at his hotel almost anything is possible"". Brilliant! The only negative was the size of hanging space, which has already been mentioned on this forum. Our wardrobe was unable to house a long coat or dress, and such items would have to be placed in the bathroom.  The top portion of the wardrobe housed a fuse box for some reason. If this was removed, along with the safe at the foot of the wardrobe (this being placed in the bedside cabinet) then problem solved.  Love the brass eagled espresso machine in the lobby.  If I am in the big smoke again, would definitely return.",4,2013,01,27
129,Affordable Luxury,"I can't fault this hotel at all! We stayed in a standard double room and the hotel exceeded our expectations considering the price.  The attention to the little details really made all the difference even though our room was quite small.  The staff were welcoming, helpful, professional and couldn't do enough for us.  The location is great; just a minute from the tube and Natural History Museum, 15minutes walk from Royal Albert Hall and Harrods.  Great service, food and hospitality.  If you are looking for a classy hotel at a reasonable price with all the little extra's you expect at a 5* then take a good look - what a gem!",5,2013,01,26
129,My best hotel experience in London so far!,"I stayed a weekend (three nights) with my grown up daughter. All staff were very friendly and the service prompt and helpful. The common areas are well equipped with for example computers with printers and fitness room with free, cold bottled water and towels. The room was nice however a bit small for a superior room, but warm and cosy even with a temperature below zero outside. An extra plus for having floor heating in the bathroom. As in many other hotels in London it was possible to sometimes experience a slight ruble when a train went by, but that didn¬¥t disture us at all. The location very near tube station South Kensington facliltated our stay in London, as for example approx. only 10 minutes to Piccadilly Circus. We will absolutely consider to stay in this hotel again at or next privat visit in London.",5,2013,01,26
129,Hmmmmm,"I really wanted to love this place, but the service was terrible.  I will finish on positives so will get the negatives done with first.  I was in room 408 a deluxe double and the place shook and rumbled EVERY time a train went by, but the worst part was service, I hung my breakfast order out before bed to be delivered at ten. Ten am came and went and so did 10.15, at which point I dialled room service.  No answer, I have up at11 am and checked out after 4 attempts to call down to room service.  Other than those points the hotel is very nicely decorated deluxe double was fairly spacious brand new and comfy restfull(once trains stop) bed.  Won't be back though...",3,2013,01,25
129,Recommendation,"Have been here for 1 night. Wish I could have stayed longer. Perfectly located (1 minute to tube station South Kensington), great Service (friendly, helpful), very clean rooms (but this in general as well), modern design. On top very good breakfast in a nice restaurant...... Just go there and try",4,2013,01,25
129,The Amazing Ampersand!,"My husband and I stayed there for his birthday last week. It was perfect: great design, big room with wonderful amenities (including a TV in the shower!), and--most importantly--a very responsive, friendly staff. Their attention to detail as well as the pride they take in their work really showed. This is the way hospitality should be done. The hotel has a fun restaurant and a drawing room for afternoon tea, and it is located super close to the South Kensington tube station. It was super hard for us to leave!",5,2013,01,24
129,Chic bolthole in South Kensington,"The location of this boutique hotel in South Kensington is fantastic.  About a minute away from South Kensington tube and within easy walking distance of lovely shops, cafes and restaurants in the area.  Also easy walking distance to the museums. 

The lobby and public areas are very attractive and, if we return, I would definitely like to try afternoon tea in the lounge.  I saw some other guests enjoying it and it looked very tasty indeed!

Our room (Deluxe) was lovely, though a little on the small side and while we liked the room we felt a tiny bit cramped.  The bed itself was really big and comfy and we both slept very well indeed so big thumbs up for that!  The decor is lovely too.  The room had a subtle ornithological theme.  The bathroom felt spacious and the Miller Harris goodies were stocked up on the second day which was a nice touch.  

The mini bar had water, coke and juices which were free of charge, another nice touch.  

Overall this was a really, really nice place to stay.  We both like the area a lot and it was great to find somewhere that was chic yet comfy and didn't cost the earth.  We'd definitely go back again.",4,2013,01,24
129,Quality hotel!,"The hotel is still new after opening in September 2012 and you can tell. It looks as clean as a new pin and smells fresh and new. 

All staff I encountered were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. When my Mum and I came down in the evening to go out, the receptionist asked if she could call us a cab.  I booked through secret escapes and my ‚Äòpackage‚Äô came with a complimentary glass of champagne. I don‚Äôt drink champagne and so asked if I could swap it for a cocktail instead. This was done with no bother at all. 

The minibar which was included in the price was very well stocked and greatly appreciated. 

I stayed in the superior suite. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was a bit smaller than I would have expected for a superior suite but this isn‚Äôt a criticism, just an observation! 
Breakfast was lovely. I had paid for just continental. I could have upgraded for ¬£10 and the cooked breakfast menu was vast. The continental breakfast although quite small was delicious. 

The hotel is just a stone‚Äôs throw away from South Kensington underground which was really good when I arrived seeing as I had a large case! On the way home I had bought too much to get the underground back to Paddington Station so got a cab. This was reasonably priced at ¬£10.20.",5,2013,01,24
129,Business trip,"Wonderful gem of a hotel. We're treated like VIPs  despite a booking confusion.  Would love to stay again this year. Very clean, food great and attentive staff. Taxis always at the door although walking everywhere is good for us",5,2013,01,23
129,intelligent luxury in South Kensington,"we stayed here for a night in January '13 and loved it. The staff were friendly and engaging, and the decor is funky  with lots of quirky features and clever touches. Check out the collage in the basement and the cabinet of curiosities in the restaurant.

The rooms are cozy and what they lack in space they make up for in decor...all cleverly themed, really good bedding and high quality bathroom accessories, intelligent books and magazines to browse through. 

The only niggle was the room was very warm when we arrived and we had to open the windows to cool it down.",5,2013,01,23
129,Research paid off!,"We stayed here for a week from 1/14/13-1/21. We came to London for some R&R, and to take in the museums.  The location couldn't be better. Walking distance (2-4 blocks) from the V&A, Science Museum, Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall, and a ""shopping museum"" Harrods.
The places to eat, ethnic,local, upscale, breakfast,so many so close,and very good food, little patisseries with to die for tarts. As you may tell we are foodies. 
The decor in the rooms and the hotel tastefully yet subtly reminds you of the nearby natural history museum.  Our room had an ornithological feel. The longer you stayed in it the more you appreciated it and the amenities that were complimentary. Shhh they give you so much that others make you pay for, keep it secret or they may charge.  Truly free internet,a variety of free sodas, juices, teas, coffee, waters,non gestapo refrigerator, big comfy robes, and slippers, small, but state of the art fitness center, i-pod dock in alarm clock, big screen TV, and good lighting for reading or working, and plenty of pillows on the bed, and luxurious linens.  The bathroom had a great big tub with modern fixtures,both tub and shower accessories, heated floors, very striking black and white colors, great lighting, big towels, and a mirror that doesn't fog up when you take a long hot shower.  Even the milk in the fridge was changed every 2 days whether it was still good or not.  The room was immaculate, and has a modern system on the doors to electronically let the maid know if you needed service, so it was like your own refuge.  
One of our bags got lost at the airport, no thanks to United, and the front desk worked on getting it back for us, so we could enjoy our holiday.  It could have been a day of frustration.  They look out for their guests and really understand customer service.  Including letting us check in early (no extra charge) to storing our bags gratis while we went to Paris for a few days.  They even have fun with their name playing on the ""&"" . Hello & Welcome 
A more current set of movies in the pay for view, would be nice, and the local tube station less than a block away (great for location, a little less great when you can feel the rumble), would be the only things i would mention on the downside.
I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

129,Small rooms but for the rest perfectly fine hotel,"We stayed at The Ampersand in December 2012. It is a new hotel at a good location, staff are friendly and correct and there is free WiFi throughout the hotel at no extra charge. Rooms are quiet but pretty small and we even had a Deluxe room instead of a Standard room. For the rest is a perfectly fine hotel.",4,2013,01,20
129,"Wonderful staff, great location and superb facilities.","Arrived at the hotel, swift check in and immediatly taken to our room which was located on the second floor by very friendly staff.  Our room was at the front of the hotel and I was a little concerned about street noise but this did not cause any problems!  The location of the hotel is very convenient and easy to find. The decor throughout the hotel is stunning and very unique.  Downstairs there is a library and games room which are accessible to all guest, we enjoyed a game of table tennis!",5,2013,01,20
129,Great value,"We stayed at Hotel Ampersand for 3 days in London and were very pleased. It was in a great location (across the street from the subway) and the price was excellent. There were nearby museums and restaurants that are definitely worthwhile. The hotel restaurant was very good as well. 

Overall great value for a London hotel!",4,2013,01,20
129,Didn't disappoint,"This was our second visit to this hotel; we love it here so much. Upgraded our room to a deluxe and this gave us more room. We were greeted on our return with a couple of glasses of bubbly - lovely touch! Staff still as friendly as ever, which gives this hotel a relaxed feel. ",5,2013,01,20
129,Overall an excellent hotel,"First time staying here (I normally stay at Firmdale's No 16 on Sumner Place around the corner from Ampersand) but fancied a change - the Ampersand has won me over! Reception staff were excellent both very friendy and enquired if I had had a good journey  to London. 

The room was a good size and had everything you needed.  I particularly liked the mini bottle of fresh milk in the fridge and fresh coffee - I dont know why more hotels cant do this instead of the standard plastic UHT stuff, small touch but so much better. Also an excellent range of things in the bathroom - quality bottles of shampoo, cond. and shower gel etc, + a great little bag of extras including eye make up remover for the girls!  I also loved the simplicity of the TV - I stay in lots of hotels alone for work and being a girl always seem to struggle with overly complex systems!! this was easy and straightforward. 

Apero restaurant is very nice, good atmosphere, I ate a really good burger on Sunday lunchtime -my only comment is that they only offer a 'brunch' on the weekend and its not what everyone will want, eg no light lunch options - sandwich etc.  Breakfast buffet was good value at ¬£10 - I wasn't offered any hot choices, it didnt matter because I didnt want it anyway but the service here did seem a little confused - teething prombelms? 

Overall excellent and about 1 - 2 minutes walk from South Ken tube for Circle and District and Picadilly lines.",5,2013,01,17
129,Fantastic Hotel!,"Stayed at the Ampersand January 10-13.  We needed a hotel in the Knightsbridge/Kensington/Chelsea area and I did a search of all the hotels in the area. The Ampersand looked perfect after reading the Tripadvisor reviews.  The rooms are large for london. They are clean with new modern bathrooms, modern technology and clean very comfortable beds. The Tube stop is across the street. The coffee and tea in the main lobby was very nice and the restaurant for breakfast was awesome.  One night my kids wanted pizza but we did not see it on the menu. I called to ask for a nearby pizza place that would deliver, They recommened a place but said they would pick it up, deliver to the room and charge to my bill! These guys really get how to be good at SERVICE! Fantastic.",5,2013,01,16
129,Good Hotel!,"me and my partner stayed here for one night, very nice hotel very clean and helpful staff, we also used the drawings rooms for afternoon tea which was great and once again great service, we got a free upgrade of rooms which was great! our room was lovely really comfy large bed, comp soft drinks and water, tea and coffee, lovely bathroom, tv etc.... only downfall is if you want to watch a film they charge you ¬£8! per film! you get free wi fi which actually does work and signal was strong. Overall had a really good experience expensive but great!",4,2013,01,16
129,Friendly hotel in great location,"Booked a 3 night stay through slh. We were in a superior room.  Comfortable but compact.  We did have a few noise issues: first morning woken up at 7am by electric drill (there is still some building work going on); then at 8am the rubbish lorries made a fair bit of noise.  Our room also overlooked playground of French lyc√©e so during the week there is noise at certain times of the day with school children screaming & playing.  Lastly, the hotel is above the underground so you can feel a rumble as trains go by.  However, having said all that, we did have a good stay.  The hotel is still new & pristine. Towels & dressing gowns all wonderfully new & fluffy.  Free water & soft drinks in fridge, plus tea/coffee in room with fresh milk.  Staff all very friendly.  Breakfast is in the basement. ¬£10 for continental which we thought was very good value (especially if you like a few cups of coffee in the morning to get you going) & a nice selection of brioches, croissants, muffins etc plus fresh fruit & fruit juice.  Great location just steps from s kensington tube.  Would definitely feel happy staying here on my own in London.  We didn't spend much time in the room as we were out & about.  If we were planning a more leisurely stay in London I would probably want to stay in one of their larger rooms to enjoy more space.",4,2013,01,14
129,wonderful boutique hotel,"loved this wonderful boutique hotel . The decor is very fresh and colourful , the staff are helpful and friendly , although it was strange at first to see their dress code was jeans !! But the hotel is a little quirky and thats what makes it a joy ! The bedroom was typical for London ,small , but it was extremely comfortable and the bed was large and cosy . Situated across the road from South Kensington tube station the hotel is very accessible to all the major attractions . I will definitely return to this hotel ,hopefully very soon !!",5,2013,01,13
129,Fabulous,"Everything about the hotel is stylish and well done. The staff are great and treat you in a very friendly manner. From check in to check out it was a pleasure to be there. I love the decoration of the place. We had a room upgrade and everything was perfect from the lighting , shower, hot water and small little touches , such as mini nibbles left in our room. The bed is supremely comfortable and it was one of the best nights sleep i have ever had in a hotel. I could happily have stayed in bed all day. 
The only minus point would be the noise from the underground, but it didnt bother me. That one point is very much outweighed by all the positives , such as the perfect location for Harrods and the museums . 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Whenever i am in London i go there even if its just for a glass of champagne and a cake. Its like an oasis.",5,2013,01,13
129,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Stayed here for one night, absolutely loved it. Has a great boutique feel to it, beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. 
We stayed in a superior room the bed was huge! All round great service and scrumptious breakfast.
This hotel with without a doubt be top of my list for my next hotel stay in London.
I didn't know it was going to be so close to the tube station either, really handy only a stones throw from south Kensington station. 
Some nice places to eat and drink nearby too. 
Can't wait to come again thank you Ampersand!",5,2013,01,13
129,Excellent value for money and very good location!!!,"This new boutique hotel, newly renovated offers excellent value for money in a great location just minutes away from Harrods, A&V museum, Hyde Park and other attractions. the sfatt if very attentive and helpful. it offers a nice coffee shop restaurant downstairs in addition to service in the lobby. i have stayed there twice in the last month and will be back soon.

129,Very happy visit,"It was our first visit to this hotel.  The staff were very friendly and enthusiastic.  It suited us well being near V&A.  The rooms were good and well serviced and thoughtfully supported as we had three children in one of our two rooms.  We thought it provided good value.  The facilities were excellent - good breakfast, nice cocktails, lots of spaces.  It is relatively new so there are teething problems WiFi is variable depending on where you are and the theatre booking service can improve.  We are sure the staff are keen to make these improvements.  We will be back.",5,2013,01,10
129,Nice boutique hotel in the heart of South Kensington,"I've spent there a short weekend and really appreciated the perfect location right in front South Kensington metro station and only few steps from several point of interests, museums, Hyde Park and last but not least Harrod's and many other shops.
The Ampersand borns from the full refurbishment of a well-know but old/styled 4stars hotel and the result it's absolutely  great.
The hotel is very cozy and trendy at the meantime as well as provided with a nice tea-room, business centre, bistrot and all the amenities.
I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone chasing for a strategic and classy starting point to visit London.
Probably due to the recent inauguration the Hotel offered a great price for value compared to the average London rates.",4,2013,01,10
129,Simply the Best,"From the moment we arrived we knew the ampersand was something special. By the time we left, after three very comfortable nights we knew our first impressions had been correct. The staff could not be more helpful, pleasant or efficient. Every request i.e. extra tea bags or help with the computer was dealt with immediately and cheerfully. Afternoon tea in the Drawing Room was an absolute delight and so reasonable compared with other London afternoon tea venues.
Dinner and breakfast in the Apero restaurant did not disappoint either. The food is quality, properly prepared and cooked and well served, the wine is reasonably priced. We have stayed in many hotels in many places here and abroad. Ampersand is the best and we shall probably never stay anywhere else on our frequent visits to London from South Wales now we have found this gem.",5,2013,01,10
129,Marvellous,"Wow there are so many things to love about The Ampersand. While the lobby, rooms, restaurant etc aren't spacious, the service, design and room facilities are lovely, modern and cosy. All the staff here are casually friendly in a relaxed welcoming atmosphere. I don't feel uncomfortable at all unlike at some hotels I've been in with fake customer service that makes you uncomfortable. Every day, I can't wait to come back to my superior room and relax. If only, I can have more time in it but unfortunately, this is London which means I should be out there experiencing all the sights and sounds. This hotel is in a very convenient location not too far from everything by tube or walking but just far enough to escape the madness. Great choices on tv channels and details can be seen from the toilets to the switches. It really inspired me to remodel my bathroom toilet in future to make it look like my bathroom in Ampersand. Plenty of food choices around like a halal Subway and Miss Ellie's subs around the corner at South Kensington station which is less than a minute away. Hope I can return here one day.",5,2013,01,10
129,Excellent hotel in London,Great service. Good location. Outstanding bed comfort. We stayed at the Hotel for three night and had an impeccable experience from check-in to check out. The breakfast is also of great value (¬£10) for a hotel of this standing and the food is really neat. The overall service experience provided at the hotel is exceptionnal.,5,2013,01,09
129,Gorgeous hotel!!!,"Reception was wonderful, very friendly! The hotel is absolutely stunning, modern and classy at the same time. Very unique! The Drawing Room is gorgeous!! (shame they don't serve the hotel breakfast there, but you can have lovely afternoon tea!)
The location is perfect - right next to South Kensington tube station - with lots of very cute restaurants nearby! Harrod's is a 15min walk.
Everything is modern and working well (incl. shower/bath!)
Would stay there again anytime!",5,2013,01,09
129,Ideal hotel for our crazy trip to London,"Hiiii !!

We go to Ampersand hotel around 20-25th of january 2013 with my friend. We saw that hotel already inside and we liked it very much. So we decided to go back not just have a look but to spend one night in one of the beautiful room :)  We plan a big shopping and big party over there, and Ampersand hotel is in the center of London so everything seems perfect for us !

We are looking forward it !!!

Best regards 

M&K",5,2013,01,08
129,"Excellent boutique hotel, great value for the location","We booked this hotel to treat ourselves for a night before Christmas and it was the perfect choice. Just a minute's walk from South Kensington tube station, the location is unbeatable! If you were coming to London for the museums, you couldn't ask for a better spot. The lobby is warm and welcoming and the staff are very friendly and chatty. It's classy without being stuffy. The best part, however, is the room and the amazing shower in the bathroom - it is huge! With lots of great settings. There are even speakers for the radio in the bathroom so you can listen to tunes while you shower. The bed - huge and very comfortable. Would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone coming to London who wants luxury at a great price.",5,2013,01,08
129,Beautiful boutique hotel,"We stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions over Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.  The interior design is fabulous and the bedrooms very comfortable.  The location of the hotel couldn't be better.  A few minutes walk to some of the best museums and galleries in London, some good restaurants and the tube station from where we went directly to Kings Cross/St Pancras at the end of our stay.    The hotel itself has a great atmosphere and this starts with the enthusiasm and warmth of the reception staff.   I must add that breakfast was great value, either continental with many choices or a cooked breakfast which we had on most occasions.  This hotel is a delightful place to stay, be it business or pleasure.",4,2013,01,07
129,Terrific hotel!,"I stayed at the Ampersand for a 2 day business trip and it was terrific. The staff was excellent, and did everything possible to make my stay productive. The hotel is brand new, very interesting interior design and super comfortable beds and rooms. The food was excellent and the dining room staff friendly and attentive. No complaints and much to appreciate!",5,2013,01,07
129,A small luxury hotel at it's best!,"I was travelling with my 13 years old daughter to visit London. It was a pleasure to stay at The Ampersand. The quality of all services is really good, the young highly motivated staff is always on your disposal - as much as you like, very helpful and discreet. You feel, they are loving their jobs, each of them acts as a perfect host. We never saw a manager - maybe one of the friendly guys was the manager? - It is not important, you don't miss it - you feel to be in good hands in each moment. The surroundings of the hotel are also very good. Clean, safe and inviting for a walk - and of course the perfect position to visit the City of London.",5,2013,01,07
129,One of the best hotels I ever stayed in!,"I found a great deal via Secret Escapes and thought I'd surprise my boyfriend with a different Christmas present. We stayed at Ampersan's on Christmas Eve and were blown away! The hotel exceeded our expectations. Being yet another Small Luxury Hotel of the World, it does not fail to impress with little details. Loved the interior of the room and the breakfast was out of this world. Even the Birchermiesli tasted like back home (Switzerland). Thanks Ampersand!!

I'm planning to book an afternoon tea at this place very soon!! Cannot wait!",5,2013,01,06
129,A Very Pleasant Place for Afternoon Tea,"We visited the Drawing Room at the Ampersand Hotel for afternoon tea after a visit to the nearby V&A museum. The hotel is very conveniently located less than a minute from the South Kensington tube exit. The initial impressions were of a very pleasant and relaxed environment with modern furnishings. We both ordered the Classic Afternoon Tea (16.95 each) and selected from the extensive tea menu. The sandwiches were slices of rye bread with the toppings laid on top, a selection of 4 types. I associate afternoon tea with finger sandwiches but these were perfectly fine. The scones were small, crisp and very light and delicious with the strawberry jelly (no fruit pieces in the jam) and cream. The final tier was a selection of 5 small cakes, each about two mouthfuls and were delicious. Throughout the meal the service was excellent. Overall a very nice place to spend an afternoon and probably a place I will visit again on my next visit to the London museums.",4,2013,01,04
129,A special occasion made more memorable,"I booked a night stay at the Ampersand Hotel on New Year's Eve 2012/13 to treat my partner to a special NYE in London. The staff were extremely helpful before and during my stay, with the hotel having a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. As requested, the concierge arranged for a bouquet of flowers to be in the room on our return from a lovely day out in London where I had proposed to my partner (he said yes!). The hotel itself has a very modern style and is in a great location for local tourist sights. I cannot praise this hotel and our experience highly enough. I would most certainly visit again and would recommend this to all my family and friends.",5,2013,01,04
129,"Stylish, welcoming hotel, would recommend in a heartbeat!","We stayed for 1 night in January in a Deluxe room. The hotel is recently opened so everything has a lovely new, clean feel to it. The d√©cor is very modern and stylish, even the usually forgotten corridors have real character to them but it all feels very comfortable and laid back. It's not the kind of stylish 5* that leaves you feeling stiff and uncomfortable. In line with other reviews I do agree that the rooms are on the small side, even for London. We had a Deluxe which is the 3rd room category up and it was about the size of a standard in other hotels and next time we'll remember to request a room with a bath! The room was however really lovely, the furniture and fittings were of a high standard and the bed was very comfy. The bathroom wasn't huge but beautifully appointed, big fluffy towels and robes and an excellent shower and nice toiletries. I was very pleased to see fresh milk in the fridge to use, a detail many 5* hotels miss. They also give you complimentary soft drinks which is a nice touch. I was amazed to see that you could get a Full English breakfast on room service for ¬£10 plus 12.5% service charge which is surely the best value of any 5* in London. We had drinks in the bar before heading out for dinner and the service was friendly and they have a really interesting selection of cocktails and plenty of selection of spirits etc. There's some interesting touches, like the male hotel staff wearing Levi's with the hotel name/logo on the usual Levi tag and the coasters which are cocktail recipe cards. We didn't eat at the hotel but the food in the restaurant looked really nice and the cakes and pastries in the drawing room looked very tempting as did the breakfast menu which was incredible value for a 5*. Overall this hotel is doing all the right things, if it can maintain it's current prices and service levels it will do very well, if you want a 5* hotel in London this is the place to go!",5,2013,01,04
129,Everything was perfect!,"I have been to London several times I have finally found a hotel for future visits. I thought the room and bathroom were larger than I had previously experienced in London. I loved the high tea, the breakfast, and even the quiet lobby late in the evening for drinks. The location just a few feet from the South Kensington station is so convenient. 

The staff was wonderful and the best was when I arrived at the hotel very early (8am) from my international flight, they gave me a room. 
Thank you!",5,2013,01,03
129,Really nice boutique style hotel,"Very good hotel in a great location. The room was well furnished, the bed was comfortable and the staff were excellent. The only minor niggles were the room size which was (slightly) small and the room temperature which didn't seem to go low enough, but this might have been user error and was resolved by opening a window anyway.

The minor niggles were very minor and this is excellent value for money and I would definitely stay again.",5,2013,01,03
129,Great place to stay when you are a long way from home,"I have to say that my past visits to London hadn't endeared me to the city and I was dreading having to be there alone in winter for business. I was enormously surprised by the warm, pleasant atmosphere that characterizes this hotel. It is just across the road from the tube and there is a taxi stand outside often providing a cab when you need one. The hotel is surrounded by reasonable restaurants offering a range of cuisines to hungry travellers and it is a just a brisk shortish walk to the main attractions. Unfortunately, I didn't get to do much sight seeing, but it was nice to know there was lots to do nearby if the opportunity arose. On the whole, I found the trip much more bearable than I anticipated, and I attribute much of this to the high quality of the hotel. Biggest bonus of all: I now love London and I look forward to returning to the Ampersand on my next holiday in the northern hemisphere.",5,2013,01,03
129,"Perfect weekend getaway, and would be hard to improve.","My wife and I had a few christmas events booked over a weekend so booked two nights at the Ampersand and were very happy with that decision. The price we paid was extremely fair for the very high level of service, rooms and entrance were exceptional to look at and the facilities were very much up to standard.
Room furnishings are very cool, and the bed was to die for...we slept like hibernating bears.
Only minor observations could be the room size, for a couple with shopping bags etc it was a little cramped - and (hardly worth mentioning) but the shower controls are a bit out of touch, im a bit fussy but it was either really hot or really cold.
Otherwise a fantastic boutique style hotel with staff that are superb, and an outstanding location for tourists and shoppers who are visiting the west end and south west London. The Ampersand is literally across the street from the tube, and one block from Londons main museum quarter. Travel time on a red bus to Green Park and Piccadilly is a scenic twenty minutes.
Trust the Ampersand to deliver a stylish and comfortable few nights in a lovely setting and you wont be disappointed. ",4,2013,01,02
129,Lovely stay,"Stayed here on NYE. Hotel decor is gorgeous, modern and very stylish. Staff very friendly and helpful. Loved the bathroom all the goodies and the shower was amazing. Room was nice, with complimentary soft drinks however room was very small. We expected a bit of a small room in London but when we was shown the the room even the porter said ""oh small room"" as we opened the door onto the bed! As I say very nice hotel, will be going again but will be asking for a bigger room. Great location thanks again. ",4,2013,01,02
129,"""Just Perfect""","We had book the Champagne and Canapes in the evening, therefore decided to make a night of it and stay in London.  We looked on late rooms and then decided as we had booked the champagne and canapes then we would pay the extra and stay at The Ampersand.  So glad we made that decision.

When we arrived we were greeted at reception by your very helpful staff, who checked us in and gave us a free upgrade to a Luxury room, showed us the upstairs lounge area, and then took us and our bags to our room.  He explained how the lights, heating etc worked and showed us the mini bar.  When he had gone, we both said, ""wow"" this is amazing, what a lovely place and what lovely staff.  The room was lovely and clean, the bed was the comfiest bed we have slept in, the linen was so soft, everything was just perfect.  (the only negative we had, was that the shower pressure was not great and quite difficult to use, turning on/off).

We then went out of the hotel to Winter Wonderland and came back in time for our Champagne and Canapes at 7.30pm.  I have to say that we both said they were the best Champagne and Canapes we have ever had, all the flavours and tastes were just amazing.  In the evening we went out of the hotel for a couple of drinks and your helpful staff guided us in the direction of local pubs/bars.

In the morning we came down for breakfast, which again was fantastic.  When we were leaving the restaurant, we were greeted by the head chef, who said, would we like to be showed around, to which we said ""yes please"".  Forgive me as I cant remember the Head Chefs name, but he was a very delightful, professional chap.  He showed us around the rooms downstairs, the drawing room, the wine room and then he took us into the kitchen introduced us to his staff and showed us his kitchen and talked to us about the Hotel and restaurant and about our stay.  He then took us upstairs to the reception and let us choose 2 complimentary cakes from the afternoon tea selection to take on our homeward journey.

The overall experience at The Ampersand was just fantastic, we loved every minute of it, and have told friends about what a great place it is.  If only we could have stayed for a week.

I will be writing a 5* review on Trip Advisor about our stay and certainly continue to recommend The Ampersand to friends and family.

Thanks you for giving us such a pleasant stay hope to see you again soon.",5,2013,01,02
129,I love this hotel!,"We go to London at least 2 to 3 times per year to visit our kid. Have stayed in many hotels there but at the last trip, we stayed at the Ampersand and we were so happy with our choice. This is one of the best hotel we've stayed in with very attentive and courteous staff, luxurious rooms with very comfortable bed. It was recently refurbished and the fittings were all very modern and gave each of the rooms a personal touch. Lots of cafes and nice restaurants within walking distance and Hyde Park is just a stone's throw away.

Definitely, our first choice from now on when in London.",5,2012,12,31
129,Amazing doesn't do it justice!,"I booked this hotel for my husband's Christmas trip to London. I selected it based on the TripAdvisor reviews and it's location to the musuems he was wanting to visit. I cannot tell you how glad I did. The Ampersand staff was responsive to my every request. When the underground went on strike and was not available for transport from Heathrow to London, the hotel had a driver willing to pickup at 11:00pm. During this trip there were several revisions that needed to be made due to weather delays, sick children etc. The staff, and Myriam in particular, handle every request graciously. My husband said the property was beautiful and the room, although a bit small as reflected in the hotel information, was perfect for him as a single traveler. I am just sorry that my son's family was unable to join him as planned as I am sure they would have been equally pleased. If you want to be steps from the South Kensington station, have lovely accommodations and be treated royally - this is the hotel for you!! Thank you Ampersand for all you did to make the holiday wonderful.",5,2012,12,31
129,Christmas Afternoon Tea,Had a lovely Christmas themed champagne afternoon tea for two. It was so good! Portions were generous size (we couldn't even finish!) and the staff were very polite and friendly. It was beautifully decorated and nice atmosphere. Will definitely return and recommend to friends.,5,2012,12,31
129,The Best High Tea in London!,"I went to The Ampersand for Champagne High Tea and it was simply divine an experience. The staff were absolutely delightful - friendly and very accommodating. Service you rarely find these days.

The tea and coffee selection was wonderful as were the tatines and pastries. The scones were out of this world! The Champagne topped off a truly memorable afternoon.

10/10 in every respect. I will be returning!",5,2012,12,31
129,Great place!,Brand new very nice hotel in South Kensington. Rooms are small but with a lot of luxury and nice bath rooms. The atmosphere in the hotel is very nice and relaxed. Great location close to the subway and Hide Park. This is going to be my basecamp when staying in London!,5,2012,12,29
129,The best boutique hotel I've stayed in London,"Now I'm a hard one to please, but I can honestly say that The Ampersand goes way above all my expectations.  I spent five nights at the hotel and also arranged two events there as part of my wedding weekend.   The service, the kindness of the staff and most of all the quality of food by Head chef, Chris Golding, was of a very high quality.  When I checked-out, I felt a tinge of sadness to be leaving.  It had been my home for five nights and I just couldn't find one fault through out my whole stay.  I just want to say a huge thanks to all the waiters, chefs, reception staff and everyone else behind the scenes that made my stay so memorable.  I'll be back again!",5,2012,12,28
129,Great stay at the Ampersand,"We have just returned from a two night stay at the Ampersand. Staff were all very helpful and very accommodating. The hotel is beautifully designed. Loved the drawing room and the breakfast room (the Apero). The superior we stayed in was very comfortable, high ceilings, all the mod cons e.g hair dryer, iPhone docking station, great bathroom (a little small but well designed). Only complaint, the room gets very stuffy at night, window got stuck and once it was closed for us we didn't open again, the first morning was really noisy, not ideal for a lie in with door slamming, street noise and work taking place outside. Aside from a few kinks, a really great little hotel!",4,2012,12,28
129,Top place to stay,"We found the hotel through SLH.com and were very positively surprised. The Hotel was new since September 2012 and it is very nicely designed and properly maintained. We were lucky and got an upgrade to a suite which was very large and the shower even included a TV Set. Location is very convenient next to South Kensington Station and 15min walk to Harrods. 
Breakfast is good, especially the buffet is very nicely done and presented.",5,2012,12,27
129,What a find - a real GEM of a hotel,"Read about it in the Times earlier in the year, sounded good so booked for 2 nights, as it is so close to the RAHall and V&A and NHMuseum, also good transport links - buses and tube on the doorstep.  Staff were brilliant, so helpful and professional.  Bedroom very comfortable, bathroom WOW !
Best breakfast in London ever and dinner was a fine meal with wine at a reasonable cost - Brilliant chef.  We felt welcome the minute we entered the hotel and all staff were so friendly and helpful.
The design and decore is out of this world literally, being based on astronomy, colours were both vibrant and soothing.  Whoever put this together is a real class master, well done to all concerned. We shall be back !

129,Fantastic.,"My friend and I decided to go out just before Christmas to celebrate her birthday. The Ampersand is a two minute walk from South Kensington tube so it's very convenient. From the moment we arrived, the hotel staff did their upmost to make our stay perfect. We even got an upgrade, as it was a birthday weekend. 
The staff at the front desk were polite and efficient. We arrived early and our room wasn't quite ready, so we were directed to The Drawing Room where we had a complimentary cup of tea while we waited.  
We were shown to our room after a short while. The room was beautifully decorated and had lots of little touches, the iPhone docking station, television in the bathroom and bathrobe and slippers to name but a few. 
And after a (very) heavy night out, we had our continental breakfast delivered to our room in the morning. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I will definitely be returning in the new year. 
",5,2012,12,22
129,Superb from start to finish,"We booked this hotel because of its convenience for the V&A museum, as we had tickets for an exhibition. From the moment we arrived, it was a joy. The reception staff were warm, friendly and helpful- the young (German- according to my missus who is believed to be an expert, so he was probably Dutch or some such!) guy particularly; nothing was too much trouble. The room was beautifully arranged and incredibly comfortable, the bathroom was small but perfectly formed, and if you look to the left of the restaurant you'll find a games room which allowed us to have a nice game of wiff-waff (copyright- Boris Johnson). Nice touch! Good library too, if you have the time.

The only thing I'd be slightly picky about was the breakfast. Again, the staff were lovely- but the pricing system is somewhat bizarre. I'd booked for breakfast, but only a continental breakfast. If I wanted some hot food it had to be cooked to order and paid for separately from an additional menu. We did look at the menu, found it decidedly pricy- particularly as we thought we'd already paid- and stuck with the continental option. Which, in fairness, was very good and had a large selection of offerings. 

All in all, I'd struggle to find much in the way of fault. Fantastic staff, beautiful hotel, 1 minute from the tube station, good value for money. What's not to like? Congratulations Ampersand. Despite having a daft name, you're doing a great job!",5,2012,12,22
129,NICE SURPRISE,"We chose this hotel because it seemed like a great price. The hotel opened quite recently and it's not easy to find such a good price for a 5 star hotel in central London. Before we booked, we read the comments and looked at some of the pictures on TripAdvisor from previous guests, as well as checking the hotel's own webpage. And when we arrived, we thought 'Yes. Very good choice!' It has a lovely entrance, very elegant space inside, new furnishings with a nice mix between classic and modern. The room was perhaps a bit small but it was very nice, with a lot of attention to detail. Amazing bathroom, with a great walk in shower which we loved. There were free non-alcoholic drinks and of course tea and coffee. The only thing we would say is that it was slightly too hot in our room... Aside from that, the staff was very professional and all in all, yes, definitely a hotel we would go back to and would recommend to friends. Last but not least, the location was ideal with a great selection of pubs and restaurants with international cuisines, Spanish, Italian, Moroccan, and South Kensington tube station just 2 minutes' walk from the hotel!",5,2012,12,21
129,Great,"Excellent central location.  Fresh & pleasant athmosphere. All staff members were very helpfull, especially frontdesk. You'll have everything you need. Superior rooms are great & full of latest Tech. Slept so good. The matress is so so comfortable.
no hesitations this is probably one of the best hotels at the moment.

129,Amazing!,"Visited this hotel for one night whilst in London.  From the moment we arrived it was fantastic.....the staff were great, we checked in and were shown to our room and talked through what we had available in the room for us to use.  Rooms were lovely and clean, the mini bar was stocked with complimentary soft drinks, the bathroom was great with loads of products, bathrobes and slippers were a great touch. Great location as well was two minutes from South Kensington underground. We returned to the hotel about 7pm with the plan to freshen up and head out for dinner and drinks....but we stopped in the bar downstairs in the hotel and didn't make it any further!!  The cocktails were great, the bar staff were extremely helpful and polite, they have a large selection of spirits behind the bar, especially Vodka.  When my partner asked after one bottle they had the bartender offered him a sample then a sample of two others so he could compare, we were both really impressed with his knowledge. So we decided to have a look at the menu, the first reason we had decided to try somewhere else for dinner and drinks was we thought the restaurant would be expensive but this wasn't the case, we decided on the sharer chef's selection menu which was ¬£26 each - well worth every penny we shared a 5 course meal and we were full after 3! The food was amazing, it was nothing we would have picked ourselves but we both enjoyed every mouthful!! For 2 cocktails, 5 course meal and a bottle of lovely red wine was just over ¬£100 so not overpriced at all.  The breakfast in the morning was also just as great, there was a large selection of cold items, toast etc but hot breakfasts were being cooked to order. Over all this hotel was probably one of the best I have stayed in well worth the money.",5,2012,12,19
129,"Loved it. Superb staff, fab decor & great location","We stayed only one night (30th wedding anniversary) but will stay longer next time.  From the moment we walked in we were looked after by the loveliest staff I have experienced in years.  The lady on reception was the perfect example of how to do it right - first impressions do count - and had the friendliness / professionalism balance absolutely right.  Everyone we encountered smiled and greeted us and we felt welcome & cared for the whole time but without any intrusion. Our room (216) was lovely; very spacious with a huge and wonderfully comfortable bed and lots of thoughtful little extras - I do like attention to detail. The breakfast selection is fabulous & the pastries in the Drawing Room looked scrumptious.  The decor everywhere is bright, dramatic and stylish.  This special experience was worth every penny.",5,2012,12,19

129,Boutique Luxury Hotel in Great Location at Great Price,"I booked this hotel because of the location - wanted a bed for the night within staggering distance of a party we were attending. 

The Ampersand was the closest, but also the nicest. I was completely surprised by how nice the rooms were, and what good service we got. Also, the price of afternoon tea and breakfast were very reasonable, which is very unusual for hotels of this standard. Overall we had a great stay...",5,2012,12,18
129,Great place to stay for a bit of luxury,"We had a fantastic stay here which we both really enjoyed. Immaculate and tasteful decor, polite and attentive yet inobstrusive staff. Convenient location. The only small grumble I have is that the room was really warm and we couldn't seem to get it much cooler so we had to open the window which was a little noisy.
The bed was really comfy, the rooms were really clean. I wish all hotels were like this!!",5,2012,12,17
129,Brand NewDesign Hotel/ Great Location,"We stayed in the Deluxe studio room which was very spacious with modern decor. In the bathroom we both had a massive shower and bath tub with Television and underfloor heating. The service was impeccable. We were welcomed with very nice and courteous receptionists who escorted us directly to our room to see if everything was ok with us. We had complimentary soft drinks and water in the mini bar. The only problem was that our room heater was not wrking well which they tried to fix immediately. On the second day they also offered to upgrade us with a better room but we chose not to move an instead they offered us some complimentary drinks and tea. 
Great service and would go back any time.",5,2012,12,17
129,Overnight,"We stayed overnight at the Ampersand. Staff were very helpful and friendly. It is located in a very good area of London. It is one block away from the Natural History museum. The room was small but functional, with a huge bathroom and a double shower. Perfect weekend accommodation for couples.

Managed to get room service served in the drawing room at 01:30 in the morning.",5,2012,12,17
129,Can't wait to visit again!,"A fantastic experience - from the Guestfolio eConcierge email we received prior to our stay packed full of useful information to the warm, welcoming and relaxing atmosphere. Great location (literally 30 seconds from South Kensington tube), friendly staff, lovely food, superb cocktails - a brilliant example of a luxury boutique hotel getting it exactly right. We booked through Small Luxury Hotels of the World and received a room upgrade at check-in, but it wasn't a simple upgrade from double to superior, we were actually given the second best room in the house - a deluxe studio! Even without the upgrade, value for money was second to none. The Ampersand comes highly recommended, I'm already looking forward to my next stay!",5,2012,12,16
129,This is one hotel I'll use again,"After a disastrous stay at another London hotel earlier in the week, I stayed here on an overnight for another Christmas function in London.  This hotel can show the other how it should be done.
At check-in I was upgraded to a better room but I can appreciate others‚Äô comments about the small size of the rooms. However I had one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and there was  a great shower room packed with all sorts of complimentary goodies, including eye make up remover ‚Äì something I had run out of. Due to the recent fit-out, everything is brand new but it also takes excellent staff to make a good hotel and this hotel has them in all areas. The afternoon tea is very good value for money and the great thing about breakfast is that I only had to pay for what I ordered ‚Äì I did not pay over the odds to have items that I do not eat included. And it‚Äôs a long time since I ordered a  full English breakfast  and had kidneys and white pudding included.
Price, location, service ‚Äì all excellent. I shall definitely use this hotel again.",5,2012,12,15
129,Perfect location- very comfortable,"We absolutely loved this hotel.  It was perfectly situated near to South Kensington tube station, and within walking distance of the museums and great bars, cafes and restaurants.  I would not stay anywhere else in London.  South Kensington is a beautiful base, and with a child, it  felt very safe and relaxed.

The hotel interior is exceptionally well designed, the rooms and bathrooms are comfortable, elegant and our room (a superior double ) was spacious.  The mini bar was stocked daily with complementary soft drink, the room was immaculately cleaned and presented every day.  With all the necessary toiletries and comforts you would expect in a luxury hotel.

The hotel had a  relaxed feel, obviously this was due to the wonderfully warm welcoming staff.  Every member of staff we met were friendly, sociable and professional.  The manager has done a great job in creating a place were you really feel so at home and relaxed that you don't want to leave. We have stayed in many larger and exclusive hotels, but I really don't think you can beat this one. Reasonably priced, I would recommend anyone to stay here. We loved it.

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast each morning, in the restaurant which again had a great ambience with the interior design and relaxed feel.  All the food we ate in the hotel was excellent. 
We had a couple of hiccups with orders for drinks and room service got our order confused one day, but again the staff are alway happy to resolve it.

Perfect 5 night stay in London",5,2012,12,15
129,"Friendly staff, cosey beds, great view","Had a really nice stay in the Ampersand hotel. The staff were really welcoming and helpful, and the room was lovely- with juice, tea/coffee etc all high quality and included in price of stay. We didn't eat in hotel, but the cocktails were very good, and they carry a small but select collection of whiskey etc- worth an explore in the bar if you like to try different types. The hotel is well located - min walk to the south Kensington tube station, and five mins to natural history museum/science museum/V&A.
The only bad points were the expensive breakfasts, and they fact that we could hear the trains go under in the tube- but only sounded like distant rumble so didn't keep us up.",4,2012,12,13
129,Perfect for a break to the Capital,"Bravo The Ampersand- had a short break with my daughter for some shopping in London-fantastic, staff and service wonderful, helpful, polite, greeted with a smile. Great location for shopping, all within walking distance. Lovely places to eat locally, although the hotel takes some beating. Can't wait to re-visit- the comfy beds were just heaven.",5,2012,12,10
129,This might be my favorite hotel ever.  And I've stayed in a LOT of hotels.,"I'm actually only two days into a five day stay at this beautiful hotel and decided to post this review because I'm so impressed.  I travel frequently for business and it takes a lot for a hotel to stand out but this one has absolutely succeeded.  The lobby is exquisite.  The staff, though young, are all amazingly friendly and have gone out of their way to make me feel welcome.  I stayed in a Four Seasons hotel not too long ago and this hotel has so many more amenities than that luxury chain, although admittedly the rooms are smaller.  The room has more high tech features than any other hotel I've been in, with everything i-capable, touch controls for heat, maid service and privacy, plenty of charging stations, heated tile floors in the bathroom, a full size umbrella in the closet, motion sensor lights in the closet, beautiful decor, luxury sheets, a packet of makeup removers, loofas, manicure kits, and other beauty items, a mini bar stocked with complimentary soft drinks and water, a very cute coffee and tea bar, fluffy robes and slippers, and a gorgeous bath.  I want to bring home every piece of art in the public areas - all are gorgeous.  I can't imagine that I'll ever want to stay anywhere else.  Location - 30 seconds from South Kensington tube station - is fabulous.  I might not go home.",5,2012,12,10
129,Excellent hotel,"Brilliantly situated in cultured South Kensington, 100 metres from the tube and 5 minutes walk from the V&A and Natural History Museum.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated with courtesy and consideration by the young, friendly and very professional staff - nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel, opened in Aug 2012, is stylishly furnished and decorated with very comfortable and relaxing public rooms.  The superior bedrooms are the smallest and several reviewers have commented on the cramped nature of these rooms.  However, with luxurious beds,quality furniture and fittings, underfloor heating in the bathroom, robes and good quality toiletries, as well as complementary soft drinks from the minibar, few people are going to be too inconvenienced, particularly since the public rooms are so intimate and comfortable.  Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for and this is a wonderfully relaxing place to come back to after a day's sightseeing.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,12,07
129,& Comfortable & Stylish & A Must Stay!,"Stayed for one evening by myself upon my arrival in London before staying with friends. This was a cheery oasis from the rain and with all the comforts of home! The bed super luxurious for a hotel, and the marble bathroom quite opulent too. Being an artist, I found the decor very pleasing and it is fun to explore the Ampersand's quirky details. The friendly staff was quite amenable to my requests for room location, early check in, and offered to store my bags next morning so I cold take a quick browse through nearby V&A museum. Being a block from the tube is key, as well as a 5 min walk to two impressive museums and 10 to Harrod's. If you have time, the afternoon tea is delicious and a meal in itself! I would absolutely stay again, and hopefully next time, for longer!",5,2012,12,06
129,A tiny bit of heaven in all of the hustle & bustle,"This is a gorgeous hotel & we will definitely stay here again in the future.
The hotel was dressed for Xmas & was tastefully decorated.
The staff were very helpful throughout our stay, the facilities were first rate & the food was superb. I have already recommended this place to my friends.
The hotel is surrounded by lovely shops & restaurants & is just steps from South Kensington tube station & minutes from the Natural History Museum & the V&A.",5,2012,12,05
129,Friendly staff clean hotel,Stopped for a weekend break on the 30th November till the 2nd December. Booked through secret escapes. Check in was quick but never received our complimentary champagne. Rooms were clean but very cold heating was on to max but didn't get warm.cleaning of room hadn't been done when we returned at 4 o'clock to get ready to go out and see a show. Cleaners came while we was trying to get ready so told them it was not a suitable time. They did say they would come back later but told them not to bother. Continental breakfast was good and staff friendly.,3,2012,12,05
129,One night only,"Room was small but comfortable, with staff welcoming and helpful when we arrived. The breakfast service was very slow and confusing; we had been told it was included and no one told us that it was only the Continental part until after we had ordered. Even then we had to go to the counter for attention, rather than staff coming to our table. In contrast, when we had coffee later in the lounge by the reception, the young lady serving us was delightful. The hotel refurbishments are still not finished so there was a little noise from the works, but not enough to disturb us.",3,2012,12,05
129,Fantastic Hotel,"What a beautiful and friendly hotel. you could not fault anything apart from the size of the room. We had a superior, however had to move the chair from the dressing table as could not get round the bed! This did not spoil anything as the decor,complimentary drinks in a fridge (proper milk not little cartons!) and rubber duck in shower was fab.
would definately stay again and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,12,05
129,ALMOST THERE!,"The hotel staff were very good, cannot fault them, but the room was cold and the breakfast area really cold, also we would have liked  some savoury options with the continental style breakfast,
some breads and cheeses would have been nice, all the items were sweet, a bit much in the morning.  For me some drinking yoghurt would have been nice, I cannot drink milk so had dry cereal, previous hotels have had an option I could use on my cereal, particularly on the continent where they do tend to have a really good variety at breakfast time. Other than that I would have given top score",3,2012,12,04
129,Stayed one night.... wish we could have stayed 10!,"Quick hop from the Tube, just get on the right road the first time so you don't have to walk the block like we did, tons going on in the neighborhood if you want to go out and walkabout or eat.  Fast, efficient and friendly staff at check in.  Beautiful lobby and reception area, looked like a lovely place to spend some time relaxing in.  Help with luggage to and from the room available without request, bellman also gives you a rundown on the rooms amenities as they are very techno-friendly and full of gadgets.  Rooms not big by any means but in London not a huge surprise, large bathroom with a great shower and a lovely toasty heated tile floor.  Best bed I have ever slept in, EVER!!! IPod dock on alarm clock radio at bedside, free nonalcoholic mini bar, tea, coffee and snack biscuits and a lovely view out the window to the beautifully lighted Natural History Museum behind the hotel.  Checked in the day they opened the 4th floor, didn't hear any other or see any other construction, so noise was not a problem (this was a week day) didn't hear a peep from anyone outside on the busy street or outside the room.  Only minor thing was the next morning we had lukewarm water in the shower which wasn't so pleasant when it was only 37*F outside, but I'm sure it was just an opening glitch and it wouldn't keep us and won't keep us from checking back in.",5,2012,12,03
129,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel on a deal as we had booked to see The Bodyguard at the Adelphi and I thought this would be a great way to spend a nice weekend in London and we were not disappointed.  Arrived around 1.00pm and greeted by a very helpful bell man who helped with my bags as hubby was waiting outside in the car as were on route to our booked parking space in Earls Court area.  I waited at Reception and I was checked in very quickly and offered a very nice room to which I was shown very efficiently by the Bell Man.   Our deal was through Secret Escapes which included a deluxe room with continental breakfast and 2 classes of moet chandon which we opted to have on our return from the theatre.

This hotel has only recently opened after renovation and was beautifully done.  The reception was beautiful and contemporary with a lovely Xmas Tree and delightful lighting all the way up the stair well.  The rooms are well appointed, clean and had enough space to enjoy a very comfortable stay, beds to die for!!!. Beautifully designed too with electronic door scans and touch pad heating and lighting facility which was very easy to use and the room was very comfortably heated.  Walk-in rain shower and well appointed bathroom, TV with huge choices of both music and films if required.

The Hotel is very well situated just 2 min walk to South Kensington with lots of nice eateries around the area. Although we did not try the restaurant having had the continental breakfast which was superb and again served by very helpful and courteous staff I am sure the Aperto would have been a delight.

I will certainly return to this hotel and would recommend you stay if visiting London for a nice weekend.

Congratulations to all staff who are I am sure an asset to this hotel and will keep guests returning",5,2012,12,03
129,Afternoon Tea for Two,"The Ampersand Hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from South Kensington tube station so easy to get to and very convenient for combining with a visit to the Vand A or a shopping trip.
Newly refurbished, the inspiration for the stylish interiors was drawn from the surrounding museums.
The Drawing Rooms where tea is served feature an eclectic mix of art, bold patterned wall papers and colourful upholstery fabrics with an animal and bird theme.

Afternoon tea for two with bubbly was a good deal booked via Lime and Tonic.
I went with a friend and we started with a glass of Moet et Chandon Champagne and made our choice of tea menu. There was a traditional tea with little open sandwiches (tartines) or one with savoury gougeres. The day we went there was also a chocolate themed tea menu. We chose the traditional menu which I had with Darjeeling tea.
The tartines were topped with savoury honey-glazed ham with sauce gribiche; a tangy coronation chicken; Goldstein smoked salmon with dill and cream cheese; and cheese with fruit chutney.
The scone was light with a crisp exterior and the little cakes tasted as good as they looked.
We were about the last to leave and it was one of the best afternoon teas I have had.",5,2012,12,02
129,Excellent staff,"Visited for afternoon tea with a friend. What stood out was the laid back, peaceful and roomy feel of the place as well as the wonderfully friendly staff. It was luxurious but not stuffy and its nice to see happy staff wearing jeans but still with smart waistcoats and shirts. We didn't want to leave because its so laid back and chilled.
The head chef,  Chris , even took us on a tour of the kitchen, restaurant and private eating rooms. Its a beautifully furnished hotel and the staff seem really proud to show it off. Very impressed and will soon book to eat in Apero, the main restaurant,  for dinner. I hope its success doesn't change the vibe of the place and the personal attention that the staff give to each diner.",5,2012,12,02
129,ENTHUSIASTIC STAFF,"This hotel gets a 5.0 mostly because of its smiling, friendly, warm and enthusiastic staff. It is very clear that they are on a mission to satisfy their guests and do so wholeheartedly. The lady who checked us in was a great resource throughout our stay, the bell captain was seemed to actually enjoy his job and interaction with the guests and during afternoon tea we had a riot with a young lady called Kat. We invited some American guests who were in London and they had a ball talking to Kat and we even received a ""refill"" of sandwiches. The GM came out of her office and welcomed us on arrival. If we may make a suggestion, it would be great if the room (we were in 207) had some additional lights, perhaps a standing lamp in a corner for some warm lighting as it can be a little dark in the room. 207 is a great room, at the end of a corridor, a kind of corner room with the windows looking down on Harrington Road and the bathroom had a window around the corner. The walk-in rain shower was brilliant and almost large enough to do some running around! Tips: if you need to charge batteries while out, make sure to ask housekeeping  not remove the card key which keeps the electricity going. Also, if your room should be cold, get in touch with reception and they'll send an engineer who cranks up the heat and you will be very, very warm. Hotel is not all stuffy and there are shiny white Mac desktops downstairs where one can work in peace--comparable to a first class airline lounge. Finally, the beds provide excellent sleep quality.",5,2012,12,02
129,A nice hotel in a perfect location,"Good stuff first: the hotel location is the best we ever had in London: smack in the middle of one the most pleasant London neighbourhoods and within two minutes of the tube. As the hotel has very recently reopened under a new name after a complete refurbishment, everything is brand new and fully functional - from furniture to large flat screen TVs and fancy touch controlled climate controls.
We spent the first two nights in a so called ""Standard Double"" room which we found a kind of a misnomer: in no universe should that be a standard, it should rather be marketed as a ""Single Contortionist Midget Travelling Light"" room. Both of us being rather skinny than fat, we had to literally squeeze our way sideways between the bed and other furniture/walls, the only place to put our bag was found in the bathroom behind the toilet, there was nowhere to hang clothes: the ""closet"" compartment not tall enough to hold even moderately long clothes shares this tiny space with coffee/tea making facilities. There is no bedside table on one side of the bed: nowhere to put your glasses/book/whatever before falling asleep.
We asked for an upgrade to a larger room and got a Deluxe Double which set us back quite a few pounds sterling. That room was of a much more generous size though not huge by any standard. There was enough room for everything with the sad exception of clothes: the closet compartment was a bit taller but you still should be prepared for a shower of cups and glasses on your feet when removing a longer garment from there.
Both rooms were very soundproof - we have not heard a sound from other guests. The only sad exception was the construction noise from the parts of the hotel still under construction, but the construction might be hopefully over by the time you are reading this.
The WiFi signal was quite weak in both rooms (both on the 4th floor) - only one of the three wireless devices we had was able to pick it up at all.",4,2012,11,29
129,Hidden Gems in Kensington,"Stay for 3 nights for holiday.

The Ampersand put us on perfect vacation. Having stayed for 3 nights in this newly refurbished boutique hotel, we are happy that we spent a bit more in Deluxe studio rather than superior room. The room size is a lot bigger than london standard with bath tub next to the windows. It is big enough for our 5 luggages and still plenty of space to walk around. The bed is perfectly comfortable, and the bathroom has also good size with Miller Harris amenities. Staffs have great service mind, and wifi is free

Location is perfect, just 1 min walk from South Kensington tube station for Piccadilly, circle and district line; short walk to museums and Knightbridge; 10 mins direct bus to oxford street.

Never try the breakfast, but there are couple of hip cafes nearby the station.",5,2012,11,27
129,Beautiful new hotel with great staff,"My partner and I spotted this hotel on a deal and thought we would check it out for a night. 
It had only recently opened after renovation and was beautifully done. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful and we were lucky enough to get an upgrade which was a nice bonus. On checking in we were taken to our room and had everything explained.
The rooms were well appointed, clean and had enough space to stay comfortably. Very nicely designed too which isn't that common with a lot of traditional hotels in London. 
Also very easy to get around with the tube so close. 
Would recommend this to London visitors and locals.",5,2012,11,26
129,Perfect!!,"We stayed for just the one night on Saturday 24th.  So wish we could have stayed longer.  We stayed in a deluxe room which was simply stunning and so very comfortable. Attention to detail was fabulous down to the egyptian cotton bed linen, jielde and original btc lighting, Miller Harris toiletries - pure quality.   The staff were ultra friendly but not in your face,  The continental breakfast had a great choice including freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh coffee, fresh fruit, pastries etc a huge choice. Public areas are stunning and again attention to detail second to none. I would be back in a flash and higly advise anyone to visit for a stay or just to experience a delightful afternoon tea in the delightful drawing room.",5,2012,11,26
129,"Fantastic hotel, can't wait to go back.","Have just returned from a long weekend in London to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday, and stayed 3 nights at this hotel.  The experience was great from start to finish.  We had asked for 2 x twin rooms, and whilst the rooms are slightly on the small side, it wasn't a problem at all.  The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in, the rooms are beautifully decorated, there is a mini bar with complimentary tea/coffee/water/soft drinks/fresh milk, the room had a TV and air conditioning, and the windows can be opened. Bathrooms are modern and quality complimentary toiletries are provided.  All the members of staff were helpful and friendly without being instrusive, our rooms were made up every day by the time we got back to the hotel late afternoon.  We had a package which included continental breakfast and there was a good selection to choose from at breakfast.  The hotel is across the road from South Kensington tube station giving easy access to all areas of London. I would absolutely recommend this hotel and look forward to visiting again.",5,2012,11,26
129,Fantastic hotel. Hits the mark on every point.,"We were thrilled to discover this nearly brand new Boutique Hotel at the last minute. A gem in every way. Super location, beautiful decor, both public and private
spaces. Both cafe and Formal restaurant; Aparo were excellent. Great value. I actually thought they made a mistake!  High-tech and convenient. Modern and stylish interior. Nice gymnasium, WI-FI is free, mini fridge with free soft drinks, rooms are spacious and immaculate. Bathrooms are similar to those found in much higher priced hotels. I will definitely return!",5,2012,11,25
129,Excellent Experience,"My sister & myself have just stayed for 2 nights in this lovely hotel.
From the moment we stepped through the doors we had an excellent experience.
We were greeted immediately with someone to take our bags & although we had arrived 2 hours early our room was ready. We were shown to our room where everything was explained to perfection.
We had booked a superior twin & it was a stylish adequate room & superb bathroom with fab shower & quality Miller Harris shower gel etc. There is Free coffee, tea, biscuits & the fridge was stocked with a variety of free soft drinks. As for the beds & linen they were perfect & we both had wonderful nights sleep.
The location is fabulous, just a stone throw from South Kensington tube & a short walk to both the V&A & Harrods.
Breakfast was good the eggs benedict ample & tasty as was the smoked salmon & scrambled eggs washed down with coffee which was good value...a reasonable ¬£27.
On check out there was an efficient system for storing all of our luggage etc & the staff throughout our stay couldn't have been more helpful & polite.
The interior design of the whole hotel although not yet finished was unusual & stylish & the attention to detail was superb....little details & a clever play with words which was really quirky.
If I was being picky & had to think of a down side it would be more coffee in the room & probably to provide a quality instant instead of or as well as a ground coffee as it didn't make much.
All in all we would say that for a luxury hotel in the location & for the price it would be difficult to beat & we would definitely stay again & recommend....an excellent experience.",5,2012,11,24
129,Nice Hotel,"My wife and I stayed overnight with another couple the primary purpose of our visit being a Thames Dinner cruise. The hotel was chosen as it appeared newly furnished high quality, good value and close proximity to the tube station offering quick and easy access into London.
We werent disappointed first impressions were very good. We had cocktails and coffees in the bar which small but very pleasant. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food and drinks seemed reasonably priced for a central london hotel. We had contintental breakfast the following morning which was nice. Our two rooms were different the other couple had walk in shower in the bathroom and a bigger room. Both rooms newly furnished and decorated and looked good. Ours had the shower over bath in bathroom. Beds very comfortable.
Both rooms looked out onto the street. As you come out of the tube station you can almost see the hotel straight away. Our only concern was both couples heard street noise throughout the night. We spoke to the staff in the morning who were very receptive to the feedback and indicated they would look at the soundproofing of the windows in those particular rooms.
Overall though good stay for our intended purpose.",4,2012,11,24
129,Outstanding customer service - hotel with a heart!,"My husband and I were supposed to stay in the Ampersand on 22 & 23 of November, for a long awaited, jam packed trip to London. Sadly, our beloved miniature dachshund became extremely ill whilst we were taking her to the dog sitter and we had to abandon our trip. I informed the Ampersand we would not be arriving as planned, and was informed, as expected, that they would still have to charge me for the first night's accommodation.

A few hours later I received an email from the Ampersand, offering their thoughts for the health of my dog and advising that they would forgo the usual charge in this case.

I'm so surprised that the hotel has seen things from a human perspective, and had empathy with the situation my husband and I found myself in. We will rebook our trip to London at some point in the future, and we will be staying at the Ampersand. Thank you so much to everyone at the hotel that was involved in making this kind decision, and particularly to √âadao√≠n for her thoughtful email.",5,2012,11,23
129,I still really want to like this hotel...,"This is a newly opened hotel, very close to South Kensington Tube station. Some parts of the hotel are not open yet, but this is not a problem.
The hotel is attractive because the rates are relatively good, it has a comfortable, upmarket, designer feel, and it is new.
The reception staff were very attentive and efficient, and show you personally to your room.
The first room I was given, on the ground floor behind reception (005 I think) had 6 noisy air-con units immediately outside the window, which I consider unacceptable - they should pay you to stay in such a room! I was allocated another room without much fuss. It wasn't too bad - though pretty small (about 1 metre of space around the bed) and without direct light - window looked out onto a space in the middle of the building (room 102).
I became frustrated by the TV system which proved very poorly responsive to the remote. The bathroom was lovely - brand new and pristine. The waterfall shower was missing part of the nozzle, which was a shame, and the temperature control for the water wasn't easy to manage. Soap etc, towels, all good. There was some wallpaper missing in one corner of the room.

So - could be a good venue, if you get a good room - but an inferior experience if you are allocated a room like the one I had.",3,2012,11,22
129,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here in September through a Secret Escapes promotion. The photos online really do for once, the hotel justice.  Bright, classy interiors - you could still smell the paint it was that new.  The bedrooms was small but perfectly formed.  The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in, I didn't want to get up.  Great location with lots of places to eat and have coffee and within walking distance to the museums and Harrods. The bathroom was well fitted out with a large walk in shower. Everything was spotless.

The staff were very helpful and cheerful which all added to the ambience of the hotel.  Breakfast was included with a wide choice.

I would definitely stay here again and hope to return in the new year.",5,2012,11,22
129,Too small room,"A very bad experience. Our room was a standard room for 2 persons. I‚Äôve never seen a smaller room anywhere in the world. There was less than 1 meter free space around the bed (which was smaller than average, probably 140 cm wide). There was absolutely no room for a suitcase, not even your shoes, no place to hang the overcoats. There was a desk and a chair on one corner of the room and you had to jump to the bed to pass them! The bathroom was also very small and its door opened to the room but only partly because the bed was so close to it. This size room is an insult to the visitor. We had a booking for 3 night and we complained about the room and were given a bigger one. But still it had the same size bed which is too small for 2 adults. I was ready to pay extra for a bigger room but those were not available.

When we left they tried to charge me for 2 ‚Äúextra nights‚Äù although I had paid everything in advance. That was resolved. After that they charged me double prize for some extra hot food we had on a breakfast. At that point I had no time to argue about it because we had a plane to catch and I paid it.

If you go to this hotel, avoid the standard room. The other room categories are so expensive that you can go to another better hotel instead. So my advice is: avoid this hotel.",1,2012,11,21
129,Nice new hotel with wonderful service and a great location,We stayed here for our 2 night precruise stay in London and liked it so well we booked it for our 1 night post cruise stay. The hotel has been recently renovated so the rooms are all clean and modern but it is the service and location that make this property a real winner. We will definately stay here on our next trip to London. Be aware that the rooms are very eurtopean so are a touch on the small side but still very comfortable!,5,2012,11,20
129,Perfect,"Perfect location, lovely decor, well equipped room including tea coffee making facilities, the room was a bit small, our room was on the back of the hotel which was extremely quiet which was amazing considering the location of the hotel. ",5,2012,11,18
129,Wonderful London Stay,"The Ampersand made our first-time London experience very enjoyable and we would definitely return if this standard is maintained. 

Pros:
1. Location - Steps from South Kensington station which has 3 different lines so we were able to reach all the desirable places (Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, London Eye, The Tower of London, Eurostar station, Harrods, ect.) on one of the lines without the hassle of changing lines. There also is a lovely little square with numerous places to eat when you exit the station. 

2. Staff & Service - Very friendly and accommodating and we felt very welcomed every time we returned from a day out. They were very nice about accommodating an early check-in as my husband was not feeling well upon arrival. We were also not disturbed at all by housekeeping during our 3 night stay with our do not disturb sign. We tended to leave our room around noon after sleeping in and the room was always made-up upon return in the evening.

3. Decor - Clean, spacious, and beautiful interior/colors. We had the deluxe studio and the room was spacious with seating arrangements and a nice-sized bathroom with tub and shower. The shower had a lovely rainfall showerhead. The Miller Harris amenities was also a nice touch. 
Another thing that worked for me was the fact that I was able to open the windows to air out the room. The room smelled nice but I'm quirky about being able to open windows so it was a huge plus for me. 

4. Free Wifi and Computer/Printer Area and Library with ping-pong table and book selections - Had no trouble with wifi for both our phones and laptop in the room.

5. Complimentary drinks in the fridge that are restocked daily. 

Cons: Not that many and nothing major honestly.
1. Slight rumbling from the underground tube during early hours but not very noticeable unless you are highly sensitive. My husband is on the sensitive side but he didn't have a problem at all.

2. Hotel Entrance - the entrance is merely a double door a few steps up from the sidewalk. We didn't know that it was the hotel at first as there is no driveway or doorman/bellboy outside. There is a friendly staff who is willing to help with luggage once inside though. 

3. Closet space - There wasn't a lot of space to hang longer clothing such as coats and dresses in our room. 

We have stayed at 3 different hotels that are part of the Small Luxury Hotel collection so far and this was our favorite. We didn't get to dine at the Apero but did have a cup of tea in the Drawing Room and it was simple yet tasty. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to my family/friends visiting London if they are looking into luxury boutique hotels.",5,2012,11,18
129,SHORT BREAK,"We arrived at the hotel on Sunday 11/11/12 and was staying for 3 nights.The reception staff was very helpfull.
Only 1 room was ready for us so we left the cases in there and went for a walk.
The hotel is 10 min walk from Harrods.There is a bus stop, outside the front door, where you can catch the service or the tourist bus.
This is a new hotel with all the up to date gadgets available.
There is also a gym available.
The carpark if you have to use it is quite expensive.
The only disappointing thing was that there was still work going on in a room next to ours and the hammering and drilling started at 8.00 am.There was no notification of this at time of booking or on arrival.",4,2012,11,18
129,good value,"A contemporary funky modern hotel.  Always clean and the rooms are well furnished. Very comfortable beds, luxury bathroom with robes and slippers.  The hotel is however directly build over a tube line which can be heard all over the hotel.  But this would't put me off staying as I have stayed a few times.",5,2012,11,17
129,Best London Hotel Opening 2012,"I have checked in at the Ampersand Hotel on the official opening day 29-Aug for a very long weekend. Kept all arrangments (show tickets, museum entries, lunch + dinner reservations etc) to the hotel and they were great. All was very well arranged by Indira. Her colleague Salvatore spent over 30mins with me upon arrival to go through all the arrangements - that was great! The room was beautiful, especially the bathroom. The location of the hotel is the best! You have the tube station South Kensington less than 1min walk, making it easy to reach any point of interest within maximum 20mins as the most important tube lines are meeting in this station. It is about 10-15mins walk to Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens and Royal Albert Hall. V&A and Natural History Museum are about 4/5mins walk. 
As I checked in on the offical opening day, there was still work in other rooms going on, but I did not hear anything, just saw some builders/carpenters walking around. All staff is very friendly and going the extra mile - especially Front Desk and Bell Captain.
Have booked already my next trip to London in February! :-)",5,2012,11,17
129,"Nice boutique hotel, but tiny (!) rooms","Recently spend 5 days at the Hilton Park Lane in London and decided to try this new boutique hotel for our last night.  The location is convenient (right off the South Ken stop) and safe.  You can literally spell the fresh paint in this place having just opened 2 months ago.  Rooms (and bathrooms most importantly) are really well appointed and the whole hotel has a nice, luxurious feel.  I was a little disappointed by how small (!) the rooms are - our room was literally a bed (with barely enough room to walk around). I def can't imagine staying in such a small room for more than one night.  Also, when my wife checked in there was no door man to help her with 2 large suitcases.  The staff was very friendly however and helped us even though we made a gaffe on the dates for our reservation. Overall, nice place but not sure I'd stay there again given a choice.",4,2012,11,17
129,Wish I could have stayed longer,"This place was wonderful. I only stayed one night here but it was excellent. Plus the staff was wonderful with me after I checked out also. Thanks for making my stay for one night enjoyable and will come again.

The only problem was the do not disturb sign did not work very well. I had put the do not disturb sign on but was still interrupted by the maid the next day.",4,2012,11,16
129,An understated gem,"This is a well priced hotel in the heart of south Kensington. It is within walking distance of the major museums and shopping temples such as Harrods and yet still in an area which retains some of the real London. 
The hotel itself is stylish and modern with helpful staff who are there to provide a service, not pass judgement as some of the poincier hotels in this class do.
My only criticism is that the room is overheated - a problem which is solved by turning off the air con and opening the windows slightly. The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom well appointed.",4,2012,11,15
129,"Very nice hotel, but....","We had 3 nights at the Ampersand with our children.
A suite and a luxury room and the rooms are beautifull, beds are great, the ""decor"" is very nice.
The only problem was with breakfast, very good but no way to have what we ordered which was not very complicate as it was some toasts !
They never came, from the 1st day to the 3rd one, no way to have what you order... The service is very long I have been waiting about 15 mns before I had my cup of coffee.
Little problems with wifi in the suite, hot water quite cold for a bath but nice and friendly place to stay.",4,2012,11,14
129,Boutique Chic,"Had a delightful one night stay at the impeccable newly opened Ampersand Hotel. I wish it had been longer. Excellent service at check-in - you are taken to your room and certain features explained. I was in a standard room - small but perfectly formed! Very comfy bed. Beautifully decorated with all the features you would expect - flat screen tv, wifi etc. 

The tea tray is in the wardrobe for space saving but had a good selection including a cafetiere and lovely biscuits.  Fridge full of complimentary soft drinks.

Lovely bathroom and products. Everyone got a rubber ducky except me! 

We took breakfast the following morning, which wasn't included in the room but was extremely reasonable - ¬£8 for a huge plate of eggs benedict.

And the location is superb- meters fom Sourh Kensington tube and so perfect for the museums and Royl Albert Hall.

Highly recommended!",5,2012,11,13
129,I wasn't ready to leave,"I loved my stay here at the Ampersand. The location is great, right across the street from the South Kensington tube station. Near multiple museums and walking distance to Harrods (about 15 minutes). Lots of great places to eat nearby as well as shopping. 

The staff is great. Very courteous and friendly and they remember you by name which is a very nice touch. I love the modern decor and the comfy beds. The bathroom amenities are plentiful, with soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, loofah, sewing kit, vanity kit (nail file, q-tips and cotton pads), a robe and slippers. They even had wash clothes, which while common in the States, is a rarity in the places I've stayed in Europe. Large umbrellas are also placed in the room for use while in London. There is also a complimentary minibar with apple juice, orange juice, sparkling water, mineral water, coke and diet coke which is replenished daily. A selection of tea along with a package of shortbread cookies is also complimentary and restocked daily.

There is free wifi available as well as a small business center with 2 computers and a printer in the sublevel. There is also a small gym there with complimentary water and towels.

There was some final construction going on while I was there that would start fairly early in the morning (around 9am or so). Also, the maid service starts pretty early as well, which was a bit of a surprise.

All in all, a great stay and I would not hesitate to stay there again when I'm in London.",5,2012,11,12
129,Top class service in a nice part of London,"Just returned from a four night stay at The Ampersand. The Deluxe Studio was good sized and very comfortable and stylish. Amenities in the bathroom was good. It was a nice touch to have books placed in the room ranging from books on the city to gardening and bedtime stories.

As pointed out by many others, service was top class. Professional yet sincere. The staff always had a smile for you and are always eager to help.

Location was a bit further from the shops and hence was not ideal for the shopaholic in me. But close to the tube and there are various buses available to all parts of London. Will stay again for the service and beautiful rooms.",5,2012,11,11
129,Perfection,"During October I've had the pleasure to stay two times in this magnificent hotel. The first time was a scheduled stay and the second I rushed there escaping from the worst [--] in London called The Marble Arch by Montcalm, a review that I will post soon. Even though it was fully booked and midnight, the wonderful staff did their best to find me a room to stay just for the night. Thank you so much for that. Anyways, the Ampersand is really one of the best hotels you can find in London.  I've stayed in a deluxe studio which is literally jaw dropping. Huge, especially for London, with an enormous bed, a freestanding bath by the window, bathroom with tv, nespresso machine with the most delicious butter cookies complimentary (my favorite morning ritual) and a big wardrobe.The decoration was amazing highlighted with grey, blue and yellow tones. The lobby and the restaurants are also fantastic. The staff super polite and helpfull. And the location just 15 min by feet from Harrods. I swear to you, choosing it you can't ask for more. Impeccable.",5,2012,11,09
129,excellent,"Stayed here for one night only. The hotel was easy to get to very close to Souyh Kensington tube station close to Kensinghton High St which is a nice shopping Street,the musuems including the Natural History musuem Victoria and Albert Musuem, Kensington Gardens and The Royal Albert Hall. The hotel is very modern recently refurbished in a boutique style nice decor and furnishing.,The bed was extremely comfy and complimentary soft drinks from the mini bar was a nice touch. Breakfast was ok nothing special and the service was slow. However staff at check in very effecient and friendly. Would stay again",5,2012,11,08
129,Nice new hotel,"Stayed in this hotel before a trip out on the Orient Express.

The major plus points are that it is a nice quirky hotel a stones throw from South Kensington tube.

The hotel is furnished to a high standard and the continental buffet breakfast which we had included was more than adequate.

The major negatives are that the rooms are tiny even by London standards!  We had a superior room (not the cheapest smallest rooms either) and it was so small that if the chair was tucked under the dressing table you could not walk behind it as the chair touched the bed. I would say that the room was smaller than my own bedroom. Obviously can't comment on other rooms in the hotel.

Also there is no mirror in the bedroom (room 310) so as a lady there was no where you could put on your makeup in natural daylight.  Also it meant there was no where to blow dry your hair or use hair straighteners and actually see what you are doing, obviously should have packed an extension lead that would have reached to the bathroom!!

If the rooms were a little bit larger and there was a mirror in the bedroom I would have scorred this hotel 5 out of 5",4,2012,11,07
129,Great Value,"We stayed here on 3 November as we were in London and saw a review in ""The Times"" which gave details of a opening offer. 

The Hotel is very well located for the V&A which we had tickets to go to and the staff very friendly. They were unable to fit us in for afternoon tea (our fault as we had not booked and turned up at 4.30 to see if we could get in) but they accomodated us in the restaurant and this turned out to be better from our point of view as the head chef and pastry chef came out to apologise and spent time chatting to us about the food and hotel . On the Chefs recomendation we had the full english breakfast and we would say it is a must (and great value for Central London)

The rooms was excellent and we  were even give a up grade",5,2012,11,04
129,Beautiful modern hotel with great staff,"My wife and I spend three nights at The Ampersand Hotel on Honeymoon and it was fantastic. Very well located within about 100 metres of South Kensington tube station which made it very easy for us to get about the hotel has very modern features and is excellently finished which allows it to retain a very definite character. The room has probably the best, most comfortable king sized  bed i've slept in! All staff we met were superb and extremely friendly interacting on a genuine and personal, but not intrusive, manner. The surrounding area has numerous eateries, restaurants and cafes and as such we didn't eat there. We saw the afternoon tea being served and it looked extremely good. If we'd had more time and less commitments elsewhere we would certainly have made the effort to eat there.

I noticed a couple of reviews referencing noise from the tube nearby and whilst we noticed it a couple of times it in no way interrupted our sleep etc. (we live in the countryside normally so it is something we would have picked up on).",5,2012,11,02
129,Beautiful hotel,Even though it's right by the tube station  it was not that noisy but the studio room we had was brillant and because we had to wait for our room we were given a free glass of champagne each in the bar. Check in and out was quick and friendly and room service was fab. I would stay here again but the restuarant was too cold for me,4,2012,11,01
129,Pleasant Dreams,"Some building work ongoing so main entrance unavailable.
The hotel is beautifully decorated and furnished
Best aircon ever in a hotel room and the most comfortable bed/quilt/pillow combination we have experienced. The only downside on 1st floor east side is constant deep booming bass drone from next door building - not the hotel's fault though so keep windows closed.",4,2012,10,31
129,"Delicious high tea, beautiful hotel.","We visited this hotel on Saturday for the Champagne high tea. Service was very quick and friendly, and the tea room is beautiful. We were there a couple of hours but the time flew by. The sandwiches and cakes were absolutely delicious and we left feeling full! Great value for money thanks to Lime & Tonic, and we would love to go back again.",4,2012,10,29
129,Simply the best!,"Currently staying in a superior room on the ground floor. 

What we love:
1. The bed is the best hotel bed we've slept in .
2. The check in staff were friendly and extremely efficient. 
3. The staff uniform- check out the jeans!
4. The Barman on the Saturday night made the best cocktails and very knowledgeable about his alcohol. 
5. Location!
6. Gadgets in your room. 

Easy to say we have found our favourite London hotel and will be booking again when we return in January. 

All this and we still have another night to go! Right, time to check out breakfast...",5,2012,10,28
129,"Lovely room, great location, noisy builders","Great location just by  Kensington tube station so perfect for museums and other attractions. Lovely room in this smart, newly-refurbished hotel.  Bathroom well-appointed and great toiletries. Friendly service, staff helpful and relaxed yet attentive. Cellar bar/restaurant was a great place for a drink in the evening and the afternoon tea in the lounge area looked sensational; sadly, we didn't have time to try that.

We were awoken early the next morning with loud builders noise from the floor below; not a great start to the day and not what we expected at this price point.

We would stay again, but have to make sure all the building work has been finished!",4,2012,10,26
129,New hotel in South Kensington,"Stayed in a Deluxe room at the Ampersand for three nights on business in mid-October.  Hotel is new in that it was purchased and completely renovated, and reopened recently. Small and quiet, with small but well-appointed exercise room with new gym equipment/cardio machines. Outstanding service from the front desk to housekeeping. Requests were followed up within a short time, assistance on where to eat, how to get places, etc., was pleasantly and thoroughly provided, including arranging room service breakfast before the normal breakfast hours.  Room was decently-sized for London, very attractive, good lighting, reasonable desk, and the best bed and pillows I've had in any hotel, regardless of caliber. Best feature:  mini-frig stocked with complimentary water, Coke, juices, and even a little container of milk for coffee/tea.  Bathroom was comfortably sized, good shower, plush towels, bathrobe and slippers.  Exceptionally clean.  Location is superb with many small table service and quick service restaurants, bakeries and express food stores anywhere from across the street to an easy couple minutes walk away.  Tube stop (South Kensington) a short half block down the street.  Lots of cabs available in area, too. Heathrow Express shuttle service got me from hotel to the airport for 15 pounds, far less than cabs and hotel's car service.",5,2012,10,25
129,Wonderful Ampersand,"Just returned from a two night stay at the Ampersand, and what a wonderful Hotel it is! From the minute I arrived we knew that this was going to be a very good experience. The concierge, Indira, was charming and handed me mail that had been sent by courier, which the Hotel had signed for on my behalf, a true sign of a Hotel going all the way and it was much appreciated. We were updated from a Superior room to a Deluxe Room on the first floor which was a charming touch and the room was splendid. Extra large and comfy bed with Egyptian Cotton sheets, lovely pillows and bed cushions. The shower room was fabulous with Miller Harris bath products and a raindrop shower to beat all others. There was a comfortable sofa and an enormous flat screen TV with bathroom speakers. The desk was enormous and accommodated all my papers, giving me space to work. We felt at home because the staff were so attentive and greeted us personally at all times. The breakfast buffet is delicious and the coffee shop Drawing Room served a fabulous Cafe Latte.
I cannot fault a thing, and wouldn't want to. The Ampersand will be my base in London when next I stay. It is central, accessible and accommodating, and without a doubt will have great success due to careful styling, impressive and highly individual decoration, and the creation of a wonderful ambiance, where nothing is a problem, and a stay is a treasured memory.",5,2012,10,25
129,Near Perfect - Worth the Price NO PROBLEM,"I have spent 80% of the last 15 years living in hotels. I have stayed in many hotels obviously. This hotel is certainly one of the best. The location is excellent for the Museums and Hyde Park. The style is superb. The service was perfect. Met at the door and made to feel very special. I had two of the superior twin rooms - again worth the price.

You definitely don't feel like you are in yet another chain hotel; and you feel very much an important guest.

The room was a mix of style and technology that any one from 16 to 70 would appreciate. The TV's are incredible. The bathrooms fantastic.

I might seem like I am over selling it, but I was seriously impressed after many experiences of the same tired ""English"" hotels.

Yes you feel the tube a little in the bar, yes it is a busy area - Its London!!!

Thoroughly recommended.",5,2012,10,24
129,Truly a pleasure,"Beautiful, very comfortable hotel superbly located in London. We travel often and our stay at the Ampersand was one of our best hotel experiences. Well appointed comfortable rooms, maintained style and decor throughout the hotel. Truly a pleasure. In room Nespresso, excellent bath/shower facilities and reliable complimentary wifi are essential details.",5,2012,10,22
129,"Would be excellent if it weren't for the teeny, tiny rooms","Everything about this hotel is incredible -- the location, the graceful, classical exterior, the exquisite public areas, the stunning artwork, the wonderful champagne in the drawing room and of course, the delightful staff.   I would love to love this hotel and I would love to return if it weren't for the rooms.  They are so small.  I am used to small rooms in London but this room was exceptionally small.  Two people can barely fit.  Forget  about luggage.  There is no room.  If you do happen to bring more than one  suitcase you will have to store it in the shower.  If you do stay in the small room, make sure you get a good price and pray for an upgrade.  If you are close to the person you are traveling with it will be fine and you will love the rest of the experience.",4,2012,10,22
129,A wonderful place to stay!,The Ampersand is a stunning hotel in a beautiful location. The place is immaculate and the rooms amazing. We were well looked after by all the staff to make it a truly special stay.  You've  just got a stay here!,5,2012,10,22
129,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights, fantastic hotel, the staff where so friendly & helpful.  We stayed in a Deluxe Room, bed soooo comfortable, linen so soft, pillows fabulous. Just first class.  The cakes and pastries for Afternoon Tea to die for, we actually met the pastry chef, and a special thankyou to the chef for our fabulous Eggs Benedict.   Will definitely be returning. Thank you for a fantastic stay",5,2012,10,21
129,The Best Boutique Hotel Experience,"I have stayed in a few boutique hotels and can safely say, it is a hit and miss experience. The Ampersand, however, even though is relatively new, excels in every ways. Admittedly, it is at the higher end of boutique hotels.
 I shall start from the booking process. There are a few offers going on at the moment and it is so easy to book a room. The guestfolio that follows, gives you a few useful informations about the hotel and London. Quite helpful. 
  Checking in was easy and straight forward. Everything was ready. The staff have been exceptional. Love the different motifs in the rooms. Luxurious amenities, free minibar, coffee/ tea facilities. Spacious room and wc and a very, very comfortable bed. 
   Breakfast was very good and generous. Great food and friendly service.
Had a very restful staycation and will definitely come back.",5,2012,10,21
129,Great hotel!,"This is a great hotel, stylishly decorated, really friendly and attentive staff, good toiletries and huge incredibly comfy beds! I absolutely would stay here again and ita only a couple of minutes walk from the tube station (south Kensington)",5,2012,10,20
129,Absolutely Fantastic,"I stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights after travelling in Europe and I can say the hotel is very well locate and very good value, I was check in by I do not remember his name because the staff have no name on them I remember was  a blond cuban I have to say he was an example of 5 stars delux service, very friendly, helpul, polite, I work on Hospitality as well and his check in made me feel very welcome to the hotel, if I say so is because the manager need to know how good person they have in there,The room was very nice clean and the bed absolutely fantastic I love the decoration, and the breakfast is acording with the price, for the guest complaning about the room size, I have to say on the webside is very clear the size, have a look on that before booking the chipest.I Highly recommend The Ampersand Hotel, I will come back for sure.",5,2012,10,20
129,Quirky boutique hotel,"Stayed in the Ampersand for a long weekend, the room was excellent with quirky but still stylish decor. The staff were better still - casual yet smart, friendly and extremely helpful.

Apero, the basement restaurant was excellent; the chef came out to see what an awkward diner I was and allowed for that - the food was tasty and varied and there was plenty of it on the sharing menu.

I'll certainly consider this hotel again for next time I'm in London.",5,2012,10,19
129,Cream tea with bubbles!,"Highly recommend The Ampersand Hotel for afternoon tea. Visited here with 3 girlfriends & had such good service with champagne, delicate , delicious food in lovely surroundings at a very reasonable rate.",5,2012,10,17
129,New hotel in great location,"The hotel has only recently part opened but what an exceptional surprise.  We stayed there twice in September and had a wonderful room each time.  Obviously as they have just opened there are a few snagging issues, however the staff encouraged us to report even the smallest thing and were very responsive in fixing the small problems.

The deluxe rooms were big with bathrooms bigger than some 4* hotels I have stayed at in London or Paris in the past.  And the location next to South Kensington station is perfect for business travellers and tourists. There are so many good restaurants close by the hotel will have to maintain a very good standard to compete.

After many years of searching this could be my hotel of choice assuming they do not ratchet up the rates too high once they fully open.

Well done to all the staff and management at The Ampersand.",5,2012,10,16
129,Excellent stay,"My husband and I stayed here for the weekend, it was lovely.  The staff were first class,polite,friendly and attentive.  We had the cooked breakfast both mornings,omelette on day one fluffy and tasty,full English day two also could not be faulted. Ideal location opposite south Kensington tube with a bus stop right outside.
A really fab bed,with a warm cosy quilt.",5,2012,10,15
129,"Fantastic and faultless, loved it!","We stayed for 4 nights - what can I say... absolutely fab!  Beautifully appointed, wonderful decoration. All the staff were excellent - friendly & helpful, all made a real effort to speak and chat. Hotel in a fantastic location, opposite tube station and walking distance to museums and the like, with plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes in the vicinity. Rooms well appointed, not huge (we had a superior) but lovely to retire to after a busy day, especially the huge, comfy beds. Apero restaurant is to be recommended - try the tasting menu. On our 1st night we weren't too sure what to expect, but the chef, Chris, came out, explained it all to us and also got a tour of the kitchen later and met the staff. Food was outstanding, so much so that we ate there again on our last night, and again, the staff here go that extra mile, sooo friendly. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone and we are looking forward to visiting again at some point.",5,2012,10,15
129,Gorgeous boutique hotel.,"Beautiful boutique hotel in an excellent location. Very well designed interior with all the finishing touches, complementary soft drinks in the rooms and plenty of space. The staff were really helpful and friendly. They went out of their way to help celebrate my sisters birthday and brought her a cake, totally unprompted, as they had overheard us mention her birthday. The facilities are great, and they also accommodate children, which is most welcome and unusual. I shall definitely think about returning with my 3 year old. 
The library, gym, wine room, drawing rooms and downstairs dining area are lovely and well planned. We really had a fabulous stay.
The only downside is that the Saturday night drunkeness and noise for the 'club' across the road woke us at 3.25 am and carried on for 1 hour. I know the Hotel has no responsibility for this, but the rooms opposite the club, might benefit from a  bit of sound proofing, and as always  the hairdryer cord didn't reach adequately to the only available mirror, which involved a bit of contortion, and amusement! ( I say 'as always', as its a very common issue with hotels, probably not tested out by women with hair that needs drying!). These are only tiny bits that might need considering, but all in all we absolutely loved it. Highly recommended!",5,2012,10,15
129,very impressed,"I recently stayed at the Ampersand and was very impressed overall although the room was quite small. We ate there and enjoyed the whole experience immensely esp the staff.
Staff - 100%, Room decor 100%, Room size 60%, Bar and restaurant 90%, Location 95%
Top drawer!",5,2012,10,15
129,A Great Find!,"Having travelled extensively in the US and Europe, I must say that The Ampersand Hotel was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.  The location is ideal - just a short walk to the South Kensington Underground station and a good supply of restaurants and shops.  The staff were all very polite and helpful. The hotel is decorated extremely well with modern references to the surrounding neighborhood museums. The rooms were well appointed though closet space and storage space was limited.  I initially was in a very small room that proved difficult to manage with two person's luggage, however the helpful staff was able to upgrade my room (I am a SLH member) the next day to a nicer sized room.  The beds were heavenly!  Breakfast was tasty and there was ample selection of cereals, pastry, fruit, yogurts, juice, tea and coffee.  I will definitely stay at The Ampersand on any future trips to London!",5,2012,10,13
129,Loved it!,"This well-located hotel in upscale South Kensington is super stylish, incredibly comfortable & beautifully appointed. It is truly less than a minute from the tube stop so getting around is a breeze. Harrods & lots of trndy shops are right down the street, if that's your thing. Several museums are likewise a stroll away. There are lots of cafes with outdoor seating around the corner on Exhibition Rd. We especially like the Lebanese one for a good, inexpensive lunch with people-watching thrown in for fre.

What we especially liked? The gorgeous room includes lots of books on gardening, travel and London, with a book of Bedtime Stories on the nightstand...the in-room espresso maker...the free water & soft drinks in the mini-bar...huge & very comfy bed with quality linen.

Staff are uniformly helpful & pleasant. We took the local tube (one line, Picadilly) all the way to Heathrow for a very small fraction of a taxi fare with no hassle as long as it's off-peak hours. The desk staff even offered to carry our bags to the tube, which we declined. But, yes, they are that eager to go the extra mile. A real find",5,2012,10,13
129,Fantastic all round,"Excellent staff, rooms, and facilities. The staff are helpful and friendly, the rooms stylish, clean and the bed amazingly comfortable. The drawing room offers an excellent high tea and the restaurant does fantastic breakfast and lunch. Also conveniently located very close to South Kensington tube station. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. ",5,2012,10,13
129,"A lovely experience in a fabulous location, what a gem.","We recently stayed here for five nights and what a find. Firstly the location is quintessential London with many top restaurants, bars and shops. The hotel is immaculate and the decor fresh, very classy and interesting. The staff were incredibly helpful, polite and friendly. The food and services are also exceptional. I would recommend the superior room as the standard doubles are on the very small side.

129,Excellent!,"We've spent 4 nights in the Ampersand Hotel. Overall experience was way beyond our expectations. First of all as SLH members we were upgraded to a lovely, spacious room. We also got a complimentary glass of champagne. Hotel staff is at their best all the time. Friendly, chatty, helpful. Drinks in the bar are so yummy and the afternoon tea fantastic. Decor is fantastic and those beds! :)) so so comfy! 

The hotel is based 1 min walk from South Kensington tube station. The area is full of nice pubs and restaurants with great lunch /dinner deals. There are 3 museums short walk from the hotel - Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum and Natural History Museum. Royal Albert Hall is 10 minutes walk from the hotel.

It was a pleasure to be a guest in this hotel and we'll definately be back.",5,2012,10,09
129,Almost there,"We stayed one night on 6th October. The reservation was on a bed and breakfast deal. We got a complimentary glass of champagne which was very nice however whilst we were told we could take it in the drawing room at our convenience we actually had to go downstairs into the wine area as the drawing room was apparently booked out for afternoon teas (there were empty tables).
Our room was very nice, the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were great. The curtains were heavy making the room nice and dark. I slept very well and only woke at 8.50am. Unlike many places I didn't hear noise of doors banging ot other guests moving around.
Breakfast was good, although the cooked breakfast could have been warmer.
The strange thing, and most annoying, was the fact that the web site (and the information in the room) both stated that there was a gym (even listing the equipment) however it is not yet in working order! I thought it very odd that this wasn't explained on the web site or at check in. I wish I hadn't carried gym kit round London. One member of staff did say we could use the Fitness First down the road for a small charge (no actual deal with the hotel). We didn't try this as we didn't believe they would actually just let us in for a charge (otherwise people wouldn't take out membership) and we didn't want to go down the road and then have to come back to check out.
Other than that it was a good stay.",4,2012,10,07
129,"Staff excellent, accommodation brilliant, food unusual!","Just had two nights at this great hotel. Arrived at 12 for the 2 pm check-in and was in the room (deluxe studio) by 12.10.  Staff at reception could not have been more helpful throughout our stay.  Decor is brilliant, but at the moment, the hotel is a work in progress so there is still work going on.  Our room (216) was fantastic but my wife was disappointed there was no power point near a mirror. (Someone else has also made this comment.).  The rooms are really well equipped, as is the library and games room (gym not open yet). Some people have commented on room size, but the hotel website describes the different room sizes accurately.

Didn't actually have the afternoon tea, but it looked fantastic, and the hotel has an award winning pastry chef so it should be good.

Dined twice in the Apero restaurant.  Basic decor, great food and service, great atmosphere, but if your taste is for traditional or plain food you might struggle to find something you like. (You can get steak and chips on the room service menu, but not in the restaurant).  Also breakfasted twice in the restaurant (continental and full English) - REALLY good

The hotel has a tube line running underneath which you can sometimes hear but not enough to cause a problem.

For a very good hotel in South Kensington, prices are pretty standard.

We will DEFINITELY go back",4,2012,10,06
129,One Night Stay,"Comfortable, stylish hotel in a convenient area with great details. Its location only 1 block from the South Kensington Metro means you can get anywhere in a blink (south ken boasts 3 tube lines) and restaurants and bars abound. Gym wasn't ready when we stayed, but everything else was fantastic.",5,2012,10,06
129,Chic and stunning,"THis swanky new hotel is just great, we stayed two weeks after it opened and the whole experience was well worthwhile.
At 3pm on arrival our room wasn't ready but we were whisked to the bar for a lovely glass of champagne while we waited so it was no hardship. We were fortunate for an upgrade as an SLH member and the room itself was spacious and very well apppointed, modern, comfortable and attractive, we loved the claw foot bath in the bay window and the bed was deliciously comfortable. Bathroom relatively small but certainly adequate, lovely shower. 
Enjoyed the staff, the afrternoon tea spread looked divine.
Check out was a litle complex but probably teething problems, it was 5am and we had a relatviely complex booking so give them the benefiy of the doubt there.

We thoroughly look forward to returning and highly recommended.",5,2012,10,05
129,"perfect location, wonderful staff, beautiful rooms and awesome breakfast","we stayed at this hotel while my husband was on business.  I love the Small Luxury Hotel Group. The location in South Kensington is perfect and right across from the tube station.  The staff was outstanding and knew us by name.  The beds are very very comfortable.  We actually upgraded to a superior room--the only negative is that the rooms are very small.  A colleague could not even put her suitcase down in the smallest room.  The next room up was a bit small for the both of us as very little closet space.  However, the superior room is perfect.  If you were staying just  a short period, or were alone, the middle of the road room would be fine.  The drawing room is beautiful.  Also the breakfast in Aperois the best i have had in Europe in a while--very accomodating as well.  Apero is very fine dining and the bar is fabulous with great drinks. The staff is very willing to please.  The hotel lobby is beautiful--just a great place.  I will definitely stay there again!!",5,2012,10,04
129,Fantastic,"We had a lovely weekend stay here.  The staff were lovely, all very friendly and very eager to please.  The hotel is perfectly placed for museums, sight seeing around london and is very close to South Kensington tube station.  There is a slight noise from the underground but nothing too much.  We will be returning in the near future.",5,2012,10,03
129,Wonderful stay,"We enjoyed staying at the Ampersand -- a brand new sparkling clean boutique hotel within a stone's throw of a tube station.  It is surrounded by cafes and museums.  Wonderful service, pretty good breakfast, comfortable beds and tastefully decorated rooms.  I would love to return if I can afford it again!",5,2012,10,02
129,Great hotel,"This hotel is situated ideally for visiting the museums such as the Albert and Victoria and Natural History. It was easy to get to by tube and on the central line so could get anywhere quickly. The hotel is very new Kensington tube station so not far to walk even in the rain!!

The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are brilliant and very big with all mod cons.
There is a great indian resturant across from the hotel that did fantastic food and service. 
I would definately use this hotel again. 
However if you are in a hurry in the morning dont order a cooked breakfast service is really slow.",4,2012,09,30
129,Great location but small rooms,"This is a lovely new hotel in an ideal location just near the South Kensington tube station, numerous bus routes, taxis outside, lots of restaurants, cafes, etc outside the door.  Rooms are very small, so despite booking a Deluxe, there wasn't room to swing a cat.  Wardrobe space is minimal, and not satisfactory for stays of more than a night or two (we were staying six).  The in-room safe is also inadequate, being very shallow, so no use for storing a camera or laptop.  Very good water pressure (often an issue in London hotels), free soft drinks from the minibar which is a pleasant change, and excellent free Wi-Fi.  Hairdryers cannot be plugged into sockets anywhere near a mirror - some design faults in the rooms.  Beds are a bit soft.  Staff are excellent, particularly receptionist Indira, who could not have been more helpful.  Unfortunately, the gym was not yet set up which was disappointing.  Some other things still being finished (hotel opened 29 August) but didn't really detract fro our stay.",4,2012,09,29
129,Great location and design,"A lovely old building right opposite south kensington tube station. My room was small but very luxurious feel, free soft drinks at the minibar and nice tea/cafetiere facilities.

They have a few difficulties, no key available the night i was staying, but overcame these with good attentive service.",4,2012,09,28
129,Excellent boutique property,"Lovely hotel with exceptional attention to detail thru-out. Very friendly service! Highly recomended. Location just a minutes walk from South Kensington tube station & very close to Royal Albert Hall, museums etc. Wonderful afternoon tea. We did not eat in the restaurant but met the head chef & looked over the menu - we will be coming back for dinner",5,2012,09,27
129,Off to a Great Start!,"The Ampersand offers much more than just a ""newly-renovated"" hotel -- the restaurant is terrific, the location is superb, and the staff make you feel right at home.  The Gym hadn't opened yet when we were visiting, but Hyde Park is only a few blocks away for running, cycling, and other outdoor pursuits.  The Lounge has afternoon tea if you're in the mood for some relaxation and need time to plan that evening's or tomorrow's activities.  We stayed in one of the Superior Rooms for two nights.  It was comfortable and well-appointed, and the bath/shower was fantastic!  We didn't feel cramped at all, but if you have lots of luggage or aren't used to London/Paris hotel room dimensions, then consider paying more for one of the Deluxe Rooms.  Prices are very reasonable for this part of the city, especially considering the quality of the overall experience.",5,2012,09,26
129,Lovely hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at The Ampersand on 22nd September as we were visiting the Cake and Bake Show at nearby Earls Court.
 Last time we were in London we stayed in a 5 star hotel in Piccadilly and were not very impressed with the attitude of the staff. However we were very impressed with the friendly service of the staff at The Ampersand - we felt welcome, which is how I think hotel staff should make you feel.
The hotel is beautiful and our room was comfortable and very well equipped. Loved the bathroom and the gorgeous Miller Harris toiletries.
We had continental breakfast included in our deal - and here I come to my only negative point.
Usually a four star hotel includes some protein element e.g. cold meat, cheese, eggs in a continental breakfast but this was missing at The Ampersand.What was provided was of excellent quality - cereal,croissants, sweet pastries, sweet muffins, fresh fruit -but it was unbalanced. I am diabetic and found that there was very little that I could actually eat as there was not even any plain bread - I did have fruit and cereal but would have liked to have some bread - wholemeal preferably. Hopefully the catering manager will look at this review and consider my comments. Otherwise top marks to The Ampersand.",5,2012,09,26
129,Brilliant hotel in Central London,"Everything is top notch at this newly opened luxury boutique hotel in the center of South Kensington.  Rooms are thoughtfully decorated, service is friendly and knowledgeable, breakfast is fabulous.   Its a true winner.",5,2012,09,26
129,fantastic hotel,"A bit nervous when we booked as brand new hotel and room sizes seemed small. However, the location is fantastic for Tube, cafes,museums, etc. The staff were friendly and helpful, The decor is outstanding. The rooms were small-ish but given decor, high ceilings and lighting, it didn't feel cramp at all. LOTS of great touches by hotel (esp the rubber duck!) to make it feel special. We were on ground floor but didn't find it noisy at all.",5,2012,09,24
129,excellent experience,"Excellent hotel, modern decoration. Although it have opened less than 20 days before of our arrival, everybody was very helpulful, nice rooms, excellent bed, big bathroom. Harrington Road is a quite noisy road, but is very near to museums, restaurants and tube. We had an excellent experience and will come back.",5,2012,09,23
129,A wonderful weekend,"Just returned from 2 nights at this very different in decor hotel, enjoyed every moment, room was spacious and quiet, I expected to hear traffic noise as we were at the front of the hotel but heard nothing, I would have liked to have brought the bed home as it's the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Room was very comfortable with a sofa and a chair, loved the duck in the bathroom, and the soft,fluffy towels, slippers and robe,nice toiletries and the tea/coffee making facilities included a caffatiere which was a nice touch with decent coffee, mini bar included free bottled water and soft drinks again another nice touch. Ate in Apero on the first night and really enjoyed the sharing menu with a wine recommended by the waiter, also had drinks in the Drawing Room,and when we went back to collect our luggage the room was full with people enjoying afternoon tea. Staff are cheerful, helpful and very well trained. Would definitely recommend this hotel as a well placed ( literally across the road from South Kensington underground station) luxury place to stay. Thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay and can't wait to go back",5,2012,09,23
129,Top Class Hotel,"Very easy to find, as soon as you come out of South Kensington Tube you can see it. When we arrived our room was not ready so we were shown into the Drawing Room for complementary coffee .We were then told we were being upgraded from a  superior to a deluxe room. The staff are very friendly and I loved the uniform smart shirts and waistcoats then Levi Jeans. There were also plenty of staff at all times. The Room was very comfortable and chic it had a large very comfortable bed with crisp white linen. Free wi-fi was welcome as were the complimentry soft drinks in the fridge. Whilst there we had a Champagne Cream Tea 1/2 price with a voucher from Lime & Tonic, It was excellent and I would recommend it even at full price, the pastry chef is amazing",5,2012,09,21
129,Wonderful new luxury hotel,"The Ampersand recently opened and is one of the best hotels we've stayed at, small or large. Unique design in all areas, public and private. Excellent furnishings, great bathrooms, extremely comfortable rooms (we had a very spacious deluxe studio with one of the most restful beds ever) and a staff that is most helpful and attentive to every need. A perfect stay.",5,2012,09,20
129,Boutique at its best..,"We have just got back from a lovely trip and stay at this beautiful hotel... They have got the colours and decor spot on...from when you walk in, to the bedrooms the restaurant games room and  library , defiantly go back again...",5,2012,09,17
129,Luxury boutique experience,"This newly opened hotel was an amazing luxury experience! Great location, interiors and very friendly staff. As a SLH member, breakfast was included and was a delicious and healthy spread with very attentive wait staff. The rooms though small are really comfy with lovely bath areas...our friends had a superior room which is more roomy with a couch. The location is amazing with the south ken tube across the street and lovely Knightsbridge restaurants 5 mins away. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2012,09,11
129,Fabulous stay!,"I have just come home from a brilliant 1 night stay at the Ampersand Hotel. 

This trendy boutique hotel is just a stones throw away from South Kensington tube station and was a perfect base for our weekend as we were attending the proms at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday night.

The entire hotel is beautifully decorated with impeccable attention to detail. Our room was modern and stylish with a fabulously comfy bed! 

The food is divine, breakfast was really tasty and we also booked an afternoon tea in the drawing room which was heavenly (see pic!), the chef even added a few special sandwiches for me as I mentioned I was vegetarian.

Above everything though I really must mention the staff. I have worked in hotels and I think it's really important to recognise when staff members deliver outstanding service. I must say that all the staff were wonderful, helpful and efficient but I'd like to especially mention Thomas and Endira who really went out of their way to make our stay perfect. Thank you.

I look forward to returning in the new year! Cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2012,09,11
129,"Wonderful restaurant ""Apero""  Superb dinner and service","I recently took a friend to the new Apero restaurant and Bar. It was a sublime experience.
We just visited the restaurant and not staying in the Hotel.  

Loved the Hotel on arrival: beautifully furnished entrance and reception area. Loved the friendly welcome and brightness of the decor.  The front lounge/bar area is very relaxed but also smart and would be a great venue for afternoon teas. 

We were initially just going to have a drink at the bar Apero. Apero is a lovely informal bar with a fine selection of spirits and we opted for the Aperol Spritz which was delicious. Also like the cocktail list. Bar staff very friendly and knowledgeable. 

We then decided to have a bite to eat as hungry and the restaurant looked very Med/Italian style. We've just returned from Italy so it was nice to reminisce. 

The food was absolutely delicious from the starters and my favourite the twist on the bruschetta which we both loved with the burrata/tomatoes. Also loved all the other courses particularly the stone bass with the beetroot risotto and the lemon sole, the onglet which was just so delicious and tender.  
The desserts were also a revelation including the pannacotta - all credit to your dessert chefs, chocolate mousse and rose sorbet plus the cake with the olive oil.

Also the service was very attentive but just right, the ambiance very relaxed and laid back. 
The waiters made some excellent suggestions and I can't wait to return to try other dishes plus more in the bar! 
Credit to the wonderful chefs, service from all the staff and a fine dining experience!",5,2012,09,11
129,Not impressed,"Ive never written a review before but I thought I had to with this hotel.

As has been said before, you cannot sleep past 8am due to doors slamming, drilling, hammering and housekeeping shouting ""HOUSEKEEPING"" every couple of minutes.

Rooms were freezing, the room phone didn't work, the tv volume went down only to a loud setting.

Probably the worst part was the size of the room. ¬£245 was taken from my card and without a word of a lie, there was around 10-12 inches of space between the bed and the walls and the bed and the door. This means you can't even open the door properly when entering or exiting with bags etc.

As I said, I have never taken the time to write a review before but I felt I had to with this extremely disappointing hotel. Dont get me wrong, the hotel looks nice but that is small consolation.
",2,2012,09,11
129,Excellent boutique style hotel,"Stayed for 1 night and can't wait to return. Fabulous location, but once inside didn't feel like you were in the middle of London. Staff exceptional, sexy interior, with beautiful decoration touches. Stunning ! Ate in the restaurant which was first class and very reasonably priced. Breakfast was also great. Loved the rubber duck in our shower room.",5,2012,09,10
129,Fantastic stay,"Booked via the secret escapes website and knew it was a brand new hotel, only opened a week before our stay  slightly worried that it would still be ironing out any teething problems, but should't have worried at all.  Staff were delightful and the room (we were upgraded to one of the suites) was wonderful.  Very state of the art with all the modern day traveler needs.  ipod dock, computer ports etc.  Wifi was free and you didn't have to ask for a password.  But the most outstanding thing was the bed, not only was it huge but it was by far the most comfortable bed we have slept in, we really didn't want to get out of it!  Continental breakfast was included and was a good spread of quality foods.  
The hotel has a real funky feel but the communal areas were still welcoming.  We visited the bar the evening of our stay which had a good vibe to it.
It is also really well located close to the tube station and within walking distance of places to eat etc
Would recommend for a weekend break, and will be returning",5,2012,09,09
129,FIRST CLASS,"A one night stay at the new Ampersand Hotel was absolute perfection. The rooms are very well appointed, the facilities excellent and, most of all, every member of staff with whom we had contact was superb and could not have been more helpful. Although we did not eat in the vening, breakfast was fantastic. We definitely stay again.",5,2012,09,09
129,Not for late sleepers,"New hotels have growing pains, but there are some problems with the place that I believe are structural in nature.  However the design of the place is indeed wonderful.

1 - hotel sits above the Tube and you can hear and feel the trains rumbling underneath you, especially at night
2 - the walls are thin, when people walked by our room I could hear and understand everything they were saying.  On top of this the doors slam quite loudly so whenever anyone on my floor left their room I knew it.  So in practice you cannot sleep past 8am here as that's when many people start walking down the halls and letting their doors slam as they leave their rooms
3- there are 6 steps up to the main entrance from the street so you have to carry your luggage up as there is no doorman to assist.  Not a problem for me with 1 small bag but perhaps a problem for others.

The staff were somewhat less friendly than at most hotels.

Design of the hotel is wonderful.  Beds are wonderful.  Bathroom is good.  A/V in the rooms is excellent.   Food in restaurant is medium to good.  Location is wonderful.",3,2012,09,08
129,Perfection,"Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff. Stayed in a deluxe room which had the most comfortable bed you could imagine. Pure elegance throughout, everything perfect down to the smallest detail. Excellent location..couldn't have asked for more. Will most definitely be back.",5,2012,09,03
129,Fantastic,"The Ampersand is not only a beautifully finished hotel, it's made truly fantastic by the staff. Everyone we met during our stay gave us a friendly, warm greeting and was sincere - something that's often lost when hotels try to train their staff to be ""chatty.""  It's clear that the staff are clearly interested in making your stay special which makes this hotel stand part from its competitors.

The rooms are very well decorated and appointed with everything required.  Beds are extremely comfortable and despite this hotel being in a busy part of town, there‚Äôs no road noise.  Being a brand new hotel, naturally everything works perfectly, but it‚Äôs obvious that fixtures, fittings and details have been invested in.

The offering from the Apero restaurant is a refreshing change from the same old modern cuisine with the food being prepared to a fantastic standard.  Breakfast was a particularly highlight - I thoroughly recommend the full English!  Again the staff are fantastically helpful with the Restaurant Manager being an absolute win for this hotel.

I absolutely recommend this hotel and very much look forward to staying again.",5,2012,09,03
129,"Fabulous Room, Fabulous Staff, Fabulous Hotel","We loved our one night stay at the Ampersand hotel and wish we could have stayed longer. 
The hotel is decorated beautifully with lots of lovely little touches. We really enjoyed our room,the design was unique and very tasteful. We especially loved the comfortable bed and wish we could have taken it home. The breakfast also was very tasty and we thought very reasonably priced. 
The location is great as it is so close to South Kensigton station. Very easy access from Heathrow as well as to central London and all the lovely cafes and museums in south Kensington.  
A special thank also goes out to the staff who were fantastic and very helpful .

The Ampersand hotel will definetly not dissapoint and we would really recommend it if your are in London and feeling like spoiling yourself.",5,2012,09,02
129,An excellent Hotel,"We have just returned from a weekend at the Ampersand Hotel, what a refreshing experiance.
From the minute you walk in the door you are greeted and made to feel welcome, all the staff contribute to this feeling. The service is extremley professional yet has that balance of being sincere and friendly. 
The interior decor is a work of art, obviously a lot of thought has gone into this to create the ambience throughout the hotel. Our room was very well furnished and the bed unbelievabely comfortable, the bathroom was spotless as was the rest of the room.
We dined  in the Apero restaurant, this is a mediterranean menu which was explained fully buy the waiter. I can only say excellent food well priced and served with flare.
To sum up if you are looking for a London Hotel which ticks all the boxes look no further.
If",5,2012,09,02
129,Couldn't be better,"Incredibly sexy new hotel, amazing food, wonderful staff in smart Levi's and crisp shirts which sets the tone from the moment you walk through the doors, best negroni(s) with hand cut ice! Brilliant breakfast offering including White and black pudding on toast with eggs, amazing and genial general manager who is just at home and and as comfortable in jeans as his wonderful team. 
It is our new favourite and can't wait to return.",5,2012,08,31
129,Simply a must visit!!!!,"The Ampersand is a truly unique experience, so much so that I forgot I was in London. The attention to detail in the interior design that resonates throughout the hotel is impeccable and creates a synergy and mellowness that goes to form what is a unpretentious but trendy vibe that a lot of London hotels try to recreate but fail to do so.
The rooms are well designed making use of the space in a practical but fashionable manner in sync with the overall design of the hotel. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and will go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay to the maximum.
My favourite part the stay was the visit to the in-house restaurant Apero and the games room. I would continue to visit the restaurant regardless of staying in the hotel or not as it as all the makings to become one of London‚Äôs hidden little gems - the small Mediterranean plates along with the inventive cocktail list make for a great evening with friends or family and with very reasonable prices won't leave you out of pocket.",5,2012,08,29
129,insufficient,"we were looking forward to the ampersand but unfortunately you experience was not good. the ventilation throughout the house is bad. it smells of kitchen. unpleasant. even the rooms do not smell good. staff is not friendly. breakfast room and bar - in one - a reasonable . does not belong in the 5 star category and certainly not in the small luxery rating. price is the only one which is luxurious. price/performance insufficient.
Too bad!",2,2024,07,09

129,Kleines Luxushotel in South Kensington,"Wir hatten als Familie zwei Doppelzimmer gleicher Kategorie - wobei die Gr√∂√üe des Zimmers unterschiedlich war (einmal gr√∂sseres Zimmer mit kleinem Sofa, einmal kleineres Zimmer aber mit kleinem Eingangsbereich und gro√üem Kleiderschrank, einmal Bad mit Dusche und Fenster, einmal Bad mit Badewanne und etwas kompakter). 
Es gibt Badem√§ntel, Hausschlappen und eine Minibar mit Softdrinks for free.
Das Hotel hat sch√∂nes Design, gutes Interior, √ºberall Raumduft (sehr angenehm) und wirkt neu und stylish. 
Das Restaurant bzw. Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum ist sehr heimelig, modern und schlicht. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksangebot war exzellent und er Service ist sehr herzlich und aufmerksam. Die Qualit√§t der Speisen war hervorragend.",5,2022,03,07

129,Decisamente sopra gli standard londinesi,"Premesso che a Londra gli hotel sono sistematicamente di livello inferiore a quello che il prezzo (sempre alto!) pu√≤ suggerire, credo che in questo senso l'Ampersand si distingua.

Sempre decisamente caro, ma quantomeno molto molto curato, pulito e arredato con un bellissimo stile. Unica pecca, le stanze un po' piccole (bench√© non fossero quelle della fascia pi√π bassa), ma d'altro canto ben arredate, con bagno con pavimento riscaldato e in stile vintage, bellissimo!

Colazione al ristorante Aper√≤, al piano sottostrada, con un po' di proposte √† la carte e un piccolo buffet con scelte dolci e salate e anche diverse alternative vegan, molto gradite.

Posizione super super super comoda, letteralmente accanto alla stazione di South Kensington, noi conosciamo bene la citt√† ma specialmente se √® la vostra prima volta √® una delle posizioni pi√π strategiche che possiate trovare, soprattutto con i bambini (i musei di storia naturale e della scienza sono a un minuto a piedi).

Il personale √® forse il lato meno positivo, sempre gentile quindi non si pu√≤ dire nulla, ma non preparatissimo e un po' disattento (davano quasi l'impressione, specialmente in reception, di parlare male inglese, anche se sembra assurdo...).

Comunque sia, molto consigliato, probabilmente torneremo!",4,2019,12,03

Nunca desayunamos ah√≠ por que por la diferencia horaria nos levant√°bamos a las 11. En la habitaci√≥n hab√≠a agua, jugos, caf√© y te, Pochoclo y no ten√≠a cargo extra.
Un d√≠a pedimos m√°s aguas y sin problema nos trajeron. Tambi√©n Pochoclo.
El Room Service es bueno.
La atenci√≥n de la recepci√≥n y de los chicos de la puerta es muy buena, s√∫per amables.
Tiene un restaurante y un lugar para t√© y otras cosas. Todo se ve apetitoso, no prob√© mucho. √âl te de las 5 se ve√≠a exquisito y s√∫per variado. El de los ni√±os ven√≠a en un cohete.
La ubicaci√≥n es excelente, colectivos varios, subte a una cuadra con tres l√≠neas diferentes.
Muchos restaurantes y caf√©s alrededor, una fruter√≠a enfrente.
El hotel es lindo, pintoresco, lo volver√≠a a elegir.

129,Sopravvalutato,"Hotel molto bello che pecca in alcuni dettagli. La hall √® molto bella, la stanza minuscola. Nel prezzo, non economico, non √® compresa la prima colazione, 16.00 sterline + servizio (avranno sbagliato a prenotare la stanza...) che, dopo averla provata, ti evidenzia come sia di molto pi√π opportuno uscire e far√† fuori. 
",3,2019,09,29
129,Totalmente inappropriato,"Non √® mai piacevole recensire un hotel con una tale bassezza di servizio.
Dal momento in cui si varca la soglia dell‚Äôhotel si √® aggrediti da una puzza di vecchia moquette. Un mix tra stantio e muffa davvero poco promettente. Questo √® solo il preludio.
Camere piccole e poco pulite. Polvere ovunque, sporcizia nell‚Äôascensore. Cattivo odore che arriva dal bagno. Un senso di vuoto che pervade l‚Äôhotel, quasi di inadeguatezza.
Peccato, a discapito di una location favorevole , davanti alla fermata di south Kensington,  rimane un‚Äôesperienza davvero da dimenticare",1,2019,07,19
129,Pasqua in famiglia,"Il nostro soggiorno a Londra √® risultato ancora pi√π piacevole grazie alla scelta dell' Ampersand come hotel. Camere sufficientemente spaziose e pulite, arredate con cura. Letto confortevole. Il personale dell' hotel attento alle nostre esigenze e molto professionale. Un ringraziamento a Lisa, ci scusino gli altri di cui non conosciamo  il nome... La colazione √® ricca e con prodotti freschi e di buona qualit√†. L' hotel √® a pochi passi della metropolitana di south Kensington, unico neo, a volte nella stanza si sentivano piccole vibrazioni dovute al passaggio della metro. Ma complessivamente ripeto un' ottima scelta, anche come rapporto qualit√† /prezzo . ",4,2019,04,24
129,Turismo,"Ottimo albergo, pulito e confortevole, personale sempre sorridente e molto giovane,
tanti ragazzi italiani, vicino metropolitana, ottimo ristorante, lo consiglio, pasta all'uova buonissina tutto molto fresco e saporito.",5,2019,03,24
129,Ogni volta un piacere!,"Ci rechiamo qui solitamente per lavoro; e ci troviamo cos√¨ bene ogni volta che rimane la nostra tappa fissa in occasione di una visita a Londra. 
Le camere sono perfette, molto belle, non manca veramente nulla: set di cortesia ricchi e attenti, riscaldamento a pavimento in bagno (che non guasta sicuramente negli inverni londinesi:) ), dimensioni delle camere molto ampie (contro lo standard londinese) pulite.
Colazione molto abbondante, si pu√≤ scegliere il buffet oppure la selezione di prodotti a piatto; in ogni caso la qualit√† dei prodotti √® veramente alta. 
Rapporto qualit√†-prezzo (per Londra) corretto, contate sempre che siamo a Londra. 
Personale sempre molto disponibile, alcuni dei quali anche connazionali italiani! :D Bravi!!!",5,2019,03,17
129,Ottima posizione,"Albergo molto carino, posizione fantastica vicino al Vittoria & Albert Museum, raggiungibile a piedi, e vicino alla metropolitana, fermata di South Kensington. Il quartiere √® molto bello, con una vasta offerta di locali,  ma non caotico. Unico neo le dimensioni della stanza e del bagno, veramente molto ridotte.

Bl√∂d bei einer St√§dtetour wenn man sich am Vorabend etwas ""austoben"" m√∂chte. Empfang war Nett aber in einigen Belagen schnell √ºberfordert.

129,"Buen hotel, excelente ubicaci√≥n","La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es perfecta. A pocos metros de la estaci√≥n de South Kensigton que te permite desplazarte en poco tiempo a cualquier punto del centro de Londres. A una manzana de la Exibition Road, donde est√°n los mejores museos.
Hicimos una reserva de una ""small room"" y la verdad es que la habitaci√≥n no era peque√±a.... era enana!! Una cama doble estrecha, (1,35 mts), no muy c√≥moda, y apenas 40cm de paso alrededor de la misma. Pr√°cticamente sin armario.
El ba√±o, siendo peque√±o, algo m√°s correcto. Servicio de habitaciones muy bueno, con reposici√≥n diaria de los ""amenities"" (curiosamente algo que pocos hoteles hacen).
Wifi correcto.
Por otra parte la zonas comunes del hotel son excelentes: sal√≥n de t√©, restaurante, recepci√≥n, etc.... decoraci√≥n muy cuidada.
Desayuno correcto. Bufete de calidad sin excesiva variedad. Buena carta de huevos y platos cocinados.

129,Ci siamo ma non troppo,"Sono stata qui per una conferenza, senza pernottamento. 
La stanza per il meeting era piccola e quindi un po‚Äô troppo affollata per il numero di persone che accoglieva. 

Il servizio era buono, il pranzo anche. 
Ci sono per√≤ stati dei problemini con quest‚Äôultimo: essendo la stanza piccola, e il pranzo un ‚Äúworking lunch‚Äù senza una effettiva tavola, con conseguente obbligo di appoggiare qua e l√† cibo e piatti, anche direttamente sui computer e sugli appunti. 

Insomma, tutto sommato un‚Äôesperienza accettabile, ma per la cifra spesa (molto alta) ci si aspettava qualcosa di pi√π. ",3,2018,03,10

129,LA MEJOR JOYA DE LONDRES!!!!!!!!!,"Tuve la suerte de alojarme en este hermoso hotel boutique.
Luego de a√±os de conocer muy bien esta ciudad, y decepcionarme con la hoteler√≠a local, descubrir un hotel tan bello como el Ampersand, √∫nico, c√°lido, con un servicio insuperable ademas de siempre bien predispuesto y una atenci√≥n a los detalles especial, sumo a mi viaje un plus adicional.
Las habitaciones son muy lindas, c√≥modas, cuentan con todo lo necesario y si a uno le hace falta cualquier cosa, todo el personal del hotel esta a disposici√≥n para ofrecerlo.
La ubicaci√≥n ademas es perfecta, mejor imposible frente a la estaci√≥n de tube de South Kensignton, rodeado de restaurantes y con excelentes conexiones para moverse a todas partes.
Las fotos que se ven en la web son un reflejo exacto de lo que se van a encontrar aqu√≠, no habr√° sorpresas ni decepciones! 
Sin ninguna duda, Ampersand Hotel ser√° el lugar en el que deseare volver a hospedarme una y otra vez cada vez que tenga la oportunidad de regresar a Londres!!!!!!!!",5,2017,12,28
129,"Gepflegtes, sch√∂nes Hotel","Wir waren im September nach einer kleinen England-Tour hier noch ein paar Tage, um uns London anzuschauen. Zimmer sind extrem geschmackvoll eingerichtet, unseres war leider nur extrem klein. Fu√übodenheizung im Bad fand ich echt klasse, genauso wie die sch√∂ne gro√üe Dusche. Sehr freundliche, hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter. Das hat uns alles sehr gut gefallen. 
Der Kaffee beim Fr√ºhst√ºck war genial. Der Rest allerdings leider nur ok. Es gab nur gesalzene Butter und die Frage nach ungesalzener bedeutete 15 Minuten Wartezeit, um dann Margarine zu bekommen. Auch sonst war der Service beim Fr√ºhst√ºck nicht ganz so gut wie im Rest des Hauses. Generell haben wir uns hier aber sehr wohl gef√ºhlt und w√ºrden gerne wiederkommen.",4,2017,12,26
129,Vergognoso,"Sono stata recentemente all‚Äôhotel Ampersand. Avevamo prenotato (tramite l‚Äôhotel) il transfer dall‚Äôaereoporto all‚Äôhotel e l‚Äôautista √® stato a dir poco maleducato insofferente X il traffico neanche fossimo noi responsabili e arrivati in hotel dopo 2 ore con i 4 bambini esausti ha cominciato a beatemmiare perch√© non avevamo preso un trolley dal bagagliaio....il tutto davanti al personale dell‚Äôhotel. Personale alla reception molto cordiale. Camera impercettibile non c‚Äôera neanche posto X la valigia. Colazione scarsa X un 5 stelle e carissima. Ma il bello √® stato questo: la 2 mattina del nostro soggiorno la bambina (5 anni) si cambia il suo paio di orecchini e lascia la sua piccola borsetta con gli altri 4 paia sul comodino. Torniamo e la borsetta e gli orecchini non c‚Äôerano pi√π.. premesso che il valore in totale sar√† stato 180 pounds al max trovo assurdo e disgustoso che in 1 hotel 5 stelle accadano episodi simili... non solo hanno fatto finta di denunciare l‚Äôaccaduto e dopo 5 ore mi √® arrivata la mail con ‚Äúthe accident has been closed,no suspects identified‚Äù
Trovo il tutto imbarazzante X 1 hotel che si dichiara 5 stelle... X via del mio lavoro viaggio sempre e sono stata in hotel veri 5 stelle dove ho lasciato da iPad a borse con portafogli a vista e non √® mai accaduto nulla..",1,2017,12,13

129,LUSSO ELEGANZA E POSIZIONE,"ho visitato parecchi alberghi nel mondo ma voglio dare un plauso a questo affascinante hotel per la pulizia che questa struttura regala al suo ospite, ogni minimo angolo √® pulito profumato e questa a perer mio √® condizione essenziale che viene prima di tutto il resto. 
L'hotel comunque eccelle in ogni aspetto, eleganza della struttura, precisione ed attenzione del personale, cortesia dal primo all'ultimo minuto, atmosfere sempre cariche di fascino ed un prezzo che tutto sommato √® anche basso per le attenzioni (giornale al mattino, telefono cellulare anche per girare la citt√† con mappe e telefonate illimitate, free bar in camera, dotazioni di toletta di ogni genere).
Quindi andateci e fate colazione all'Apero (ristorante interno) perch√® √® uno dei posti pi√π caldi accoglienti e suggestivi che chiunque possa desiderare per una colazione davvero eccellente con personale italiano che ti coccola di continuo..

Kleiner Wehrmutstropfen: da Hunde im Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum nicht erlaubt sind, haben wir das Fr√ºhst√ºck jeweils aufs Zimmer bringen lassen. Das hat leider zwei von drei Mal nicht gut geklappt.

La posizione √® a dir poco fantastica, a due passi dalla metro di South Kensington, nella quale transitano 3 linee e nel cuore della Londra pi√π bella che ci sia, tra i musei, i locali vivi e divertenti, ristoranti per tutti i gusti, il parco e le vie sobrie ed eleganti che portano a sud verso la vicina Chelsea e ad est verso lo sfarzo di Knightsbridge.
La camera √® un p√≤ piccola (eh si che avevamo prenotato una deluxe, dato che avevamo con noi la nostra bimba) ma molto confortevole, pulita ed accogliente. Unico neo, nel bagno (spazioso) non c'erano n√® finestre n√® ventole, ecco qui magari si potrebbe fare meglio.

 Pero a m√≠ lo que m√°s me ha gustado, y creo que distingue este hotel de otros, es que tuvieron un mont√≥n de detalles muy agradables, como por ejemplo, prestarnos un paraguas durante toda la estancia, prestarnos un adaptador de enchufes (no nos acordamos de que en el reino  unidos son diferentes), bebidas gratis en el minibar (no alcoh√≥licas), los botecitos de champ√∫, gel, crema, etc... eran de L'Occitane y ol√≠an muy  bien, nos dejaron un tel√©fono m√≥vil con Wi-Fi gratis para movernos por la ciudad, hasta hab√≠a un patito de goma muy simp√°tico para la ba√±era!

A m√≠ esos detalles me han gustado mucho y  a√±adi√©ndolos a la buena ubicaci√≥n y buen servicio del hotel hacen que lo recomiende.

129,Un gioiello,"Se si cerca un albergo confortevole a Londra, in una zona tranquilla come South Ken letteralmente di fronte alla metropolitana, questo √® proprio l'Ampersand. Certo non √® economico, ma gli alberghi a Londra non lo sono di certo, ma √® raro trovare un simile condensato di servizio di qualit√† e discreto, stanze confortevoli ed un arredamento moderno ben inserito in una struttura classica. Il tutto offre una piacevole sensazione di accogliente freschezza e relax. Le stanze sono quasi tutte di buona dimensione (tranne le singole, francamente adatte solo a viaggiatori alla ricerca di un letto dell'ultimo minuto) alcune delle vere chicche come quella d'angolo con la vasca da bagno in camera. Molto curati i dettagli: in tanti anni non ho mai riscontrato un elemento fuori posto o un problema di alcun genere. Ottima la colazione a buffet nel basement cos√¨ come piacevole √® il relax nella moderna sala lettura al piano terra. Un indirizzo da non perdere.

Wir sind bereits am Morgen angekommen und wollten eigentlich nur unser Gep√§ck abgeben (Check-in ist ab 14 Uhr) als uns mitgeteilt wurde, dass es ein freies Zimmer f√ºr uns gibt, das wir vorzeitig beziehen k√∂nnten. Wir hatten ein h√ºbsches und sauberes Zimmer mit einem gem√ºtlichen Twin Size Bed (Superior Room), das auch sonst keine W√ºnsche √ºbrig lies - inklusive Handy zur kostenlosen WLAN-Nutzung und Telefonie (auch f√ºr unterwegs). Ich glaube, beim n√§chsten Mal w√ºrden wir uns f√ºr ein Delux Room entscheiden, um ein paar Quadratmeter mehr im Zimmer zu haben. Aber das ist wirklich - insbesondere in London - meckern auf h√∂chstem Niveau. Das Hotel befindet sich in bester Lage. Kensington allein ist schon einen Besuch wert, es gibt viele tolle Restaurants, Cafes und Museen. Wer shoppen m√∂chte, kann zu Fu√ü (ca. 20 min.) zu Harrods und anderen Gesch√§ften in der Umgebung gehen. Die Verkehrsanbindung zum Hotel (Haltestelle South Kensington) ist ebenfalls sehr gut. Wir haben immer die Tube genutzt, die nur 3 min. Fu√üweg vom Hotel entfernt ist.

Este es un hotel boutique, no es barato, pero tampoco caro y tiene una gran cantidad de de detalles en la decoraci√≥n. El ba√±o puede ser un poco peque√±o, pero la cama y las almohadas lo compensan.

Free Wi-fi in camera. Stanza molto pulita, dotata di un'utilissima macchina nespresso e di mini bar gratuito. E di due tv. Uno in camera ed uno in bagno nel caso lo si voglia vedere durante un bagno in vasca. Letto matrimoniale grande e comodissimo. Non ho usufruito della colazione ma, proprio davanti all'hotel, ci sono diversi bar per farne di buonissime. Insomma, dovessi tornare a Londra, sarebbe la mia prima scelta!!

129,Hotel di ottimo livello. Posizione strepitosa.,"Nell'elegante e vivace zona di South Kensington (a due passi dall'uscita della metropolitana) l'Ampersand Hotel brilla per il livello dei servizi e per la sua posizione.

Arredato con gusto, con tocchi ironici e moderni, fortunatamente lontani anni luce dall'opprimente stile vittoriano che caratterizza molti hotel signorili di Londra, √® una soluzione perfetta sia per un weekend romantico che come base per visitare le mostre al Victoria & Albert Museum (distante una passeggiata di 5 minuti).

Le camere riescono ad essere spaziose ed accoglienti anche se non sono molto grandi.
I bagni ricordano le futuristiche architetture dec√≤, con i colori essenziali del bianco e del nero.
Una bella sorpresa il riscaldamento a pavimento :)

Lo staff √® giovane, sorridente, cortese e professionale.

La punta di diamante dell'Hotel √® a mio avviso l'Apero restaurant, di gestione italiana, un ambiente perfetto e accogliente, semplice e ricercato allo stesso tempo, sia per le colazioni e i brunch, (consiglio l'opzione from the counter) sia per la cena, con un menu √† la carte sofisticato e poliedrico.

Ps. Se mi posso permettere un appunto, l'unico neo √® dato dalla vista dalla camera (numero 003) al piano concierge. 
Per il prossimo soggiorno mi auspico una vista migliore da un piano pi√π panoramico.",5,2015,03,23

129,Canto al buen gusto,"En este, mi segundo viaje a Londres, hemos decidido alojarme con mi mujer y mi hijo de 5 a√±os a√±os en el Hotel The Ampersand durante 3 noches. 

El periodo de la estancia fue del 6 al 9 de diciembre, con lo que pod√©is imaginar el alto grado de ocupaci√≥n hotelera en una ciudad como la capital de Reino Unido. Dicho esto, lo que puedo decir es que reservamos, por un precio m√°s que competitivo, dentro de su categor√≠a, un hotel 5 estrellas altamente cuidado y en plena √©poca navide√±a londinense.

El Hotel es todo un regalo para los sentidos en su conjunto. La vista se ve premiada nada mas entrar en el lobby, con sus l√°mparas recreando aves volando las escaleras, con un blanco inmaculado vistiendo sus paredes y con una decoraci√≥n navide√±a propia de una cinta de Meg Ryan y Tom Hanks. La sala de t√© es como sacada del ultimo n√∫mero de la revista de viajes mas chic del mercado. 
El olfato ser√° unos de los sentidos que m√°s condicione tu estancia en The Ampersand. Y lo digo porque huele a Londres. ¬øQu√© a que huele Londres? Pues huele a este hotel, huele a Miller Harris, huele a entre vainilla y galletas, a eso huele este hotel.
¬øEl gusto?, solo con desayunar y pedir un chocolate caliente estar√°s deseando que comience a llover para poder mirar a trav√©s de la ventana y perderte con tu imaginaci√≥n entre la gente mientras degustas sus deliciosas cupcakes de chocolate.
T√≥calo todo, hasta coge sus palas de ping pong y juega en su coqueta games room, te puedo asegurar que el tiempo pasa taaaaaaan deprisa.
El o√≠do es otro mundo, no escuchar√°s nada. Solo la leve danza de un personal atento empe√±ado en regalarte calidez.

La situaci√≥n del hotel es fant√°stica, fuera del mundanal ruido, en South Kensington, pero aun pasa o de Harrods, Hyde Park, Kensington, el Museo de Historia, el Victoria & Albert Museum y la joya de la corona, la estaci√≥n de metro con conexi√≥n de las l√≠neas m√°s c√©ntricas justo en frente.

Nuestra habitaci√≥n fue un Studio Deluxe. En cuanto a tama√±o, unos 30 m2, se me antoja muy adecuada para viajar con ni√±os. La cama tiene una calidad del sue√±o de 9 sobre 10, con almohadas con un grosor bastante aceptable para lo habitual en hoteles. La estancia dispon√≠a de ba√±era en la zona de la cama con vistas a la calle, impresionante.

El personal fue muy amable, muy eficaz en cualquier gesti√≥n y siempre con una prioridad, privacidad y calidad. Un detalle es el uniforme del equipo del hotel; camisa y pantalones vaqueros. Esto es algo que le proporciona al Hotel un aspecto transgresor y cercano al cliente.

En general un hotel con tan pocas pegas que no merecen ocupar l√≠neas en este conjunto de cantos al buen gusto. Muy recomendable tanto para familias, como parejas como por trabajo.",4,2014,12,17

129,Tolles Boutique-Hotel in Super Lage,"Ich lernte das Ampersand auf einem Business-Trip kennen - und lieben. Die Lage in Kensington mit perfekter Anbindung an die Metro ist ein Pluspunkt, ebenso die Ausstattung und das geschmackvolle und zugleich individuelle Design der Zimmer. Mein Superior Room (kostenloses Upgrade) war f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse ger√§umig, insbesondere das Bad. Ausstattung ebenfalls hervorragend und die Minibar (Wasser und Softdrinks) inklusive. Die Gegend ist sehr gepflegt bis ein wenig posh. Dieses schon sehr gute Bild wurde abgerundet durch das sehr freundliche Personal. Es gibt also beim besten Willen nichts Negatives √ºber das Hotel zu sagen, selbst der Preis ist f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse noch absolut im Rahmen. Hier kann man - leider - f√ºr deutlich mehr Geld deutlich weniger Hotel - Qualit√§t und Gr√∂√üe der Zimmer - bekommen. Jederzeit wieder gern!",5,2014,11,19

129,Sehr gutes Hotel in toller Lage,"Das Hotel ist in sehr gutem Zustand und das Personal ist extrem freundlich. Alles klappte wunderbar. Wenn man Bitten/Fragen hatte, war dies nie ein Problem. Zimmer toll - aber der Schrank ist leider viel zu klein. Selbst f√ºr eine Frau alleine w√§re es nicht genug gewesen. Es war ein schmaler kleiner Schrank, in diesem befand sich aber auch noch Safe und Wasserkocher etc. lange Kleider konnte man also nicht aufh√§ngen, was schade ist. Und jeder konnte nur ca. 5 Teile reinh√§ngen. Ansonsten gibt es nur Schubladen. Da wir beide auch wegen Musicals da waren, hatten wir eher Kleider mit. Dies war aber das einzige Manko. Bad sehr sauber und sch√∂n - f√ºr London gro√ü. Bett perfekt - Hotel selbst sehr modern und sch√∂n. Lage in einem teuren Viertel. Ubahn nur 3 Minuten entfernt.

129,"Un poco caro, pero no defrauda","Hotel agradable, acogedor, de dise√±o, fresquito y cool, con un personal que destaca por la amabilidad... te hacen sentir bien. Las habitaciones son muy peque√±as y apretadas, y en nuestro caso muy ruidosa, pues estaba cerca del ascensor y se o√≠a mucho movimiento, incluso el ruido de la maquinaria. El hotel est√° cerca del metro, a unos 100 metros solamente, y al lado de los museos de la ciencia y de historia natural. La zona no acaba de ser segura, y hay calle por las que una no se atrev√≠a a pasear, especialmente hacia el sur del hotel, pero ning√∫n problema yendo hacia el este. Se come bastante bien en el hotel, hay un restaurante muy agradable en el s√≥tano y tambi√©n sirven comidas en la cafeter√≠a junto al lobby, que es luminosa y muy cuca y acogedora. El desayuno buffet es excesivamente caro, pero el pan, los bollos, los embutidos, quesos, confituras, etc. son de muy buena calidad, sin bien no hay demasiada variedad. El caf√© no emociona. Hay varias alternativas de precios y combinaciones de desayuno, siempre hay muchas personas desayunando, y es gente joven y bastante ""trendy"", el ambiente es bueno, siendo como es Londres. En la habitaci√≥n tienes todas las amenities necesarias, hay un paraguas precioso para usar si lo necesitas, un buen secador de pelo y una kettle, con las correspondientes galletitas de mantequilla. La cama es muy c√≥moda. Yo realmente destaco el factor personal y la amabilidad de los recepcionistas, que incluso algunos hablan espa√±ol, lo cual se agradece mucho. Hab√≠a una chica espa√±ola muy servicial y el jefe de servicio nocturno, que es cubano, tambi√©n es especialmente amable y atento. Lo agradecemos mucho, ya que tuvimos un problema de cancelaci√≥n con British Airways.
El hotel es caro en cuanto a relaci√≥n calidad-precio, y nos cobraron m√°s de los que indicaba la reserva en Booking, aduciendo impuestos locales y el cambio de la moneda libra-euro, que nos perjudic√≥ bastante... ¬°¬°¬°Cuidado con eso en los hoteles de Londres!!

129,ottimo hotel in ottima posizione,"L'hotel √® stato ristrutturato recentemente e questo √® gi√† un elemento a suo favore: √® curato, ben arredato e pulito. Le camere sono moderne e arredate con gusto (la nostra era una superior room non particolarmente ampia ma comunque funzionale); il bagno invece era molto spazioso. Buona e abbastanza varia la colazione, con camerieri sempre disponibili e sorridenti (molti di loro erano italiani!). La posizione dell'hotel √® ottima perch√® si trova a due passi dalla fermata di South Kensington (attraversata da 3 linee della metro: blu, gialla e verde); stessa cosa per quanto riguarda la fermata degli autobus che si trova praticamente di fronte all'ingresso: questo permette di raggiungere qualsiasi zona di Londra con estrema facilit√†. Hotel consigliato e molto valido!

129,Nettes Boutique-Hotel,"Wenn ich ein Hotel buche, ist es mir besonders wichtig, die Bewertungen durchzulesen/ ""Urlauberfotos"" anzusehen (wie wir alle wissen, tr√ºgt der Schein bei perfekt inszenierten Werbebildern und die √úberraschung kommt dann bei der Ankunft), aus diesem Grund w√§hlte ich das Ampersand f√ºr meinen Aufenthalt in London. 

Ich muss nicht im Ritz Carlton wohnen - ganz im Gegenteil, ein sch√∂n gepflegtes Boutique-Hotel bevorzuge ich den internationalen Hotelketten. Nat√ºrlich hat auch das Ampersand seinen Preis, aber vergleichsweise zu anderen 5-Sterne-Hotels in London sind die Preise leistbar(er). 

Vorab: ich schlafe des √ñfteren in 5-Sterne-Hotels und das Ampersand ist mit Sicherheit ein sehr sch√∂n gepflegtes 4-Sterne-Hotel, entspricht aber nicht den 5-Sterne-Standards (schon alleine aufgrund der Zimmergr√∂√üen). 

Gebucht haben wir grunds√§tzlich die billigste Zimmerkategorie - ich denke, mit diesen Zimmern ""lockt"" das Hotel auch die Urlauber an, aber schon bei der Ankunft wurde uns an der Rezeption gesagt, dass wir vermutlich ein gr√∂√üeres Zimmer ben√∂tigen w√ºrden, da wir √ºber eine Woche in London blieben.
Trotz alledem sahen wir uns unser gebuchtes Zimmer an und stellten selbst fest, dass wir in diesem Zimmer unm√∂glich 1 1/2 Wochen bleiben konnten (man konnte sich kaum darin bewegen, darin Koffer auszupacken w√§re unm√∂glich gewesen und der Schrank war mehr Deko als brauchbar). 
Zudem war das Zimmer im letzten Stock, was erstmal toll klingen mag (Aussicht, Licht etc.), aufgrund der niedrigen Raumh√∂he aber sehr beengt wirkte, zudem der Ausblick in den Hinterhof und das Zimmer alles andere als lichtdurchflutet war. 

Zum Vergleich wurde uns ein Zimmer einer besseren Kategorie gezeigt (das waren 42 Pfund/Tag Aufpreis), ebenfalls im letzten Stock. Dieses Zimmer wirkte auf uns nicht unbedingt ansprechender, das sagten wir auch an der Rezeption und das Personal meinte, dass in einer Stunde ein weiteres Zimmer in dieser Kategorie zur Besichtigung zur Verf√ºgung stehen w√ºrde. 

Dieses Zimmer im 3. Stock nahmen wir dann auch - es hatte h√∂here Decken, eine f√ºr uns bessere Raumaufteilung, einen gr√∂√üeren Schrank, zudem einen wunderbaren Ausblick und war vergleichsweise zu den anderen beiden Zimmern lichtdurchflutet. 
Wir zahlten ca. EUR 600,- Aufpreis - leider wurde uns von Seiten des Hotels kein entgegenkommendes Angebot gemacht (Erm√§√üigung...), obwohl das Hotel nicht ansatzweise ausgebucht war. Erster Minuspunkt. 

Kommen wir zur√ºck zum 5-Sterne-Standard: in einem 5-Sterne-Hotel ist es √ºblich, dass der Room-Service 2x t√§glich kommt (morgens uns abends, w√§hrenddessen man zu Abend isst), in unserem Hotel konnten wir froh sein, wenn wir √ºberhaupt alle Handt√ºcher bekamen. 
Fast jeden Tag verga√ü die Putzfrau auf ein Handtuch, an einem Tag kam sie gar nicht - ich wei√ü nicht, ob es unsere Schuld war und wir versehentlich auf den ""nicht-st√∂ren-Button"" dr√ºckten (im Ampersand funktioniert alles elektronisch) oder sie wirklich auf uns vergessen hat, aber als wir das an der Rezeption sagten, wirkte das Personal nicht sonderlich hilfsbereit/freundlich. Auch bekamen wir keinen ""Drink auf's Haus"" w√§hrenddessen wir warten mussten, bis die Putzfrau mit unserem Zimmer fertig war - das alles sind Kleinigkeiten, die ein 5-Sterne-Haus von all den anderen Hotels unterscheidet und hier hat uns das Ampersand abermals entt√§uscht. 

Das Ambiente ist aber wirklich toll, das Hotel total durchgestylt und die Zimmer sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Wir haben im angrenzenden ""Apero"" (leider) nur 1x abends gegessen, das Essen war wirklich traumhaft und preislich gesehen nicht teurer als all die anderen Londoner Restaurants. 
Au√üerdem nahmen wir 1x den Afternoon Tea ein, die Scones waren ein Gedicht und der ""Drawing Room"" ist wie all die anderen Zimmer im Hotel wirklich sehr entz√ºckend gestaltet. 

Auch die Lage hat uns √ºberzeugt - eine Underground Station direkt ums Eck, viele M√∂glichkeiten, um zu fr√ºhst√ºcken/Abend zu essen und tolle Pubs. 
Zudem gingen wir sehr viel zu Fu√ü - der Hyde Park ist nicht weit entfernt und gehen ist ja sehr gesund, h√§lt in Form und macht hungrig! ;)

Das Hotel ist durchaus empfehlenswert, nur sollte man wissen, dass es nicht das Schn√§ppchen ist, das man anfangs denkt, gemacht zu haben.",4,2014,08,27

129,Esperienza ampiamente positiva: peccato per il wi-fi lento,"Ho trascorso due notti in questo hotel per un viaggio in famiglia. L'impressione che d√† √® subito positiva: ristrutturato molto di recente, si presenta pulito, luminoso, e con personale cortese. Il prezzo era assolutamente competitivo: la mia camera (una specie di doppia uso singola) era molto piccola ma - ripeto - ben rifinita e venduta a un prezzo onesto.
Unica nota negativa per il wifi: pur gratuito, l'ho trovato lento. Immagino che, come in molti hotel, sia questione di fortuna (la posizione della camera incide molto), ma sta di fatto che non sono riuscito a sbrigare questioni di lavoro che avrebbero richiesto la mia attenzione.
Grandissimo pregio dell'albergo √® la posizione, a meno di cento metri dalla fermata della ""tube"" di South Kensington: tre linee di metropolitana e varie linee di autobus sono a portata di mano e consentono di spostarsi comodamente in molte zone di Londra (a partire dall'aeroporto di Heathrow, raggiungibile in 40 minuti di ""tube"").

129,Non potevamo scegliere di meglio !!!,"Abbiamo soggiornato qui per la settimana di Natale e come dice il titolo non potevamo decidere di meglio. La struttura per esempio √® stata ristrutturata in tutto e per tutto da poco e quindi √® tutto nuovo. Attenzione e cura del particolare non lo rendono un hotel banale. Dalle camere alle aree comuni passando per la sala ristorante/breakfast c'√® sempre qualcosa che ti colpisce e niente √® lasciato al caso. La posizione √® ottima, trovandosi proprio di fronte alla fermata della metro di South Kensington,e si raggiungono in pochi minuti zone pi√π turistiche dell'area 1-2. La nostra camera era una deluxe con affaccio interno ad un cortile quindi molto silenziosa. Le dimensioni sono comode per una coppia con tutti gli amenities disponibili in camera e in bagno e non ultimo soft drink gratuiti nel mini bar e wifi gratuito che funziona benissimo. Abbiamo apprezzato particolarmente la comodit√† del letto che per un soggiorno di una settimana fa la differenza, regalandoci un'eccellente qualit√† del sonno. Abbiamo provato il ristorante Apero con il suo sharing men√π che √® un idea molto simpatica della condivisione tra commensali di una cena o di un pranzo.
Una menzione particolare va data al servizio. Una squadra giovane e motivata che lavora alacremente per la buona riuscita. Ricordiamo con piacere il sorriso a colazione di Titty e David,la disponibilit√† del responsabile Antonio, la gentilezza del portiere di notte Giorgio e la dolcezza della giovane Eleonora al ricevimento. Unici nei riscontrati sulla base della nostra esperienza che possono( lo speriamo vivamente) essere migliorati √® il buffet della colazione,scarno e ripetitivo ed il servizio di riassetto serale della camera dato a singhiozzo da una cameriera poco volenterosa.

129,Esperienza meravigliosa!,"Hotel delizioso, posizione ottima a pochi metri dalla stazione della metropolitana South Kensighton. 
Avevamo prenotato un Deluxe studio ed √® stata un ottima scelta: decisamente spaziosa, letto comodo, bagno accogliente con vasca con tanto di Tv a parete, accappatoi, asciugamani e refil giornaliero di sapone/shampoo ecc. Camera molto pulita con doppio passaggio per preparare il letto per la notte, caffettiera nespresso e soft drink nel minibar inclusi. Su richiesta quotidiano ogni mattina fuori dalla porta! Unico neo si sente leggermente la metropolitana per questo consiglio 3 o 4 piano. Receptionist molto gentili e disponibili, tempi di check in e check out veloci. La sala per il t√® del pomeriggio √® deliziosa con buffet di dolcetti (servizio extra). La colazione se non compresa nella tariffa costa 12 ¬£ non economica ma vale il suo prezzo! Spero di poter tornare prestissimo in quest hotel e lo consiglio davvero a tutti. Certo non √® economico ma ha un prezzo secondo me pi√π basso di altri hotel della stessa zona e un servizio alto e personalizzato!",5,2013,10,03
129,Habitaci√≥n incomod√≠sima,"Seleccionamos este hotel apoyados principalmente en la calificaci√≥n que presentaba en Tripadvisor, lo cual con otros hoteles en Londres no hab√≠a fallado, pero en esta ocasi√≥n fue fatal. A pesar de que viaj√°bamos con un menor, nos asignaron una habitaci√≥n terriblemente inc√≥moda por peque√±a, en la que no hab√≠a ni donde ubicar nuestro propio equipaje y sin remedio permaneci√≥ en el pasillo del ba√±o, con lo cual fue un obst√°culo durante toda la estancia. Generalmente las visitas a Londres se caracterizan por estar el mayor tiempo ausente del hotel, pero el tiempo que pasas en el, disfrutas lo que pagas. En esta ocasi√≥n, no fue as√≠. Tremendamente inc√≥modo y me parece que no se nos dio el tipo de habitaci√≥n por la que pagamos. Para una sola persona sin mucho equipaje puede ser viable. NO para una familia. Del resto de hotel no merece hablar. la estancia en general se hizo desagradable.",3,2013,09,29
129,Ottimo Hotel,"Prenotato tramite Expedia dopo aver letto numerose recensioni su diversi siti, l'hotel ha superato ogni mia aspettativa!
Ho soggiornato in quest'albergo per 6 notti a settembre 2013 in una camera doppia con mio marito.  Devo subito sottolineare la gentilezza e la disponibilit√† del personale: mi hanno portato la valigia, ci hanno aiutato ogni qual volta abbiamo fatto domande o richieste, hanno sempre avuto un sorriso e delle parole carine per noi. 
La camera era piccola, arredata elegantemente, in modo semplice ed estremamente pulita: non un granello di polvere o di sporcizia nell'armadio e nel comodino (per sicurezza ho passato una salvietta disinfettante prima di riporre le mie cose, ma non era assolutamente necessario). 
Le lenzuola venivano cambiate spesso e i kit di cortesia del bagno cambiati giornalmente. 
A causa di un po' di febbre o dovuto utilizzare il servizio in camera: prezzi in linea se non pi√π bassi di quelli dei ristoranti di Londra, velocit√† del servizio (in 10/15 minuti avevo gi√† la cena in camera) e il cibo non era niente male. 
Che dire poi della biblioteca/sala giochi al piano -1? Diversi libri che potete leggere durante la vostra vacanza, ovviamente in inglese, play station 3 e altri giochi in questa sala spaziosa arredata con divanetto e poltrone dove potete rilassarvi dopo una giornata passata a vedere le bellezze della citt√†. 
Infine √® vicinissimo alla fermata della metro di South Kensington e a pochi passi da pub, ristorantini, Starbucks e Pret a Manger, quindi se non fate la colazione in hotel (era un po' cara, quindi abbiamo preferito farla altrove) non morirete certo di fame!",5,2013,09,27
129,Supero mis expectativas y excelente ubicaci√≥n,"El hotel es divino! Tan lindo como en las fotos oficiales del hotel. La habitaci√≥n era super espaciosa, la cama grande y c√≥moda, almohadas espectaculares, el ba√±o un lujo. Los productos Miller Harris de primera calidad. Lo √∫nico que agregar√≠a en el ba√±o es un enchufe cerca del espejo donde se pueda enchufar un secador de pelo. El √∫nico enchufe que hay es para afeitadoras. Bueno gusto en todo el hotel. El restaurant Apero muy lindo, buena comida. El desayuno espectacular, los mozos encantadores. Las conserjes de d√≠a y los conserjes de noche s√∫per amables y siempre esmer√°ndose para que el hu√©sped este conforme. El hotel esta a menos de una cuadra de la estaci√≥n de metro South Kensington con lo cual es s√∫per f√°cil moverse por toda la ciudad para los que no quieran caminar tanto. Lo recomendar√≠a una y mil veces y no pensar√≠a en ning√∫n otro hotel si volviera a Londres. Est√° a dos/tres cuadras de la zona de museos (Victoria & Albert Museum, el de Historia Natural, etc.), cerca de Chelsea que es uno de los barrios m√°s divinos de Londres, y todo alrededor del hotel ten√©s servicios, muchos restaurants, caf√©s, laudries, etc. Que ganas de volver!!!!",5,2013,09,20
129,Calidez londinense...,"Alojamos 5 noches en este maravilloso hotel. Nos encantaron sus espacios para estar ( drawing room), su decoraci√≥n y ubicaci√≥n, pero lo que m√°s nos gust√≥ fue la amabilidad y calidez de todo el personal que nos atendi√≥ y que hizo que nuestra estad√≠a fuera extraordinaria.
Sin duda volveremos a alojar en este hotel  la pr√≥xima vez que visitemos Londres.",5,2013,09,11
129,Ottima struttura e location prezzi londinesi,"La struttura √® molto ben tenuta ed √® posizionata molto bene in zona SouthKensinghton.
La camera √® molto piccola e contiene praticamente solo il letto il che rende problematico qualsiasi cosa se non il dormire. Il prezzo √® abbastanza caro seppur in linea con i prezzi londinesi zona 1. Camere al primo piano si sente l'underground.",3,2013,07,25
129,Muy buena ubicaci√≥n,"La ubicaci√≥n del hotel es muy buena. A dos pasos de los jardines de Kensington y del Museo de Historia Natural, que  no os podeis perder al ir a Londres, y casi enfrente de la estaci√≥n de metro de South Kensington, lo que te permite muy buena comunicaci√≥n.
El hotel dispone de una decoraci√≥n muy original y con un personal muy amable.
Estuvimos alojados en una habitaci√≥n de luxe en la 4¬™ planta y estuvo muy bien. 
Cenamos en el Restaurante Apero, en los bajos del hotel, y la comida y el trato tambi√©n fueron muy buenos.",5,2013,07,21
129,Super Hotel in guter Lage,"Waren f√ºr drei N√§chte im Ampersand und waren sehr zufrieden. Das Preis-/Leistungsverh√§ltnis ist f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse sehr gut und das durchg√§ngige Hoteldesign trifft voll unseren Geschmack. Das Zimmer war gro√üz√ºgig, gut eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Die Lage des Hotels ist optimal, da die n√§chste U Bahn Station fast vor der Haust√ºre liegt und es auch sehr nette Fr√ºhst√ºckslokale in der unmittelbaren Umgebung gibt. Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder!",5,2013,07,13
129,Ottima scelta.,"Appena rientrato da un breve soggiorno a Londra. Io e mia moglie abbiano scelto The Ampersand rinunciando al consueto albergo - nella medesima zona - dove risiediamo quando a Londra. L'albergo √® stato recentemente rinnovato, √® in una posizione strategica per coloro i quali visitino Londra per piacere ed √® ottimamente servito dai mezzi pubblici (bus, metro, taxi). Abbiamo avuto un'ottima impressione sia per quanto riguarda l'ospitalit√† sia per quanto attiene alla cura delle camere e dei locali comuni. Il personale alla reception √® stato cortese e di aiuto. La pulizia √® di un buon standard, mentre i servizi gratuiti offerto sono un must non da poco (wi-fi, soft drinks in stanza). Non abbiamo avuto modo di apprezzare la cucina del ristorante o il bar in quanto avevamo altri impegni, ma sicuramente lo faremo al nostro ritorno.",5,2013,07,10
129,LONDON MOOD,"Siamo stati in questo piccolo e tranquillo hotel purtroppo solo una notte.E' un hotel fantastico curato in ogni minimo dettaglio con un servizio eccellente.La posizione anch'essa stupenda difronte alla fermata della metro south kensington ma la cosa pi√π spettacolare che ti da veramente un ""LOndon Mood"" √® la sala colazione.
Complimenti 
Da ritornare per trascorrere qualche notte in pi√π.",4,2013,07,10
129,"ganz sch√∂n, klein und teuer oder sch√∂ner, gr√∂√üer, noch teurer","In London gibt es sehr viele alte Hotelk√§sten und die meisten sehen auch heute noch so aus, als sei seit dem Bau kaum etwas an ihnen gemacht worden. Bis vor einem Jahr traf das auch auf das  nahe der Nationalmuseen zur Geschichte, Wissenschaft und ""Victoria und Albert"" gelegene Hotel  ""Ampersand"" zu, das vorher den Namen ""Grosvenor Kensington"" (3 Sterne)  hatte (und eine damals sehr schlechte Bewertung auf Tripadvisor aufwies - dort auch alte Fotos). Dann wurde das ganze Hotel gr√ºndlich renoviert und er√∂ffnete im August 2012 als schickes 5-Sterne-Design-Hotel. Der Name ist √ºbrigens die englische Bezeichnung f√ºr das Schrfiftzeichen ""&"". Die Renovierung ist √§u√üerst gut gelungen und hat aus dem alten Gem√§uer einen wahren Prachtpalast gemacht. Alle Zimmer sind in tollem Design, aber sehr unterschiedlich in der Gr√∂√üe, welche man bei einigen Zimmern auch als ""Kleinheit"" bezeichnen mu√ü: 11 qm f√ºr ein Doppelzimmer kann eigentlich keine 5 Sterne erhalten, auch wenn es sonst sehr geschmackvoll und hochtechnisiert herkommt. Das Letzteres auch seine Schattenseiten hat, wird beim Beleuchtungsdesign deutlich - die richtige Bedienung der Lichtschalter ist schon eine Wissenschaft f√ºr sich. Die Zimmer zur Stra√üenseite sind in der Regel die gr√∂√üeren, aber auch die lauteren. Zum Hof dagegen ist es - trotz benachbarter Schule - sehr ruhig. Aber viele Zimmer sind eben eher goldene K√§fige. Und das bei sehr stolzen Preisen. Und die gr√∂√üeren Zimmer sind nat√ºrlich noch weitaus teurer. Sehr sch√∂n renoviert wurden neben den Zimmern auch die Lobby, die Bibliothek, die √∂ffentlichen Toiletten und das Restaurant. Das Personal war eigentlich und uneigentlich sehr freundlich. √úber eine Sache haben wir uns aber sehr ge√§rgert: Wir wurden gefragt, ob wir in Pfund oder Euro bezahlen wollten und haben dummerweise Euro gesagt, Dies hatte zur Folge, da√ü das Hotel √ºber einen englischen Anbieter den Pfundbetrag in Euro umrechnete, allerdings nicht zum offiziellen Kurs, sondern zu einem ""Spezialkurs"", wodurch jede einzelne eh schon teure Nacht noch mal 4 Euro teurer wurde, als wenn der Pfundkurs √ºber unsere Hausbank abgerechnet worden w√§re. Nat√ºrlich hatten die Rezeptionisten von den hohen Wechselgeb√ºhren bei Ihrer Frage nichts gesagt. 
Kann das Hotel insgesamt empfohlen werden? Bei einem Sonderaktionspreis auf jeden Fall, ansonsten kann ggf. eher eine ""Stippvisite"" in den √∂ffentlichen Bereichen empfohlen werden.",4,2013,07,05

129,Servizio e Qualit√† a South Kensington,"Ho soggiornato gi√† due volte al The Ampersand, a gennaio e ad aprile. In entrambi i casi avevo prenotato una Delaxe Room, ogni volta sono stato sorpreso dalla dimensione delle stanze. Il tutto √® molto fresco, anche perch√© l'hotel ha aperto a luglio/ agosto 2012.
Il personale, tutto giovane, √® sempre disponibile e cortese. La posizione √® tattica in quanto nel cuore di South Kensington, a due passi dal m√©tro e servito da diverse linee di autobus, infine la scelta di ristoranti √® pressoch√© infinita.",5,2013,05,29
129,Elegante,"L'hotel, recentemente ristrutturato, √® situato nella tranquilla South Kensington a 50 m. dalla metro. Lo staff √® giovane e cortese. Abbiamo soggiornato in una Deluxe Room sufficientemente ampia (soprattutto per gli standard inglesi), letto molto comodo, wi-fi gratis e veloce, minibar con bevande (succhi di frutta, coca-cola, acqua e latte) a disposizione (oltre al classico bollitore con vari the e caff√®), tv lcd con canali Rai, accappatoio e ciabattine, ombrello (fortunatamente mai usato) e adattatore per le prese elettriche inglesi. Consigliamo di provare, almeno una sera, il ristorante dell'hotel che si chiama Apero.",5,2013,05,19
129,"Muy bueno, para volver sin dudar","Nos alojamos durante siete noches y la pasamos de maravilla. Elegimos una habitacion studio deluxe en el segundo piso y estuvimos muy comodos. Las habitaciones decoradas con muy buen gusto, cama extra grande y confortable, ba√±o muy bien equipado con ducha y ba√±era, TV 42', cafetera Nespresso y bebidas sin alcohol de cortesia en el minibar, ubicado en una zona muy animada de Londres, con muchos restaurantes, estacion de Metro (lineas Picadilly, District y Circle) a pocos pasos del hotel, muy conveniente. 
Lo mejor sin dudas es la atencion de su staff, en especial Carlo (nuestro amigo de Venecia) y Daniel (de Espa√±a) a quienes les agradecemos por tanta gentileza y su brillante trato hacia el cliente, haciendo aun mas placentera nuestra estadia.
Aspectos a mejorar: El desayuno, que se sirve en el restaurante en planta baja solo contempla opciones dulces, falta variedad de opciones saladas incluidas en la tarifa (huevos, omelettes etc... se cobran aparte). Todo lo demas excelente, esperamos volver pronto!",5,2013,05,15
129,"Ottima posizione, pulizia e cortesia","Ottima posizione, si trova subito usciti dalla stazione di South Kensington, perfetta per visite ai musei Victoria & Albert e al museo di storia naturale e allo shopping.

Si bien las habitaciones, la nuestra era deluxe en la √∫ltima planta del hotel, son un poco peque√±as, en el armario s√≥lo hab√≠a espacio para 3 camisas, se ve todo compensado con los detalles y el trato amabil√≠simo del personal los cuales hacen una estancia de lo m√°s agradable.

129,"Sch√∂nes Boutique Hotel, sehr gut gelegen","Das Ampersand wurde neu renoviert. Die Lage in South Kensington (100m von der U-Bahn) ist sehr gut.
Die Zimmer sind wie √ºblich in London klein, aber im Falle des Ampersand fein.
Das Badezimmer ist besonders h√ºbsch renoviert, allerdings hat die Glasduschwand ihre T√ºcken und schlie√üt nicht dicht ab. Somit stand das Bad unter Wasser, aber mit einem Handtuch l√§sst sich das beheben.
W-Lan ist kostenfrei! Service sehr nett.",5,2013,03,04
129,Sch√∂nes Hotel in toller Lage,"Moderne Zimmer in sch√∂nem, alten Geb√§ude.
Wir hatten einen Deluxe Room - leider im 1. Stock zur Strassenseite hin. Bisweilen sehr laut, au√üerdem merkt man teilweise die Tube. 
Das Empfangspersonal ist sehr freundlich und kompetent, Zimmerreinigung k√∂nnte besser sein.
Die Underground Station South Kensington befindet sich 1 Minute zu Fu√ü vom Hotel.
Hyde Park  und Museen (National History, V&A ...) sind auch nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt.
Nicht g√ºnstig, aber f√ºr Londoner Verh√§ltnisse ein gutes Preis/Leistungsverh√§ltnis.
Wir kommen gerne wieder, w√ºrden aber ein Zimmer in den oberen Stockwerken anfragen.",4,2013,01,04
129,Wundervoll & Wundervoll,"Der Name ""Ampersand"" bedeutet  ""&"" (wie in Victoria & Albert Museum) und es ist das kleine ""&"", was den Aufenthalt so angenehm macht. Wie waren schon sehr fr√ºh vor Ort (erster LH Flug von D√ºsseldorf), die Zimmer waren noch nicht fertig (was wir aber auch nicht erwartet hatten), wurden aber eine Stunde sp√§ter aber telefonisch informiert. Der Empfang war insgesamt supernett und superprofessionell. Wir haben ein Upgrade bekommen, da meine Mutter ihren 80sten Geburtstag hatte und wir deswegen nach London gekommen waren. Zus√§tzlich gab es einen liebevoll dekorierten Kuchen. Die Deluxe Zimmer sind sehr sch√∂n und liebevoll eingerichtet (wie auch das ganze Hotel - die Federlampe von Ingo Maurer zieht sich von der Lobby bis in die 4. Etage hoch), Bademantel und Slipper, hochwertige Badprodukte, Softdrinks (allerdings keine alkoholischen in der Minibar vorhanden), ein wundervolles Bett. Ich hatte ein Zimmer noch hinten zu einer Schule (Nach der Schulzeit relativ laut durch Sch√ºler,die kreischend durch die Gegend laufen, daf√ºr am abend und Wochenende kein L√§rm). Beim n√§chsten Mal w√ºrde ich auf jeden Fall ohne Fr√ºhst√ºck buchen, da Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet - welches im Preis inbegriffen ist - keinerlei warme Alternativen bietet und das √† la carte Fr√ºhst√ºck preislich sehr moderat ist. Dar√ºberhinaus ist die Lage unschlagbar. Alles was wir unternommen hatten (Tower, Md Tussaud, Buckingham Palace etc) konnte ohne umsteigen von der U-Bahn South Kensington stattfinden. Zur√ºck nach Heathrow mit der U-Bahn (max. 1 Stunde mit Warten ab South Kensington, super preiswert 5,40 pro Person) Ich war Anfang des Jahres im Corinthia (eines der teuersten Hotels in London 3 Zimmer im Ampersand = 1 zimmer im Corinthia), aber Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis im Ampersand unschlagbar, nie wieder Corinthia, immer wieder Ampersand",5,2012,12,23
129,Komplett neu renoviertes Hotel zu angemessenem Preis,"The Ampersand Hotel ist ein wirklich komplett neu renoviertes Hotel mit altehrw√ºrdiger Fassade. Das Interieur ist modern und frisch. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet und insbesondere sehr freundlich. Die Preise sind - gemessen am hohen Londoner Preisnineau - angemessen.

Das Hotel liegt nur wenige Gehminuten vom absolut sehenswerten Natural History Museum entfernt. Ebenfalls in der N√§he l√§dt Harrods zum Shoppen ein.

Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet, aber relativ klein. Der Stil mit den imposanten Betten und den dunklen M√∂beln ist vermutlich nicht jedermanns Sache. Mir gefiel's durchaus, ebenso wie die gewagten Farb- und Formvariationen im Foyer und im Restaurant. Die Betten sind sehr bequem. Die Badezimmer sind ebenfalls komplett neu, aber klein. Der Duschkopf ist riesig und √ºberrascht trotzdem mit einem guten Wasserdruck. Das technische Equipment ist tadellos, WLAN ist kostenlos.

Vermutlich nur ein dummer Zufall war, dass wir mit dem Fahrstuhl steckenblieben - aber schnell befreit wurden. Eine Garage hat das Hotel nicht. Valet Parking kostet rund 40 Pfund f√ºr 24 Stunden.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war sehr variantenreich und reichhaltig, allerdings nicht im Preis inbegriffen. Es wird im Restaurant im Souterrain serviert. Neben dem Foyer gibt es einen farbenfrohen Sitzbereich, der zu Tee und Kuchen einl√§dt.

Etwas besorgt war ich vor der Buchung √ºber einzelne Kommentare, man w√ºrde in den Zimmern von der U-Bahn gest√∂rt. In der Tat sp√ºrte ich die U-Bahn, als wir durch das Foyer gingen. In unseren insgesamt drei Zimmern im ersten und zweiten Stock wurden wir jedoch nicht durch die U-Bahn gest√∂rt. Nachteiliger ist, dass man bei der Renovierung die Fenster ausgelassen zu haben scheint. Der L√§rm von der Stra√üe war bei unserem Zimmer deutlich h√∂rbar. Im √ºbrigen befindet sich ein zweiter Fl√ºgel des Hotels noch im Umbau - jedoch ohne dass wir dadurch in irgendeiner Weise gest√∂rt wurden.

Unter dem Strich f√ºhlt man sich im Ampersand wohl, die moderne Ausstattung verspr√ºht eine gewisse Fr√∂hlichkeit. Wer in einem wirklich neuen, kein bi√üchen verwohnten und doch individuellem Hotel zu einem fairen Preis √ºbernachten m√∂chte, ist hier gut aufgehoben.",5,2012,10,22
129,"Tolle Lage, sch√∂nes Ambiente, Service ausbauf√§hig, allenfalls 4 Sterne.","In Erwartung eines neuen 5 Sterne Hauses in toller Lage sind wir angereist, und ja, die Lage ist super und nein, ein 5 Sterne Hotel ist es nicht! Bereits am Eingang zeigt sich das deutlich: Stufen,keine Rampe f√ºr Menschen mit Handicap, keine automatische T√ºr und kein Doorman der meiner Mutter mit dem schweren Koffer geholfen h√§tte. Der erste negative Eindruck setzte sich an der Rezeption fort. Obwohl bereits lange vor der Er√∂ffnung gebucht war das Hotel nicht in der Lage 3 Zimmer, alle auf den gleichen Namen gebucht,auf einer Etage zu finden....
Im Zimmer angekommen fanden wir ein ansprechendes Design und eine f√ºr London ordentliche Gr√∂√üe vor.Dies gilt f√ºr die von uns gebuchten Deluxe-Zimmer. Leider mangelte es an der Sorgfalt des Reinigungspersonals: im Bad gab es einen verschmutzten Bademantel und der Telefonh√∂rer war noch voller Make-Up meiner Vorg√§ngerin. Das gerufene Housekeeping ging sehr widerwillig mit der Beschwerde um. Ich h√§tte auch lieber  darauf verzichtet.
Die Sauberkeit scheint eh etwas vernachl√§ssigt zu werden, denn die Spuren der Bauarbeiter die noch im Hotel arbeiten fanden sich √ºberall und Schmutz direkt vor meinem Zimmer fand sich dort auch noch am √ºbern√§chsten Tag, ebenso der Staub auf dem Nachttisch.
Die Ausstattung ist sehr ansprechend, dies t√§uscht aber nicht √ºber die M√§ngel hinweg. Der versprochene Fitnessraum ist noch nicht fertig, w√§re kein Problem, wenn es darauf irgendeinen Hinweis vor der Anreise oder sp√§testens an der Rezeption beim Check-In g√§be.Weder im E-Concierge ( eine tolle Idee, wenn er alle Infos enthielte) noch in der pers√∂nlichen Email vor der Anreise stand etwas von andauernden Bauarbeiten und noch nicht voll funktionst√ºchtigen Serviceleistungen.
Eine sehr l√§stige Angelegenheit sind die T√ºren, die nur laut krachend ins Schloss fallen und die andauernden St√∂rungen fr√ºhmorgens ( vor 8 Uhr) durch das Housekeeping, obwohl jeder sehen kann, das das Zimmer vom Gast gerade genutzt wird.
Meine Bitte die Zeitung doch meinem Zimmer zu zu ordnen wurde schlichtweg ignoriert, sie landete immer im falschen Zimmer.Dann bitte nicht anbieten.
Im Ganzen macht das Personal einen noch recht ungeschulten Eindruck, hier besteht Handlungsbedarf. Vielleicht w√§re ein Praktikum in einem befreundeten 5 Sterne Haus ganz n√ºtzlich. 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist qualitativ gut, weshalb man aber mit Musik bedr√∂hnt wird, die anscheinend nicht in der Lautst√§rke reguliert werden kann, wei√ü ich nicht. 
Die im Zimmerpreis enthaltenen Softdrinks aus der Minibar sind eine gute Idee, machen aber die offensichtlichen M√§ngel, vor allem im Service, leider nicht wett.
TV-Ton ist auch im Bad zu h√∂ren und wer den Ton regulieren m√∂chte: der Schalter ist hinter den Badem√§nteln versteckt! So war dies zumindest in unseren Zimmerm.
In einigen Zimmern riecht es nach Feuchtigkeit und in meinem Zimmer wurde zuvor geraucht.

Alles in allem: ein ordentliches Hotel der Mittelklasse, aber der Anspruch ein 5 Sterne Haus zu sein ist doch wohl etwas zu hoch gegriffen.

5 Sterne gibt es von uns f√ºr die Lage, die Verkehrsanbindung ist super, viele Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten sind zu Fu√ü erreichbar, auch die Messe in Earl's Court,aber das ist nicht das Verdienst des Hotels.

Weitere √úbernachtungen werde ich mir sehr genau √ºberlegen.",3,2012,10,03
129,Klein aber fein,"Das Hotel ist sehr gut gelegen, direkt gegen√ºber der Tube station South Kensington. Hierher fahren 3 U-Bahn Linien.Und viele Busse, z.B.die Linie C1 von Victoria station Richtung White City, bis fast direkt vor die Haust√ºr. Der Empfang war freundlich. Das Zimmer stand leider erst ab 14h zur Verf√ºgung. Da allerdings ohne Wasser, denn das Hotel ist noch nicht fertig umgebaut.
Mein Standart-Zimmer lag in der 1. Etage und wirkte auf den 1. Blick klein und dunkel, denn das Fenster ging zum Innenhof, wie alle Zimmer, die auf 01,02 oder 03 enden.
Die Ausstattung war allerdings wunderbar. Ein super bequemes Bett, ein umwerfendes Badezimmer, freier und unkomplizierter Internetzugang, Flatscreen TV auch mit deutschen Sendern, tolle Designerleuchten, gute Aircondition und viele liebevolle Details, die nicht der Selbstdarstellung des Hotels dienen, sondern dem Gast! Milch und Softdrinks in der Minibar ohne Berechnung, Safe, ein kleiner Schreibtisch mit allen Anschl√ºssen, die man brauchen k√∂nnte, ein Regenschirm im Schrank, ein guter F√∂n und eine Hand-Kaffeemaschine, Lautsprecher auch im Bad, ein I-Dock f√ºrs i-phone oder i-pod. Great!
Negativ sind die wirklich laut zufallenden T√ºren der Nachbarn und der Baul√§rm.Aber das ist bestimmt in ein paar Wochen vorbei. Einziger Minuspunkt war die Sauberkeit. Die Nachttische waren wirklich schmutzig, genauso wie die T√ºr. Wahrscheinlich wird nur kurz Staub gewischt...was bei dem Baudreck nicht reicht. Und der Spalt zwischen Nachttisch und Schrank war (noch)nicht tapeziert. Der Roomservice war schnell und gut. Die Restaurants habe ich nicht besucht. In der direkten Umgebung gibt es viele, gute Restaurants und Cafes, sowie ein Tesco und Waitrose um die Ecke.
Fazit:man ist in den kleinen Zimmern gut aufgehoben, wenn man nicht viel Gep√§ck hat und/oder nur kurz bleibt. Ich habe meinen Koffer im Bad gelagert, denn im Zimmer war daf√ºr einfach kein Platz mehr √ºbrig. F√ºr 2 Personen gibt es zu wenig Stauraum im Standart-Zimmer.
