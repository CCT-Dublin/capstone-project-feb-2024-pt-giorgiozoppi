122,Mohit and staff,Mohit was very helpful as well as the other staff here they helped me out though a stressful time after I was pickpocketed in central London they made me become relaxed and comfortable I must appreciate them for their help and most definitely to come back again,5,2024,10,20
122,The Honeymooners,"My wife Joyce and I spent our honeymoon here at Chelsea Harbour Hotel. Room and facilities in our two-room suite were first class, but as we spent three successive nights in London’s theatre land we found it a little too far out. Otherwise we would have given five stars. Room service excellent and staff friendly and efficient. Recommend you use the Uber boat service into London; black cabs have become prohibitively expensive. Nearby Battersea Power Station is well worth a visit. and take the 109 lift for stunning views. By the way, I am an octogenarian and Joyce is 90 next month. So we are not your usual newly weds. Have a nice rest of your lives and, remember, love conquers everything.",4,2024,10,18
122,Friendly high quality hotel,"We always stay at the Chelsea Harbour, every room is a suite and the staff are so friendly
from Claud the concierge to Muhit the Guest Relations Manager.
The level of cleanliness was also very high 
Would definitely return.
We didn’t try the food so can’t comment.
Thank you",5,2024,10,16
122,Lovely hotel but check trains are working if reliant on them,"Spotlessly clean hotel with modern rooms and great bathroom. Very quiet and comfy bed so a great nights sleep. 
Downside was also many tube lines not working but that was not the fault of the hotel. We used a Uber boat to get to the embankment but there is only one an hour and it was so busy that only half those queuing could get on. The mainline station is so closed but unfortunately that was closed too for engineering works. We got a taxi back from the west end in the evening.  We got back to the hotel bar for a drink quite early but despite being busy the bar suddenly  closed and all the bright lights were turned on. Spoilt the end of the evening a little and maybe they could have called last orders as is traditional in most bars. We would return to this hotel though and would imagine it’s lovely in the summer, being right on the harbour. We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel as it was expensive but we walked to Battersea for breakfast where there were several nice coffee places. It was a pleasant 45 minute walk along the river with footpaths all the way and lots of dog walkers and joggers. Enjoyed it.",4,2024,10,14
122,The best hotel ever!,"The staff were so polite and welcoming ,our room was amazing.It was my sisters birthday and they had made a cake out of towels,they then bought a little chocolate torte for her.Overall it was a spectacular trip we will definitely visit again.",5,2024,10,12
122,Great visit,"Amazing stay for 1 night with free unexpected upgrade to penthouse apartment.  Breakfast great, room amazing, bar lovely. Check in /out extremely slow but apart from that couldn’t fault the place.
View from the room was great. Hotel is located a short walk to imperial wharf but you can also walk from other tubes. We walked into the centre of London via the river which was a lovely walk. Also very close to Chelsea fc which was the reason for our visit.",5,2024,10,07
122,Spa experience,"We visited the spa on a whim after another spa booking was cancelled last minute and we struggled to find availability elsewhere.

We paid £40 for 4 hours and really enjoyed the experience. Staff were lovely and helpful and the spa was clean. 

Refreshments included fruit water, nespresso and a variety of teas however no regular tea or mint. Apples and biscuits also available.

Marked down because children were allowed. I think this should be made clear before booking as screaming really takes away from the spa experience. The steam room was just a warm room rather than a proper steam room (however the sauna was great).",4,2024,10,06
122,Beautiful stay,"Me and my boyfriend had a lovely stay at this hotel. The room was stunning, very spacious and clean. We had a balcony view which looked over the harbour, very stunning. Fahad & Andreas were very welcoming and funny. I will definitely be back to stay here again",5,2024,10,06
122,Amazing hotel stay,"The stay was amazing, the room was lush with so much space to roam.

We look forward to coming back in November .,5,2024,10,05

122,Didn't live up to expectations,"Arrived quite late, 9.30pm on a Saturday with two younger children - had made the hotel aware earlier in the day we'd be arriving a bit later.

Reception was friendly enough but slightly off-putting when they're making calls on their mobile (work related) while checking you in.

Sofa bed in lounge not made up so had to wait for housekeeping to come and do this when all we wanted to do was to put children to bed.  This surprised me as clearly we had a booking for 4 people so why wasn't this done sooner?

Room was very large and spacious, balcony on the non-harbour site seems a little pointless to me.  Top drawer in chest of drawers in the bedroom wouldn't close, with nothing in it (room 203) and just kept rolling open which was slightly annoying.  Lovely toiletries in the room - shame about the very poor toilet roll paper!

Breakfast was ok, could do with more cereal choice (cornflakes, museli, granola) and a bigger toaster.  Staff were friendly and helpful at breakfast.",3,2024,10,01
122,Harbour view suite.,"Wonderful location and really good value for money. 
Clean and tastefully decorated rooms and very welcoming staff. Good transfer links to central London. There'sa spa and swimming pool in the hotel too. I'll definitely go back there again.",5,2024,09,30

122,Great breakfast service . Really liked how Ian and Reagan demonstrated positive attitude,"Ian and Reagan service was outstanding from start to finish. Both were welcoming, attentive, and genuinely eager to ensure a positive experience. Upon arrival, we were greeted with warm smiles, and they quickly seated us at a clean, well-prepared table. Throughout the meal, they were attentive without being intrusive, checking in to ensure we had everything we needed and promptly refilling coffee or water. Special requests, like dietary preferences, were handled graciously, and it was quick to accommodate. The professionalism and friendliness from both of them  really elevated the experience, making us feel valued .",5,2024,09,28
122,Excellent breakfast service,Excellent experience with swimming pool which the kids enjoyed. Ian and Regan provided excellent service at the breakfast table. They asked us if we needed extra food and gave the kids specially prepared omelette which kids like very much.,5,2024,09,28

122,Malika Is The Best ,"Thoroughly enjoyed our experience. First class all the way.  Especially the restaurant hostess Malika.  Had early morning flight and she made special effort to get coffee for my wife and I. Took the extra step in order to take care of us.  This was especially helpful since I screwed up our Uber and was in the dog house with my wife. 
Thanks to Malika's efforts, I got out of the dog house.",5,2024,09,23

122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa: A Riverside Gem,"Experience luxury at its finest at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa. Nestled along the picturesque Thames, this hotel boasts an unbeatable location with stunning views.

The surrounding area is a delight to explore, with charming cafes dotting the landscape and the fashionable King's Road within easy walking distance.

They are the epitome of outstanding service, going out of their way to ensure every guest has an unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, they were attentive, friendly, and incredibly helpful, making us feel right at home. Their local knowledge and willingness to assist with every need made our stay exceptional. This hotel is a solid 5-star, and Jey and Azher are a big part of why. Highly recommend booking here!",5,2024,09,19
122,Great stay,"Great location and stunning view. Staff were very helpful, in particular Azher at the front desk.

122,Excellent Service,"I really loved the service provided by everyone.
Everyone is super cautious and polite. Starting from how we got opened the door up to the receptionists Jey and Jiny, who introduced us to all services.

122,5 stars well deserved,"I had the most perfect time at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa. I was there for business to carry out a detailed 360 CGI of various area of the hotel. 

From the moment I got in the evening before, al the reception staff including the front of house and reception were absolutely joyful and couldn't do enough to help me feel welcome and appreciated as a guest.

Being booked  for a job at 5am meant that  the hotel offered me a beautiful suite in which to relax and I even managed to  check out their swimming pool whose temperature was perfect and the spa. Thanks Chelsea Hotel and Spa for organising this for me",5,2024,09,17

122,Weak to non-existent maintenance service for a 5-star establishment,"My wife and I arrived late on a Friday evening after a long day's travelling. The room was well equipped, and the bathroom had both a separated loo (with a bidet as well) and a separate shower cabinet in addition to the bath. We both like a bath in the evening to relax, and especially after travelling. BUT no bathplug, so no bath. I phoned Reception, who appeared and confirmed 'yes, indeed, no bathplug', and promised to get it sorted the next day. We were out from midday until late but when we returned, NO BATHPLUG. We were due to leave early on the Monday morning, so on Sunday evening I met the duty manager. Nice person who apologised profusely and promised a 10% compensatory refund on the room cost (which had already been paid).  As of this time of writing a month later, still NO REFUND.
In fairness, perhaps the maintenance staff were too busy dealing with severe issues and keeping the rest of the hotel from falling apart that they had no time to deal with a minor matter such as a bathplug. Or possibly the bean-counters reckon that the cost of maintenance over a weekend is not something they want to finance.
To mention something positive, the staff are courteous and helpful, and the restaurant is very good. BUT I strongly recommend to anyone booked into this hotel to take their own bathplug with them.",3,2024,09,14
122,A gem in London,"Beautifully located by a small harbour with boats and surrounded by exclusive flats, this wonderful place is somethung quite special. The staff are extremely kind and helpful, and the food and service are outstanding. Five stars from me - without doubt",5,2024,09,14
122,Great guest services,Mohit greeted us upon arrival and departure with such enthusiasm and friendliness. He encompasses all the qualities of a welcoming host and continued to do so brilliantly.  The hotel itself on the other hand have seen better days and checking in was delayed.,3,2024,09,13

122,BETTER NOT TO GO,"CHOOSE ANOTHER HOTEL
Just 4 points to justify my opinion: 1. Fire alarm rings at 5 in the morning, no explanation no fire. 2 the Booking offer says 20£ breakfast, they charge 35£ and no way to change it. 3. My room was beside an elevator under reparation, the hotel was not full, no way to tele working after 10 am. 4. They charge the bill and the entrance fee (300£), I asked for returning and they say they do, I need to claim afterwards from home.",1,2024,09,11
122,All I can say is that this is such a nice place to be. Enjoyed the pool as I never wanted to get off the water 😂🤣.,It was a lovely place and I enjoyed spending time here with my wife on her birthday.

The view is amazing and hotel is beautiful I will definitely be returning to this hotel! Can not wait for my spa service in the morning! My favourite hotel to come to !",5,2024,09,10
122,So unfortunate with check-in,"Very unfortunate front desk service. We have stayed in the Chelsea Harbor Hotel three times this summer.. our first experience was fabulous with the front desk, but then it has been downhill since then.  We had so much trouble with the second check that we asked to speak to the manager who really did not help. And this last time has been terrible. For example, as we tried to check out, a man walked in through his parking ticket to the front desk lady asking for his car. She stopped processing up and went in the back to deal with him.  How rude to us and how rude was the guest to the front desk lady yet she jumped to him and left us waiting.
   Sadly, the front desk, service, and website are bad.
   However, the food is delicious, the weight staff lovely, and the rooms are very nice. be prepared for an up charge. Should you want anything other than a view of the above ground train.  The spa needs work, but at least there is a nice sauna swimming pool and steam room.
   With two rooms and the Chelsea location, the hotel is a good value just so sad about the check-in.",2,2024,09,09
122,Welcoming staff make the hotel!,"Beautiful hotel, gorgeous rooms (worth the upgrade).  Staff were very welcoming and friendly.

A highlight was definitely the chocolates given from a treasure chest at the end. The spa was so relaxing and all the staff were kind and attentive. Definitely will come back!",5,2024,09,05
122,Excellent hotel and marvellous staff as well,"Very good hotel I have been to this hotel for last 20 years and its excellent having a suite its the biggest room you get in London without paying a tremendous amount, but also got the pool and spa. Also I like to mention the following receptionists Zakia who was wonderful after I ask her to give me a higher floor and she did it without any explanation and also Hamza both of which gave me a nice conversation I also met them when I left as well, The only thing is that its far from centre of Town, but thats easy just get a cab or walk to Fulham Broadway, you can be in Piccadilly in 20 mins. and quicker if you want to go to Knightsbridge for expensive shopping, so I highly recommend this hotel",5,2024,09,03

The decor has also been improved in the suites.

All staff were amazingly friendly, warm and welcoming.

We have been coming to this hotel for over 14 years and it’s always a pleasure to come to this hidden gem. In fact we stayed here when we got married in Chelsea 14 years ago tomorrow! It has a special place in our heart.

We are looking forward to coming back in November for our wedding anniversary.
Thank you all for a delightful stay.

122,Friendly staff,"I checked in today and the front desk staff are very friendly and helpful, especially Mohit and Azher! Mohit was exceptionally welcoming when I checked in to the room. I forgot to bring a converter with me for the outlets and Azher provided one for me to use during my stay.",5,2024,08,20
122,Stay at Chelsea is always Pleasant,"We always prefers to stay at Chelsea Harbor since 6 years now. 
We all loved the rooms and quite pleasant location and the warm greeting staff specially Fahad and Luz they always tried best to resolve my problems and yes Stan at restaurant is very kind and helpfull.
We will surely be coming back in December for Christmas celebration.
Only issue we faced is no cold water and televisin chanels are still not working rest all is amazing.",5,2024,08,20
122,A Truly Beautiful and Comforting Place,"Our stay at this hotel was made exceptional by the wonderful staff. Smita and her team truly enhanced our experience, making it the most memorable one. Although we encountered a few initial issues, Smita promptly ensured everything was perfectly in order.

Thank you for an extraordinary stay—the serene views were simply breathtaking. We’re already looking forward to our next holiday here and can't wait to see you again, Smita!",5,2024,08,20
122,The worst hotel we have ever stayed in,"It has taken a lot for me to write this as I normally prefer to try to resolve any issues directly with the hotel.  In the case of this hotel it would be a waste time as the problem is at the top. We are fortunate to work all over the world and stay in some wonderful places with excellent service.  But, having stayed in this hotel for many times  – and having read many of the problems that other guests have experienced – I felt I had to register my profound and overwhelming disappointment.  Apart from a couple of people working there (Luz and Mohit, who tried their best to make us feel welcome),  the hotel has some very serious problems.  Not only are many of the rooms tired, dirty and broken with poor air conditioning, but the level of personal care towards guests is severely lacking.  If there is any problem with the hotel and guests dare to raise these, the guests are made to feel that they are the ones being difficult.  The check-in is dire,  the room service is slow, the fitness centre needs a complete refit and the behaviour of senior management towards both guests and their own staff is appalling.  Our most recent experience was so dreadful that we couldn’t wait to leave.  No doubt the hotel will respond in a self-justifying manner, as they have done to other criticisms that have been levied at them.  There needs to be a complete change in management for this hotel to function as a professional and customer-orientated business.  I would recommend, in the meantime, that people steer clear of this hotel.",1,2024,08,19
122,Smita was really good staff,"We reached here with our family for holiday of one month and it was really good
Thank you so much Smita for your support and help.................................................................................................",5,2024,08,18
122,Taylor Swift Eras Tour,We had a very positive stay at the hotel one the first night our shower was broken and the staff was at our room first thing in the morning to repair it. Our stay in Chelsea was beautiful and the hotel made our stay very pleasant. Azher at reception was extremely helpful.,5,2024,08,17
122,Family friendly hotel and a good value,"we stayed  there for 5 days and overall we had an excellent experience. The front desk, Mohit, Zakia and Smitha was very helpful. When we arrived early, Smitha was able to provide us with shower options and Mohit and Zakia ensured that our room was available on time. The service staff is prompt and very responsive. The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel is conveniently located, within walking distance (~  1 mile) to underground subway and a variety of eating options (we did not use either the breakfast bar or the spa, so cannot comment about those).  Overall, the hotel is a very family friendly place and a very good option for those planning on visiting london.",5,2024,08,17
122,A good few days,"Nice hotel in a great location. 
Restaurants and reception area are lovely. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious, although getting a little tired. 
Pool was nice and changing rooms large and comfortable. 
Majority of the staff were really helpful, friendly and professional. 
Evening meals were good and the bar area was lovely to sit in. 
Breakfast was a bit chaotic with very little help or attention from the staff. Ended up having buffet breakfast with no hot drink as no one came to take our order. It was very expensive considering the service. 
All in all it was a good stay and we would return but probably will eat breakfast out in future.",4,2024,08,16
122,Tina,The Hotel was fantastic and the staff was  splendid. Viktor at the bar made a perfect cappuccino and the chocolate cake was super! He was very nice and professional. The view at the Harbour was lovely and we could have stayed here forever and ever.,5,2024,08,14
122,Welcoming and hospitable,"Mohit was extremely friendly, welcoming and hospitable after our long red eye! Gabriella was also very kind and helpful at the hotel restaurant. Looking forward to returning to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa the next time we visit London.",5,2024,08,14
122,Great experiences,"The Spa & Pool were totally amazing experiences.  The hotel has a beautiful 18 meter pool with natural light. It was so relaxing I would highly recommend it. The Main Hotel bar was fab with friendly and professional staff,  we sat out on the terrace over looking the harbour which was stunning, watching the sunset.",5,2024,08,13
122,I love it,Azher and fahad are the best they are very kind and helpful  and the hotel is very nice and the staff are very friendly good hospitality and customer service everything was very good the view is nice the hotel is clean and it smells very very good,5,2024,08,12
122,"On The Skids, and The End Of The Line.","We stayed here for 6 nights in 2023 and 23 nights in 2024 – so this is not just a one-night review.
This hotel has two main problems:
Check in procedures which typically result in one to two hours waiting in the hotel lobby.
Poor quality rooms with varying faults (unreliable a/c, bathroom taps and showers, power sockets, improperly fitting entry and cupboard doors – to name just some) in both renovated and unrenovated rooms.
Check In
The pre-arrival electronic registration form is then largely ignored. We always requested two things – twin beds, and no interconnecting doors (this quickly included a third request of a renovated room, because the unrenovated rooms were grubby, dated and old more in keeping with a two/three star hotel).
Check in is from 1500. The first few times we arrived at 1500 – but then spent one to two hours in the lobby – a part of the hotel you will quickly get to know. And here’s the problem. Having waited that time, you are normally told “We are so busy we can’t give you the room you requested”.
Individual staff are pleasant enough, but they mutter there is little they can do because of restrictions and how their hands are tied behind their backs. Not reassuring.
We then turned up earlier, telephoned earlier, or even informed the staff at the end of the previous visit when we would next be back.
But every visit was like Groundhog Day – the long wait, the wrong room. And it really felt like the hotel thought they were doing us a great favour by giving us the room we had requested. 
We were once given one of the enormous penthouse suites (because in spite of many conversations, calls and emails leading up to a three day stay the hotel still could not find the normal room type we had requested). This penthouse had more faults than the normal rooms – missing light bulbs, shower controls falling off, a/c that was marginal at best and which four calls to maintenance made no difference. Oh, to be in our normal room with fewer faults!
Appealing to managers at any level was fruitless. It soon became obvious that there were many other complaining guests having bad experiences as well – and that overall the hotel is involved with daily firefighting, rather than providing the basic level of customer experience.
It seemed like the more often we stayed, the worse we were being treated.
We just became accustomed to this poor service and just put up with it, until it all ended in the most unpleasant circumstances last week.
As usual I had turned up at 1100 to say we would be arriving at 1500 – to give them time to find a twin bed renovated room with no interconnecting door. I came back at 1400 to say the same and had also phoned in the meantime. I had asked reception to call me when the room was ready – but they didn’t. At 1700 I finally arrived but was only offered a double renovated with interconnecting door, or a double unrenovated. I declined both, saying that they had spent six hours and still not found a correct room. 
And then we met the Grim Reaper – the Operations Director. An unsmiling Gold Medal Winner in indifference, sarcasm and devoid of any customer care he took less than two minutes to get from saying “Hello” to “If you don’t like either of the rooms go and stay elsewhere”. When I said we could reluctantly take one of the rooms if we could get a rollaway bed, he said he would have to charge for it. We had medical reasons for needing the extra bed, a fact of which he was well aware. 
You can imagine our response.  Not only were we not given the room we had requested but now he was going to make us pay for the inconvenience the hotel was causing us!
And at that point he asked us to leave. But it could have been so different, such as “We can do the extra bed for free” or “I’m sorry we haven’t got you the right room after six hours, can we make it up to you with a drink/breakfast”. Nothing. Just get out.
His sudden change in behaviour was so physically and emotionally threatening towards my wife and I that we felt genuinely intimidated. How does someone in a hospitality business think that this is appropriate, and get away with it?
We travel the world with our work, stay in so many hotels with their loyalty cards (and are even Prestige Members of Millenium) but have never received such a pre-determined stubborn refusal to help a customer. Hostile, offensive and shocking. My wife, who had undergone a serious operation ten days before (which is why we needed the two beds – as she has abdominal stitches) was left shaking uncontrollably, almost fainted and was on the verge of needing an ambulance.
Nothing will change in this hotel until there is a root and branch shake-up to the service ethos – from the top management (who I guess set the confrontational and hostile tone) to the bottom.
As a postscript, just as we left, we met a family who, after twenty years of staying at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, also said the standards in the hotel had significantly declined over the last five years. We finally checked into our suite in another hotel and, within a few minutes, we were reminded of how joyful an experience staying in a professionally run up-to-date hotel can be.
Avoid the Chelsea Harbour Hotel at all costs unless you want a truly miserable experience.",1,2024,08,11
122,Fulfilling and relaxing,"Smita was warm and friendly. Also very resourceful and helpful. 

Very cosy, world class service, definitely in the 5 star range. Would come back. My family loved it. Especially my son. My wife enjoyed the spa and the suite was impeccable.  The room was serene and peaceful……………………………………………………………………………………",5,2024,08,11

The safety in this hotel is 10/10 i didnt worry about my stuff getting stolen. Thank you for your efforts in making my stay this pleasant and i will definitely come back again.",5,2024,08,02
122,Amazing hotel!,"I cannot express how happy I was with my stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel!  We booked the Chelsea family balcony suite, the room was very spacious, it felt like a mini apartment. It had a king size bed and a pull out couch in two separate rooms, tv in each room, a desk with chair in one room and the other had a mini vanity with chair, a full bathroom with shower, tub, 2 sinks, toilet and even a bidet.  Christian Lacroix shampoo and body care products.  It also had an additional 1/2 bathroom with sink and toilet.  It had a mini bar that had a fridge, Nespresso machine and tea kettle. The mini bar had complimentary coffee pods, Nescafé, tea, hot chocolate, Biscoff cookies and water, and it was restocked daily.  The pool and spa was great, it had an indoor pool, sauna and steam room, and changing room with lockers and showers.  I was definitely impressed with the hotel accommodations and amenities but to top it off the service was top notch, from the moment you walk in, it smells amazing!  Zakia checked us in and out and she was wonderful! Very polite and professional!  The manager will follow up after housekeeping cleans your room to make sure we had everything we needed.  We had a very comfortable stay at this hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone!  Truly wonderful and exceptional hospitality!!",5,2024,08,01
122,100% recommend.,"We stayed at the suite and since the moment we arrived everyone was super nice and helpful. The suite is big and clean and everything we asked for was delivered right away.

Thanks again to Jey and Azher, they have the very best attitude and extremely hospitable.",5,2024,07,31
122,My favourite hotel,I stayed at the Chelsea harbour hotel again for a work trip. I love this hotel. The rooms are great. They’re big rooms giving a separate living area with the bedroom being bigger than most hotel rooms anyway. Always clean and cleaned everyday. It’s great relaxing on the balcony once you get in. Overall great hotel which I love staying at and friendly staff you can have a laugh with. Especially Mohit when we were talking and having a laugh about beards as I was checking out.,5,2024,07,31
122,First Class,"Zakia and the whole team from  reception day team the  night staff are just first class nothing to much trouble . The hotel is spotless food,bar restaurant rooms and gym fantastic we have  booked again for September Well Done Chelsea  Harbour see you soon",5,2024,07,31

122,Great stay,"This hotel is really beautiful from the moment you walk in. The staff are wonderful, really polite and helpful. The rooms are impeccably clean and the breakfast was delicious. 

The only thing I can pick fault with, is the parking isn’t great. Other than that a 10/10 stay.",5,2024,07,24
122,My stay at Chelsea harbor hotel,"I loved the hotel as front desk especially Smita with lovely smile has been so welcoming and kind. All my arrivals are taken care by her, restaurant is really good they are able to find the food that’s not on menu who is really hospitable special thanks to Reddy and Stella. Room is really good and spacious. Thanks A lot Smita for all your help and support you made this place as second home to me",5,2024,07,24
122,Good ambience,"I went to the restaurant that belonging to the hotel.
Visited with my friends.
Service was really nice. Ambiance was nice as well. The restaurant is located alongside of the harbor.
Especially, Enrika and Stella was amazing duo. 
But tbh, booze and foods are quite overpriced compare to the quality.
Hope you would work with that!

Thank you!",5,2024,07,24
122,Fantastic hotel in a superb location,"Checked in late after a long drive and working at a local sporting event. I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman called Fahad who made check in swift and gave me a very welcoming upgrade. Hotel is well located and immaculate, amenities are great, staff at breakfast and in the bar were also very polite and helpful. I am looking forward to my next stay in a couple of weeks.",5,2024,07,24
122,Avoid at all costs ,"I booked for my sister recently to stay at this hotel for 10 days, and it was an awful experience from start. The check-in process wasn't smooth, and it took forever to get her bags to the room. To top it all off, they gave her a room with a wall view instead of the booked room with Marina view.
The biggest issue was the room itself. It was filthy – completely unacceptable for any hotel, apalagi ( apalagi means ""especially"" in Indonesian) for a place claiming to be up to standards.

Save yourself the trouble and avoid this hotel! There are many other options that will provide a relaxing and enjoyable stay.",1,2024,07,23
122,Amazing Service,"As mentioned I would I like to extend a huge thank you to all the staff who assisted with the EMLT meeting 
Special mention to the following staff:
To you Marco with the pre -planning of the event, rooming lists and all other general queries 
Chris and his onsite banqueting/operations team– nothing was too much trouble
With their welcoming smiles and friendly demeanour, Luz, Bianca, Mohit and the team at the front desk assisted who welcomed an assisted with check-in and check-out. 
Mo who helped with transfers 
Thank you to everyone who made our guests stay a memorable one!
I’d also like to acknowledge those staff who work behind the scenes who also assist in the smooth running of the hotel.  It is a great pleasure to work with a team of staff with great people skills, exceptional attention to detail and that work together with a contagious enthusiasm and attitude.
I look forward to working with you all again soon",5,2024,07,22
122,The trip,This was an amazing hotel experience the  Brazilian lady at front desk I believe her name is luz was very accommodation and very professional she made sure we enjoyed our stay. The staff in general are very nice. The hotel amenities are amazing,5,2024,07,22
122,Luce And The Hotel,"During our recent stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, we had the pleasure of being assisted by Luce, a member of the hotel staff who truly made our visit remarkable. From the moment we arrived, Luce's warmth and professionalism stood out, making us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for.

Luce's attention to detail and commitment to excellent service were evident throughout our stay. She went above and beyond to ensure that our family was comfortable, from assisting with our luggage to providing helpful recommendations for local attractions and dining options.",5,2024,07,22
122,Terrible,"Our recent stay was deeply disappointing due to the poor service provided by Azher and the front desk staff. From the beginning, it was clear they did not have our best interests at heart. We dropped our bags off at 1pm and confirmed that our room would be set up for three people. This had been assured by email by Bia Bunch. However, at 5pm, the room was only set up for two. Bianca at the front desk assured us this would be fixed by our return from dinner. When we returned at 11pm, nothing had been done. Azher and Bianca promised to bring sheets to make up the sofa bed. Apparently there were no spare quilts or pillows for us. After 30 minutes of waiting, we had to return to the front desk to ask again, wanting only to sleep. By midnight, Azher arrived only to discover that our ""sofa bed"" was just a sofa. This is unacceptable for a 5-star hotel, especially since we paid for a suite to accommodate four and had written confirmation for three. Their only response was that they were fully booked and nothing could be done. This is not an appropriate response. As a result, one of us had to sleep on an uncomfortable sofa with makeshift bedding. Sadly, after reading other reviews we are not the only guests that have been severely neglected by the staff at this establishment.  Our experience in this hotel was completely ruined by having to chase staff for basic accommodations until midnight. We are profoundly disappointed with the customer service at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. Smita at the front desk acknowledged the unacceptable nature of our experience and assured us that a full refund would be approved. On returning home we have been  correspondening with Expedia, with whom we booked and paid for the room with. At present the hotel have refused to refund any money.",1,2024,07,20
122,Very helpful staff & very clean rooms,The Chelsea harbour hotel is a beautiful hotel. I love the ambience & the staff are incredible helpful. Mohit especially. I’ll always return as i love the food here & the views are incredible. The promixity to major stores also is a major plus. 10/10 hotel.,5,2024,07,20
122,Lovely stay😀,"Lovely experience as always, excellent welcome by Zakia and Mohit.
We will be back.
Happy to hear it will be refurbished, the space in the rooms is glorious but they can do with a revamp. Looking forward to our next stay. ……………………………………………….",5,2024,07,20
122,F&B lacks attentiveness; rooms nice but some minor flaws.,"I stayed here between 14-17th July, bit of a mixed experience, staying in Room 615.

The good: The renovated rooms are really comfortable, quiet and have all the amenities anyone could want at a great price point. The rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff always excellent and on top of everything. It was evident they were proud of the service they provide and were great.

Some minor gripes: the bedside tables are bizarrely nowhere the bed, you need long arms to operate the nightlights! The window cannot open, so if you like (or like me actually need) a little fresh air to help you sleep, I'd suggest to ask for or book the harbour side. The air conditioners are little noisy and the showers have reasonable flow, but not really any pressure. As I say these are minor points, but for some could be an issue.

The worst part of the experience was from the F&B side. I went into the bar area fully intending to get a lunch on Tuesday 16th July, I was shown to a lovely table overlooking the harbour outside.  A server came and took a drinks order, however after 30 minutes my drink did not arrive. I didn't wait to hear the excuses, I would have ordered lunch, but if a drink is unreliable, why would I stay to find out? It's not as thought it was busy, if anything the staff outnumbered the people in the bar area.

Unfortunately this put a dampener on my experience here.

The only other thing is be prepared to pay a rate of £100 per night for a deposit for incidentals, even if you've been a frequent guest or prefer to pay as you go.  Don't expect the deposit back on check out, I was there Tuesday night, it's now Friday evening and I wonder how much they've made off my £300 before I eventually get it back. Holding deposits can be instantly returned, I don't really understand why this isn't done for guests.",3,2024,07,19
122,Hidden Gem in London,"I had an excellent time at the Chelsea Harbor Hotel and Spa. The service is impeccable. Our bed was made and bathroom cleaned multiple times a day. In particular, Fahad Yousef was very accommodating to us and helped us have a tremendous experience. The Chelsea Harbor Hotel felt like home away from home.",5,2024,07,19
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel Review,"A great improvement from 2 years previously. The new bedroom decor is fabulous and the general attention to detail has vastly improved.
Breakfast options should be reviewed - the variety of the buffet is underwhelming - the eggs, bacon, etc uninspiring. Would welcome more variety all round and better quality hot breakfast.",5,2024,07,19
122,Worst service in London,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is a fantastic place if you wish to be treated like your wishes are unimportant. 
They are very happy to grovel in front of white men in suits, but if that’s not you - you will be treated with contempt. My worst hotel experience in 30 years. Avoid at all costs.",1,2024,07,17
122,Great Suite!,Mohit was extremely friendly and hospitable.  I had a riverview suite and I enjoyed each night.  Everything was polished to a shine and the suite was the most luxorious I’ve experiencd.   The breakfast was amazing! Way more than I expected and worth every bit of the addon. If I could give 10 stars I would.  I will be back!,5,2024,07,17
122,Pure essence,"Very clean, nice staff , nice concierge system, both receptionist very helpful and kind, fahad and azhar, understanding people willing to help and always a smile on their face.

Truly amazing with a special mentioning for Atika Fahad and Khymee!!

Thank you very much for helping me out and making this a wonderful experience,5,2024,07,16
122,Great hotel.,Lovely hotel in a great location with excellent staff. Checked in by Mohit who was very helpful and made it a pleasure to visit. Highly recommend the VIP parking - makes life much easier. Rooms are very spacious and a great view over the harbour.,5,2024,07,15
122,Amazing. Comfortable. Friendliness.,Amazing stay affordable prices and Custermer service was great from Fahad and Azhar. The overall accommodation was perfect for a few night stay and would recommend this to anyone. The location is amazing right by the harbour and there is no noisy atmosphere.,5,2024,07,15
122,Amazing,My stay is Chelsea harbour is amazing. I really loved the way Smita in the front desk welcomed us . She is always smiling and treating us with utmost care . She is always ready help for any queries . This is my first visit to London and first time stay in Chelsea harbour . Smita has made our stay memorable and I will defenitely book this hotel for my future London visits . Highly recommend this hotel,5,2024,07,14
122,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Fantastic hotel. Great atmosphere and love the location. Room for improvement in house keeping, but not a big deal. We also met a lovely receptionist, Mohit! What a wonderful man. Was very helpful, great energy, and made us feel so welcome! 10/10 approved!",5,2024,07,13
122,Good hotel for stay with Family.,"It was a good experience right from the reception and checking in our bags early since we reached way before check in time where Luz welcomed and helped us. I would also specially mention Mohit on the reception who helped us with our checkins, got us a room upgrade with a balcony and also got our luggage to the room. He also got me a shaving kit sent to my room when requested.Overall the rooms were comfy and we got a suite with 2 beds ( king size and sofa bed) . The cleanliness was thorough.  Things that could have been better - one of the elevators didn’t work for our floor (4th floor) at all. The restaurant food wasn’t as per expectation but the service and attentiveness compensated for that. You have better options for food outside. Also imperial wharf overground station is 5 min walk for easy access to commute. Overall nice and relaxing stay.",5,2024,07,13

Thankyou team for making the stay so beautiful,5,2024,07,11
122,!!!! THE MOST INCREDIBLE EMPLOYEES!!!!,"**special recognition and thanks to:
FAHAD, SMITA, LUZ, ZAKIA and AZHER - THANK YOU SO much for all your fantastic support** ❤️

The Team who looked after me in my stay at the Hotel this week…. Were the MOST supportive, professional, incredibly friendly and went ABOVE AND BEYOND any other hotel team I’ve ever visited. 

The management of this hotel - have got this right. Their team provides an environment which hotels used to be like…. A place where you feel safe and looked after and cared about. Their manners and respect are second to none in my opinion.
Thank you all!

Regards

122,"Nice property, even better people.","Staff were all friendly and very helpful.  Room was spacious, clean and well appointed.  Good value for the money.  Comfortable bed and large bathroom with walk in shower and two sinks.  Would strongly recommend and I would stay here again when in London.",5,2024,07,08
122,Disappointing stay,"We have stayed many times at the Chelsea harbour since the days when it was the Conrad . Since then we have watched the standards slowly decline. There is no longer a doorman to help you park your car and only one person on reception . Our room was clean enough but with an unpleasant outlook over a dirty roof top and very close to an office block whose light shone through our window all night affording us little privacy. The location of the hotel necessitated a taxi into London to attend a show we had tickets for, they used to have a direct button to call a taxi but this was no longer in use and a staff member had to run down the road and flag one down which took over 20 minutes.  The main disappointment however was the breakfast, I detest having to make my own toast on a commercial machine by the time it reaches the table it was soggy like a bit of rubber . The food was not cooked to order and was lukewarm at best . Scrambled eggs looked like rubber and the sausage was cold.  The only thing that has not lessened is the cost and we would have done better at a premier inn",3,2024,07,08
122,Amazing service,"i’ve only been here for 2 days so far, and my stay has been incredible, i have had no issue whatsoever with the hotel at all, and the staff are amazing people. One of your employees, Mohit, is among the best I’ve talked with. He was incredibly helpful, easy to communicate with, and easy to get along with!",5,2024,07,06
122,A herd of snails trudging through peanut butter,"Great view of marina, comfortable clean rooms, good location …. However ….. should you need any assistance from any of the team, brace yourself for totally slow at best….non-busy times …  Drinks from the bar take 20 mins - order yourself , don’t expect proactive outreach …. Take your own suitcase to the room one of ours never arrived until the next day, and the other took over an hour and 3 phone calls. No hotel management in sight , lethargic staff.  An easy fix but our stay with friends was frustrating at best and would not recommend this hotel given the price and there are better in the location with staff who are super helpful.",2,2024,07,05
122,Not for families,"We booked the room through hotels.com as we got a good deal and NHS benefits plus instalment pay. We checked in late and was informed the room was upgraded and the bed was made for our family of four. We had our dinner in the restaurant and came back to the room hoping to have a good rest. We had gone sightseeing the whole day. This is when we realised the sofa cum bed was not made for the kids. We contacted the receptionist and she was unaware and mentioned that the housekeeping staff had left. They had not made our bed nor had they left any pillow , quilt or sheet for us to do it too.Finally around 10:30-11 , a front desk staff member helped us out by coming to make the bed.  This was when we realised that the bed was very wobbly and no adult could sleep on it. Thankfully my children are petite, they managed to sleep although they were in a sinking state in the morning. I decided to make an enquiry with the hotel and give them a chance to provide me with a valid explanation. The first one was to offer me 20% discount for a future stay . When I said that would never happen and I needed an explanation, they shifted the blame on the poorly staffed front desk for not making the bed properly. If not for the front desk staff, were they expecting us to sleep on the cold floor? I would never recommend this hotel to any families as they have total disregard for your plight. A good night’s sleep was all that we wanted after a full day of sightseeing. I do think that’s the least any hotel can offer. Please not Premier Inn has better beds for you",1,2024,07,03
122,My new favourite London hotel! Highly recommend.,"Just excellent! My partner and I had a brilliant stay here this past weekend and couldn’t have been more pleased with the service we received throughout. 
I booked the Romantic Package as part of our visit and they decorated the room beautifully, with a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and chocolate strawberries on the side.
The room was cleaned immaculately upon our arrival, check-in and check- out was a smooth and easy process and the breakfast buffet each morning was perfect for what we needed. Many thanks to the receptionists also, for allowing us to store our bags before checking in and after checking out; it was much appreciated and allowed us to enjoy our time around London even more.
The staff were extremely friendly - the environment is luxurious and professional yet each staff member we had dealings with were incredibly kind and helpful. They have achieved the perfect balance of quality and relaxation here.
It is in a perfect, picturesque location situated right on the harbour with stunning views. I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking to stay in the area, or even if you are needing to go elsewhere in London - it is well worth the short travel!
We will definitely be returning here and I would like to thank the team for the relaxing and comfortable weekend they ensured we had.",5,2024,07,02
122,"not great, don’t recommend for families!",When we reserved the room online we had not been informed of the pool rule where 1:2 as in one adult per 2 children. the desk lady was rude and refused service. Breakfast was worse when the manager made a scene because HE forgot to give us the check EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A 300£ Deposit with the hotel for breakfast and other fees! Ridiculous!!!!!,2,2024,07,01
122,Spacious rooms with great views,"Fantastic view over the marina, where you can also see the Thames glinting in the background. We had a spacious suite with separate bedroom, sitting room and balcony. Shame it was not warm enough to sit outside, otherwise we would have done!
The beds were so comfortable, and the bedding and pillows lovely and soft. 

The staff were all very polite and helpful. My thanks in particular to the lovely Smita in  Reception, who went beyond the call of duty to help find a card we had left behind in the bar the night before.  Then she helped us find an Uber taxi who had got lost near the station, and guided us to him. Thank you Smita!",5,2024,07,01
122,Nice place,"Nice place

122,London Chelsea Harbor hotel,Excellent stay! Mohit at the front desk was super helpful our whole stay! Would recommend the hotel as a nice clean place with a spacious room. We got a king suite with a rollaway bed and the whole family was comfortable. Very central location too!,5,2024,06,29
122,Best customer service in London,"The customer service is top notch, Luz especially was very helpful, she gave me a complimentary drink while I was being checked in and even helped me print some documents free of charge. The hotel staff was always ready to help, it was a nice experience.",5,2024,06,28
122,Honeymoon at Chelsea Harbour,"For the first few nights of our honeymoon, Chelsea Harbour was amazing! The customer service was top-notch, with very attentive and wonderful staff. Luz at the front desk was a gem and made our stay extra special. Also the food is extra yummy! An amazing experience!",5,2024,06,27
122,The most lovely experience I have ever had in Chelsea harbour hotel for my 5 days stay,"Mohit staff is the nicest person ever as we met him at the last day of our stay and he recommended some really nice idea for our last hours not only him but the receptionist Rana was very welcoming and had a very professional and friendly chat with her about our staying 
Overal I loved the environment and the people here I would defo try it again !",5,2024,06,26
122,The most wonderful place I’ve ever stayed.,"Mohit was extremely helpful for us, incredibly accommodating and guided us through the entire process. Enrica was our waitress and she made sure we felt very taken care of, keeping our drinks topped up and our food arriving swiftly. I would definitely love to visit again, perhaps not on work next time.",5,2024,06,26
122,Truly memorable stay with the most magnificent views and excellent service,As a big tennis fan (Wimbledon) I have stayed  at this hotel for a number of years back when it was under the Conrad Group. Our stay was extremely memorable ; we stayed for one night before my daughter departed back to America . Our stay was made all the more special by Fahad who upgraded our room to a Penthouse Suite. The room and views from there  were amazing; if only we didn’t have to leave so early for the airport. When I was younger the likes of John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova and many tennis players  would be staying in the Penthouse whilst Wimbledon was on and  I would always wonder what it would be like; now I have been so lucky to experience this and I am very grateful to Fahad. Fahad made my daughters last night in the UK very special indeed. The staff in breakfast this morning were also very attentive and extremely friendly. Thank you so much; extremely grateful. Hope I am lucky to get some Wimbledon tickets next year so I can stay here again as in recent years never seem to get any luck in the public ballot .,5,2024,06,26
122,Shambles,"Booked a suite. 

Arrived at 19:45, couldn’t check in until 20:45 in the evening. Was told to wait in bar as rooms were ready. I would’ve been there all night if I hadn’t kept chasing. No-one was going to come and find us to let us know. No explanations as to why?",1,2024,06,25
122,Terrible bar service,"During our visit, we faced several issues:
1. The cocktail my mum initially ordered was unavailable. She then ordered another one, which also couldn't be made due to missing ingredients. She eventually settled for the same cocktail my mother-in-law ordered, but it arrived without alcohol and seemed hastily made.
2. When the rest of the drinks finally arrived after a long wait, the bartender accidentally spilled my Coke on me, soaking my cardigan, bag, and phone. The bartender was very apologetic and assured us that our drinks would be complimentary.
3. After cleaning up, we went to settle the bill, only to find that only one drink had been removed, and it wasn’t the one that was spilled. We tried to explain that we were told all drinks would be free due to the spill, but the bartender (not the one who served us) was unresponsive to our concerns.

Additionally, we were charged a service fee despite the subpar service we received and had to pay for the full drinks after being told the drinks will be complimentary. 

After reaching out to the hotel bar, they were unable to refund us for the drinks that were meant to complimentary. Terrible service!",1,2024,06,25
122,Fantastic hotel,"Everything was fantastic especially Mohit, whose attention to guests was excellent. Moreover the facilities were incredible and the room is so comfortable, spacious and well equiped with everything that might be needed. Thank you for making our experience better!",5,2024,06,25
122,Hygiene and safety,"We checked in and were met with a smell of BO and curry in our room. Then my young son cut himself on a bit of metal hanging out the sofa. Breakfast was a joke and overrun. This was our 11th stay, no compensation or branch to make it right was offered",1,2024,06,25
122,Will definitely be back,"The service was amazing and the staff are so nice. Rana, Azher and Smita were really helpful during check-in and during the stay. They made our stay so much more meaningful. 

The room is beautiful and has an amazing view. Definitely will recommend and will be back.",5,2024,06,23
122,Great Stay!,"Great stay .
 Great staff. 
Mohit was wonderful. 
Best reakfast was lovely. Our room had great views of the harbour. Bed was comfortable- great pillows and duvet .         

On leaving the staff could not have been more helpful putting bags into the car etc",5,2024,06,22
122,Very pleasant stay!,Amazing stay! Would highly recommend - very friendly staff! Great dinner and breakfast varieties - room was amazing with a view. Pool and massage therapies were awesome. Would recommend going for head massage. Very grateful to reception staff for being so accommodating.,5,2024,06,22
122,Excellent hotel near the Thames,Staff were friendly and the room was clean. The spa was very nice with a big pool. Smita on reception was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable with big fluffy pillows. The Anchor restaurant had a jazz singer on Friday night who was great to hear. Thank you,5,2024,06,22
122,Great stay at Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Great stay at Chelsea Harbour hotel. Effortless checkin at front desk with professional staff who were able to accommodate our extra requirements despite being almost sold out. 
Spacious all suite hotel with lovely views of the harbour.  
Have stayed before at Chelsea Harbour and would stay again.",5,2024,06,22
122,Avoid this place like the plague.,"Avoid this place like the plague.

We booked a room for a day, intending to use the pool and spa and generally have a relaxing change of scene. On arrival we were told that our room wasn't ready, even though we arrived later than the advertised check-in time. The reception was chaotic. They eventually realized that there was a different room reserved for us. We finally got room keys 35 minutes after first approaching the front desk. We went to the room to find that neither key card worked. We returned to the front desk and got replacement cards. These didn't work either. A member of hotel staff accompanied us back to the room, but he couldn't make the lift work. He jabbed at the button for our floor repeatedly. I suggested we take the stairs. We exited the lift and the member of staff took us back of house to the service lift. When we got to our room, he battled with the door lock for several minutes trying to get it to open. Eventually it did. He was dismissive of my concern that the lock appeared to be unreliable. But at least we were in our room at last. At this point noisy construction work started in the lift shaft right opposite the room, including hammer drilling into concrete. So much for a relaxing day away from home. We left the hotel without even putting our our bags down. These people don't deserve to be in business.",1,2024,06,21
122,Perfect hotel - located in London but without the hussle and bussle,"From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the warm welcome and the attentive service provided by Mohamed and his team. His commitment to ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay was evident in every aspect of our visit. The accommodations were impeccable, and the facilities were outstanding, contributing to a very memorable stay.
We deeply appreciate the extra efforts he made to make our stay special. His personal touch and attention to detail did not go unnoticed and made a significant difference in our overall experience.
Also special thanks to Sritna Joy - she is an asset to the hotel - working on Front desk she went above and beyond and deserves a five star rating 
Once again, thank you for your outstanding hospitality. We look forward to returning and will certainly recommend your hotel to our friends and family.",5,2024,06,20
122,Standards have dropped…,"Stayed here on several occasions, but this may be the last.

They say first impressions are the most important. Somebody tell the reception staff that.

We are an elderly couple and struggled with our luggage. Not an offer of help although there were 3 staff gathered around the side of the office and one trainee on reception. No smiles, no friendly conversation. All a very matter of fact.

Not a 5 star hotel I am sorry. 4 at the very best.

No mini bar, no turndown service. Side plates as saucers!

Suite 319 needs carpet cleaned.

Reached out to Mohit the guest relations manager, but very flaky with his responses.

Breakfast okay, but more staff required. Finished our breakfast before we got our coffee!

Does not cost anything to be friendly and the occasional SMILE",3,2024,06,17
122,5 stars overall - read why.,"Communication from the start was 5* 
Smita, she was amazing, friendly, kind, very warm welcoming, she was there for check in/out and accommodating from the start. 
Bedroom... well best night sleep I've ever had! So so so comfortable.. I didn't want to leave.
Pillows heavenly.
Didn't book breakfast so not sure what that was like. 
Spa was GORGEOUS!, so many lounge beds and the pool was beautiful.

I would rate 12/10 if I could.. I will be back at some point for another lovely stay. 

Thank you Chelsea Harbour and Spa hotel.",5,2024,06,16
122,Stuck in the 80’s,"Unfortunately this was not the five star experience I was hoping for. After staying at the hotel many years previous with fond memories I return to find a relic frozen in time. 

Our rooms were very very dated and worn, although the size was nice the flow, decor, and furniture was not at all at the expected standard. The in room tv offering, air con quality and power outlet placement was not ideal. Because of the decor dust, dirt and grim was lazily hidden/not addressed. 

The spa facilities were disappointing and less relaxing, more local gym quality. Accessibility was not ideal for my elderly mother. Treatment rooms were on the second floor with no lift and access to the pool was also up a flight of stairs so getting refreshments or using the restroom was cumbersome. 

I did have amazing treatments but the treatment rooms were not sound proof and my much needed rest was disturbed by chatter in the next room. I could hear every word clearly. 

I had asked for a menu to be emailed to me prior to checking in as it was not on the website, this never happened. I didn’t want to risk disappointment so we decided to eat out. We did however attend the bar and was invaded by an over zealous member of staff who went from welcoming to annoying and over stepping. It felt inappropriate and like a rep one would find in a summer resort doing the hard sale and using slick tactics to get reviews and/or spend more money. Because of where we were we endured it but thankfully the next evening we were in the bar he saw us and ignored us but also proving the agenda of his ‘hospitality’ the previous evening was not authentic. I just wish my valuable time hadn’t been wasted and I should’ve told him to leave us alone. 

In general I had a sense that many of the staff had not been fully trained or was being trained in the etiquette one would expect from a 5 star experience. From the front desk addressing me incorrectly to housekeeping banging on our door at 8am on Saturday morning seeking to clean the room. 

Lastly I’d say the ambiance was totally missing, you’d think on a Friday and Saturday evening that there would be entertainment, live music, something to create a relaxing vibe in the bar area and restaurant. Each time we were there it felt more like a waiting room completely flat. So we had early nights on both evenings. 

Overall I hoped for much more and believed I paid for a better experience. I live in London anyway and just wanted a relaxing weekend but I believe I could have saved myself £1k+ and eaten out, booked treatments locally and go to the local recreation centre for a swim/sauna, and have the same if not better experience. 

I hope for improvement and modernisation as the location and views of the harbour are lovely for a London hotel.",2,2024,06,12
122,Poor afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea was a poor experience. We had to wait nearly an hour after our arrival before they served any food. When it arrived, it was surprisingly poor quality. The bread used for the sandwiches was not fresh, the presentation was poor with a crust clearly visible indicating little care in prep and the fillings were so poor I would rather have gone to Tesco. The cakes looked fancy but had little substance. The selection of teas available was embarrassingly short. A glass of champagne was given in mitigation of such poor quality which was appreciated but avoid at all cost!",2,2024,06,12
122,Girls Trip,"Wonderful environment, friendly management and staff team. The suites were amazing, beautifully decorated to a very high standard, Comfortable rooms and is really 5 star services through and through. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner and loved all the meals",5,2024,06,11

Love this place and will always come back",5,2024,06,11
122,Absolutely wonderful,An absolute lovely hotel to stay in for a short one night trip to London. Very welcoming and helpful staff. Rooms were excellent and clean very comfortable. I only wish we could stay for longer! Easy access to London by any transport. Enjoyed a peek in Chelsea harbour too. We will be back.,5,2024,06,11
122,Robbed of our deposit,"Paid £200 deposit, the day we was leaving they tried to tell us we spent £55 at the hotel which did not happen, spent 40mins looking this over, told us they will sort it and email us and then processed to charge us the £55 after we left. With no email sent! Poor service!",1,2024,06,09
122,Excellent service,"My husband and I booked the hotel for our wedding anniversary and to spend holidays in London and I must say it was the best experience, excellent service and outstanding hotel facilities.From the reservations team, the reception, and all members of the hotel staff we came across were extremely nice and professional in their work. Amazing breakfast and view, hotel rooms are exceptionally clean and it is really value for money. We were so happy that we extended our stay in the hotel. We will definitely recommend it to others.",5,2024,06,09
122,Spa treatment break,"Comfy and clean stay. Assessable facilities available to use. The spa treatments were incredible, very relaxing and professional. 

Two things to improve: update the room decor and I didn't like that the pool was very deep and didn't have a shallow end. Clear signs need to be displayed around the pool area.",4,2024,06,09

122,"Dirty, not as described and appalling customer service!","Horrendous, avoid at all costs! I stayed here with my mum and sister for my mum's big birthday. I was most disappointed and disgusted with a number of issues which we encountered  during our stay. I raised these with the front of house on the day of arrival, and on check out, however I have received no feedback. I have listed the issues below which were way below the 5 star standard advertised.

On arrival I was asked what I had booked, despite giving booking confirmation.

There was no bed or bedding for the third person, and when I raised this, I was told house keeping were finished for the night.

When we eventually received the fold down bed, it was dumped in the middle of the floor.

I asked for my call to reception to be returned with solution, the call was not returned after being told I should have known when I checked in that the bed was not a sofa bed.

There were dirty toe nails on the carpet.

The wi-fi would not connect to my phone.

There was a hair in the bath and it was dirty.

The carpet was stained and not hoovered.

The furniture was thick with dust.

There was not enough toilet paper.

There was no soap or shower gel.

The couch was stained.

The furniture was worn and scratched.

The door between the connecting rooms was damaged.

There were only robes and towels for 2 people, despite having booked and paid for a suite for 3 people.

I am disgusted that this is advertised this as a 5 star hotel and they do not specify that balconies face the train station.

I was offered 20% compensation after much difficulty trying to contact them, with calls and emails being ignored. When I accepted this they refused to honour the compensation.",1,2024,06,02
122,Excellent Service,"We had a lovely 9night stay at the Chelsea Harbour hotel. It was clean and the rooms were well sized, walking distance from KIngs Road. The phenomenal service from staff was the highlight of our trip. Thank you Smitha, Rana, Monit, Tomas and Zakia for your thoughtful service",5,2024,06,01
122,Superb Value,"The newly refurbished rooms are great value. They have incredible views down the Thames and of the London skyline. The suites are all extremely comfortable.

122,Very helpful staffs and luxurious services,"A very friendly manager Mahit and he is extremely helpful to us. We were staying there for one night and the facilities there were amazing. The bedroom and the view is very good, although the hotel is a bit archaic but the services we got and the neat environment was a bonus.",4,2024,05,30
122,Great hotel,"Really nice hotel. Inside is very nice, smells very good, has apples and water, and is very organized. Mohit made our experience even better and made us feel cared for. Definitely recommend. Imperial station is right there so you can transit everywhere.",5,2024,05,30
122,A group booking for a Business trip,"The hotel accommodated 21 of us as we held a full day business meeting. the event was organised with ease through their events team and a massive shout out must go Betty and Rushina who were super helpful and willing to work with the budget we had. The facilities for the meeting were brilliant, we were given the Drakes room which is more akin to a ball room and it was kitted out with everything we needed with large projector and screen which was perfect for those remote employees dialing in. Coffee and pastries were provided and a full buffet kept everyone full at lunch. 
The guests rooms in the hotel are unusually large for London with separate living room and a very large comfy bed in the bedroom. Being in Chelsea and 30 mins from central London on the tube (district line) is certainly worth it considering the sheer size difference of the rooms. 
A special mention must go to Claude, Akira (both front desk)  and Carolina in the restaurant who looked after everyone very well. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure.",4,2024,05,30
122,"Pleasant, but disappointing","We really enjoyed our stay at the Chelsea Harbour however were extremely disappointed by the service in the restaurant which was shocking. Having sat down and waiting 20 minutes we had ask at the bar for a menu. Our order was taken, and our starters arrived after about 30 minutes despite neither requiring any cooking. Having then waited for our mains for a further 60 minutes we sought out some to ask where they were coming. No explanation was provided as to where they were, and no apology was given. A further 10 minutes later our original server walked passed seemingly noticing we had no good and said our food would be out in 5 minutes. It was not. Again we were given no proper explanation or apology. We were then approached again and given how late the hour was we advised we no longer wished to have our mains as it was too late to eat. One of our party has diabetes which was impacted by this. Fortunately they had brought their own snacks with them! We were then presented with our bill. Again no meaningful apology or or any explanation was given. We advised that we were totally unhappy with the service and no form of compensation was offered. We also noted the table behind us experienced a serious delay in their drinks order, they in fact were met with by the manger, offered an apology and given a complementary bottle of wine!
We enjoyed the spa although found the pool quite deep. We were surprised one end wasn't more shallow or accessible. 
It was such a shame to experience so poor service, probably the worst I have ever had, the rest of our stay was lovely, especially the breakfast. This really overshadowed the whole trip and I wouldn't recommend the hotel",3,2024,05,28
122,Birthday celebration,"Had an amazing stay. Food was amazing and rooms were lovely. Amazing customer service, especially Smita. 
Really enjoyed the view of the harbour the housekeeping was great………………………….will surely come back super soon………………………………..    ……..",5,2024,05,28
122,Mixed Bag,"It’s fair to start with the positives. The location and views are great, the rooms were fantastic, and the food in the restaurant was really nice. The music provided by the singer and guitarist was high quality and enjoyable.

However, we felt that the service we received from a 5 star hotel was really disappointing. Check in time was from 3pm, and we had advised that we expected to arrive at 5pm. Unfortunately upon arriving at 5:40 we were advised that the room wasn’t ready and were given a drinks voucher for the bar. We only had to wait 10 minutes and were then given our room key. We were booked in for the jazz night at 7pm so had wanted to check in, to shower and change before the evening entertainment.

At check in no mention was made about the restaurant, what or where breakfast could be found, or details of the spa, pool and gymnasium.

Upon arriving at the restaurant we were given a full a la carte menu to chose from, but the booking had been made with a Red Letter Days gift code (a gift for my 40th birthday), and we had to check whether this was the correct menu, as our booking had stated a three course set menu. Having settled at our table our drinks order was taken, but it took far too long to arrive. 

I had contacted the hotel in advance to advise of special dietary requirements, but the waitress looked terrified when I explained them. Our starter and mains orders were taken and we were promised that the waitress would return to confirm my food choices were suitable, and would confirm what dessert options were suitable. Sadly the waitress didn’t return, and after waiting over 45 minutes without any food, we chased another member of staff to see where our food was.

After eating our starters and desserts the waitress returned stating there were no dairy free dessert options. I enquired whether there was a dairy free dessert on the a la carte menu, or whether the kitchen could provide an alternative for me. We were told this was not possible and I was offered a free drink instead.

At the end of the meal the waitress brought our bill and took payment, apologising that the service had been poor that evening.

Before returning to our room we visited reception to ask how to access the pool the next morning. When asking whether we could use the pool we were told ‘that should be ok’, which wasn’t particularly convincing.

Whilst the hotel has a lot of good quality features, the poor service received both at check in and in the restaurant detracted from what could and should have been a high quality 40th birthday weekend.",3,2024,05,27
122,Amazing experience!,"Everything was clean, and the bed was very comfortable! I had a spa treatment done and the service was fabulous.  The food was amazing and even better the portion was big! I wasn't able to finish it off due to having small appetite, however, it was the most I ate.The staff was amazing especially Mohit, he was very kind and bubbly.  Thank you, I hope to come again!",5,2024,05,27
122,Five-star experience in Chelsea,"We took advantage of the 3 for 2 nights offer and were impressed with the kindness and professional attitude of the staff. Smita and Zakia at Reception and Concierge Claude were exceptionally friendly and helpful and Carolina and Agostino in the restaurant made us feel very welcome. Our suite was spacious and had a balcony overlooking the Chelsea Marina. The large bed was super comfy, with nice and soft pillows. There were two toilets (one with bidet), and the bathroom with two wash basins, a shower AND a bath was luxurious. Included in the room price was access to the swimming pool, steam room and sauna, which was great. Unfortunately, the men's steam room wasn't working properly, so my husband had to add cold water to the steam outlet to make it produce steam. Breakfast was delicious, both the English and the continental version were well-presented. The hotel is ideally located to take a stroll down King's Road towards Sloane Square and to visit the famous 606 Jazz Club in Lots Road. All in all we had a great stay in this wonderful hotel!",5,2024,05,27
122,Mozhgan,"Lovely time, definitely recommend to everyone who wants to have lovely time in Chelsea. Warm welcome from reception. Tidy and beautiful room. Definitely I come back again to Chelsea Harbour hotel and spa.
Design in hotel and room were so beautiful",5,2024,05,26
122,Getting married in Chelsea,"When we arrived at Chelsea Harbour hotel, we were greeted by lovely staff, we stayed in a suite which was a beautiful  room with an amazing view of the harbour. 

Mojito was so helpful and made sure that our stay was just perfect. After arriving back from a long walk up to the kings road our room had been decorated with romantic petals and towels placed as swans  a lovely gesture and surprise from the staff.",5,2024,05,25
122,Perfect night at the GALA and followed by a great stay over night,"We attended the British Iranian Dental GALA
Had an amazing experience with the staff of the hotel and the general manager and MARCO and CHRIS.
Our room was lovely with a good view and also clean and break fast was amazing .
Will be coming back soon.
Didn’t have time to use the pool but will do next time . My friend loved  the pool",5,2024,05,25
122,Fantastic service,"I recently attended British Dental Association gala on 11 th of may 2024
The service/ food/ management of the night was exceptional 
The room was very spacious and bed very comfortable 
I had a memorable night and will highly recommend this hotel",5,2024,05,24
122,Iranian Dental Gala night and over night stay.,"We attended a dental gala function on 11th May and we stayed the night. Everything was totally amazing.  Food was so well cooked and prepared. Chef deserves the biggest compliment.  we were served with respect and dignity. 
The management team were very efficient. Our room was overlooking the Marina. The best view in town. Thank you so much for looking after us so nicely. We will definitely will come to any function or even holiday to stay with you.",5,2024,05,24
122,Awesome Experience,Everything was great. Rohit was amazing just like the rest of the staff at the hotel. Clean and very kid friendly atmosphere. Great scene and view of the river. We will definitely come back here again. Thank you for the memories and great hospitality.,5,2024,05,24
122,JAY,"The service in the morning was absolutely amazing with the restaurant not being open a being an early riser, the staff members exspecially a gentleman called Jey made me coffee and made me feel welcome. The rooms are extremely spacious and luxurious with a view of the marina very relaxing.",5,2024,05,24
122,Home away from home,"It might well have become my new ""London home"" any time I am back in town. I just had a great stay, from start to end. They allowed me to check in a bit earlier and check out a bit later than the official times. That is a great plus that most hotels should copy. Spacious room with everything you need. On the negative side, the area is not specially active. Not a big choice of bars, restaurants, shops, etc nearby. You have to rely on the Overground train (5 mins walk) which, incidentally, did not work 3 out of the 4 times I tried to use it. Thank you for making me feel really at home.",5,2024,05,23
122,Our favorite London Hotel,"This is our go to hotel in London. We do a London trip every two years, and have been to Chelsea harbor at least five times. Never disappointed.  The staff is so friendly.   Smita, Zakia, and Rana made us feel so welcome - so friendly so helpful.  The rooms are wonderful with a separate sitting room.   If you are a swimmer, the lap pool is such a plus.  You can work out in the spa or swim and then be ready for a day in London.",5,2024,05,21
122,Decent stay if you are in the Chelsea area,"As a seasoned traveller who reviews spa hotels for fun I can agree that this hotel falls into the higher esteemed venues in the Chelsea area. 

Negatives 
- Its rated 5 stars but I can't see why or who made it five...For £237 a night I was not wowed at all
- Not much choice to choose from in the Chelsea area so I did expect a more modern room; rooms could do with a refurb or at least upgrade to the wooden furnitures
- £85 to pay for Parking for the day at this hotel is totally extortionate. Even though I am rich that does not mean spend recklessly on parking... my accountant would not be happy !

Positives 
- The staff were exceptional, could not fault the training of the staff is on point. Super kind and attentive - possibly the best asset to the hotel overall experience. I particularly want to shout out Zakia who had a very kind and gentle spirit and made my checkout process super smooth. Bless you.
- The restaurant and communal areas are designed beautifully good space to sit and mingle also connected to the harbour which is lovely if your into that
- The spa was a lovely touch to the hotel and you get free access to the spa/ gym as part of your room (of course treatments are extra)

Overall I would say it's a good stay especially if you're wanting something close to the Chelsea area. If you are like me and hung on the interior and aesthetic of a five star hotel you may want to rethink staying here and possibly consider an other surrounding boutique hotels in the area. I cannot negate how great the hotel it and the staff and would be classed as a decent 4/5 stars.",4,2024,05,20
122,Dinner event and stay for group of 25.,"The booking was for a dining event and accommodation for 25 people. Rushena handled the enquiry really well. The feedback by the group was excellent. Food & service was excellent, hotel was fantastic. Lovely bedrooms and views.

122,Relaxed Stay,"It is a good hotel. Good hospitality by the staff. A special reference to Ms.Zakia and Mr.Mohit. Good location. Secluded from the rush of the city, whilst not being too far from the centre. They were commendable in their efforts to ensure our stay was relaxed and pleasant.",5,2024,05,14
122,Welcoming hotel,Very welcoming hotel near the river with great views overlooking the harbour. Friendly staff particularly Mohit who helped us check in. Out of the way from the busy streets so feels secluded even in central London. Nice big rooms as well for a good sleep.,5,2024,05,13
122,Nice marina,"The hotel located in a nice neighbourhood, few steps from Themes and right by a small nice marina. 
Our room did not have water view but we did many walks by the harbour.
Staff is great, we received extra kindness from Mohit and a young receptionist lady whose name I forgot, sorry.
Building was nice, elevators were fast, restaurant windows on the boats. Room big enough, bed comfortable.
Unfortunately nothing in the minibar and the soap bottles by the sink were empty but no other issues.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,05,13
122,Weekend get away,"Really nice hotel with a great view room marina view room. Staff was friendly especially Azher from the front desk. Was really helpful and gave us an early check in as we had missed our flight. He was very kind and helpful.

Beautiful hotel with excellent location and view.

122,Very great staff,"Very great hotel, nice staff, delicious food and lovely clean rooms. It is placed in the heart of Chelsea right next to the Harbour. I would strongly recommend this hotel",5,2024,05,05
122,An gorgeous oasis,"What an oasis in a busy, wonderful city.  I had stayed here for 2 nights this weekend.  Can't recommend highly enough.  London is wonderful and Chelsea Harbour Hotel is so accessible but you feel like you have escaped the hustle and bustle of the city and in a wee world of your own.
On arrival, reception staff were so welcoming.  As a solo traveller (I was in London to see my son) it is always a thought to check in on your own.  The folks on reception and the folks at the door make you feel like an old friend.  They are genuinely interested in your welfare.  Thank you.
My room was gorgeous.  Great view to the marina and Thames, very clean, spacious and well equipped.  I liked it so much.
My son joined me for breakfast the next morning.  It is made to order.  My hash browns were the best I have had and felt like a real treat.  One thing though, if you are in a rush, build in time for your breakfast to be made for you.  It's not a buffet for the hot food - which I really liked.
The area feels incredibly safe for a solo traveller and walking along the Thames, both day and night is stunning.
At check out, I so wish I could remember the name of the lovely girl who finalised my bill.  She was beyond cheery and kind, saying she hoped to see us back - we will be for sure.
Thank you Chelsea Harbour for a wonderful 3 days.",5,2024,05,05
122,lovely stay,"Brilliant stay. Very hospitable staff. We had a warm welcome from Mohit and felt very looked after. They even generously gave us a room upgrade on arrival to a balcony suite. Room was lovely and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable! Will definitely be staying again.",5,2024,05,04
122,Underwhelming and not relaxing,"I had an underwhelming experience at your spa on 24th April, which did not meet the expected levels of comfort and service. I bought a day pass aiming for a relaxing day using all your facilities, but instead, I encountered numerous interruptions. Crucial amenities such as the pool were closed until noon and the steam room was closed all day, significantly reducing the value of the morning portion of the pass.

The schedule was poorly managed, with treatments booked at 12 pm and 1:30 pm, creating long waits in between and a disjointed experience. Moreover, a swim lesson took over the pool right after it opened at 1 pm. The sauna was also out of order, as its door wouldn't stay shut.

Additional issues included out-of-service lockers and ongoing painting in the changing rooms, which should not happen during guest hours. There were also hygiene concerns with stained paper cups in the spa area. 

Accessing hotel services was a challenge; my guest and I were initially refused drinks, and we had to assert our status as paying guests, which was both embarrassing and unnecessary. This visit was far from the seamless and high-quality experience I anticipated.",1,2024,05,02
122,Amazing hotel,Really enjoyed my stay. The hotel staff are amazing. Rana at the front desk was really helpful and friendly. The view from the room is also really nice.,5,2024,05,01
122,Great Stay and Experience!,"We booked a spa day via DayUse which included a suite, access to the spa and pool and lunch included. From arrival, the staff were super friendly and attentive! I would highly recommend Chelsea Harbour hotel for a spa day or to stay.

The restaurant was fantastic too - food was absolutely delicious - again highly recommend!",5,2024,04,30
122,:),"It was an overall okay stay. We booked for 3 people and only got a room for 2 and were almost charged for an extra bed, although we had booked for 3. Other than that, it was good. The staff was perfectly friendly and informative though.",3,2024,04,29
122,Comfortable but dated,"Very comfortable and friendly staff. Huge rooms, slightly dated but of a very acceptable standard. Sadly didn’t have time to use the facilities.",5,2024,04,27
122,Excellent service,"The hotel service is excellent
Mr Azher was a super staff, he was very deligent and ready to solve any issue you have.
I have been using chelsea habour for over 6 years and I will recommend it to any one who like a lifestyle hotel.
Also the hotel is very neat.
We had a wedding at the hotel.",5,2024,04,23
122,Disappointing,"I stayed at the Chelsea Harbour hotel in April 24 and have to say that I was quite disappointed.

Upon checking in I had to pay a £100 deposit for the room, only two of a party of six rooms were required to do so. The reception had water leaking from the roof in to a bucket and once made it to my room I found that the room had not been cleaned from the previous occupants. The room had dirty plates, towels all over the floor and the bed duvet scrunched up on the floor.

I was swapped to another room quickly. I wasn’t too impressed with the second room but it was liveable.",2,2024,04,22
122,Excellent Hotel with friendly staff,"Excellent hotel with extremely friendly and accommodating staff, particularly Smita at reception who made us feel so welcome from the very start. Would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2024,04,21
122,cant decide...5*...in 1993 totes....now think 3.5% -,"so stayed here 2 times previous: which have been ""top notch"" - and we dont mind paying.... we love the spa and having a catch up with friends......but our 3rd experience...dreadful  checking with some one sneezing..(understanding high pollen count - awww bless...but the other person didnt take over, and left her - WTF....had a good smile) but slow checkin in 

not sure what has happened",3,2024,04,19
122,Not 5 star 3 at a push Ince you get past reception,"Booked a suite for my husbands birthday for the weekend. Wanted to have treatments in the spa and swim in the pool. The hotel looks lovely in reception but the room was very disappointing 3 star at the most. Tired old and worn out in so many areas. The pool wasold, the mirrors around it were dirty, showers and toilets were old and dirty. Tiles missing from around the edge of the pool. Felt like it definitely didn’t look like it did on line. Went to reception to move rooms but no rooms available and told that the hotel was going to be refurbished. Very disappointing .",2,2024,04,19
122,Careers in Africa,"Excellent service, staff and amenities. The staff were so friendly, attentive and accommodating of all our needs and requirements. 
The rooms were so spacious and inviting with amazing views. Our clients were also so happy with the attention to detail, quality of the rooms and the level of service.",5,2024,04,19
122,A fantastic birthday treat,"Stayed here as a birthday treat present from my girlfriend. Overall it was an excellent stay.

We were in a Chelsea suite with the harbour/river view which was a great room. The view overlooking the harbour, river and city was breathtaking, especially when we was on the 7th floor.

Room had everything you need, and the bed was amazing. My only critique would be the lack of toiletries available compared to other hotels of similar standards and the air con/heating was not working properly in the sitting room, but this didn't effect the stay at all. 

We mentioned at check-in that we was here for my birthday and they went out of their way and prepared the room with some birthday decorations and even provided a  birthday cake slice the house which was a lovely touch and was a great start to my birthday celebrations.

We was able to make use of the pool which was free of charge to guests and they provided pool towels as well.

Breakfast was your typical hotel buffet although I did think this was quite pricey at £22 per person. But it was good enough quality.

Having wanted to stay at this hotel for many years, and visiting many times for drinks and for food in the bar and restaurants, the hotel definitely exceeded all the expectations I had for. 

I would definitely recommend for anyone interested in a luxury hotel in London. Just be weary, the nearest tube station is around a 15 min walk away. But it's close to local buses and the Overground.

Will definitely stay again!",5,2024,04,18
122,“Top-Notch Reception Service!”,"“I recently stayed at this hotel and was thoroughly impressed by the outstanding service provided by the reception staff.

We will definitely be returning in the future and would highly recommend to anyone thinking of staying at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa.,5,2024,04,14
122,Visiting London with the family,"The hotel staff were very attentive, Mohit especially went out of his way to give high 5’s to the kids and ask about their day in London visiting the sights.

The room was great for a family as it had a separate adjacent room for the kids, with an interconnected hallway.

The room was very quiet from other guests, we didn’t hear any banging doors or people talking loudly in the hallway.

The hotel is located in a lovely area and a few minutes from the overground railway. One day we even did the Uber boat which again was a few minutes walk from the hotel and gave an opportunity to see London from the river.

The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool and we’d definitely stay again, it worked for us as a family.

122,Great atmosphere,"Great hospitality, reasonable prices and the superstar barrister REDDY made the best cappuccino 👌🏿
The food was great, the polenta was made to perfection. The view is to die for with beautiful modern deco and located in a very exclusive area. Will definitely go back.",5,2024,04,13
122,Pleasant and Brilliant location!,"I had made a booking for the 241 cocktails which was mentioned on the menu from 4 to 7pm and then for dinner from 7 to 10pm, however; when we arrived, we were told the 241 cocktail hour was no longer available as the menu had been changed a week ago.  I showed my email confirmation to staff member 'Reddy' and told him I had spoken to the manager at the time a couple of days prior, who confirmed the 241 cocktails; I then showed him the email  confirmation from the manager.  Reddy spoke to his manager and agreed they would honour 2 drinks each for the 241 cocktails deal.  We were pleased with this.

At 7pm, Reddy showed us to our table - he looked after us very well by giving us the table right by the Jazz group which were entertaining us for the evening.  Reddy also gave me a glass of champagne as it was my birthday 😊🥳.

The food was DELICIOUS!!  it was throughly enjoyed.

The Jazz group were brilliant!! They sang songs we requested and had us involved in their performance.  

We all had an excellent afternoon and evening!!  I have recommended The Chelsea Harbour Hotel to my friends and family and will most definitely be going back again..

Thank You to all the staff and performers!! You were ace!!

The staff are brilliant, absolutely brilliant, front of house and everyone in the bar and restaurant! The staff are second to none!

122,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel & SPA was a mixed experience,"Our recent stay at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel & SPA was a mixed experience, marked by exceptional amenities and service alongside some notable shortcomings. Let me start with the positives.

The hotel itself is a gem, exuding elegance and offering spacious, well-appointed rooms that are meticulously clean. Its prime location further adds to its appeal, providing convenient access to nearby attractions. Throughout our stay, I encountered a team of attentive and pleasant staff who were always ready to assist.

However, despite these highlights, there were a few notable issues that detracted from the overall experience. The primary concern was the lack of clarity and staff knowledge regarding the packages offered by the hotel. On two separate occasions, I found myself explaining our dinner package to different staff members, which was a bit frustrating. Additionally, upon checkout, I was surprised to find that the bill for food, which should have been included in the room rate according to our package, was presented as outstanding.

Furthermore, while the hotel boasts a five-star rating, there were instances where the service fell short of expectations. Specifically, during breakfast, I found the approach of staff members, particularly Caroline on Saturday and Ana Maria on Sunday, somewhat impersonal. Rather than a warm greeting, they simply asked for our room number, which felt impersonal in a luxury setting. In a five-star establishment, I would expect to be addressed by name, acknowledging the personal touch that defines high-end hospitality.

Another hiccup arose during our parallel spa treatment booking, where it seemed there was a miscommunication. The treatment lady was unaware that there were two of us scheduled for treatments, which necessitated a discussion with the manager to rectify the oversight. However, to their credit, the issue was resolved promptly within 10 minutes, and the spa treatment itself was a delightful experience.

In summary, while hotel offers many desirable features including a beautiful environment, comfortable rooms, and attentive staff, there are areas where improvements could be made to ensure a consistently exceptional guest experience. Clarity regarding packages, personalized service, and enhanced communication between staff members could elevate the hotel to truly standout status in the realm of luxury accommodations.

Thank you",3,2024,04,08
122,Afternoon tea,I had an afternoon tea with my friend and it was great experience and the staff was so kind and helpful and especially Aditya was so sharp kind and  supportive . I hope I’ll be back there with my family and also especially the view of Harbour was so beautiful .,5,2024,04,08
122,Amazing Experience!,"Our stay was perfect from start to finish. The staff were soo helpful and welcoming. We was greeted by the lovely and friendly Mohit. Thoroughly enjoyed our cocktail which funny enough was named after Mohit 😉.

Great views from our room, didn’t even feel like we were in London! 

Would definitely recommend and will be back to stay again.",5,2024,04,08
122,Great hotel but a few tweaks needed,"Hotel is in a great location on the water, great view if you book a waterside room. Has a balcony and the rooms are big! 
Room facilities very good- touches like a coffee machine, gowns and slippers and seperate living area was great! 
Staff are friendly! Really close to Chelsea! 
The reason I rated a 4 star and not a 5 star is because of a few tweaks. We phoned for room service on the all day dining menu at 10:35 only to find that it is not all day, there is no service between 10:30am and midday. Whilst if you look closely on the menu it does specify this, it shouldn’t title the menu with all day dining as this is misleading. We were just looking for bacon sandwiches and were told that no sandwiches could be made until midday. It isn’t food, it seems to be drinks as well, as only tea and coffee is available between 10:30 and 12.
I feel for the level of hotel, there could be more flexibility. The staff are lovely but it feels as though things are quite rigid.",4,2024,04,07
122,Clarify package deals on check in,"Check in and check out process was long and chaotic on the weekend we visited, with complaints from some guests. Rooms are spacious but slightly warn and general cleanliness was also below standard. Lovely treatments at the spa, although facilities limited by space available. Lack of clarity and transparency around inclusions and options for dining in our package booked via spa seekers. Lack of restaurant staff knowledge on evening and incorrectly charging on check out. Complaint was not adequately resolved. Not 5 star service or experience. Sadly, would not stay again or recommend to others.",2,2024,04,07
122,Treated like royalty,Management staff are top notch. The attention to the customers is superb. Mahit and Vindy made our stay A+++. The pool is relaxing and the showers in the spa are amazing. The rooms are spacious and very clean. I can’t wait to go back. I highly recommend.,5,2024,04,06

Although a little expensive, the breakfast was nice and is located in a wonderful Breakfast Room.
Great views over Chelsea Harbour and super friendly Staff.

122,Mohit! World class customer service,"Arrived at the Chelsea harbour hotel for one nights stay. Booking.com made an error with confirmation and took our children off the booking so when we got to the reception desk we were asked to pay extra £45 to add them on. We spent about 40mins sat trying to message and ring booking.com to try and resolve but were not having any look, after a 7hr drive up from Newcastle with 2 small children you can imagine how upsetting and stressful this was to be asked to pay extra for something you were told was included. Becoming more and more frustrated we were then approached in the lobby by MOHIT. Mohit noticed we were unsettled and came to the rescue l, he was amazing with our children offering free drinks, sweet and high fives. He listened to our problem and went away to speak to the desk for us, within 5mins he came back and explained he had resolved our problem with no extra fees. This is one amazing customer service experiences I will remember thanks to him!",5,2024,04,06
122,Excellent Stay. Beautiful place.,"The bed and pillows were amazing. The soap, lotions, shampoo and conditioner really worked well and it has been awhile since we felt this refreshing since our trip to London. Zakia was amazing and really greeted us with warmth and gentleness.",5,2024,04,05
122,Excellence is The Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa,"My husband & I (from the US)  visited London for The Fixx concert on our 32nd wedding anniversary.  I selected The Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa for our 5 night stay.  The location of the hotel is in more of a residential area at a harbor on the Thames.  The location is quiet, in a safe part of town,  and convenient to bus or train stops.  Our newly renovated suite was spectacular with a living room & balcony, large bedroom, and one large full bath and 1 large half bath.  We had a river view suite with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on.  We opted in for the hotel breakfast included everyday during our stay.  The food is very good and plentiful with many options and something for everyone.  The hot chocolate is fabulous!  We also visited the bar a couple of nights and the drinks are very good too.  Friday & Saturday nights there is live entertainment in the bar.  During our stay, a piano player, guitar player and gorgeous lady singing jazz tunes entertained the guests.  We had one small issue during our stay where the lock to our suite stopped working late at night.  The managment sent maintenance up right away and the problem was fixed within 15 or 20 minutes.  When staying at this hotel be prepared to walk alot or ride the train or bus.  The closest pub was about a 10 or 15 minute walk and the major tourist sites are quite a bit further but public transportation is very frequent and reliable.  We enjoyed being outside of the busy & noisy tourists areas.  I want to compliment the entire hotel staff on their friendliness, warmth, & professionalism.  Luz was working the reception desk of the hotel when we checked in from our long flight from Miami.  She gave us a wonderful suite with a beautiful view but also sent up a piece of delicious chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary.  We think that was very thoughtful & kind.  When we return to London we will definitely stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa again and have already recommended it to our friends.",5,2024,04,04
122,Customer service great,"Great service from Fahad and the staff, after a long flight. Really helpful and couldn’t have done more for us.

122,Nice stay,Very convenient and friendly and we are happy during the stay. The room is very big with a very nice view and the breakfast tastes very good. The water however is a bit different I don’t know whether it has been filtered but it is quite soft compared with London hard water. Mohit helped us check out he is very efficient.,5,2024,03,24
122,Great stay,"Our stay was great by all means, the staff were friendly and so helpful, I would like to thank the front desk specially Zakia for her amazing customer service, she was so kind and nice to us.

122,Lies or what?,"We booked a river view suite for 4 nights over 6 months in advance then told just under a week before our special occasion that the hotel was closed during our stay. We were offered a refund or same package in another of their hotels.
It turned out that they are not closed, the suite in other hotel isn’t a suite, 4* not 5*, no swimming pool and very very tired (Millenium Knightsbridge).
We feel we have been cheated as there has been extremely poor customer service and no offer of compensation for taking a much lesser package.
Beware of their reservations Manager not living up to promises!!
Have we been lied to, to suit their bookings??",1,2024,03,16
122,A comfortable stay with great view of the harbour.,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was a small walk from the 606 jazz club which made the evening so easy. 

The harbour room view was brilliant and was spacious, clean and so comfortable.

Two niggles were that there we needed to chase our coffee order up at breakfast - staff seemed to forget us. And we have asked the manager if they could soundproof the bedroom front doors - we could hear guests in the corridor - otherwise, the room was very quiet between rooms.",4,2024,03,14
122,Not as good as expected,"Room: we had inadvertently booked a twin so we asked reception if there was a possibility of having a double instead, which they could accommodate- thank you.
The first room we were allocated, although clean, smelt very musty.
The Anchor Bar: lovely service, however, it wasn’t good the hear one of the staff comment “F***ing Hell” whilst in conversation with another member of staff!
Breakfast: food was hot and good choice, however, all the plates are cold, and there was a complete lack of attention to detail. No teaspoons on cups, tables left full of dirty dishes, clients having to ask for items such as sausages and mushrooms when the serving dishes were empty instead of the staff noticing that food was running low. We were asked if we’d like tea or coffee, but it took so long that we asked again and ended up with 2 lots, it was only brought out on a full tray of beverages and not after asking us what we wanted. A lot of tables had cutlery missing and I had to ask for a knife.
Overall not a brilliant experience at breakfast.",3,2024,03,10
122,Conference stay,"I was lucky to be booked into the Chelsea harbour hotel on Friday night after a conference and was a very late check in but thanks to Bianca on front desk everything ran smoothly

122,Serious Health & Safety Issue.,"My First Room Had A Mouldy TV Cabinet & Stained Carpets, After Speaking To Reception We Was Moved To Another Room On A Floor Which Was “Recently Refurbished” In Which I Suffered A SERIOUS Health & Safety Injury (The Window Hitting Me On The Head Because It Wasn’t Secure Onto The Window Frame!) We Ended Up Leaving The Hotel At Around 1am In The Morning Due To Not Feeling Great Especially After The Incident So I Emailed The Same Day I LEFT The Hotel Due To Wanting To Complain & Have Heard Nothing! My Stay Was Over 2 Weeks Ago! I’m Disgusted I Haven’t Heard Anything From My Email; I Didn’t Want To Leave A Bad Review As I Was HOPING Someone Would Have The Decency To Email Back. 

The Service Was SHOCKING. The Duty Manager Who Helped When The Incident Happened Was Great But The Rest Of Chelsea Harbour Hotel Was Absolutely Appalling. 

Over £200 Wasted And No Email Back To Even Offer A Complaint Procedure!",1,2024,02,29

122,"I had an unpleasant encounter at Chelsea Harbour Hotel. The manager, Mohammed Ibrahim displayed rudeness!","Subject: Unpleasant Experience with Manager Mohammed Ibrahim

Yesterday, Manager Mohammed Ibrahim unexpectedly disturbed our sleep and insisted on moving us out of our room to accommodate other guests who had paid a higher rate. This was contrary to what his colleague had informed us the day before, assuring us that we could stay in our room until check-out. Additionally, Manager Ibrahim's behavior was quite alarming, as he was shouting from the morning and displayed a level of rudeness and disrespect that was highly unprofessional.

We understand that situations may arise where room changes are necessary, but the manner in which this was handled left us feeling frustrated and disappointed. We value our experience at millennium and have always enjoyed our stays in the past, which makes this incident even more disheartening.

We kindly request that you address this matter and ensure that such behavior is not repeated in the future. We believe in the exceptional service that Chelsea Harbour is known for and hope that this incident was an isolated occurrence.",1,2024,02,25

122,Bad behavior by the manager,"I had a terrible experience at chelsea harbour hotel. The manager, Mohammed Ibrahim, was very rude and unprofessional. He kicked us out of our room to welcome someone else, even though we had confirmed that we would stay in the same room after extending two more nights. He did not apologize or offer any compensation. He just told us to pack our bags and leave. This is unacceptable and disrespectful. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is a waste of money and time.",1,2024,02,24
122,Lovely retreat from the urban madness,"Stayed over on a business trip. Lovely quiet location. Great to be away from the hustle and bustle of Central London. 

Found the staff attentive and the suite size was impressive for London.

Would return again and would ask for a refurbished room as the hotel is going through a refurb project.",5,2024,02,23
122,Slowest service ever with disorganised staff!,"Came here to celebrate my husbands birthday.  The only good things were the room sizes, food and the spa treatments.

Sat in the bar for lunch but no one came to take our order.  Had to chase the staff down (only 2 working initially then a 3rd joined) .  Drinks took forever, and after going up to ask where they were,  only then did the one tell me that they didn't have the Gin I ordered.  Decided prosecco was an easier option but that too just as long.  After I went up to the bar again,  then only did she start pouring it. 

Food was the same, too ages!  We were asked if we wanted Mayo and said yes. Guess what!  It didn't turn up so we asked again and where our second drinks were only to be told this time the bar tap wasn't working.  I was just lost for words.  Had the same problem with the bill so in the end we had to go stand at the bar and demand to pay as we were in danger of being late for the spa booking.  We got an apology from one member saying they were short staffed.  So gave them the benefit of the doubt.  But it gets worse.  Got to check in at 5pm to be told our room wasn't ready (check in is 3pm!!).  Were given a free drink in the bar whilst we waited yet again!!!  Had to chase staff again and the manager then said he would sort it but still we were kept waiting.   We eventually got into our room at about 5.45.

On the spa, there's not enough seating in the pool area, the men's steam room wasn't working and one of the ladies loos had water seeping in from the shower cubicle next door.   
The jazz dinner has been moved into the bar area because of emergency painting.  Dread to think how it's going to go.

122,Don’t waste your money,"Awful stay, would not recommend. What was supposed to be a relaxing weekend was far from it. The spa/pool is tiny for the size of hotel, with only 8 sunbeds no chance of relaxing with the amount of guests staying at one time. Very dated needs revamping. Went for a treatment it was awful, there was no relaxing music on at all in the room just silence all I could hear was my therapist sniffing from a runny nose, when the treatment was finished I wasn’t offered water just to leave pretty much. 
The lamp in the bedroom was boiling hot resulting in me burning my thumb! 

Food at breakfast was cold. 

I wouldn’t be returning.",1,2024,02,21
122,"Do not stay here, expensive and miss leading","Expensive ‘suite’ with a balcony and harbour view is what we booked. The decor and furniture is from the 1990’s and not updated, 
The ‘balcony’ was a crap pair of chairs and table with a railing overlooking a 20-30ft paved roofed covered in moss, litter and cigarette butts, beyond this was the ‘harbour’ which you couldn’t really see.
The ‘spa’ consisted of changing rooms with the sauna and steam room individually inside the male and female changing blocks, the male steam room was out of order and the sauna looked a bit seedy. The ‘pool’ was ok but very dated. 
Room was comfy but outdated, for the price you would be better off elsewhere.
Such a shame",1,2024,02,16

They gave us top quality service and made the stay very welcoming and comfortable. I was sure to get their names, Jey and Azher, they truly were the best. 

We stayed in the marina suite the views are lovely at night, it has a balcony too, but too cold to use right now, haha. The shower was sensational and the toilet also has a bidet!!! Most hotels in the rest of Europe have bidets but UK hotels rarely ever have them. The room also has fast acting heating/ac

Everything was great about the stay honestly only thing that sucked about the stay was my sister forgetting a sentimental ring in the suite after check out, when we went back they said it wasn’t there unfortunately.",5,2024,01,27

122,Avoid spa,"So I booked a spa day at Chelsea harbour hotel which included a 50 min treatment and afternoon tea for 2 for me and my friend. I booked it as a birthday surprise.. so when we got there we were booked to have  our treatment first.. 

When we got to the treatment room we was in separate rooms we requested to be in the same room as it was a deal for two. But that's fine they couldn't offer that to us. 

However, when we had the treatment we both opted for the facial. Now anywhere you go when you do a facial you also get a head,neck and shoulder massage. I had this done . However my friend wasn't even offered it as the therapist assumed she may not want to pull her swim wear down also she never did the head massage that was included.. 

After treatment was done and we discussed the treatment we individually had. We went to ask the therapist how comes the neck and shoulders was not  massaged she just brushed it off and said oh I didn't think she would want to take her swimwear off.. 

When questioned about the head massage she claimed she did it which my friend clearly said she didn't . I would not recommend this place as it's overpriced for treatment that isn't filled.

When the reception/manager was made aware it was just brushed of with the therapist said it the head massage was done  which it wasn't.

Personally I would say save your money as some therapist don't do all that's is required..",2,2024,01,22
122,Excellent customer service - pre stay,"Though I have not yet attended the hotel I was compelled to write a review in respect of  Rana on reception 

I asked so many questions as I wanted to make sure everything was right for my mums upcoming birthday and nothing was too much trouble for Rana, not only did she answer my questions she went above and beyond to check the menus, give information as to what else was in the area and generally what could be done to make the day special for my mum

Looking forward to going

Thank you Rana, you are clearly an asset to the hotel",5,2024,01,17

As a spa should be run.  Spa was clean with a luxury feel.  Staff were experienced and professional.  I was late for my appointment and a member of staff came out to find me, then rescheduled my appointment so I received the full treatment - that goes above and beyond - so thank you.

HOTEL
Sadly this hotel does not meet the standards of what one would reasonable expect from a 5-star hotel.

GOOD POINTS
1.  Hotel public areas - spotless ( save for the notes below).
2.  Suite - housekeeping was exceptional, mattress and sofas excellent quality.
3.  Staff - attentive to customers.
4.  Dinner - tasty.
5.  Jazz Night - performers were talented.

BAD POINTS
SUITE:
1.  No USB ports in the suite - went down to reception to see if I could borrow a charger.  Instead directed to the local shop.  The appropriate response would have been to offer to charge the phone for the customer.

2.  I x sanitary bag provided - say no more.

3.  Bathroom and toilet - switches in the walls did not appear to connect to anything, or if they did, we did not know what they connected to.

4.  Shower unit - needs attention, area below the shower door requires repairs.

5.  Double sink units in the bathroom - no mechanism to release the plugs once the plugs were pushed into the sink, and yes we tried pushing the plugs in further.

6.  TV in the lounge repeatedly switched off after 5 minutes and/or the screen would go blank.

7.  Fridge very warm - Turn it off or keep it at a  reasonable temperature please.

THE ANCHOR BAR
8.  There were 3x customers in the bar when we arrived and 3x members of staff talking at the end of the bar.  Though the bar was quiet the tables had not been cleaned and we had to ask the staff to clean the table.  This was done with a dry cloth, no disinfectant used.

9.  A member of the bar staff was observed sneezing into his hands and made no attempt to clean his hands.

RESTAURANT
10.  Atmosphere - It could have been mistaken for a TGI Friday hen night.  There were 4 bookings while we were in restaurant.  One being a large party who were so loud that it was difficult to hear the entertainment.  The manager should have discretely intervened as there were plenty of staff around to witness the events,  This of course did not happen, instead he received complaints. 
I appreciate that the hotel would have made more money that night from the annoying group than the other parties, but ultimately you will lose more money as the other customers will not return or provide a positive review.

11.  The cheese and tomato salad starter arrived without the cheese...

12.  Breakfast - average.  Mushrooms stored in a dry pan under heat without liquid.  Note to the hotel chef - the mushrooms will burn without water.

SEATING IN RECEPTION AREA
13.  Crumbs on the table.

STAFF
14.  Hosts/Waiting Staff - inconsistent/incomplete training.  They were attentive but lack knowledge of basic hospitality do's and don'ts.  E.g. observe customers to see if they need assistance, do not keep approaching them, know what is available on the menu before you take an order, clean as you go etc.

15.  Reception - depending on who you spoke to, service was either indifferent or helpful.

To conclude:  From a staffing prospective it felt as though the staff have been working in the industry for a very short period of time. This is not an issue if proper supervision is in place, but this does not seem to be the case.
Other than housekeeping, the quality of service and attention to detail was not at a level expected for a 5-star hotel and as such I will not be staying at this hotel again.",3,2024,01,14
122,Superb birthday,"The staff were so lovely, Mohit was very friendly alongside the other staff too! They made my birthday very special and made sure to put balloons and a cake shaped towel on the bed for my arrival. Overall the bed was super comfortable and the facilities including the spa was very relaxing.",5,2024,01,14
122,Awful hotel - don't do it to yourself,"Do not go here, honestly I wouldn't give this hotel a 3 star. Appalling service, didnt do anything I asked for our anniversary. Completely ruined it. They didn't rectify after we made a complaint which made it even worse. Do not have breakfast here either",1,2024,01,13
122,"Spectacular massage and spa, a must to visit","My trip to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa was my first holiday in a while, so I took a long time to choose where I’d go. I’m glad I did — this was worth the wait. The deep tissue massage treatment is the best I’ve had in years, even though I get massage done weekly. It really is a very strong massage, which I find is very hard to get in London, especially outside specialised massage parlour. The lovely therapist, Paulina, was extremely skilled, checked in with me throughout to make sure the pressure was optimal and delivered a spectacular treatment all around, all of my knots were ironed out and I was left feeling truly rejuvenated and rested,
 
The spa is absolutely great, always spotless with excellent facilities: separate male and female saunas and steal rooms (which truly is spectacular, especially nowadays when so many facilities are mixed), well-maintained treadmills and rest areas. One can also walk out into the harbour and look at the boats right from the spa. It’s very nice that the rest area post-treatment is separate from the pool and the sauna as one can really sit in peace and quiet and enjoy the post-treatment time without noise or interference. Will definitely be back asap, outstanding experience all-around.",5,2024,01,11
122,Stay in Chelsea,"We were so happy with the room and the service. We got a lovely welcome from Rana on reception, who was fantastic with the children and couldn't have been more accommodating or helpful. In fact, all the staff were great.",5,2024,01,10

122,Rubbish,Shower flooded - we called reception and the shower full of hair. We can live with that BUT the duty manager at 17.30pm Friday 29th December was rude and arrogant and didn’t give a toss - he was a thoroughly nasty man. Also 2 people waiting for their room at 17.00 even though check in was 15.00 - they were told even though they booked in June there was no room for them - same manager told them to “sod off and take it up with booking.com” even the reception staff were shocked at the duty managers performance!,1,2023,12,30
122,Christmas break,"Arrived before Christmas and Stay for the Christmas day. Our suite had a beautiful view of the Marina and looking towards Battersea. We could have not asked for more. The hotel team on Christmas day did a great job, thank you in particular to Reddy",5,2023,12,30
122,Short stay,Stayed two days last week and loved the vibies of the place. Despite being surrounded by celebrieties (football players) I felt at home.

122,Excellent stay ,"Really good stay and the staff, Smita and Rana in particular, were really helpful. Would highly recommend! Some great facilities and a really good location, very central to restaurants. Great atmosphere at Christmas time ",5,2023,12,24
122,Made unpleasant by the staff and facilities ,Shocking customer service regarding recent stay. Shower was blocked with two single beds provided for me and my wife. When we asked for another room we were provided with no feedback and a shrug shoulders mentality. A refund was offered then retracted by the management after my wife made a review. Reception are rude and managerial team need training in people skills.,1,2023,12,23
122,Good experience,"Comfortable stay, spacious suite and hospitable staff! Extremely helpful & welcoming staff! We were assisted by Smita who kindly ensured we had a comfortable stay! I would definitely recommend and will be staying again! ",4,2023,12,21
122,Great experience ,"The stay was wonderful. The hotel staff is very nice, especially the receptionist Smita. The hotel location is very unique. The size of the rooms is amazing. The hotel is exceptionally quiet. The balcony’s view of the harbor is something indescribable. All this for an amazing price.",5,2023,12,21
122,Blocked shower - ‘we don’t offer any form of refund’,"We booked an overnight stay as we were attending a wedding in Chelsea. This was our first night away from our son. When we got to our room after the wedding we had been provided twin single beds, we hadn’t requested this, we also called the reception to move rooms and they never came back to us. 
The following morning we used the shower, where the base filled with water, clearly a problem with the drain that was blocked, see photo. 
We complained on checkout and were told they didn’t have a complaint from the previous guest, which seemed like they were pointing fingers at us. I was told they would investigate this and would come back to us, we had already pre paid the room on booking.com, so I would expect some form of compensation. 
I hadn’t heard back from the hotel so followed up with an email, eventually I received a response after they had made their ‘investigation’, to be told that we were not going to receive a refund as requested but we could come back and they would offer us a discount and upgrade and other amenities. So we had to spend money with them again in order to receive anything as a good will gesture.
I complained about this and was told it would have to go to senior management, yet to have a response, and I’ve now been told by another employee that they don’t do refunds, which I find very hard to believe and was never informed of when we mentioned this at checkout. 
Overall, disappointing and poor service, for what could have been a very easy fix when we checkout but instead they are now dragging their heels and it clearly isn’t a priority to make a customer happy again. 
",2,2023,12,14
122,5 star service and Hospitality,"Returned back with the family for Christmas shopping and what a great change since I last visited , they really working hard to bring the property to 5stars standard , from team lovely hospitality , food is delicious, spa is clean rooms are tidy staff always going the extra mile and made our stay special",5,2023,12,10
122,Disappointing,"We found the  person who SHOULD have greeted us when checking in lacked all customer focus - no greeting, no information or a word spoken other than crossing  where we needed to sign and telling us our room number and of course asking for payment. It was our wedding anniversary trip to London and this straight away left us disappointed by the attitude as we were excited to be staying here and would expect basic good manners and a friendly demeanour should be standard!!! Disappointed further by a very tired looking room - frayed and stained carpet - chipped fixtures and fittings and not as clean as we would have deemed standard - hand prints on windows - dirty floors in bathrooms, hair in wardrobes. The toiletries (refillable fixed to the wall/sink) had not been filled, leaving us with no showergel.  Only one regular teabag left in the room along with some herbal tea! We would not stay here again based on our experience and would not recommend to anyone we know….. 
",2,2023,12,10
122,Afternoon Tea & Spa,"Thanks a lot to Mohit at the reception for a warm welcome. Excellent afternoon tea at the hotel, good selection. 
Spa facilities are also recommended. 
We are already looking forward to the next visit to here. ",5,2023,12,09
122,Excellent Stay,"Stayed at the Chelsea harbour Hotel for a Xmas Ball in Battersea - excellent service, rooms extremely comfortable, with amazing pillows.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Reception is well manned, Mahito was very helpful.
I would recommend a stay.",5,2023,12,05
122,Great experience ,I stayed at the king suit for a night. The suit was very spacious and lovely. The staff also were very friendly and helpful. I also enjoyed the gym and the spa. Had an amazing stay! I really recommend this place to everyone. Thank you.,5,2023,12,03
122,Lovely staff,The receptionists Rana and Smita were wonderful and very friendly. The breakfast is simple and good. Therr are many options to chose from in the breskfast. The location is very relaxing and quiet which is exactly what I need. The view from the rooms are very nice. ,5,2023,11,29
122,Loved this gem of a hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa and will definitely stay there again should we visit London. Mohit welcomed us with open arms and did everything he could to accommodate us after a long night of travel (including early check in and rooms near each other). The rooms were quite large (all suites) and the hotel was surprisingly quiet (we couldn’t hear any outside noise at night at all). We had everything we needed (hair dryer, lotion, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner) plus a refrigerator and safe in the rooms (and TV’s, a Nespresso coffee maker (with pods) and tea kettle (with tea) and they brought us water each day). The hotel was located in a very safe area - walking distance to a cafe (with great pastries), a small Tesso grocery store and several restaurants (we had Lebanese food and brought back a pizza for later-both restaurants were great). We were also able to catch the overground train and busses located across the street with little to no wait. It was my birthday while visiting and the staff decorated our room with chocolates, rose petals, a “cake” made of towels and balloons plus gave me a box of chocolates. It was so thoughtful and kind! We didn’t have time to use the gym, pool or spa (the gym is for those 18 and up) but they seemed fine and a nice option. We didn’t have time to eat at the restaurant either but the breakfast looked good when I went in on our last day. The concierge was very helpful as well when we had problems booking a tour. I’ve stayed in many hotels in Europe and two in London and this hotel is a gem. It’s not super “posh” but it is really nice and clean and we were all very happy to stay there!",5,2023,11,24
122,Pricey hotel spoiled by no hot water in the shower,I stayed for work because I attending a conference here. It was pricey (£22 for an ordinary breakfast!) but there wasn't a more competitive option in the vicinity. The staff were friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed using the gym and my room was large with a separate sitting area. Sadly the water in the separate shower refused to get hot (the other taps in the bathroom got hot water quickly) so getting ready for work was an unpleasant experience. ,4,2023,11,22
122,A wonderful stay in a room with a view,"We had a lovely stay at the Harbour Chelsea Hotel. We were welcomed with open arms by Mohit, who gave us a marvelous suite with a breathtaking view on the Marina and the river. Mohit made sure we felt more than welcome. The breakfast was excellent.

We are grateful.",5,2023,11,22
122,"Pleasant stay, good location, great views. Not worth the money though.","Check in excellent, staff on front desk really helpful and friendly.

Good selection at breakfast.

Kept being told (not asked) every morning by breakfast reception that breakfast was not included when it was. Every time we said it was, they said they’d have to check with reception. Made us feel like we were blagging it. Maybe communication between breakfast staff and reception needs improving?.
Eggs cold and hard at breakfast, coffees not hot. Had to ask for coffee, not offered.

Room lovely (river view studio), although table on balcony was broken. Nothing in the fridge, so no mini bar. Coffee machine in room not working very well, only dispensed a small amount of water despite pressing for large cup.

Imperial wharf station a short walk away which made excursions easy.
Water taxi in to town fantastic, straight from the riverside by the hotel.

Spa closed at 8pm on weekends which meant we didn’t get to use the pool much.

Sounds a bit picky but it was a lot of money.",3,2023,11,20
122,Nice enough but needs refresh not 5 star,"A four star pretending to be a five star hotel.  The location is nice and well placed for London Olympia.  The rooms are very spacious, but the whole hotel needs a refresh the decor is very dated.  The restaurant served the most difficult to eat fish and chips I’ve ever had.  They were served in a frying basket on a wooden board to look more nouvelle cuisine, but just made eating it bloody difficult.  Nice place been neglected by the owners, not badly priced if you need to stay near Chelsea harbour but don’t expect 5 star",3,2023,11,19
122,Good but could be better,"Nice stay but wasn’t quite the 5 star experience I’d expect from this hotel. 

Room was lovely, nice and quiet, clean, comfy bed. 

Pool was nice but quite cold. Lots of empty cups and old towels lying about which I’d expect to be periodic cleaned up. 

Service at the bar was poor, one of us was ignored completely when taking our order and had to call the waitress back to order a drink. 
After the meal, we were completely ignored, no one collecting our plates or asking if we wanted another drink - despite 6 staff hanging around trying to look busy. 

Overall was ok but not amazing.",4,2023,11,19
122,I looked at all reviews and wish I listened. TERRIBLE. ,"DO NOT STAY HERE. We stayed here over our wedding weekend and unfortunately many friends and family did too. We stayed in a harbour view suite one night and the kings suite for one night. The phone didn’t work in either room so we couldn’t contact anywhere for room service. There were no drinks in the fridge or any water inside either room and we had to go to reception to ask and explain about the phones. No one came to fix it and water arrived 1 hour later. The bar was expensive without the service or standards of a 5 star hotel. In one of our guests rooms, there were fag buts left on the table which made the room feel incredibly dirty. The bell boys asked if parking was booked and took the receipt from guests but I’ve since found out all of these people were charged additionally for this on their room bill. They are going through a very difficult time to get a refund from the ‘financial controller’ Thomas Rajanayagam for this complete missold service. Another guest was charged for 8 breakfasts which automatically was taken from his card despite them being a couple of two. He hasn’t challenged this but will persue it from now.",1,2023,11,15
122,Fantastic venue for business meetings,"Fantastic service at the Chelsea Harbour, for an informal business meeting. Staff were pleasant and fantastic especially Enrica. The overall atmosphere was very relaxing. The efficiency was brilliant. Thanks once again",5,2023,11,10
122,Company Event 7-9 November 2023,"Just finishing a 3 day event at The Chelsea Harbour hotel, we return year after year due to the service we receive from Chris and his team.  

The meeting room space and catering are always of a high standard, nothing is too much trouble.  Complete on hand dedication to our event which speaks volumes.",5,2023,11,09
122,The comfort hotel in London ,"the best hotel in London, quiet and clean with a sublime view, very good staff catering, housekeeping and reservation especially SMITA very very helpful and smiling. the room is really spacious and very clean.
finally a big thank you to the most helpful and generous man at the hotel MR MOHAMED IBRAHIM",5,2023,11,08
122,Best hotel ,"I have stayed in this hotel and the hotel is good. The staff is very good. It’s just because the one who has been made my bed her name is Sarita. She is from housekeeping and one more colleague his name is Merhawi.
From the front office team, who are very much helpful. I do remember the name and I have just written it out in a paper so that I would have to give them this reference and this good feedback for them. Her name is beautiful girls Rana Smitha, Luz ,Ásia khymee Bianca.
Men is best oli,star & uddin temi,claud. Love is Mohit best.

Wonderful hotel stay.",5,2023,11,05
122,Ideal hotel for London mini break ,A lovely mini break to kick start Christmas shopping. The hotel is ideally located and a perfect base. Smita looked after us beautifully and always with a smile and thoughtfulness - thank you. We will be back! ,5,2023,11,05
122,Need to get customer focused,"I reviewed a stay in April so here goes with another.

I need to be in this area fairly regularly so tried again but it will be last time, suites are spacious but need some tlc now but the room rates are crazy, nigh on £200 a night & doesn’t even include breakfast.

Had reception problems last visit, this time they couldn't find my booking yet I was showing confirmation & booked in on line day before as they request plus the morning you leave early text & email arrive asking what time you are leaving, a disgrace. 

The reception staff are not friendly & even with no other customer waiting there they are in the doorway of their office seeing you standing there & you have to let it be known you need ‘help’ 

This booking in, booking out & asking a question in the evening, customer service isn’t their forte. Attitude seems to be to ignore.

Late evening I walked in following dinner (not at hotel) with my younger sister who I was in town see to be met with a very strange uncomfortable  look from a security guy.",3,2023,11,04
122,Great ,"Amazing stay, staff amazing great location would definitely recommend 
The room was clean and comfortable 
Spa and pool available for guests 
Bar and food available which we didn’t try this time but we will try next time 
On reception mohit and oli are a credit to your hotel ",5,2023,11,04
122,Great,"Bang for the Buck! Fantastic Hotel, fantastic Service. Would Love to come back. We had such a great time and enjoyed the Spa. We gotvupgraded to a Suite for freue AS well, just keep tat in mind it yo are travelling witj kids",5,2023,11,03
122,Brief thanks to the hotel and staff member Mohit ,"Very good hotel and I love the facilities and restaurants here. The manager Mohit in the lobby was a fantastic staff here and I recommend this hotel to everyone, will still choose this hotel next time I visit London ",5,2023,10,30
122,Worst service ever,What hotel has a bar closed to residents at 23.15. Has room service available to 23.30 but at 23.20 a terse member of staff says it’s too late as they would not get round to actioning the order till after 23.30 yet at 23.15 the bar staff were standing around. Doing nada. Appalling service that doesn’t warrant a revisit and you get the impression management don’t care,1,2023,10,27
122,Modern hotel with charm and personable staff,"I stayed at Chelsea Harbour for two weeks in the large river view room and most importantly the room was completely refurbished / well-maintained with a legitimate, firm mattress. On the room's terrace, there was direct sunlight for hours. Both at check in, and there were many hypothetical check ins as I had in fact extended my stay several times by two nights, and check out Mohit and his team were very intuitive and even when I twice forgot to extend by 11am etc no one ever harassed or was even passive aggressive. They really do attend to you in an uplifting, sincere way in the way famous, grand hotels do. The human experience was not like an anonymous or amateur property at all.",5,2023,10,23
122,Great experience ,Mohit was extremely helpful. Treated me very nicely. All of the staff have been extremely helpful and supportive towards me and my brothers. I honestly do not have anything bad to say about anything to do with this amazing hotel. ,5,2023,10,22
122,Great stay.,"Visited the hotel.  Really helpful staff especially in the restaurant.   Would definitely visit again. 
My gripes would be that some breakfast dishes were cold when they should be warm.  Also there were no vegetarian/ vegan dishes- eg. Sausages & no non dairy food.  This adjustment would go well.",4,2023,10,22

Hotel’s aesthetics are pleasing and staff are all hospitable its clean and food is yum ",5,2023,10,18
122,Amazing hotel,"This is a very nice hotel. All the staff are really kind and helpful. Rana, Mohit and Oli at the reception are really accommodating and assist with all enquiries. Deepiesh the general manager makes you feel like you are the owner of the hotel and feel comfortable. Mohamed Ibrahim the manager is always ready to assist with everything. I do not remember all the staff names but the staff in all departments are amazing. Location is very good. I came to stay for one week and I have been here 1 month now and will stay here until i go back home. Would appreciate if I can have more discount regardless i will still stay. I wish they had a guest laundry room for long staying guests like me.

122,Took money off my card and did not get a refund. I am still chasing and it is now in the hands of my bank to chase,"The room was good if needing a revamp but I cannot stress how disgustingly I was treated after I was trying to get a refund for being charged for breakfasts and meals I did not have. I spent over £1000 for a 5 day stay and had to chase for a refund everyday at the desk for the whole 5 days.  The staff were constantly lying to me and patronised me all the time. I had to, leave unresolved. They could not provide me with any proof and there was even confusion as to if the overcharge was breakfast or a meal. ",1,2023,10,17
122,Best stay!,Lovely experience me and my friends had a wonderful time and a lovely advisor named Mohit made sure we were happy throughout highly recommended this hotel if you want to stay with friends or as a couple.,5,2023,10,14
122,WHAOOOO!!!,"From the time we drove up the hotel drive, the welcome was soo I g it made me question why I go abroad!!-:) . Mohito managed to check us in early, I just couldn’t fault one single thing. Thank you CHELSEA HARBOUR HOTEL😘 I would come here again and again and again, it’s amazing!!!!",5,2023,10,14
122,"Just what the Doctor ordered, six night of relaxation and recharge batteries","I used to come with us hotel many years ago and my favourites are returned after many years and was glad to see that the standards were the same. If not a lot better all the staff were friendly and efficient, particularly on the front desk. Mohit had pointed me in the right direction to many fine restaurants in the area I would recommend this hotel to all my friends. I always compare hotels with Bangkok where I live, which is very high standard and this is the same standard. ",5,2023,10,09
122,Great Experience @ the Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"I stay regularly at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa and always have a wonderful experience. The staff are friendly and helpful, I know some by their first name, Luz is always happy to see me and always greets me with a smile as do the others, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the views were stunning. The onsite spa was a great bonus and the Mediterranean cuisine restaurant was delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in London.  It is my regular go to hotel in London and I cannot thank the staff that work their enough that make the stay special.  Thank you Mr C Holtz",5,2023,10,09
122,Four night stay at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel ,"Excellent service as always.  All staff are very professional, friendly and so accommodating.  Ollie who we met on arrival for our stay was exceptional and all staff are very attentive.  We stayed at The Chelsea Harbour for a very special occasion this week and we highly recommend the service and the accommodation.  The rooms and the attention to detail is an extremely high standard and the room service was outstanding.  The bar and food selection were excellent with varied choices.  The entrance, interior, reception areas and the rooms are spectacular and the view from the room looking onto the harbour is just fabulous especially in the evening.  We look forward to our next stay and thank you all so much for another wonderful and most enjoyable stay. ",5,2023,10,08
122,Poor poor poor service .very disappointed,"Tried to get food at the all dyy restaurant but told we could t eat there , went to the o2 that evening for a show then returned and thought it would be nice to have a drink in The bar , we sat down waited while the waiter served the table best to us and then he turned to us and said sorry we are closed ?? 
Definitely not 5star and I give zero marks for failing g to make your customers feel a little bit like they matter ,definitely won’t be returning.
Staff really in friendly and don’t really seem to care",1,2023,10,07

The Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa

London

The fabulous Chelsea Harbour Hotel

919795269

We booked the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for a spa weekend for my birthday and had the most amazing stay! We had full use of the spa and booked a massage each, I had the hot stone massage which I thoroughly recommend. We did pre book these, otherwise we may not have got the availability. The hotel is beautiful and at the reception when we checked in there were beautiful chocolates to help ourselves to whilst we were being checked in.

When we checked in we actually got upgraded to the Penthouse which was just so special as we were celebrating my birthday, the Penthouse was super spacious, with a TV Snug room to host several people if you wished, a spacious long balcony with the most incredible views of Londons City skyline! An incredible place to watch the fireworks on nye! The bed was the most comfortable I’ve slept in and the shower had a huge rainfall shower and a bath with a tv you could watch whilst soaking in the tub.

We went to the anchor bar restaurant and sat outside, it felt like we were abroad as we dined overlooking the harbour!

The breakfast the next morning was perfect with a lovely buffet of continental and cooked options. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay, it was made so special by the lovely staff and the incredible upgrade! To see a reel of our stay check out niconsocials on instagram",5,2023,10,05
122,Exceptional Hospitality,"""First and foremost, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to the wonderful team at Millennium Hotels. As loyal clients, we have consistently experienced exceptional service, and our recent stay was no exception. Fahd, the night manager, provided the best service ever! His attention to detail and dedication to ensuring our stay was comfortable truly stood out. He went above and beyond to accommodate our needs, making our experience exceptional. Mo, the manager, took perfect care of us, ensuring everything was seamless and enjoyable. Juliet, an extremely hardworking individual, deserves all the best for her dedication and efforts. Additionally, Jey, the wonderful night manager, was extremely welcoming, adding to the overall warm and friendly atmosphere. Our heartfelt thanks to the entire team for making our stay truly memorable! We look forward to many more visits as your loyal clients.""",5,2023,09,30

122,Bad staff and not cooperative after check out services,"I stayed with my family in 2 rooms for 7 nights, in june and i keep calling them asking for my original invoices to send to my email, they are really lazy, every one talk to me say im busy will send later, or system is down, and many excuses. Then the manager transfer me to finance because i want my tax invoices which is my right, keep promising but no respond i call every day and talk to them. They are not as expected as millennium group hotel staff. They have my email and contact number but no use this one Sh_.......",3,2023,09,29
122,Incredible,"We stayed here 26th-28th September and it was incredible. 

The room was beautiful and well equipped with a view of the harbour. The gym, pool and changing facilities were modern and clean. But for me, the best part of it all was the staff who were amazing. All of staff we dealt with were wonderful and extremely accommodating to our requests (including bringing an extra bed to the room due to a mix-up, providing ice buckets and cutlery for the room, printing something for us) - nothing that we asked for was too much trouble.

Overall this was a great trip and a fantastic location - I hope to be back soon! 

Thank you for everything.",5,2023,09,28
122,Excellent experience,"The services was another level, you ask for 1 thing and they exceed your expectations. The conference manager Chris C was awesome, he understood the business and how to handle client, he kept saying just ask and I will get it fixed and he did get things fixed, A man of his words on the job. Thank you Chris. I think he deserve a raise.

122,Great welcome by Mohit at reception on arrival. The best!,"The most kind welcome we have ever had! Upgraded room, free drinks and breakfast vouchers to make the stay for our wedding anniversary feel all the more special! Would highly recommend to all to stay here!",5,2023,09,23
122,You will NOT be disappointed. Very impressive. Excellent surroundings. One of the best beds I've slept on.,"Don't hesitate to choose this Hotel, it was an amazing stay. We booked a double room, the spaciousness in the rooms was unexpecting - it was a pleasant surprise. Our room provided a view of the yachts docked in the harbour, the spa experience was lush. The staff was attentive and accasionally checked in to make sure we were comfortable.",5,2023,09,22
122,"Faded glory, such a shame","This hotel used to be pretty vibrant. The restaurant was busy, there were people in the bar.  You could get a cab. The suites only set up was innovative and made you want to come back with the family at the weekend.

Not any more. It’s tired and ailing. The staff seem to know it and it’s sad to see such a once cool place deteriorate so quickly.  Ashwin on reception was helpful and smiling but he alone can’t turn it round.

As a result it’s pretty cheap with my stay costing a lot less than other hotels. But it doesn’t feel like good value. The toiletries are stuck down in big push pump bottles presumably to stop guests taking them. That says it all.

What a pity.",3,2023,09,22
122,Value for money,"The hotel is very clean, very serene environment and the entire staff are very very friendly and helpful, especiallythe conference Manager, Chris. I do recommend everyone to this place as you will never regret.",4,2023,09,21
122,Exceptional Service,"We were in the conference room for an advanced IT audit school. It was an unforgettable experience. The combination of conference room setup, outstanding dining, and exceptional service made our time remarkable. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating. The staff consistently went above and beyond to ensure my and our team's comfort and satisfaction throughout the program. Being on a special diet received special attention from Chris Christodoulou, the M&E Operations Manager. I doff my hat to him. I highly recommend the Chelsea Harbour Hotel to anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable hotel experience.

122,Wonderful Customer Service,"Private conference room was well organized. Thanks to Chris and his wonderful customer service, my team and I had a wonderful time.
Thank you so much Chris. You indeed personify the word “Customer Service”.",4,2023,09,21
122,Perfect weekend ,"This hotel was the perfect setting for a romantic weekend. The ambiance, harbor views, and exceptional service set the mood perfectly. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a relaxing weekend.",5,2023,09,19
122,Weekend stay for a couple!,"Absolutely amazing stay, me and my girlfriend stayed for one night in the king room I believe. It was absolutely wonderful, brilliant staff, such a clean and luxury hotel. I have stayed all over London on a high ish budget, and for the money I think this is my favourite. They even prepared a birthday cake for me on 20 minutes notice! 

Definitely coming back, hopefully when the steam room is working though ☹️!",5,2023,09,18
122,Great stay,"Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa felt like a home away from home. Comfort, luxury, and a warm welcome made my stay truly special.

The staff is very friendly and kind.
Very convenient access as well. Would recommend to anyone.",5,2023,09,18
122,Great experience visiting the Bar/Restaurant,"We were staying nearby and just walking past the Chelsea Harbour Hotel on a very hot afternoon, so we popped in to see if we could get a cup of tea. We asked at reception and were directed to the bar, and we sat on the terrace for our very welcome pots of tea! 
We had a look at the (Anchor Bar) menu, and felt encouraged to come back later for dinner. So we also had our dinner here, sitting on the terrace, overlooking the little harbour area as it got dark.
We just had just one course - the market fish of the day with a vegetable side, which was superb - and some (non-alcoholic) drinks. We were very pleased, not only with the quality of the food, but also with the quality of service and overall value.  The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and seemed keen to ensure that we had an enjoyable dining experience (even though we were not staying at the hotel and only wanted a single course).  We were very impressed, and would want to come back if we are ever in the area again!
",5,2023,09,14
122,"Wonderful place, wonderful staff","Big thanks to Asia and Oli (on reception) for making our stay so welcoming. My husband arranged for my mum and I to have a night at the hotel with spa treatment. The hotel is clean, modern and has a wonderful sweet smell..the staff were professional, helpful and very welcoming. Oli is very funny and made us laugh...All the staff appeared happy  and nothing was too much..I missed my treatment BUT the spa allowed me to have it the next day, meaning I didn't waste my money.. lovely touch...rooms were clean and well equipped with hairdryer, iron, safe, robs and slippers..Spa very clean and the domestic lady worked so hard always up and down...she has long long blonde hair (don't know name).. Breakfast was a high standard and they had vegetarian sausages which was a lovely touch for me...I would highly recommend and definitely go back... it was lovely sitting by the boats and having a drink..thanks CHH",5,2023,09,13
122,Robbed,"We stayed here July 10-17. I had $25,000 worth of cash and jewelry stolen from my room.  The safe would not open.  It was not laying out where anyone could see it.  We had gone to the Wimbeldon finals on Sunday.  They had to have gone through my room looking for it.  I filed a report with Kyle the head of security.  He took pictures of what jewelry was leftand asked me some questions.    Assured me he would investigate.  As of 9/8/2023, I have not heard from him.  Mr. Ibrihim the manager has emailed me that they looked at film from the cameras and questioned the staff.  How many people od their people are going  through my room?  They can't identify who went in my room. And no one is going to tell the truth?  They will be fired.  That is all the investigating that was done.  I do not feel as if an investigation was even done at all.  Mr Ibrihim actually questioned me if a robbery even happen at all or if guests going in and out of my room took my things.  We had no guests.  It was just housekeeping.  All he says is I didn't use the safe.  I say if they are the standard of the Millenium hotels, they need to vet their staff better.   I thought I was staying at a high end hotel.  We have traveled extensively and have never been robbed.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement.",1,2023,09,11
122,Wonderful stay,Lovely room in an all suites hotel. The rooms are spacious and great amenities. The staff are very friendly and efficient. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Will definitely be my hotel of choice whenever in the UK. ,5,2023,09,10
122,6 star service from Ashwin guest relations on my wife's birthday goes above and beyond for the customer ,I don't usually rite a review untill we have finished our trip but the service from Ashwin the guest relations executive has been absolulty outstanding! We have been treated like royalty on my wife's birthday trip to London I can not thank this man enough he works extremely hard to make my wife's birthday more special then I could ever have imagined. We have one of the best rooms in the hotel and has been greeted with one of the best hospitality services I have ever experienced. Thank you again this trip has been above and more for both of us we will return and recommend to the highest level.,5,2023,09,06
122,My stay was excellent. I very much enjoyed it.,"The reception personnel, Luz and Rana were very professional, kind, attentive and helpful. The rooms were very spacious with an adjoining living room. I really liked the bathroom and shower. The swimming pool was excellent.",5,2023,09,06
122,Very Poor service,"This may be a five star hotel but the service is not . It started as soon as we got there as the front area was closed because Chelsea football club were getting on their bus to go to the game. While we were still eating our main course being asked if we wanted any desserts. Tried to order room service to be told no food available. Ordered breakfast for 2 , 4 turned up with no coffee and tea. Complained at checkout and was told don’t worry we will discount your bill , still waiting for our bill  3 days later but been charged full amount. Sent email to reception manager still no reply, filled in survey sent by email still no reply. ",1,2023,09,05
122,Lovely team of staff,"Very friendly staff who kept offering to help in any way they could, lovely room, perfect location and for London very good value for money
We paid the extra for a balcony room which had a separate lounge too
Would definitely stay again. 
Many thanks",5,2023,09,05
122,Really good !,"Everything was perfect, the crew is really smart, we didn’t use all the services that was available but those we used was really good. The breakfast albait a bit expensive is really complete with a wonderfull view of the harbour",5,2023,09,03
122,Ashwin in the star of the hotel ,"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and the rooms are spacious with a great location but it’s the upbeat personality of receptionist Ashwin which is most memorable for me. He is polite and informative, when you are arriving tired after a flight his persona can change your mood for the better and as I stay 80 nights per year in hotels this skill should not be taken for granted. Claude the bellman is always helpful, the front office manager was sadly quite rude, must have been having a bad day. Look forward to return ",5,2023,08,31
122,Recent Visit,Another excellent visit to the hotel. Ash and Liuz were outstanding and friendly. Great location with good links to Central London. A very friendly hotel with great staff. Will be back on my next trip to London.,5,2023,08,31
122,Thank you for a great stay!,"My recent stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel in London was made exceptional by the staff. From the front desk to housekeeping and the dining area, everyone provided top-notch service. Their dedication and friendliness truly stood out, ensuring a memorable stay. Kudos to the entire team! 
Ashwin, Luz, Smita & Claude.",5,2023,08,29
122,Relaxing,Clautair and Luz were friendly and informative. They offered to show me routes and also were kind to call me a Taxi after my stay. The food was marvelous and the view was something I would not mind seeing again.,5,2023,08,29
122,Would recommend!,"Our stay was wonderful, especially Luz at the front desk and the entire breakfast staff. The whole family had a great time! The location is great and taxis were usually easy to find. We would love to stay here again the next time we’re in London. ",5,2023,08,28
122,Fantastic but comms need work…,"Had a staycation on my 5th wedding anniversary weekend with my 2.5yr old son (my husband is working abroad so my son became my date lol). We stayed in the King Bed Suite on 3rd floor. The room was a lovely size. It meant that when my son went to sleep, I could utilise the living room area whilst he slept in the room. Check in process was very easy (I did check in online prior which may have helped), my luggage was delivered to my door which was helpful as I had a pushchair and a toddler to deal with so it was wonderful! Food was great. Sometimes with hotel food it can be hit an d miss but it was fantastic.
Saying all that, I have to say service was not great. Every time I called reception or anywhere else it kept saying mailboxes were full or it kept ringing. As a 5 star hotel, I would expect staff to be almost faultless. I did also apply for an upgrade prior to arrival. When I called reception for an update, I was passed from pillar to post then told to email reservations who never got back to me. Room service on the first night also took almost 1.5hrs and that was after me calling after 1 hr because I figured it was Saturday night over a bank holiday, I would give them some grace but when the reason given was because the app I ordered through via the tv on the QR code was faulty, I was annoyed that someone didn’t call me to report this and that my meal would be delayed. If they could tighten up on the comms, I would say the experience would be 5 stars!
I would like to pass my thanks to Ash & Luz for a swift checkout experience and for the box of chocolates and ordering my cab ensuring my son and I got off safely without too much hassle.",4,2023,08,28
122,Excellent Stay,"We had the most enjoyable stay at The Chelsea Harbour hotel.  The staff were lovely and very helpful and our room was clean,  spacious and very comfortable. 

Location is lovely and just a short stroll to the Imperial Wharf station which is convenient to central London. ",5,2023,08,28
122,"Took a very long time to get checked in, and they made illegitimate charges to my crad","I had a very poor experience. Despite pre-paying they seemed to have allocated my room to someone else and took 45 minutes to find me a room to actually use. When I checked out they refunded my room deposit to someone elses credit card (potentially fraud here) and charged another £198 to my card for no reason whatsover. The room was fine, its not great to get to on public transport.",1,2023,08,28
122,Wonderful,"Wonderful experience from beginning to end. Lovely welcome and made to feel taken care of the whole time. Took all my stress away! Exactly what I needed. Thank you! 
Would recommend to anyone and everyone! ",5,2023,08,28
122,5 star service ,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Chelsea Harbour Hotel and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The rooms were not only beautifully designed but also incredibly comfortable and spacious, providing a luxurious retreat after a day of exploring the city.

Their unwavering commitment to ensuring my comfort and satisfaction was truly remarkable. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to return and experience their exceptional service once again!",5,2023,08,26
122,Impeccable,"During my recent visit to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa, I was treated to an exceptional experience. Ash and Rana delivered impeccable service that left a lasting impression. The hotel boasts luxury, magnificent harbor vistas, and exceptional dining choices. ",5,2023,08,25
122,My stay,"I stayed at the hotel with a friend and the service was lovely. The receptionist, Rana, was super lovely and friendly and assisted me with no problems. The rooms were clean and put together but were outdated and the restaurants food was 10/10. Would recommend.",5,2023,08,25
122,Delightful stay at Chelsea Harbour Hotel!,"I recently stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa, and it was an absolute delight. The hotel's location, room quality, and spa are exceptional. 

I'd like to extend a special thank you to Ashwin for his outstanding service. His attention to detail made my stay even more enjoyable. 

Thank you, Chelsea Harbour Hotel, and thank you, Ashwin, for a memorable experience!",5,2023,08,24
122,Don’t waste your money!!  Keep away!!!!!,"Completely unprofessional hotel. Definitely not a 5 star!  
Found underwear under the bed. Hair in the bath. Coffee machine not working, stains on the sofa. 
Asked to change rooms. Staff not Cooperative. They could do with management/ people skill training !Breakfast was awful. Had a terrible experience which we paid for !! 
Don’t even ask for a discount!!",1,2023,08,24
122,Great reception,"Checking was fast, the reception team was lovely and efficient, in particular i would like to mention Luz, she always lovely and friendly. She delivery the best custmour service. 
The only think they should ask house keeping to delivery more water",5,2023,08,22
122,Brasserie. It’s ok. Not best ambience though. ,"I went with a friend before a football match.  Had a drink at the bar before sitting down.  Quite chaotic at the bar despite just 2 or 3 people there.  Odd.  
Anyway, we sat down and the service was fine.  Food was well presented and tasty.  Caeser salad an Caprese salad each as starters.  We had a ribeye each for main course with lobster on the side.  The ribeye was the thin type.  Not recommended.  Veg was tasty. Lobster just ok. Restaurant was empty except for one couple and when they left a 3 came in.  But it was a Wednesday at 6:30-7pm, I suppose. We left at 7:40, jumped in a cab but missed ko. 
I’ll go back but I won’t have the ribeye.  ",3,2023,08,20
122,Amazing Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel and amazing staff!

Special mention to Rana and Luz who were extremely helpful and made my stay more enjoyable.

Highly recommend trying out the Hotel and will definitely be coming back again soon

Top Notch Hotel and the food is also amazing",5,2023,08,14
122,Outstanding customer service,"Wonderful staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special - absolutely brilliant customer service. Such an amazing experience, food was great and loved the views over London. Good location on the river - so you can arrive by boat! ",5,2023,08,13
122,Great family break ,"The staff are lovely. Very helpful. So welcoming, we as a family had a fantastic time. Thank you to all reception and catering and cleaning staff. You guys are so lovely. You all deserve recognition. Last night was the only thing I can criticise as alarm went off at 1.30am and no communication was made that we were safe to go back to sleep. Was rather chaotic. 
Apart from that you have all made our stay very special. Many thanks and I’m sure our family will visit again. 
Great room, wonderful and big and perfect for us! Food great and jazz music was also great. ",5,2023,08,12
122,Some challenges but overall we enjoyed ,"Positives: 
- I felt 280  pounds for a two-room suite at a 5-star hotel with breakfast was a reasonable price
- Nice pool, though note it is 1.5 meters deep, so somewhat intimidating for weak swimmers and worried parents - no life guide or hand-rail around the pool. They do give your thick, lush towels. 
- Reception, door people, and lobby staff were very friendly 
- Most rooms seem to have a balcony -  I loved sitting over the dock drinking my coffee each morning 
- Food was five-star in general 
- Our room had a kettle, fridge, safe, two bathrooms, balcony, lobby, tub, shower, nice towels, and lovely bed linens
- This hotel is about 30 minutes in an Uber ($25) from downtown, but this does mean it is quieter - no street noise, and it felt calmer. We had no issues getting an Uber or taxi downtown or back to the hotel (try the Uber water taxi that is close to the hotel); there is also an underground station and bus service close to the hotel 
- a 30-minute drive from Heathrow 

Negatives: 
- The Hotel rooms look a little dated and worn - it looked 1990s to me, but everything worked and felt clean (I loved the room had a bathtub and separate shower), and I felt that was fine for the price we paid. Our room also had a lobby area that cut down corridor noise as it gave a second door between the room and the corridor. 
- Parking is 80 pounds a night at the hotel. I used Prestige Parking which was a 3-minute walk around the corner from the hotel, for 90 pounds in total for three nights. 
- At check-in, we were given a room with two beds when there were thee in our party (three in the booking, and we all stood a reception during check-in). I called reception for a bed at 11 pm (I had wrongly assumed the couch was a pullout and would be made-up or sheets would be in the cupboard when I first arrived!). A bed was delivered to our room without any bedding to sleep under. It came with a mattress topper that the delivery person thought were linens. As the delivery person left the linens in a bag and did not make up the bed, we only spotted the issue when I made up the bed a little later. By now, it was midnight, and I just wanted to go to bed, so I made do with towels as covers this first night. The next day, I asked the receptionist for a comforter or sheets and blankets as we headed out of the hotel at 1 pm and was told, ""Of course,"" but when I returned at 6 pm - nothing. I called reception again and asked for bedding at 7 pm, and a new bed arrived when I just wanted sheets and a blanket! I was so done with this saga that I just said thank you and was pleased to see a comforter and sheets on the second bed (it was made up), so I just used that bed for the next two nights and left the first bed leaning against a wall - it was never taken away. None of these issues are awful, but just not five-star hotel service. 
- We had issues with room service. The first time we called down, it was 11 pm, and we had just arrived; we were told no room service when the menu in the room clearly said it was open for the light or snack menu (the overnight menu)! I did not argue, it was 11 pm, and we made do with what we had in the room. The second time I tried to order breakfast on our departure day, as we were under a time crunch - I called three times, and no one picked up, so I called reception, and they said there was no breakfast service in the room. This time I was awake and wanted to ensure my kids were fed, so I argued that it was clearly stated in the menu in our room that we could order, and I had checked with reception the night before and been told I could order breakfast from our room. Reception relented and took my order, and the food was delivered - it was delicious! Again, just not five-star service.
- I also had an odd experience at checkout when I asked for a print-off of my bill. The receptionist said he would do this and bring it to my car as we were waiting to leave - I waited for 10 minutes and then went in. He said it was proving challenging and would email me the bill - acceptable.- still, at the time of writing three days later, no emailed bill! Again not five-star service. 

Overall, we had a great time and liked a lot about the hotel and likely would return; it was just odd to have to the issues above in a five-star hotel!

122,Great Value For Money ,"Outstanding value for money. Great location. The hotel is undergoing a refurbishment .. though this is not obvious to guests. The new look suites look fresh and attractive. 
Breakfast was very good, and all the staff were friendly and welcoming. ",5,2023,08,05
122,Manager Disrespect and unprofessional to a CANCER guest !!,"Bad m, awful experience!  Writing a review  now as hotel is not resolving to complaints Had to wait for the room. The key given was to a female guests room in error!  Paid over £700 for a suite for 2 nights with 2 single beds. Got 1 double bed and child camp bed in the lounge!! Apparently big hotel like that didn’t have any other rooms and they couldn’t be bothered to re arrange the beds. Cancelled the 2nd night, went to another hotel , refusal of refund or discount for a such a bad night sleep with springs in back from camp bed. Mohamed ibrahim was very rude to my husband who was clearly a cancer patient! This was distressing, Stayed at the hotel due to cancer treatment at the marsdan hospital. Coffee machine / safe didn’t work, reported but no one came.  Didn’t even offer my husband a coffee before going for treatment!  Request for Complaints procedure are begin ignored. How can a  5 star hotel get away with treating guests so rudely and no respect. Even the reception staff apologised on behalf of the mangers attitude. Shouting at a cancer patient In reception with other guests is really not acceptable or professional. It’s disrespectful. If you are having treatment at the Marsdan and need a hotel. Please don’t use this one. Maybe a taxi ride but you will get ripped off and won’t get the rest you need.",1,2023,08,05
122,Excellent,It was a wonderful stay. Special thanks to Smita for assisting us. She was so nice our kids was very happy to have chocolates from her. Found her so helpful quick in service .polite in nature very friendly .,5,2023,08,04

122,A delightful stay in London . Friendly staff,"Friendly, comforting & spacious. A delightful stay that I would like to visit again. I took advantage of the swimming pool & spa facilities. My room had everything I needed from a large room 2 seperate toilets great for guests s visiting me on my stay In London and all of the lamps worked",5,2023,08,01
122,Fawlty Towers on the Thames,"Got here after a long day looking forward 
to relaxing and some nice food 
Mmmmmmm
Think again 
Tell tell sign should have been at check in 
Someone complaining there was no response from room service !!! 
There seemed to be chaos at check in with various guests seemingly thinking it’s ok to interrupt you checking in !!!! Got our room key to find 1 out of 3 lifts working !!!  So a queue and wait for the lift 
Finally got to our room on the 6th floor 
And guess what our room key didn’t work !!!
Meanwhile the lobby on the 6th floor was alive with kids running up and down it screaming so much so at least 3 other guests came out their rooms to see the chaos 
So back down in the lift another queue another 30 minutes for the nice guy in reception to come all the way back up to confirm the door system was broken snd he would have to get maintenance !!!! 
So we decided let’s just get out of there 
Place is a shambles it’s falling apart and the staff try their best I will never go to this or another Millennium Hotel. It was once a great hotel so much potential but being run into the ground for whatever reason very sad !!!",1,2023,08,01
122,Very Disappointing experience :(,"First of, I’m only giving this 3 stars because of my spa treatments by the therapist Mimi (sorry if iv misspelled), I’m currently 29 weeks pregnant and the head and foot massage was just what I needed so thank you :). 

The reception staff when arriving at the hotel were so friendly and our room was ready straight away but unfortunately that’s where the positives ended. 

Me and my partner had afternoon tea booked for 1:30pm which was included in our spa breaks package, this was a £20 allowance off afternoon tea or dinner. I had emailed weeks prior to book this but no one got back to me therefore I called to confirm this booking. 

Upon arrival I told the waiter we had tea booked for 1:30 under my name, he went to check and came back to ask if it was under a different name, I said no. He looked confused but told us to sit down anyway, at this point I assume they never had our booking in the system.

 After 10-15 minutes the restaurant manager came over to me and said he couldn’t find our booking, I had to explain it was a spa breaks booking and I had phoned the restaurant directly to make the booking since my initial email was ignored. 

I showed him the spa breaks confirmation email and he was questioning what package it was and if it included afternoon tea, I told him to check with reception as they had details of our booking. A further 10 mins later he comes back and says afternoon tea is not already paid for (I never told him it was) we only have £20 allowance off the bill which we told him is absolutely fine. He continued to say we still have to pay and gave us an example of how much we would need to pay, talking to is in a belittling manner. 

His attitude was somewhat patronising and unpleasant and completely ruined the dining experience to the point we left without ordering and ate elsewhere outside the hotel. It seemed like he only cared about catering for the regular guests as his attitude and service towards them was completely different. 

Although we booked through a discounted spa breaks third party website we still spent over £600 during our stay and I can honestly say it was not worth the money at all, iv worked in the hotel industry for 10 years myself in 5 star establishments and always stayed in hotels around London, this hotel is far below par.

Onto another point, none of the lifts from reception went up to the 3rd floor so we had to go to the forth floor and take the fire exit stairs down which isn’t great when your 7 months pregnant and staying at a (5 star) hotel. A lot of the decor is old and needs maintenance with things hanging off to one side. 

The swimming pool in the spa was murky and looked dirty, this was probably why it was empty, this was one thing I was looking forward to using as I was not able to use the steam/sauna being pregnant. 

We were both left very disappointed and out of pocket. This was meant to be a relaxing experience before our new baby is here and if anything we’ve left even more stressed then when we first arrived. 

I also forgot to mention I paid for a room upgrade through spa breaks and this was not honoured. Reception gave us complimentary late checkout which was appreciated thank you ( Although we checked out early anyway as we just wanted to go home) 

I had such high hopes for this hotel and experience, therefore I cannot recommend this hotel. ",3,2023,07,31
122,Great overnight stay in Chelsea,"Great room, nice breakfast overlooking the marina served lovely and attentive team.

Very pleasant stay at this hotel.  The hotel is clean and well-maintained, the team were very welcoming and the service excellent.  

We’ll be back! ",5,2023,07,30
122,Such promise that ended in a BIG disappointment,"From the moment I arrived I was met with smiles and a warm welcome. Well done the staff and management!
My room (an upgrade) was excellent. A bowl of fruit waiting for me. Another good sign.
However it all started to go downhill from there. Primarily from an obvious lack of proper maintenance.
The toilet took several attempts to flush. Not properly adjusted. My girlfriend room had an even worse toilet! In what is supposed to be a good hotel this should not happen.
I took a shower before going to bed and the water continued running when I turned off the taps! As it was late and I did not want maintenance people un my room while I was trying to sleep. I closed the door and tried to sleep. The sound of the water running kept me awake most of the night and I only managed to get two hour sleep.
As a result I checked out earlier than planned and did not stay for breakfast.
Frankly I was disappointed. There are so many hotels close by that offer a better experience for a similar price I really cannot recommend this hotel.
The only reason I did not give it a one star review were the staff. They were excellent. Senior management are, to me, clearly not doing their job properly as there should not be problems like this. Very disappointed.",3,2023,07,28
122,"Mohammed Ibrahim the Legend, supporter and helper in all duties","I rate the hotel with a 4 stars but only because of Mohammed Ibrahim I give it a 5 stars, this legend has help me and my family in all kind of situations and never missed or made any mistakes in his services. This guy made my stay here a memorable stay and I sincerely wish him the best in his life and job.

122,Staff are outstanding - the company are less impressive,"The staff are amazing! All of them! Can't speak highly enough of them! So accommodating, polite and a delight to deal with. The senior hotel management might like to take note of the following however...
Frustratingly not all the rooms are as pictured on the website which means some at the same grade are better than others. The car parking fee has gone up again which is outrageous! 
As a prestige member I'm finding that I get very little benefit compared to other hotel loyalty schemes. ",4,2023,07,26
122,Proper,"Had a wonderful time . All staff  hospitality was amazing . Spa treatments are also great. Would definitely return. Front desk lady called Luz was really helpful ,kind and gave as a warm welcome. Also the manager gave us an upgrade wich was great too. ",5,2023,07,23
122,A hidden gem excellent for rest a recuperation,"Excellent stay attentive staff. Reception and check in east and helpful. Amazing balcony room with living room area and two bathrooms.

122,You must stay here! This is a five star plus hotel and restaurant experience!,"Overall, this was an amazing five star experience, in every aspect! The hotel is beautiful, the room was immaculate, incredibly comfortable, and exceeded our expectations. But mostly, it was the staff, starting with the area, general manager, the Director of operations, the general manager of the hotel, the food and Beverage operator, the concierge’s team, housekeeping, everyone was just, simply put, amazing! In the restaurant, Alexandra, Enrica, Tanvir were amazing and Attentive to every single detail, and have a wonderful attitude and couldn’t be more helpful. You would be crazy to stay at any other hotel.",5,2023,07,22

122,Chelsea Harbor Hotel,"Stayed at the Chelsea for 5 nights while watching Wimbledon.

122,Conference,"My company had a one week conference with accommodation in July. 

Our rooms and conference facilities were great and each of the staff polite and reactive to our needs. 

The absolute stand out for us was Chris, who looked after us all during our king working days. Chris’ attentiveness, care and thoughtfulness made a tough working week so much easier. He was simply fabulous- the hotel is very lucky to have him. 

Thank you Chris for being so wonderful, it was very much appreciated",5,2023,07,21

We were greeted by Luz who was absolutely brilliant. She made sure that all of our requirements were met and when we arrived everything was ready for us. A big thank you to Luz for looking after us and for making our kids feel completely comfortable and welcomed. The rooms was great very spacious and the manager called to make sure we were okay and enjoying our stay. Thank you to the breakfast staff who were excellent. Will be staying again soon. ,5,2023,07,17
122,A massive hotel which needs to look at the finer details for the quality and service,"This was booked on our behalf with 2 other couples.  On arrival to check in (after the other couples had already checked in, at 5:30pm)  we were informed that our room wasn't ready!  That it had not been inspected!  Well I had thought that all rooms you were able to check in after at least 3pm.  So not a great start!  20 mins later on waiting we finally got a room.  On my inspection on the room, a lovely suite and size with a balcony, very roomy.  However it certainly didn't meet my standards on inspection!  When you do a dust test aboard the bed and headboard and your hand is full of dust it's not pleasant.  I know you were busy for Wimbledon, not an excuse!  Inspect areas which need to be dusted.
On a positive the breakfast the following morning was excellent, lots of selection and the staff very helpful.  Please could you up your range for decaffeinated options for coffee though.
We checked out early after the second night so didn't have the opportunity for breakfast.  
I little bit off the beaten track to where we usually stop in London, however a lovely location to stroll along the river to Battersea Park and Power Station.
The hotel really needs to look at the finer details to be quality!

122,Birthday Celebration - Afternoon Tea at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"I booked an Afternoon Tea and Spa at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for my wife's birthday celebrations.  We had a wonderful time in the lovely setting of the hotel, spa and restaurant which overlooks the marina.  

Compliments to the staff at the Front Desk of the hotel who were very friendly and welcoming.  They were very helpful in directing us to the Spa and later on to the restaurant. 

A very special thanks to Restaurant and Bar Manager, Mihai Zamfirescu and his team for making it a very special day and for going the extra mile in catering for us and providing an outstanding service.

Thank you to the lady at the Front Desk in the Spa who was very friendly and helped us in the choices of the massages available.  This also included the use of the Sauna, Steam Room and Gym.

Once again an outstanding service, cleanliness and brilliant facilities.  A special thank you to Natalie and Mimi who were very nice and friendly and gave us both a super massage, foot spa and facial.  We both felt so refreshed and relaxed afterwards and slept so well later on.      

We will be booking to go again and this time we'll bring our family, we've also told our friends about it too.   

We highly recommend the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa to all.

122,The good and the not so good,"Good——-
warm and helpful staff, all friendly.
Excellent breakfast and staff
Big rooms with everything needed.
Clean 

Not so good——
Penthouse and bar is the only dining and drinking option open. No draft beer, few places to sit in “bar”. 
Restaurant is closed indefinitely for renovations
Too much of a corporate feeling to us- marble and plastic plants. Ugh.
Not much in the area- one pub, not a good one. A few dining places. No stores or shops.
On “the water” means an algae-choked brackish boat lagoon with access to Thames closed by a lock that looks like it hasn’t been opened in decades, but who knows. not picturesque in the least.",4,2023,07,07
122,Wonderful fantastic unexpected delight! ,"Great hotel, and brilliant service. Front of House Manager, Mo was very approachable, capable and professional and a joy to meet him. 

Lovely kind Luz and the other ladies on the front desk were wonderful kind and lifted our mood. 

Lloyd and the night team were really great and very helpful also. Thank you and give them all a well-deserved pay rise! 

Wonderful staff and fantastic room wonderful views and super balcony! Wow it was spectacular in so many ways! We feel very extremely blessed and grateful. 

Many many thanks for so many kindnesses.   

See you all soon!",5,2023,07,06
122,"Pretty sub-average stay, plus hotel's location is in a nice area but inconveniently located to central London","Some members of the staff are pretty unfriendly.  Some were friendly it's just not consistent, and it's noticeably worse than most of the hotels I stay in.  There were restock issues with housekeeping and when we called to request more of the items we were missing it took over two hours and a visit to the front desk to get not even all the items we needed since we were waiting for them before we could go to bed. The breakfast is decent for an included breakfast but they aren't able to keep up with the morning rush (chairs and place settings missing, food items and juice and glasses needing to be refreshed) and the staff needs to step it up to make sure they can keep up with the rush.  The pool has kids' hours so if you are traveling with kids, you can't use the pool at a time convenient to you unless it aligns with their hours.  Lastly, the location is in a very nice area, safe and clean but it's a pain in the butt to get to central London - if you're ok with having to change multiple trains/buses then it might not bother you but it was annoying with little kids. Oh also, no power outlets by the bedside! What hotel nowadays doesn't have any outlets by the bedside?",2,2023,07,05
122,Old tired and not 5 Star more like a low end 4 star,"Booked online check in was .. painless , sent to a room with cases in then had to come back down and taken to another room, not sure they should advertise this as a 5 star rooms are tired phones broken , patio not clean , rooms not the best ever , asked for wine and was sent some took 20 mins to get a corkscrew , in common with so many London hotels they take clients for granted and try and trade off the reputation sadly as with many the place is really not the best .. wouldn’t visit again ",2,2023,07,04
122,Worst experience ever!,"We were so excited to stay at a nice hotel but our experience was far from it. I've stayed in many hotels in London as we travel alot and this was the worst. 

Firstly, we went to a late lunch at the restaurant and the waiter ended up spilling 2 drinks of lemonade all over my 10 year old daughter. He then was more focused on cleaning the mess off the floor and left my daughter feeling upset. We weren't checked on for a good 10 minutes. 

On top of that we ordered two cocktails, both of which were mixed wrong, they were pure alcohol and tasted foul. When we gave feedback the manager of the restaurant was rude and aggressive.

Then during the night, my daughter started shouting saying she found something in the sofa bed. To my surprise it ended up being a dirty thong. We were so shocked and called the manager immediately. 

Whilst he apologised and offered us a partial refund, we are still yet to wait for any refund. We have also emailed and called the hotel and had no response. Chelsea harbor, you are a joke. Manager Kyle, you are deceitful. We will never recommend this hotel. ",1,2023,07,04
122,Please see above,"We had to wait 2 hours to check in. We room was not clean, patio windows and balcony dirty and furniture needed varnishing. The inside required a proper dusting especially around the coffee machine. The carpets and sofas are marked. The lightbulb in the bathroom fell down and maintenance took 2 days to come. The safe was locked and required maintenance to re open. The bathrobes are old and have seen better days. The service in the breakfast area for A La Carte was very poor. The food in the Penthouse Restaurant was poor quality and expensive. The steam room in the Pool area was out of order. We have been coming to the Hotel from the time it was a Conrad Hotel. We will never be coming back due to being so disappointed. ",2,2023,07,04
122,NEVER JUDGE A HOTEL BY ITS COVER,"Had to wait until 15-40 to enter room. when finally allowed I was greeted by a staff member exiting the rooms.
Stains on the carpet in bedroom and lounge. Broken metal handle on wardrobe. TV that kept turning itself on. Mayhem in bar lounge on top floor. Beer served in a glass that smelt. Service on ground floor and top floor slow and lethargic. Checking out in morning after paying £75 for valet parking had to go to get my own car.
I have pictures of some of above on my phone.",2,2023,07,02
122,Events team is top notch,"I facilitated a class in the Bridges room in the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and could not have been more pleased.  The events team was incredibly helpful, attentive and service oriented.  The space was exactly what we were looking for with a nice room with large windows and spaces to go for breakouts.  We had a special evening with the plated dinner and a movie night and the hotel met our every need.  The food was delicious and we appreciated their attention to allergies and food preferences.  When a hotel's events team is as good as this one, it allows the instructors to deliver more impactful courses which is a win for everyone!
 
We don’t always go back to the same hotels after we experience them, but we will definitely go back to this one!

Highly recommend.  ",5,2023,06,29

122,Not a 5* experience,"The rooms are not particularly clean, old and I encountered lots of basic issues which you shouldn't have for a 5 star hotel, there was no clock in the room, lots of flies, WiFi didn't work remote control for tvs both didn't work, lift to spa was broken the list goes on but worst of all was being woken at 6.30am to alot of dripping by the front door I put a bin to catch the leak and reported it to reception but nothing was done, at this point it was too much and I checked out.  Not upto 5 * standard",2,2023,06,20

122,Chelsea rocks!,"I decided to treat myself for my birthday and I went to this amazing place. If you are looking for a place to rest and disconnect, I can guarantee you this is your spot. Amazing staff and incredible service, I can’t wait to go back and feel more spoiled! Thank you!",5,2023,05,25
122,"Chelsea Harbour Hotel , London,s hidden Gem","I have been stayind at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for many years and I am delighted to find it  getting better every time I stay
. Today I had a fantastic meal in the bar from a menu inspired by the Chelsea flower Show . Not only did it look amazing with edible flowers but it tasted delicious. Thanks to the professional staff and brilliant chef it made for a unique experience.
The  hotel is being rejuvenated thanks to a keen new management team . Their aim is to make it one of London top destinations. Not only is the food great but the bedrooms are spacious and there is a spa to restore you after your journey.
I understand the bar restaurant is moving to the top floor at the end of next month with views of the river . I can,t wait to visit again , how exciting!

122,A lovely bit of luxury at a great price.,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. We were 2 females travelling business and opted for a twin suite. Loads of space, amazing views of the harbour, comfortable beds, quiet and lovely balcony. The staff were attentive, polite, friendly and totally on hand. Breakfast was excellent and kept us full all day. Excellent value. ",5,2023,05,23

122,A wonderful experience,An amazing experience. The hotel has beautiful large suites that are as big as an apartment! The location is beautiful and it faces a private harbour.

It was also Jazz night so that added to the vibe..

122,Excellent venue for events or a staycation,"We recently held a stakeholder event at the Chelsea Harbour hotel, hosting 250 delegates and couldn’t have been more pleased with the service the hotel delivered. The hotel is in an easily accessible location and so peaceful, you could forget that you are in London. The staff at reception and the concierge, gave a warm welcome and were very helpful with our set up material. The suites were comfortable and the balconies overlooking the harbour were a lovely bonus. The hotel had a great breakfast menu choice and if you get time, the spa is well worth a visit.  

We were lucky to secure the Grand Room for our event which had stunning views of the harbour. Rushena, the Events Manager, was the utmost professional , understanding our needs and was able to cater to all our requirements. Chris, Yiodis and their team, who ran the event on the day were brilliant and could not do enough for us, and Chris solved various issues for individual delegates, without hesitation. Muj and Chetan from AV Projections Ltd, made everything easy and seamless and the delegates expressed how smoothly things went.

We whole-heartedly recommend  this venue for an event or a relaxing stay.",5,2023,05,18
122,GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY FOR THAT PART OF LONDON ,"WAS GOING TO A SHOW AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL THAT IS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE

NICE BREAKFAST AND ALSO NOT OVER CHARGED 
ROOMS WITH HARBOUR VEIW ARE ALSO EXCELLENT ",5,2023,05,17
122,Fab friendly hotel!,"Really impressed with Chelsea Harbour Hotel, so much so that I was already thinking about writing the review while I was there. This is a reasonably priced hotel where you can do two nights in a five-star hotel for £500 which is very fair for London. Our room (616) was spacious and had a beautiful view across the harbour and the River Thames, looking out towards the city. The facilities were great and the spa treatments I had were fab. Hotel was generally very family friendly and we were treated well. No complaints at all and look forward to staying again!",5,2023,05,14
122,"Enjoy London but in an exclusive, secluded location away from the city center noise and pollution.","This hotel is a wonderful place to stay. It’s near to everything in London but also away from the noise and pollution in this pedestrianized area that is still developing.
The staff all make you feel at home and are never to busy to help you. All attention is given to make your stay special.",5,2023,05,10
122,Old and overpriced,"It is not worth the price. The fitting was out dated and the carpet was old and dirty. Service was not good either. We paid £380 per night and even breakfast was not included. At that price, I would suggest staying elsewhere.",2,2023,05,08
122,Had the best time!,Had the best time with my friend and our 2 boys (aged 7 & 9) - the staff were absolutely fabulous with the boys. The room was great. Pool & Spa was a lovely extra. Breakfast choice was vast & yummy:-),5,2023,05,08
122,Friendly and attentive staff,"My wife and I stayed here for our 8th wedding anniversary with our 5 month old son and had a fantastic stay.  The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, special mention to Giuliano who looked after us on Sunday evening.  Would definitely recommend ",5,2023,05,07
122,Great way to celebrate a birthday!,"We enjoyed one night at this lovely hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. We very much appreciated the cake, chocolates and balloons which greeted him on our arrival- thank you to Lau on reception. We liked the spacious suite with a separate living room and small balcony. The swimming pool was great and breakfast and cheese plate for lunch were just right. We also enjoyed the peaceful neighbourhood and walking along the Thames path. We shall definitely return.",5,2023,05,02
122,A difficult start,"Tried booking on line as I’m a member & wanted my discount , the website wouldn’t allow so I called receptionist & he said I could have the room I wanted but he couldn’t book it ? Then went on to call reservations who told me the rate I had been quoted was wrong and she couldn’t book it with the membership discount so I was told go back on line . This process was over an hour & I still didn’t get discount . On arrival the reception were great & I got a credit to stay of £25.00 . Room service was the plan . No drinks were delivered ! No one answers phone at all so we used an app . On departure I was then charged for the drinks we didn’t have & although they did accept we hadn’t had them I was left disappointed at the whole experience. Hotel was however nice & breakfast was delicious. I wouldn’t stay again .",3,2023,04,30
122,Hit and Miss,"I visited this hotel on a recent trip to london for a football game. Initially the hotel looks amazing, right on the harbour and a bit of sun made it look a bit nicer. Upon checking in I was informed by the girl at reception that I couldnt go into my room as the Chelsea team was on the floor. The woman at reception was really friendly and as a chelsea fan I didnt mind, I was offered a drink at the bar on the house and my room key would be dropped down when I could go up. Overall a decent welcome. This is where the hit and miss comes in. The room was really warm so I turned on the air conditioning (at least i thought i did). I got back to the room after the match and it was like an oven. I went down to reception and asked and was told that there wasnt any air conditioning it was set to hot as the weather was cold. They were unable to open the window and i was advised that someone would be up in the morning to help open the window (no one did come and check). I was offered a fan to cool the room down. In a five star hotel you expect more that a fan you probably expect air conditioning. The following day I got back to the hotel late and asked if i could by a drink at the bar and bring it to my room as i knew the bar was close. The person at the bar advised he would check with his manager. 25 minutes later he hadnt come back which isnt what you would call good. The worse part of the trip was being woken up at 7:30 am with a staff member pushing a wheelchair saying the chair i asked for is here. I didnt ask for a wheelchair and at that time in the morning you would feel they would make sure they were at the right room.

Overall I would summarise the hotel as hit and miss. Room is amazing (apart from the heat), bed really conformable, the initial welcome top class and the location for what i needed was great.
Downside the staff seemed to half care and didnt follow up when they said they would. They do need to fix or sort out the air conditioning and be able to open windows!",3,2023,04,22
122,Amazing Hotel,"We had an amazing time at Chelsea Harbour over the weekend.
The suite we had was over looking the Marina with a nice balcony where you could sit and watch the world go by.
Every team member were fantastic and went way and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable.
Take in the spa where again you can relax and chill out.
We had such a great time we extended  our stay by 1 night.
Enjoyed the hotel so much returning in May to share the experience with a family member.

122,Real people,Heartfelt thanks to Lloyd and Fahad who were gracious enough to take care of me when I was not feeling well and to the FB manager that provided simple remedy to full recovery.

122,3 day Business Event,"I wanted to reach out to extend my thanks for a superb 3 days spent at Chelsea Harbour Hotel this week.  The team and I were thrilled with the 
location and we were very happy that we were able to contract our event to you.
 
I must say that the food was incredible.  A wonderful variety every day, catering for the specific dietary needs of our attendees, it really was super.  And I have to pay credit to Chris, Alex and Sam who supported us on a daily basis.  Chris was superb!  We had a run through each morning to clarify timings and everything ran like clockwork from your side, it was our meetings that over-ran, but nothing was too much trouble for Chris and the team who remained completely flexible.  Alex & Sam were extremely attentive to our attendees and always ensured the room was refreshed at each scheduled break throughout each day, for which we were extremely grateful.
 
I really do hope we will be able to visit you again soon.  Please do pass on my thanks to all the staff and the general Manager for a really successful event.  Other supporting members of the team were: 
 
Marco Grasso – Head of Events
Rushena Pineda – Meeting & Events Sales Manager
Adrain Piele - Head-Concierge
 
Many thanks and I look forward to connecting with you again soon.

122,Amazing hotel and staff,"We spent two nights at the Chelsea harbour hotel, two adults and one nine year old daughter, we cannot praise this hotel enough. Looking at some of the other reviews we did have some concerns, glad we ignored them because we would have missed one of the best hotels we have ever stopped at.
From the moment we arrived the staff made us very welcome with the valet parking the car after helping unpack. The room we booked was one of the smaller suites on offer but consisted of two really good sized rooms with two WCs meaning our daughter could have a room completely to herself without disturbing Mum and Dad. These rooms were clean on arrival with a great view of the small marina with a balcony overlooking. The Spa and pool were just right and we imagine would normally be quieter outside of school holidays. 
The food that was served in the restaurant was really well presented and cooked perfectly, choice could have been larger but unless you stayed for longer than five days it would not be an issue.Breakfast is buffet style and had a good choice of continental and full food. The restaurant manager,Mihai, was a great host and one of the nicest people you could meet. I also want to say how professional Gillian was at the desk and everyone else without exception who i didnt manage to get their names. Through work I stop at a large number of various hotels and I would put this hotel at the top of the list of ones visited. We will be back, hopefully in the near future.",5,2023,04,14
122,Great place to stay away from the crowds of Central London,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights during spring break. Our suite was very spacious and perfect for us and our 18 year old daughter - we really liked having a separate living area and 2 bathrooms. The amenities were super nice - my husband loved the pool and the sauna, I appreciated the fitness center and the breakfast was terrific. We also went for Afternoon tea and it was a very enjoyable experience. And the staff was super super nice, friendly and helpful",5,2023,04,13
122,Update your website as no “kids” timing,"Stayed over Easter weekend. Arrived early to hotel so left suitcase with hotel staff and left. 

Upon check in we have been given zero info by receptionist Bianca  just handed our key card and told us what floor to go to. 

So as we had 7 year old daughter and chose this hotel especially because of the swimming pool I asked how to go to swimming pool. 

Well we have learned that kids swimming pool is shut at 5 pm. We got back to hotel 20 minutes to 5 pm so sadly I said to my daughter that we cannot use it today but tomorrow morning we can and I asked what time it’s open next day and she said at 8 am.

Oh well I set alarm for 7 am to get ready etc my daughter was like really pumped up to go for swim so after looking for second lift to spa (we stayed on 7th floor which is under renovation and part for the second lift is no accessible) again haven’t been told upon check in. So had to go level down to find another lift and finally arrived to spa. 

The reception was empty so as I am looking around the receptionist was there in other room so I asked if we can use the pool and she told me that “kids” swimming pool is open from 8:30!  I am like what ! We have been told from 8 am also on website there is nothing about kids restrictions or I could not find it. 

Well from this point I was really disappointed so return to the room and had to deal with crying daughter as we had some other stuff planned for the day but eventually had to cancel and go back for swim as that what she was looking forward to. 

Also there is no “kids” swimming pool it’s only one pool so really don’t see the point that kids can not use it from 8 am I mean is there any swimming lessons going on that time ? Why kids can not go from 8 am but can go from 8:30 just to be around adults swimming lines anyway? Can someone explain that to me ? 

Other than that breakfast staff was really 5star and make our experience bit better after this disappointment. Especially the one who brought us coco pops but overheard my daughter that she wanted Rice Krispies, but i didn’t catch his name. ",2,2023,04,09
122,Lovely staff and facilities,"Great room, views and facilities. Easy to get places & staff lovely. Here 4 days midweek with 14 year old son and chosen because of pool, sauna and steam room. He described the hotel as ‘Bangin’ Which means very good. We had a lovely time and although expensive (for us) it was worth it. ",5,2023,04,06
122,All positive,"Judging by the mixed reviews, I guess that the overall experience depends very much on when you stay. For us, the experience was excellent, from check-in to check out.

We stayed for two nights in a Marina view suite, which was lovely. Breakfast was also very good, with the cooked option being served at the table on day 1, but buffet style on day 2. Due to the weather, we decided to dine in the hotel restaurant on both nights, and the food was delicious, especially the halibut.

Every single member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to assist us.

The hotel wasn’t especially busy, so maybe that’s why we didn’t experience any negatives, but based on our stay, I would definitely recommend it.",5,2023,04,06
122,"Never stay here, dreadful experience, should never be 5 star.","Before you read this read some of my other reviews, I believe I am fair and more likely to sing praise than complain. BUT.......this hotel does not come out of this review well. Before we even arrived at this so called five star hotel we were chased twice for an arrival time. Odd, It is a hotel, we are paying guests. We will arrive when we get there, we arrived at a perfectly acceptable 1800 hours, this next bit was not the hotels fault but they allowed them there, Chelsea football club were staying and just leaving for a game. several dozen fans in two groups gathered in areas both inside and out. Not an issue. We were ushered in to the foyer.  As we waited to check in (more on this) we were asked twice why were there, we are waiting to check in. They clearly wanted us out of the way of the footballers. We FINALLY got to the desk and went to check in. It took forever, it should be SO easy, here is our booking, oh ok thank you, welcome, you are in room XYZ the lifts are over there and here are your fobs, I have no idea what she was typing, War and Peace. Utterly insane. We finally got to the room and it was like an oven, the décor was tired and we have stayed in cleaner rooms in much cheaper hotels. We decided to eat at the hotel, very slow service, I mean really really slow, for us and many other guests, we heard one lady say she had waited an hour for a lemonade, another lady ask if they had gone to press the grapes for her wine, two guys next to us had to chase the bill twice, they were in a rush as going to the football, see earlier.  Then in an area with loads of tables they sat a couple right next door to us and took thirty mins before they even got a drink. We eventually ate while the staff ignored customers and chatted, We went for a walk around the harbour. I remember when it was new in the early 90s, now it is very grotty, harbour full of dirty boats looking like they need some love. We retired to our room and went to have a coffee, a nice machine that did not work, only two tiny pots of UHT milk, this is a five star hotel remember. I manage to fix the machine. but nowhere near enough. We did not bother to ring down as we wanted to go to bed and not wait an hour for more coffee. We slept ok and the room was quiet no noise in or out.  Before breakfast we went for a swim with our well behaved son (15)  when we eventually got to the basement in a maize of lifts and stairs the rather grumpy lady told us children were not allowed at this time but it would be ok today! Thanks. Back up for breakfast and the lady who greeted us was great. Friendly and warm, she should teach the others a thing or two. Breakfast was lovely, the scrabbled egg should get a special mention. Back to our room, then to check out, two guys in front of us checking out with one lady dealing with them. A man who introduced himself as 'Adrian'  He said 'what do you need?' 'Just need to check out' he said ''I am the concierge I cannot do that'  I stopped myself from replying 'if you are the concierge you should be able to do everything'' The guys checking out were complaining too. The the phone rang and ''Adrian'' who was doing nothing answered it after his colleague said 'oh it is the Penthouse' I got the impression he was not going to answer it otherwise.  All in all a very disappointing experience. Off hand staff, rooms not clean, no coffee, terrible slow staff and Adrian I don't do anything on reception. The final disgrace and trolley full of chicken bones from someone's room service left in the corridor all night and still there when we checked out been there eight hours. How unpleasant to walk past",2,2023,04,05
122,5 star definitely not yet 5 star pricing.,"I arrived for 3pm check in but room wasn’t ready, receptionist said “take a seat” (none available as lobby seats all taken) but lady said “10 minutes then I will come & get you”

Now I’m not young so standing there for an hour I found draining, eventually as I saw many booking in I returned to reception & I could tell by the same receptionist she had forgotten about me.

Hotel needs a fair bit of tlc, even coffee table in lobby is badly chipped as was the one in my room, the wooden surround on bed was the same & furniture with quite a few scratches & chips. Carpets not dirty but need replacing (see photos)

Breakfast, I was there for opening as had to get away early but the ‘hot buffet’ wasn’t hot other than the sausages….scrambled egg, beans, bacon, mushrooms were luke warm & same with the coffee in fact coffee was moving towards cold let alone before adding cold milk. Come on get the basics right.

Now this is a 5 star hotel, maybe it was back in the day. I’ve stayed in a few London Millennium hotels of late & they are not what they were, Stamford Bridge again needs updating, The Gloucester nigh on every night is plagued with dodgy fire alarms (see reviews) 

I’ve already got Millennium Baileys hotel booked in few weeks so I’ll see how they do but as it stands I won’t be using Millennium hotels again, Chelsea Harbour just look at the room rates, eye watering.  I needed to be in this location but really to charge 5 star pricing for a 3 star hotel then think again Millennium.

On the upside room was clean & staff throughout friendly.

122,"Avoid this hotel, bad staff attitude and service.","Please avoid this hotel. This hotel is not cheap, I wouldn't want other people to spend their hard earned money to receive the issues I had. This was a view shared by many other people staying at the hotel, the same weekend as me. 

We all spoke around the bar area and reception whilst receiving bad service. The staff have bad attitude and there were multiple issues with my stay. What adds insult to injury is that I have spoken with managers of the hotel and their attempt to put things right, was poor and further elaborates on how bad this hotel is and the attitude of the staff.

Read through the reviews on trip advisor and google. There are multiple occurrences of this service i received. This is not a one off.

There was initial confusion with what my booking actually contained, several emails back and forth. No apology for the confusion and time spent. I had to argue my case of what had been advertised on the website and was included.

Our room was not ready till 2 hours post check in time. We were sat around in bar area for 3 hours, meanwhile paying for drinks, just waiting for our room. We had to reschedule our dinner reservation because of this issue. Furthermore, we could not enjoy the view that I had paid additional for.

I was served a dirty plate in the bar area.

Staff in the bar, restaurant area did not clear our table, they were extremely slow to do this.

The attitude of staff in multiple departments was appalling. Laughing and shrugging shoulders when politely asked queries, which were not unreasonable.

I witnessed staff aggressively handling a customers luggage.

We witnessed a member of staff laughing behind a customers back after they had an altercation, about this customers room also not being ready.

Dinner at the restaurant, when we were the only one's dining, took an hour to be served. 

The air conditioning in our room was broken, it failed to cool the room.

We had a sleepless night due to having to sleep with the balcony doors open.

All this happened whilst being on this hotels site for not even 24 hours. Do yourself a favour and avoid. Its no where near worth the money they are charging. The bad attitude of the staff really is shocking.",1,2023,04,03
122,Good location close to the river,"Excellent location close to the Thames towpath with easy access into Central London from nearby Imperial Wharf station. The rooms are spacious particularly the rooms overlooking the river. Fifteen minutes walk to Stamford Bridge stadium.

122,Really friendly welcome and great customer service,This is the second time we have stayed here - it’s a great location and the room was large and comfortable. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel really welcome - a special shout out for Oli on the front desk who checked us in - he was so friendly and accommodating and  took the time to chat with us and our 8 year old son to make sure we were all settled in and had everything we needed - he definitely went above and beyond to make sure our stay was special so thank you very much!,5,2023,04,01
122,Stay,"Staff super nice and caring, especially the lovely concierge Luz! Super helpful and kind, she really cared and provided a lovely service! 
The breakfast was also lovely, buffet style but with a lot of savory choice !",5,2023,03,26
122,Spa day with my daughter ,Me and my daughter had a fantastic experience at the spa and then light lunch after treated very well and nice and clean would definitely recommend to anyone thanks once again hopefully will be back again real soon x,5,2023,03,26
122,Broken ventilation system,"Hotel is dated, but has large spacious rooms. Our stay was ruined because the room ventilation would only blow very hot air. The room was very hot, we informed the receptionist who sent a engineer who spent 1min with the thermostat and said all he can do is open the window. It felt like this has happened before. Room took about 2 hours to cool down. Kids were not able to sleep until mid night. We did not want to make a fuss as kids were tired after a busy day and were already in bed. At 6 30am we were woken up to the noise of all the flights landing. I feel they knowingly put us on a room with a broken ventilation system. Rest of the hotel was acceptable as a 3 star hotel.
Very poor value for money",2,2023,03,26
122,Restaurant staff and meal was amazing,"We had a great time at the restaurant, we were well cared for, staff were polite and professionals as well, the food was amazing and the children enjoyed every bit of their time in the building, I should come back to visit ",5,2023,03,25

122,Fabulous in every way,We arrived at the hotel in the pouring rain after a challenging journey from King's Cross due to the tube strike. From the minute we arrived the stressful day was forgotten. The reception staff were so kind and welcoming. The charismatic Oli cheered us up immediately. Our suite was stunning with a fabulous view over Chelsea Harbour. The beds were so comfy with the most gorgeous pillows. Breakfast was lovely. A big thank you for a lovely few days. We look forward to returning later in the year. Oh and I must be impressed because this is the first time  I have written a review! ,5,2023,03,21
122,Relaxing welcoming atmosphere,"Relaxing atmosphere, great friendly staff, and nice view of the harbour especially at night with it all lit up. Loved the drinks in the evening at the bar. Beds comfy and clean bedroom/bathroom. Will be back",5,2023,03,21
122,I wouldn’t stay here again if they paid me too,"Our stay was an absolute embarrassing catalogue of errors from the start. 

We arrived at 3pm to check in and were told our room wasn’t ready and we would need to wait for 10 minutes. I waited 20 minutes and queued up again to be told it was ready but now needed to be inspected so could I hold on for a few more minutes. I did this and queued again when the receptionist rang someone again and requested the room be inspected again! 

The receptionist then gave me a drinks voucher and assured me after we had a drink it would be ready, so we returned at 4pm to be told it still hadn’t been inspected but he would let us go to the room and leave our bags there. When we entered the room it was far from ready, pillows all over the floor draws open and bins not emptied. 

We returned at 9pm to see the room was still not ready and there was only one double bed in the room and no beds for the children. 

I rang reception and he assured me he would sort this but I heard nothing so I went down to reception at 9.20pm to be told their booking system showed only 2 people were on the booking despite me showing him clearly on our booking that it was for 2 adults and 2 children. He then told me there was nothing he could do! Eventually after several calls and requests single fold up bed was provided.

I absolutely understand that mistakes can happen but all I was asking for was a bed or two for my children to sleep in! Not that unreasonable a request for a 5 star hotel I thought…

This was a special surprise for our sons birthday and it had been completely ruined. We had been looking forward to this surprise for months and it was the worst experience we’ve ever had in any hotel around the world. 

I tried at the time to find a resolution and have had contact with the original booking site aswell as the hotel management but they were happy that their ‘service agreement was done’ by offering a Diet Coke and an orange juice. 

I’m still waiting for the refund on the extortionate car parking fee that was offered too! 

By the way the actual hotel is lovely and the breakfast was delicious, just a shame about the customer service",1,2023,03,20
122,Amazing stay!,"Had the most relaxing and best time in London at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel! Very friendly staff and amazing food.

The rooms were well maintained and everyone was amazing . I will definitely visit again for my business trips 👏",5,2023,03,12
122,Ms black,"GREAT HOTEL  
Me and my son were attending a wedding since my son is not living in London we choose to stay the nearest hotel to the event, surprisingly the best choice we made 
Amazing place, amazing experience and reasonable price  very friendly staff exceptional location absolutely scrumptious breakfast we definitely coming back !",5,2023,03,12
122,Wonderful staff,"Just stayed last weekend in the spa to treat my wife, what a wonderful and relaxing experience. Thank you to all exquisite staff from me and my wife . We will be back soon with a couple of friends. We absolutely recommend for a short weekend break",5,2023,03,10
122,Amazing hotel,"Excellent hotel, I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff are great, the breakfast was phenomenal and the facilities were amazing. I would definitely recommend this hotel. I look forward to staying here again. 

Thanks,

Malik",5,2023,03,10
122,Mr. Copercini,"I was given an excellent service from the breakfast team and very personalised attention from the bar crew.
The room was very clean and had a comfortable bed which made my sleep very relaxing.
Next time I have business in London I will stay with them.",5,2023,03,09
122,Weekend Stay,"Nice suite, very comfortable.
Coffee / tea. Not much milk. Asked for more the second night and got double the coffee and the same milk.
TV would not receive terrestrial channels, Sky only.
Long wait for fresh hot food at breakfast ",4,2023,03,07
122,Well done,"A very nice experience ,all staff were amazing but a special mention to Noura and Claude for extra care and attention.  They both went above and beyond to serve us . The setting upon the river is special and it is a quiet oasis in a busy city ( except on Match days )(Chelsea) . The staff at reception are most helpful in meeting any request especially as this Hotel is a little away from the underground links to the city ...but they make every effort to get you there.",5,2023,03,06
122,Not remotely a 5* hotel,"Pretty poor experience. Arrived 45 mins late ourselves, having bothered to complete a pre-arrival form stating our planned check in time, only to be told our room wasn’t ready. As an apology we were offered a complementary drink, only to be told we could only use that on house wine or beer. My husband and I didn’t want to drink either and offered to pay the difference for our preferred drink, only to be told no. We were sent back and forth between bar and reception and eventually served the drinks we wanted. When we finally went up to our room, supposedly a 5* luxury suite, it was very tired and dated. The balcony is crumbling and filthy, the light in the bathroom hanging down, and the sofa had rather grotesque stains. The television didn’t work only showing a few channels and then stating “poor signal” for most. The breakfast was quite nice at least and the waiting staff were helpful and polite. We went to the pool area, which was ok but again, not quite the standard we would have hoped for in a 5* spa facility. It is very dated and in desperate need of a deep clean and redecoration. 

All in all a big disappointment consisting this was supposed to be a special occasion for us. ",2,2023,03,05
122,Certainly wouldn’t stay again,"The suit was a good size and the view of the harbour was very nice. The main bed was comfortable and the room had everything you could need (other then a cot)

The carpet was stained, the mirror in the
bathroom cracked.
there was very little in the way of acoustic insulation so could hear the next room and people closing doors and talking at the other end of the corridor.
This was a major issue and both myself and our toddler were awaken by noise number of times during the night.
the sofa bed was absolutely the worst thing I have ever slept on it arched in the middle and I would have been better off sleeping on the floor (if it wasn't so stained)
service was also poor, we asked for a cot for our 2yo, instead they put out the sofa bed. We asked for one to be brought up while we were out for dinner but that never happened, I had to go downstairs to reception twice over 40 minutes when we returned to chase it up while our toddler slept on my wife's lap.",2,2023,03,04
122,Chelsea Harbour hotel.,"First and foremost, would like to give a special mention to Mo ( front desk manager) who offered us a beautiful suite for our stay. 
Everyone from the doorman, reception were very warming and welcoming. 
The quality of the breakfast was served to the highest standard. 
The cleanliness of the room was immaculate daily. 
The stay included a visit to the gym , steam and sauna and pool.  
In conclusion, would definitely come back and highly recommendable.",5,2023,03,03
122,Premium hotel,"Amazing hôtel with high professionnal staff .Baby friendly .Good food and drinks .Nice Harbour view from the room. Easy to go in the center of London and Heathrow AirPort.
Highly recommended 
You will enjoy it",5,2023,02,26
122,Weekend stay,"Loved this hotel - friendly helpful staff, beautiful views of the harbour and boats, large rooms and lovely pool and sauna - walkable to the 606 jazz club Fulham Road and kings Road but also quiet and relaxing. Will definitely stay again. It’s one of my favourite hotels in London now, perfect mix of relaxing but stylish enough too",5,2023,02,26
122,Amazing hotel,"Very good customer service, felt very welcomed, room was a good size,  view was amazing, pool and the gym were a decent size and the food was spectacular too, definitely would consider coming back here again ",5,2023,02,24
122,Excellent!,"A beautiful hotel with stunning views, from the harbour to the Thames and London skyline beyond.
An oasis of calm after a busy day in London City center.
Imperial Wharf station is literally around the corner.
The staff were all fantastic, so very very helpful with every request.
My daughter celebrated her 15th birthday, they had balloons on her bed, beautiful heart shaped cheesecakes and chocolate covered strawberries, a birthday card and a box of chocolates in a gift bag when we arrived back after a day out.
The breakfast was great with a wide variety of food on offer. Nespresso coffee machine, kettle and fridge in room, with lots of different and coffee pods.
I was almost put off by some of the negative reviews, but am so glad I booked here.
I would highly recommend the Chelsea Harbour, and will definitely return again !",5,2023,02,20
122,Nice stay,"We stayed at this hotel last night and enjoyed our stay made even better by the Chelsea fc team exiting just as we arrived. Our room was big we had a suite with balcony. Few things where it could improve - I’ve never stayed in a 5 star before that does not offer room service, we sat in the bar for a while and ordered drinks much to our surprise the menu did not include VAT so the drinks were actually slightly more expensive than they already were. We were charged £63 for 2 breakfasts which we thought was a bit steep. Balcony had cigarettes from previous people on it still and I think the balcony could have done with a clean. But overall we will definitely go back and stay again",4,2023,02,19
122,The 80s are calling and they want their hotel back.,"Nice enough hotel, good sized rooms and amenities. However the hotel was built in 86-87 and I’m not sure it has been updated since. It is now more of a 3* at best, the decor is tired and needs some serious attention. Things like the carpets need replacing. The staff are for the most part very nice however not many of them speak English. The children’s bed was falling apart and missing most of the springs",3,2023,02,19
122,Comfortable Stay!,We only stayed for one night but it was very nice to escape the nuisance noise of the city center. The room had a fantastic view facing the Marina. Breakfast was also very nice with plenty of choices from the buffet and all staff were friendly and always available to help for our needs.,5,2023,02,17
122,Not 5 star,"The staff were very friendly in arrival. The room was comfortable, but my toilet would not flush. When I called room service the lady on the other end of the phone did not speak English very well and it was frustrating to order one item. At breakfast it took forever to order 1 piece of toast and it eventually came 25 minutes later. There were no glasses at the juice station so had to ask for those.  When my coffee arrived at my table no teaspoon was given so I had to search for that on my own as no staff on restaurant floor to ask. I expected better service at this hotel!",1,2023,02,16
122,Outstanding service !,"This was a last minute booking ,we had such a lovely stay .Luz on reception is absolutely delightful and  could not do any more to help .
Thank you so much ,you have a great team of staff and we would definitely recommend.",5,2023,02,16
122,"Great stay, amazing views and location!","Great stay in this hotel for a long weekend break with my wife and 9 month baby. Great facilities and the location couldn’t be better! 
We were disappointed at first that the baby cot had no mattress, however, the hotel staff worked very hard to resolve this. A special mention to Jey who worked tirelessly by arranging a special mattress for the baby and upgraded our room to make up for the hassle! Would definitely stay again.",5,2023,02,15
122,Lovely San Valentine's day,"A very lovely moment and relaxing with my couple.  We enjoy a good San Valentine. We enjoy a good lunch at the restaurant around 4: 00 pm the kitchen is open all day. Also, we enjoy that access to spa, pool and sauna was wonderful and also very relaxing the room very clean and had big spaces. Real we had a great Valentine's day.",5,2023,02,15
122,Excellent quality of service by Noura,"A lovely Sunday morning walk ended with finding this gem of a hotel bar terrace which overlooks Chelsea Marina.

Our quiet drink was made even better due to the brilliant service, close attention and positive attitude of our server Noura, which have cemented the Chelsea Harbour Hotel on our 'must come back' list. Thank you!",5,2023,02,12
122,A memorable stay!!,"From booking the room to checking out, our experience was impeccable. It was my birthday and the attention to detail from all those involved with our stay was outstanding. I will be back and can absolutely recommend. Thank you everyone who made my birthday memorable ❤️",5,2023,02,08
122,Beautiful views,"Spacious rooms offering beautiful views over the marina. Nice, good size pool. The best thing about the hotel is its location. The hotel requires a refurbishment though. It’s old and it shows. Staff very unfriendly, from receptionists to restaurant staff. No room service was disappointing.",3,2023,02,06
122,Warm welcoming staff,"We stayed for 2 nights. We were going to the Chelsea football as a 18th birhday present for my son. We booked the hotel as we needed parking, ( train strke). The hotel we amazing, accomadating our travel arragments and even upgrading our room as a gesture for my sons birthday.
Hotel was beutifully turned out was clean and staff we accomadating.
A big mention to the front of house staff and conciergie staff who were so friendly and always had the time to chat and help with anything, actually made our stay.
Would love to go back very soon, a wonderfull hotel,staff and facilities.

122,Definitely stay at the Chelsea which is as wonderful experience ,"First of all, before we arrived, o let Chelsea Harbour hotel know that our stay was a special 60th birthday stay and they came back to say there was a surprise in-store.  On arrival, porters greeted us like royality into the amazing foyer to check in. The check in staff upgraded us up to a suite as this was my surprise. Oh wow. Porter took our luggage to our room where yes indeed was a suite. Laid out on the lounge table was a box of chocolates and cake with balloons on settee and confetti sprinkled over table and also there was a happy birthday message to me. The room was immaculate with a large bed to die for and the pillows all puffed up and soft. Had a balcony which overlooked the Chelsea Harbour. They even managed an amazing sun rise from our 716 floor suite. Lol.  All the staff were very polite and really genuine friendly.  We had lunch at the bar where the food was georgous. The surroundings in the lounge made you feel really special as was decked out with a grand piano and beautiful hanging star chandeliers.  We experienced the warm swimming pool at the hotel spa and the gym.  Our room was made up every morning with new clean sheets. The staff made our stay but especially my birthday a very memorable one.

122,A hidden little gem! ,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is local to me. I have visited the hotel on many occasions, mainly the bar and restaurant.
I was surprise to read so many negative feedbacks.
I went to the bar today to meet friends for coffee. 
On this occasion, as during all my previous visits, as soon as I entered the hotel, I was greeted by friendly, smiling, professional employees.
The service I received from the riverside brasserie members of staff was excellent. The coffee was very good. 
The view overlooking the harbour is very relaxing and has a holiday feel to it.
I can heartily recommend this hotel, and it's facilities. 
Thank you, everyone.
",5,2023,01,13
122,Nice stay at a great hotel,"Really great hotel. We stayed here for two nights hoping to catch the New Years fireworks. On recommendation we booked the River View suite as it’s on the higher floors. We had the best view in the house!! And not just of the fireworks. It was fantastic.

The hotel was also great. Rooms spacious and clean. Dreadful smell came up from the shower, but we covered it over. The room was also very hot, a common problem these days it seems. 

The staff were really great, shout out to Oli on the front desk. Everyone at reception seemed happy and willing to help. Staff at breakfast were great too. Breakfast choice was good, cooked buffet kept fresh, and good choice of drinks. My cappuccino was good, and the lovely lady insisted on bringing our boys hot chocolate. I didn’t catch her name (curly hair) but she was really sweet. 

Thanks a lot guys.",4,2023,01,06
122,Lovely New Year Break,"We enjoyed a throughly lovely New Year Break at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and enjoyed the NYE Fritework Show with a splendid view of the London Eye from our balcony. There was a mix up on checking in which was the fault of central reservations not passing booking requests but the Reception Staff sorted this out amicably. In fact all of the staff from concierge staff to waiting staff were friendly and professional and made us feel at home. We stayed for 3 nights - the breakfasts were excellent and the bar snacks and cocktails we enjoyed were also lovely. I’ve been staying here for over 20 years with various owners and Millenium do a good job overall but perhaps the place needs a bit of a refurb as the rooms, though spacious are more 4* than 5*. That said the staff make this a very pleasnet hotel to stay at. ",5,2023,01,05
122,"Great location for a hotel, pretty harbour and walk just past it for a great river view.","Great location. Clean room but bathroom a little frayed in places, perhaps due a refurb soonish (?).   Friendly staff, made my husband's day to hear Chelsea Football Club members stay there sometimes!  We had a free upgrade to a suite which was great, loads of room and such a comfy huge bed.   We went to the bar for a drink in the evening, but the bar was too chilly to stay in for too long - that was a slight letdown.  Hint for other people staying and needing to go into other parts of London - try the Uber river bus just beyond the harbour or grab a taxi to the nearest tube station",4,2023,01,01
122,Shocking service start to finish. Use to be 5 star now 4 at best I’d say,"Chelsea Harbour Hotel

Arrived Tue 25th Oct 22
- [ ] Began receiving text messages to complete check in online to speed things up so I did this on the day including card details where a small charge was made to card.
- [ ] Arrived 3:30pm and when I explained I’d checked in online as requested and just needed room keys was told ‘yes sorry we still need to do paperwork’ the whole check in process had to be done again including being asked for a card payment (another small charge). Again I pointed out I’d already done this but to no avail. The cost of being charged £1 twice isn’t the issue it’s the principle of having our time wasted to complete a process that clearly doesn’t work. 
- [ ] At check in we were asked if we’d like the sofa bed to be made up (for our 5 yr old) as it would be easier than putting another bed in. Completely agreed and we were told someone would come and do it. 
- [ ] The room was as expected (we had a balcony suite) however the main bedroom was freezing cold. I adjusted the temp thermostat in there and we got ready to head out. We arrived back around 7pm as our son was very tired from travelling all day and no one had been to sort the sofa bed. I went to put the TV on for him and found that wasn’t working (wouldn’t switch on). Room was also very cold still and realised thermostat wasn’t working so just switched it off completely. I went to reception and mentioned that we needed the sofa bed sorting (would have done it myself but no bedding) and the TV’s in both rooms not working and the heating not working. We waited about an hour for someone to come with bedding and mentioned to him about the TV’s and temp. He couldn’t figure those out so said he’d send maintenance. No one came but it was getting late so went to bed.
- [ ] In the morning we left for a full day around London. On way out around 9am again I reported No TV’s , heating etc. I was told I should have reported it earlier and when I explained I did they apologised and said that they would get it sorted and if they couldn’t would move us rooms. We arrived back late at 9:30pm and asked at reception (like I’d been told to do) if we were still in the same room. They had no clue what I was talking about so had to explain it all again and I was told to go check the room and see. Walked in the room and TV’s were on so that had been sorted and heating unit was just off (not sorted). By now wasn’t fussed about the heating as tired and our son had gone straight to sleep.
- [ ] 11:15pm as we are going to sleep doorbell constantly rings waking our son up and then maintenance let themselves in our front door saying they had come to fix heating!! Told to go away as our son was asleep and it was ridiculous to come at that time.
- [ ] Thursday morning breakfast. For the second day running asked about payment for our breakfast and had to explain it was included with our suite. Response was ok take a seat for now and we’ll check (a small issue but worth noting as we were made to feel like we were trying to get a ‘Free’ breakfast). 
- [ ] Asked for coffee, tea and 2 lots of toast. The waitress asked white or brown and we asked for white. 25 minutes past (nearly finishing breakfast) and our drinks finally arrived. Another 10 minutes past (now just finished) and 1 round of brown toast arrived. I explained we asked for White and I was asked if I’d like it changing (of course as it’s not what I ordered and you try getting a 5 yr old to eat brown toast). Sat for another 15 minutes and watched other people get drinks and toast before us who ordered after so we just left and headed out for the day. Our son had no toast just melon and some fruit and we got him breakfast in London.
- [ ] We left the hotel Thursday at 9:30am and returned at 6pm. Had 2 drinks in the bar and went to our room at 7:30pm. We walked in our room and it had not been made up at all. Beds un made, no fresh towels, no water. This is supposedly a 5 star hotel and by now the whole trip has been one thing wrong after another. All of a sudden at 8pm our doorbell goes and I answer and a gentleman asks me if everything is ok with the room (I actually thought is this some kind of joke). Clearly I said well no it’s not because it’s not been made up and the service is rubbish. He then says ‘oh well the day shift left a note saying they couldn’t get in the room as it was locked from the inside’. I pointed out they were lying as we had been out the room all day from 9am until 7:30pm and he looked at me and said ‘are you sure because they say it was locked’. I tried to keep my response polite but was fuming and told him that I wasn’t lying and that I’d be making a complaint when we checked out in the morning. He then asked if he could come and sort the room for us at that point and I refused as again it was too late, our son needed to get to bed and we’d had enough. 
- [ ] Friday morning, spent 30 minutes putting all of the above down instead of relaxing on our last morning of our trip. Very disappointed in this hotel and the frustrating thing is we stayed here 3 years ago and came back as previously it had been good.

I gave management the opportunity to address all this prior to review which they were provided in writing as they requested at checkout and they said they would recompense us a small percentage. 
2 months later we received a small recompense although again I had to pester them and was ignored several times. They tried to blame hotels.com for not issuing the refund but I have no faith that was the case and the manager again ignored correspondence from us when we asked them to sort it. 

The money wasn’t important but the terrible service , attitudes and procedures need highlighting and maybe they will sort their act out for future visitors.",1,2023,01,01

Thanks a lot . The Millennium and The Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa will be in my memories for ever 

Thanks 🤍",5,2022,12,30
122,Good but could be Great,"Stayed for 4 days over the holidays. Room was quite large , very pleasant, clean and most comfortable. The view over the boat basin and the city was tremendous and the balcony would be amazing during the summer. The location was a little removed from central London sites but is certainly a lot quieter, and the larger rooms are a good trade off. 15 - 20 pound cab to Westminster Abbey or 10 min walk to Fulham Broadway tube. The staff were friendly and attentive and the full English breakfast buffet was a great way to start the day. Overall this as a good experience.

It could have been better … usb power adapters would have been nice, the TV didn’t allow BBC, the toilet ran despite it being looked at and the afternoon tea was a master class in cluelessness…. A 2 1/2 debacle. 

Overall the extensive positives outweighed the negatives.",3,2022,12,30
122,Nice hotel and nice people.,"Fantastic hotel. Food was amazing. Great view of the London city from the hotel. This was my first time in this hotel which was recommended by a friend. But as lovely as the hotel is, I must mention, Nnamdi at the reception, who was extremely lovely and charming. He made my visit more interesting by suggesting places I could go around the area for sightseeing and also helped me with any issues. He truly went out of his way to make sure that my stay at the hotel was enjoyable. I was looked after, throughout.",5,2022,12,29
122,Very Nice Hotel - Great Location,Very nice hotel with beautiful rooms.  Staff was outstanding!!!  Can't say enough good things about the hotel and staff.  Really there to help.  Breakfasts were fantastic.  And evening bar was terrific with great selection of liquors!,5,2022,12,29
122,Nice Holiday Stay,"A friendly and very quiet hotel. Nice small suite overlooking the harbour. The rooms are a bit dated but more than comfortable. Very good breakfast with excellent service from Vera and especially Laura (?). 
The hotel is somewhat removed from public transport without a good walk to the King's Road and there were never any black cabs in the rank. But it was Christmas time.",5,2022,12,29
122,"Lacking customer service, mainly through training ","Lovely big suite. Comfy bed
A bit dated so don't spend too much for a room.
The shower was electric so not very hot, and I could not have a bath as there was NO hot water.
We did not suss out the AC - it seemed only to cool the rooms doen. 
The cooked breakfast was not worth having as it was poor quality, cold or wrong. The continental was ok, but we would have expected more from such a hotel.
Location to central London was ok if you don't mind walking (or getting a taxi) as the overground connection to Earls Court was iffy. It was easier to walk to EC then get the underground from there.
There were many new staff who did not seem to have had much training. Reception seemed unhappy to see customers. If you ask if you can leave your baggage, if you arrive early , they are happy to help. But it's a struggle to get it back without them ""bringing to your room"", for a tip ££ of course.
The pool was quiet so that was good. But the sauna and steam rooms are in the changing rooms, so I could not have one with my husband. Then I suppose, in London there are many different faiths and ideas on mixing 🙁.",3,2022,12,28
122,Not what it used to be,"Every year we have a tradition of taking the kids to Winter wonder land in London for a couple of days this also includes we book into one of Londons best hotels for the stay duration.Previous visits we have stayed at the Dorchester and Savoy but this year my wife chose the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for the main reason we had been before years earlier and found it really nice and had some great memory’s there also it had a pool which was a great hit within the kids at the time 

This time my wife booked the King suite penthouse room so we felt we where in for a treat as this is probably one on the best rooms in the hotel .

On arrival at the hotel we straight away realised it had changed there where no door men from previous visits to greet you and take your luggage and at the reception desk we got a Luke warm welcome ,it was the week before Christmas so the hotel had decorations up i must say they shouldn’t have bothered they where cheap and terrible no real effort the Christmas tree had wilted within an inch of its life pretty depressing if I’m honest also the whole feel of the place wasn’t the same from previous visits it looked old and run down even the smell of the place wasn’t too pleasant .

Before going up to our room we decided due to long trip we would have a drink at the bar due to the view of the harbour we asked if we could sit outside this was met with he would have to dry the tables and chairs and it felt like we where putting him out so we sat inside instead. 
Our table was dirty from previous people who had sat at it and the chairs where full of crumbs and mayo again from a previous person who must have just eaten there.
We ordered some food for the kids which was ok and we went up to our room 

I have one good thing to say about the room which was the view that was amazing. 

Everything other than than that really disappointed.

Upon entry the very first thing that set set the standard  was a skirting board that had been half arsed repaired and painted that i can only describe by a 6 year old child paint all the carpet all on the wall very shoddy .
The room was big and spacious with balcony’s looking out over the harbour ,Thames and London the door to the balcony was super stiff and hard to open
Again the whole feel of the room was dated and lack of repair stains all over carpets and furniture everything chipped or damaged a strange smell in the room and not a pleasant one .
The main bathroom smelt terrible stale water or even sewage smell really off putting the bath took ages to fill up the plug wasn’t attached to the chain and covered in hairs of previous guests the bathrooms as a whole we felt where dirty and lacked maintenance the shower head covered in that black mould  the tv in the bath remote didn’t work .

My wife ordered room service from a very rude member of staff not helpful bad attitude as much as she told him to forget it .

So we decided if the room and hotel was in this state then we would avoid the pool as that would probably also disappoint .

From past very fond memory’s of the Chelsea harbour when it used to be a great hotel something has gone seriously wrong from then to now its has gone down hill drastically and until that is sorted out sad to say we wont be going back.

One positive for the Hotel there was a lovely man at the front desk and front door i think his name was Adrian he was extremely helpful very kind and never stopped running round for guests he was a credit to the hotel",2,2022,12,27
122,Disappointment,Heating didint work (even thought we complaint twice no one did anything.) Room wasn't ready (ordered extra beds for kids but it wasn't there when we arrived. Only arranged 2. day) Not for families with young children. Agoda can't do much about it except offering 10% discount for next trip to the same hotel. Joke !!!,1,2022,12,25
122,Cold miserable,"Disgusting customer service on arrival. 
We spent a very cold night having to chase and haggle for some heat!  When we checked in at no point was I told there was no heating in my suit. We called reception  to enquire if we were operating it correctly thats when we were informed there was no heating. No milk no teaspoons. Our suit was a tired and  could do with an upgrade.",2,2022,12,23
122,"Poor service, dirty room, tired facilities, unhelpful staff. ","Room was tired,run down and dirty with large stains everywhere;shower seal was dirty and hanging off,bidet seal corroded; shower rail was not fixed; one of the curtain pulls was missing. Drawers on the main chest were kept closed by a chair and did not close again after we’d opened them;fridge was not working. We were told this was our fault because we had checked when the room wasn’t ready, which is not true as we had taken our room only after being told it was ready. After two inspections, pads were put under the legs of the chest of drawers as a temporary fix. We were promised free Internet in our suite, but it was not available;reception told it was our telephones’ fault, which was not correct, as our phones’ internet settings were all set to connect to the internet. In our room, our phones could only connect to a Millennium Hotels page needing an access code. We said we’d be happy to pay for the access code but reception told us they couldn’t call their HQ to get one on our behalf - we had to do that!  The Spa shower cubicle my wife used had two metal plates with metal prongs attached, which were not easily seen being the same colour as the tiles.  She knocked her upper arm against one of them, causing a bruise. She wanted to report this and complete an accident form, but when she returned to the spa, the door was locked. She knocked on the door, and the spa receptionist told her it was closed 3 days for renovations.There was no indication of this anywhere in the hotel. ",2,2022,12,22

122,Best nights sleep for ages,"I hadn’t stayed at the Chelsea Harbour for a few years, but it didn’t disappoint on this visit. Fabulous service from the moment I drove up to the concierge parking to the minute we left.
The staff were all courteous and only willing to help
The room itself was exactly what we wanted and the bed was the most comfortable we have slept in for some time.
And on our return they made my birthday more special with balloons and cake

The area is still being developed but in no way hinders your stay and by next year will be most attractive. The views out into the Harbour are wonderful especially when blessed with sun as we were.
The accommodation is very comfortable indeed with all rooms enjoying a living room and bedroom.

122,A pretty bad experience overall,"We checked in to the Chelsea to a pretty cold reception and it didn’t get any better from there. We went up to our room and started noticing how cheaply thrown together this place really is. For an all suites hotel that charges a pretty decent rate, we expected a lot more. The door to the toilet didn’t close, we had broken tiles in the bathroom and only about half our power outlets worked. From there we found a really uncomfortable and old couch in the sitting room, the tv in the bedroom worked about half the time and constantly turned itself off. The bed was so old and worn that you could feel the mattress supports below it and could not roll over without waking each other up. This truly was the worst hotel bed we have ever experienced. The carpets were old and very worn as well. Next was the breakfast at the on-site restaurant, which started late and was staffed by nobody that seemed to care about service, including the manager. When the gym was finally reopened half way through our stay we were definitely bothering the lady who ran it when we signed In. On our final night we asked for a wake up call so we could make our flight on time and they couldn’t even bother with that. All in all we were treated very poorly lie we were wasting everyone’s time",1,2022,12,11
122,Disappointing ,"Keys were given 1.5 hours after advertised 3pm check-in, drinks voucher was given but didn’t help as took time for our plans so had to rush.
Broken furnishings, worn room, didn’t feel clean enough, cold breakfast, checked out early.
Neither of us had experienced 5 stars before and this was worse than a budget hotel. So disappointed.
Emailed the hotel, their reply:
We would like to sincerely apologize over the inconvenience faced by you during your stay.

Kindly allow us to further investigate on the same and we will revert back to you at the earliest.

But no one ever responded… I see replies online about refurbishment, but the 5 star rating was advertised upon booking. Our experience was not 5 star.",1,2022,12,11

122,Overpriced. Would not recommend.,"We visited this hotel as a present for my mums birthday. The hotel were aware we had a booked a room for 3 people, but on arrival we had to ask for an extra bed and water for the room. 
They advertise themselves as a spa hotel- the sauna and steam room didnt work. The pool is average. 

Would not recommend and not worth the £360 a night we spent.",2,2022,11,22
122,Average hotel charging premium rates,"I had booked The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for its spa for a family weekend away for my Mum’s birthday. We arrived, three guests, to be given a room with one bed. We spoke to reception who requested an extra bed brought to our room. The porter brought the additional bed (on par with a wheelie hospital bed) and left us to sort it ourselves. The room itself was very nice, needed some updating but definitely not worth the £380 per night I paid.

However, the real disappointment for us was the spa - if you can call it a spa. On arrival at the spa, the member of staff informed us that the sauna was out of action. Unfortunately the only thing in action was a very dated pool. The steam room was also out of action and the general feel of the spa was it was in serious need of some TLC. 

Unfortunately, this hotel was a real disappointment and very overpriced for the service and hospitality you get.",3,2022,11,20
122,Arrived a week early…….,We booked through Secret Escapes but didn’t check the dates and arrived a week early. The reaction from Christina in reception was no problem we will sort it out for you. Less than half on hour and we were in our room. We don’t quite understand the mixed feedbacks for this hotel as we were 100% happy with our stay and all the staff we encountered were lovely. Would definitely stay again when visiting London.,5,2022,11,13
122,I cannot believe how downhill it has become.,"We are currently staying here and we are on our 3rd room. When we checked into our first room there were stains on the carpets and the floors had not been cleaned. I asked to be moved. There was no apology, and no-one even looked at my pictures. The room we were moved into was equally as filthy. When I asked again to be moved, there was no apology or explanation, I was simply told “This is it we will not be able to move you again”. What type of response is this? Added to that my 12 year old is in a wheelchair, so moving rooms was not easy and I was offered no help. I asked for the manager to call me, and he response was equally as unsupportive. We stay here as a bit of a treat as it is not cheap. I have never complained about a room and asked to be moved in all my years of travelling around the world. This will be my final time staying here. I am so shocked on how downhill it has become. I will spend the £300/night elsewhere.",1,2022,11,05

122,Terrible,The hotel has gone very downhill. The restaurent is closed on a Sunday and Monday which is bizarre at a so called ‘5 star’ hotel. The staff are lazy and the service is not good. It is a shame as it used to be much better and I hope they improve. ,1,2022,10,30
122,Very relaxing stay. ,"The hotel was very nice, the location is perfect, the staff are lovely. The food could be better, breakfast was limited however the service was excellent. The fridge was plugged out which was strange but we plugged it in ourselves. It was in an awkward position so this could have been taken care of before we arrived into the room. The window was faulty but after reporting this it was fixed immediately. Overall, the stay was very nice and the spa was extremely relaxing. Very high quality massage and clean swimming pool and steam room. The sauna was broken but this did not effect the overall experience. ",5,2022,10,29
122,FIASCO!!!!!,"Breakfast a fiasco, you have to lifer exceptionally heavy lids while balancing your pot etc to get luke warm food. The staff had to help me, by holding the lids. This system is a safety hazard. The management do not care, several gusted complained, only to get the same answer :we are trialing this method”….pathetic. At night, the alarm went off 3 times, we had to get out of our beds, we tried phone reception - phones were out of order - then we had  walk down the fire escape stairs (6 floors), to be told “sorry’ someone was swimming in their room. There is a lack of no smoking signs AKA none, and the emergency procedure is not detailed. Yes, let’s expect the manager to reply, and state: sorry, we will learn from your experience.

122,Not sure how this hotel is still 5 stars,"Not sure how this hotel is still 5 stars. 
We used to go to this hotel as a bit of luxury but this has now disappeared. 
We had a text the day before to check in. Not sure why we had this as we still had to wait to check in at the hotel. We used to like the iconic door men who were dressed up and would always  take our cases out of the boot and open doors for us. Always met with a smile. Those days have sadly gone. We didn’t even have the cases taken to the room as days of old we would have done. Not a big issue but is something about the old Chelsea harbour we loved. 
We did have Marcela who checked us in. She is very lovely. She deserves a good pat on the back and a lot of the staff could learn a thing or 2 from her about customer services.
We ate in the bar for our lunch had a club sandwich that had a chicken bone in it. Good job that wasn’t a child eating it. We did mention this but didn’t really get any reaction. For the price you pay you would really expect it to be perfect and not something that could potentially be a chocking hazard.  
We got into the TV had 5 working channels at best and none of them apart from one was an English speaking channel. As the night went on this decreased. Thankfully we took our Apple TV with us. The TV arial I had to mend as it was out laying on the side of the draws. 
The rooms are now very dated and could do with being updated. Carpets are stained and the sink in our room had a massive crack in it. 
The menus especially the room service ones need more information. I had the vegan burger but that’s all it said. No information as to what was in the burger. This again if you suffer from allergies could be very dangerous. I would like to see more vegetarian/vegan choices on there as well.  
The staff over all is very mixed with regards to customer services. The only other one I can think we needs a mention is the young lady who is behind the bar. I didn’t get her name but she was very friendly. 
The one thing post covid I think is better is the fridges in the room not having the mini bar in it. It meant that we could put drinks that we had brought in the fridge. I hope that doesn’t go back. 
The only other thing that would be good to see come back is having the breakfast menu’s in the rooms. 
Now to my biggest whinge of this review. The day before we were leaving we had a text and an email asking us what time we were leaving. I chose not to answer this because there wasn’t even a “hope you have had a good stay.” I can’t predict what time I was going to get up and get ready as I had until midday to check out. I found this rude and they need to stop this. If it had been a reminder that check out is midday that would have been much better then asking me what time I was leaving.
I don’t like leaving negative reviews and normally try and find something helpful to write in my review but sadly this time I can’t do that. I am still hoping this hotel can get back to its former glory. But I would defiantly not say this is 5 stars maybe at best a 4 star.",3,2022,10,22
122,"The most rude, unhelpful and indifferent staff I have ever encountered","I stayed solo at this hotel for 1 night on 1 October as I was running the London marathon the following day.  I had booked and prepaid for this back in August through Hotels.Com.  I arrived at the hotel a little earlier than check in time and wished to leave my bags.  Well, first impressions were that I must be invisible!  After standing for a while I caught the attention of the Concierge who glowered at me whilst continuing to talk on his mobile in a language I did not recognise.  He made hand signals only to me and roughly took my bag.  Returning to the hotel later to check in I found the lady uninterested and displaying zero customer service skills.  The rooms are tired and whilst I can see that this was probably a lovely hotel 20-25 years ago, it now looks dated and needs a whole refurb. I left the hotel before 7am to get to the race so handed my room card to 2 chaps who were sat at the check in area.  Upon returning home I was annoyed to discover that the hotel had charged me a second time for my stay and have literally spent hours on the phone (when someone actually answers!!!)  being passed around with each person saying they cannot help me or I have simply been cut off.  Eventually I spoke with Nevin? the Reservations Manager who assured me it would all be sorted and a refund processed but this never materialised even although he said he could see I had been charged twice. At one point I did speak to the very rude chap on concierge again whose manner was even worse - he really needs escalated onto an intensive customer care programme.  I've been left with no option other than to raise this with my credit card company as unauthorised use of my card and have it logged as a dispute.  Be careful with your card at this hotel.  No-one here cares about their guests.",1,2022,10,20
122,Great rooms and breakfast but woeful customer service,"We arrived on a Friday afternoon in October having already completed the online check-in as requested.  On arrival we were firstly informed the room type already booked and paid for was not available as Chelsea Football Club were staying overnight.
Not impressed with this as we are rugby fans and have no leaning towards football.  Eventually we were given a room which we are sure was the same as that already paid for.
The room itself was great with a balcony and spotlessly clean.  Rather oddly the next day the cleaning staff left clean spare pillowcases on our luggage?!  No complaints with the room at all.
Breakfast on both mornings was excellent both in food quality and service.
Customer service when we checked in asked to take a £1.00 deposit from our card in case of any extras bought.  On our return home we discovered they had not taken £1.00 but £470.40.  Telephoned the hotel - no reply.  Telephoned again and again with no reply - using the customer service and reception telephone lines.  
Eventually after many calls someone did answer and apologised that we had been wrongly debited and that the monies would be refunded.  This did eventually happen but after more unanswered phone calls and three working days later.
This hotel could be great but we will not be staying again when customer service is as woeful as this.",3,2022,10,20

The rooms are spacious, it’s very nice to have two separate rooms and it’s in a nice part of town. My biggest bug bear is that there really are no provisions for children whatsoever. They will give you a travel cot but good luck getting your child down in it. There is no kids menu. Nothing at all. So for supper I had to order my 5 year old an adult sized portion of fish and chips followed by a single scoop of ice cream, this came to over £30 and and she managed half of it. Why not just have a simple kids menu? It doesn’t need to be anything fancy. Just 4 or 5 small kids portions. Hell, you could even throw in a menu to colour in and a mini “harbour sundae”for dessert. It wouldn’t be hard. It would make staying here for families much easier.",3,2022,10,19
122,Great location and room with harbour side Views,"A contemporary spacious hotel and I had an incredible room overlooking the harbour with balcony. Well cleaned and comfortable.
Lovely location next to the Thames river pathway and seated garden areas.
A spa treatment with Masseuse Mimi was first class leaving me feeling completely relaxed and amazing at the end of my treatment. Mimi is a real gem. Breakfast staff member, Noura, stood out as being very courteous and professional. Nothing was too much during a very busy breakfast service and all with a genuine smile. 
Niggling spa locker facilities and hygiene could be better however staff are willing to do their best to put things right.",3,2022,10,19
122,Will not go again,"Sadly, I was very much let down with this hotel. There is good and bad so I will start with the good. I booked a suite with a balcony overlooking the harbour, it was a nice view and the rooms were spacious. Check in and out was easy. The location is good, just by the river and nice properties around. A bit too far to use the underground and they also did not have any maps for me. Beds were comfy and there was no outside noise. 

Now for the bad. There are a lot of little things that add up. I got an onlike check in form that I filled in, twice, but still did not seem to go thru. When I checked in, they told me it was useless and I should not have bothered. So I get up to the room, cant find a safety deposit box, they told me they would bring one up but never did. I go to wash my hands and there is no soap. They bring the soap up ( it went missing the next day and I never got another one,), go to take a shower and there is no shower gel. Then I see there is only one charging point and that is in the living room so I had to charge my phone there and get up when my alarm went off and walk into the other room. And it was not good to only be able to charge one thing at a time. They do give you free water but nothing else is in the mini bar, very unusual for a five star hotel. I had two twin beds but the night stand was so far from the bed I had to get out of my bed to have a drink of water. The cleaning staff puzzled me, they kept throwing away my half eaten snacks, I had not thrown them in the waste, just left them around but they were always gone. And they left their cleaning products and cleaning cloths in my room. The carpet was very filthy and stained, that I really did not like at all. The rooms are very dated, this place needs an upgrade in a big way. For the money I paid, and now very much regret, I could have had a much better hotel. Rules for parking I dont understand. Friends came to visit me and were told they could park for 20 pounds and that was a good deal since guests had to pay 100 per day. Another friend came to pick me up, was told she could not wait for me and had to park elsewhere, ( I was 2 minutes late) this was at night and no one in the parking area. The internet kept going out on me and this was annoying. Asked in the lobby on how to get to Stansted airport and the person had never heard of that airport!!! I googled it for him and he still said he had never heard of it. Very very odd.  

IN conclusion, this is not a bad hotel, if it was rated 3 star and with prices that went along with that but what I paid was far too much.      ",2,2022,10,18
122,"Not a five star experience, won't return","We stayed for a week at the Chelsea Harbor Hotel and our stay was more like a Monty Python skit than a five star retreat. Let me start with the good aspects. The suites are two rooms and very nicely sized. The bathtubs are glorious and the showers are very nice. The lobby and bar area are very spacious. I had a fabulous experience with one dining room person, Emi. She brought me tea in the bar early one morning and then surprised me with a croissant. Lovely and first class attention to a guest.

The issue started with our arrival. It was early in the day and the reception desk gave us the good news that she had a room for us. When we got to the room, the door was open and there was a painter, repainting the hall. We were so tired, we ignored the small of paint, the slightly dusty room and crawled into bed. When I mentioned this to the front desk person, she said she didn't know the room was being serviced. This was the first clue that service and communications was going to be central to our visit.

We got to the buffet breakfast about 15 minutes before they stopped service. We got asked to pay our bill before we got served our tea and coffee. We had to ask several times for any service. The buffet was okay but on the pricey side.

We asked the concierge  to book us a cab for a rather long ride and needed to leave at specific time. hence booking the cab the night before. When we came down, there was no cab. Finally we hailed one on the street. So much for help with transportation. The concierge also had no maps of the area; they had run out. We figured out where the tube was and how the Uber boat worked all on our own. 

It would have been great for a one page map that showed us where the public transportation was located and when they ran. The hotel is a bit far from everything touristy but accessible by public transport if you can figure it out. Why should guests have to figure it out themselves? Not five star service by any stretch of the imagination.

If you haven't heard enough, here's the coup de grace. We asked the front desk to have the bed made up in our living room for our daughter. We knew we would be back very late that night and she was joining us for the rest of the week. A staff person made up the bed, and brought us tea and missing wash clothes ( and a huge piles of towels). He was coming right back with a duvet to finish the bed. 

When we got home at 2 am, the bed was just a bottom sheet. We tried to call the front desk, no one answered (which was a continuing problem). We went down to get a blanket or duvet. The front desk person said he would have one brought to us. Twenty minutes later, we went back downstairs. He was still working on it. Then he showed up with a sheet. When we explained we needed a blanket, a duvet, he seemed very confused. Another 20 minutes later, he finally brought a duvet. We all went to bed. Another 20 minutes later, the door bell rang. The front desk person asked what we needed. For the fourth time we explained we needed a blanket. As I explained again, his colleague pushed a rollaway bed into the doorway. Now they had brought an entire bed. We just needed a blanket.

As a final note, at 8 am the next morning our phone rang, it was a person wanting to book a room. Somehow an external call had been sent to us. We suggested they should really think again about booking a room.

",1,2022,10,17
122,Mixed reviews,"I've stayed at this hotel twice in October. The rooms I've had have been really nicely laid out.  The only issue with the room was that it was freezing as the heating didn't work, I called down 3 times to see if I could get a portable heater or something but no one ever answered so I just slept in the bathrobe.
Check in second time was annoying because I already done it online via the text they sent but they took my card details again. Still haven't refunded me back though.
I think the service at breakfast could have been better as no one ever came to my table to offer tea/coffee. I kept having to get up and ask for simple things like hot drinks, spoons, toast (because its not out). I asked for soya milk for my tea and the waitress told me to go get the 1l bottle from the counter so I said please can I have a little jug like everyone else has, so she picked up the little jug of normal milk on my table...poured it out and told me to go fill that jug up...again I asked can I get a clean fresh jug of soya milk, I didn't understand why she couldn't do it so that was poor service.
The spa is poor, filled with kids, no jacuzzi and just wasn't a relaxing place.
I need to come to London again soon but not sure if I will stay here again now.",3,2022,10,12
122,Fraudulent and Poor Service,"I booked the hotel from 26-28 September via Expedia. On arrival, the receptionist was training so took a while to check us in. She asked for payment of the room despite telling her I had already paid for the room via Expedia. Her colleague came over to help and she proceeded to take a card payment for room charges. On check out I paid the additional charges incurred and left the hotel. I noticed an additional £319 had been taken out of my account so I contacted the hotel to ask why and they took ages to get back to me. They told me they will return my money that they fraudulently took out of my account and I have still not received it. The took this on the 28th September, it is now 11th October so I have been out of pocket since then because there staff are incompetent or scamming people. I have repeatedly asked for them to explain to me how they have taken money from my account when I had settled the payment and paid the room cost beforehand. I continue to get pathetic responses and still have not had my money that they fraudulently took out of my account without my knowledge so I’ve now reported it to the bank! 

On a side note, the room was freezing, heating barely worked, we asked for blankets bo one responded, so slept in bathrobes to keep us warm. Had to ask for toothpaste twice because no one could be bothered to come up and give it. There were no spoons for tea and coffee, we had to go down to ask for extra supplies in the middle of the night as they don’t even provide sufficient stock and the receptionist made excuses originally about accessing mugs/milk/tea/coffee because their room service was closed. Its a hotel, how can you not have access to such basic things? It is not a prestigious hotel, it’s run by amateurs, unprofessional and dishonest people. Avoid at all costs, you are better off staying in a travel lodge!",1,2022,10,11

122,Disappointing stay,"We booked a 2 night weekend stay and sadly the hotel was a disappointment. On arrival check in was easy however for me the biggest let down is the rooms . The decor was dated and did not represent those shown in photographs on the hotel website.  The tea and coffee tray was very poor had no tea which after a long journey was not something we expected. The rest of the supplies very minimum. I tried ringing reception no answer, housekeeping no answer and in the end left the room to go to reception my self . Asked a member of staff on way who said they would arrange for some supplies to be sent up whilst we were out, however upon return still nothing - we never received any tea supplies until I finally got a response from the night receptionist who brought up a few tea bags 

The next day after an early start and a busy day we returned to the hotel in the evening to find this time we had 2 tea bags enough to make one cup.

Sadly the whole hotel experience was poor and considering the price and location I would expect much better service and quality of fixtures, fittings and supplies provided in rooms.

I would not stay again",2,2022,10,10
122,Short stay,Very dated rooms. Very good location and nice breakfast but I wouldn’t personally stay there again as the rooms are so dated and need serious TLC. I would not recommend this hotel and staff were hit and miss some friendly some not,1,2022,10,04

122,What on earth is going on in the restaurant?,"We arrived for breakfast at 10:20am to be met with a breakfast service that was nothing short of a shambles. Nearly every table was full of dirty crockery the limited staff available had very sullen faces.
No juice
No water
No milk
No pastries
Hardly any hot food
No coffee or tea

The manager seemed completely out of her depth with no direction given to staff.
Walk-in orders were still being accepted despite the operation clearly under immense pressure.

When I asked for a refund the lady shrugged her shoulders and said she wasn't able to do it.

Shambles",1,2022,09,25
122,A cozy hotel and an amazing receptionist Clanda!!!,"Me and my husband travelled from the States and decided to stay at the harbour hotel since it had a spa which would be relaxing and indeed it was! Clanda who was at the front desk, checked us in and she was amazing in greeting!!! Even after a long flight she knew how to ease us in. Being at the hotel for the first time, clanda provided us with all answers without even having the need to ask a question and it felt like we were a regular there!!!
  Overall everything at the hotel was great and I will be returning for our next trip!!!!! :)",5,2022,09,25
122,Luxury Spa Day with 50 Minute Treatment at Chelsea Harbour Hotel for Two,"On arrival we were told that the Sauna was out of action that just left the steam room.  I wouldn't describe the venue as a spa.  The toilet facilities were dirty with urine stains on the toilet and overflowing female hygiene bins (this was at 10.30am).  The ONLY swimming pool was used for children's lessons from 3pm in the afternoon.  Our Afternoon tea consisted of 4 finger sandwiches, 2 plain scones and 5 petit fours (this was to SHARE between 2 of us).  The treatment was very nice and the therapist was excellent.  Overall extremely overpriced for what we paid.",1,2022,09,22
122,Good location but hotel requires updating - charged twice...,"*my first piece of feedback is about being charged TWICE for our stay which is still unresolved almost a month after our visit. I was charged once on the initial booking and then a second time by the parent company (as it appears on my credit card statement). Really difficult to reach someone about this and I have had no comms back - VERY POOR customer service.

Arrival:

we arrived early as we travelled from Dorset - the hotel was busy and the check in as 15:00, they are stringent about this so do not expect to walk into your room. Front desk staff were a little rude about this but I gave them the benefit of the doubt due to be being busy.

Room: 

We have a young baby who sleeps quite early so we tend to book rooms that have a separate living space to allow us to order food (we use supper.com for fancy meals and then deliveroo for other great local restaurants when in London). 

Bathroom floor has not been cleaned when we arrived.

Appliances were good but decor, condition of room and furniture is outdated and not 5*. 

Spa / Pool:

Again, pool needs work to it. If i had paid just to use the spa and saw the condition of the pool i would be disappointed. the ceiling paint was pealing away. 

Location:

easy to get a taxi / uber into Knightsbridge and in walking distance to Chelsea. 

Staff:

Worth noting this as I have seen similar comments in reviews - the gentlemen who checked us in tried to sell me an event on motivational speaking . crypto... this is unprofessional and was a bit awkward. Staff generally were ok but there is a little arrogance with some which i saw in not just out dialogue but between other people staying at the hotel.",2,2022,09,19
122,Faulty Towers spa day,"Comical day at the Faulty Towers spa of CHH. Nothing went right with our Total Indulgence Afternoon Tea and Fizz package costing c.£400 for two. Our treatment times were moved last minute, preventing us from having them at the same time as planned and giving us minimal prescribed time for tea; our first treatment was no longer available at all. The one size fits all robes were all different sizes. The sauna, rinsing machine and hairdryers were all on the blink. As was the single tiny coffee machine at reception. There was a large brown mark on the female changing room ceiling and the door was kept open so men regularly wandered in. A couple were making out in the pool. Treatments were lovely as was the pool swim. But no refreshments other than water were provided in the pitch black Relaxation room. Hotel then refused to serve the afternoon tea (cakes/sandwiches) and fizz that were part of the package until finally at the end of our patience we complained somewhat heatedly. Eventually it was provided - an hour after we had sat down. With an apology and a complimentary slice of tiramisu. Will not be returning.",1,2022,09,18
122,Modern and well appointed,"In a great Chelsea location, with harbour views for some of the rooms, this is ideal for business or leisure travel, albeit not in the budget sector.  It is close to London Overground and there is nearby secure parking as well as the limited, expensive hotel car parking.
The hotel was very clean and well appointed, with friendly staff.  We had quite a few maintenance issues with our room, which slightly marred our experience, but the staff were generous when we checked out, by way of compensation.",4,2022,09,18
122,Amazin’ Abdu!,"Abdu typifies and encompasses all that is great about my favourite hotel in London. Like the hotel, Abdu is subtle, refined, yet very much all that is amazing about special location, generous rooms, detailed and on-point housekeeping. Across the board, everyone at this hotel genuinely goes out of their way to make sure you are welcome and enjoying your stay without being obtrusive or syrupy. It’s a natural kind of hospitality that makes you feel like a friend, rather than just a “guest”. I think Abdu typifies all of this. Plus, I had a suit dry cleaned, two shirts laundered and pressed all in a matter of hours. Above and beyond the call. I love this hotel, I love this location, I love London. I will always stay here when the chance affords me. And I am a Londoner for two decades and come back regularly! This a special spot — and if you know, you know. And if you know Abdu you truly do have it made! Thank you all at Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa! Much appreciated. MIKE",5,2022,09,17
122,Betty was amazing at her job and made our stay so special,"Amazing hotel, Betty at reception went above and beyond to make my fiancés birthday extra special.

I will defo be visiting again!",5,2022,09,16
122,Nice spa treatments,"Lovely hotel. The best was the spa, pool and the massages. I was treated by a lady called Mimi and she has good messaging skills. Give her a bonus.
The pool was good, the rain showers were excellent and I didn't want to come out. The lockers need changing as a few are broken.",3,2022,09,16
122,Shambles! Avoid,"This hotel is a shambles. We had booked rooms at the Millenium Gloucester Rd so we were quite intrigued to be moved here due the flooding. We were offered suites for the same price so thought it would be OK. The suites are dated and pokey with a weird separate small room. The bathroom is shabby and I’m not feeling too comfortable with the cleaning given the dirty bath mat (see photo) the room smells and I’ve wheezed since I came in! Tried to call reception 6 times to try and move but no reply. 
The bar service was appalling, complete lack of staff training and coordination. Very limited menu of pre-prepared basic burgers etc. service was the worst I’ve experienced for a very long time.",1,2022,09,14

122,Hotel SPA,"We went to the spa booking well in advance and once we arrived we were told that we could not do the route as a couple but one at a time despite having booked for two people together.  An email was sent to me stating that the route would be at 1.30pm and 2.45am but not specifying that that time would be to let one person in first at 1.30pm and then the other at 2.45am, and when the manager was done note that the email was not specified she replied in an annoyed tone saying that they write the emails like this and made us understand that if we wanted to do the path well otherwise worse for us.  Of course we said we wanted to do it as a couple and left without even getting a refund and a voucher (£ 180)",1,2022,09,09
122,Absolutely terrible customer service.,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for 2 nights, however we had to change rooms due to faulty lights and other issues in the room.

Never experienced such bad customer service and rudeness from staff.",1,2022,09,06
122,TERRIBLE SERVICE AT MY BIRTHDAY SUMMER SUNDAY TEA,The service was absolutely appalling and unacceptable. We waited 1hr45 mins for our tea; despite customers who arrived long after us; being served theirs. My written complaint  has also been ignored!!!,1,2022,09,05
122,Poor excuse for a spa day..,"I was lucky enough to have this booked for me as a birthday present by some friends but honestly it was so disappointing, we arrived at 10am when our session started to be told that the sauna was not working, then the hairdryers were also not working right now or the swimsuit dryer... there was not nearly enough loungers round the pool and ended up sitting on the floor. The showers where left in a complete state and half of the lockers would not work. 
We then spoke to a lady at reception she gave us a hairdryer to use in the reception as it was the only place with a plug! Not the kind of experience I'd except from what is meant to be a 5 star spa!",1,2022,09,04
122,Amazing Hotel - Location/Staff/Clean,"Came here for our honeymoon and couldn’t have picked a better hotel. The staff was sensational (Abdu, Bruno, Robert to name a couple) and made us feel right at home. The views from the room were stunning and the marina backdrop for breakfast/lunch/dinner couldn’t be better. The hotel was perfectly clean and so was the entire area and city of Chelsea around the hotel. We felt completely safe and we did not want to leave. Lots of options for food only a short walk away as well, and super fast Uber service if you are venturing further out. Can’t thank them enough for making the first part of our honeymoon a complete success.

Also if you’re a Chelsea FC fan the location to the stadium is perfect!

I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone reading this, and if/when I come back to London I will be staying here.",5,2022,09,04
122,Kick off to our Honeymoon,"We came to Chelsea Harbour Hotel because it's close to Stanford Bridge but with beautiful views! First off the staff is top notch! From the reception staff, wait staff, to our cleaning crew.... everyone is so attentive and kind. Abu, truly made our experience special with the attention to detail of why we where there and that was to see a Chelsea game. Rooms are so clean and the food was very well done, make sure to add the breakfast to your stay. The bartenders also as amazing! My husband was sad to leave to say the least. Lol",5,2022,09,04
122,Tired old girl,"The staff at the Chelsea Harbour hotel are the hotel's best asset. The Chelsea Harbour really needs a refurb, the hotel is really tired with threadbear furnishings and stained carpets. The restaurant serves a good selection of tasty treats but the prices are very high, this is reflected in the empty seats

I have stayed at the Chelsea harbour on a few ocassions as the location for me and my partner is perfect and there is secure parking very close at a cost of £30 for 24 hours. 

I would stay again as I always have a pleasant stay.",4,2022,09,02
122,Overnight stay in suite with balcony,"Overall  I  found  the  hotel  old  and  uninspiring.  My  bedroom  and  sitting  room were  very  clean  and  as  expected.  But  historic  stains  on  carpets  made  me  not  want  to  walk  in  bare  feet.  There  was  no  view from balcony and  it  was  dark.
Staff  attentive  and  nice.  No  breakfast  room  service.  Food  in  buffet  an  hour  before closing  seriously  running  out.  No  second  glass  of  orange  juice.
2  rashers  left....... Meal  on  arrival  sitting  outside  on terrace  overlooking  the
algae  covered  basin  was  very  good .   For me  not  worth  being  cut  off  in  residential  area  with  no  shops  or  restaurants.  Very  Disappointing",2,2022,09,01
122,Climate comfort in a heatwave,"We stayed in mid August when London temperatures were soaring to 34 degrees.   Our time in London was most certainly enhanced by our very comfortable suite where the air-conditioning was a very pleasant respite from the outside heat.  Staff here are all very friendly and pleasant and during our 4 night stay, they were happy to interact with us making us feel very welcome.  Special mention for the housekeeping team who kept our room in pristine order and made sure we had plenty of water and to Vera who ensured that we enjoyed our breakfast.  Can certainly recommend Chelsea Harbour Hotel.",4,2022,08,31

122,Not at all impressed,"We came to london for one night as a family of 5 for my sons 18th birthday. We had chosen this hotel as it was a spa. My boys were going to visit Chelsea FC for a stadium tour and myself and my daughter were going to use the spa facilities. On arrival, we checked in and paid for the rooms. After payment was taken we weee told the spa wasn’t working and we couldn’t use any of it. Whilst I appreciate things go wrong, it would have been nice to be told this before taking my payment as we wouldn’t have stayed. 

I wasn’t happy about this situation, so my husband went down to talk to them and we weee given 2 options. 1 was a full refund or 2 was 20% off and we could stay there. We decided on option 2 as the rooms are really lovely! This was Monday, and today is Sunday and I still haven’t received any money back from this place, despite several emails! We had spent a lot of money here for my son as a treat and this was just unacceptable! Oh and to top it all off, we had a 5am fire alarm!!!!!

122,"Amazing stay, fantastic location and friendly staff","Can't rate this hotel high enough. I had a booking from March 2020 that was cancelled due to covid. Despite the booking being 'non-transferable', the hotel allowed me to reschedule no fewer than 4 times as my plans to come to London kept changing, and each time they were really fantastic about it. They didn't even charge me the additional room fee!! This tells you everything you need to know. At a time when most companies are looking for any excuse to reclaim lost revenues, this hotel went out of it's way to keep me whole.

The hotel itself is great, the rooms are modern and really spacious - something rare for central London stays. The location is really nice and very quiet. There's a beautiful marina at the back and the bar-restaurant has a nice terrace overlooking it. You'll actually forget you're in central London!

I haven't generally been too impressed with central London hotels, they're noisy, impersonal and mostly cramped - this is the opposite. I'm certain I'll choose this hotel again the next time I'm staying central. Amazing work guys, thank you very much!",5,2022,08,23
122,"Dirty, dirty, dirty. Stay away!","Text: We complained because we found used cutlery in one of the draws, there were stains on almost all of the walls.......the worst were the brown stains on the walls beside the toilets. We spoke with someone from housekeeping that apologized and just said I'm so sorry but we were busy yesterday. They cleaned the room again, but they didn't do a good job, so we talked with someone sitting behind the desk in the reception area, and told him that we weren't happy with the work they did, but noting more happened. 

There were playing cards and cardboard under one of the dressers, there was a hair tie hanging on a fram in the bathroom. We found a hairball of long black hair on the bathroom floor, and none of us have long black hair. The curtains were stained with something, etc

We also asked reception twice on arrival and were promised a cot was being bought up. After returning from dinner at 9 there was still no cot. They said there was nothing they could do, so we had to leave. They offered extra bedding!? No apology and we were basically ushered out the door. Absolutely disgusting and the staff were so smug and unhelpful. Disgusting Appalling and shameful",1,2022,08,13
122,Absolutely terrible.,"This hotel does not deserve a 5 star rating. We were told that there was parking (which there was not). There was a space outside, however we were told that it was 'first come first serve' and we needed to move. The space was obviously empty, and we were told it was not reserved, but yet could not park there.
I had to drive around and find a car park around the corner (which I later found out only accepted cash payments, so had to run and find a cash point before I could leave).
The sauna was not working on the day we visited, however no one had informed us of this or made us aware. Our massages, however, were wonderful.
We had booked afternoon tea, and when we arrived, we were informed it was a part of our package. My mother asked them multiple times if they were absolutely sure, as she didn't think it was. They insisted that it was part of the package we had booked. My sisters were not keen on afternoon tea, so ordered other meals. Asa we were going to pay, we were told that the afternoon tea was NOT in fact part of the package, and we now needed to pay for all 5 of us. We obviously did not, as we would not have accepted it if this was the case, we would have just got the other food on the menu! Customer service is absolutely shocking in this hotel - they were due to give my mother a refund as one person did not attend, and have since refused to as she 'did not pay for her afternoon tea'. Absolutely awful - would NOT recommend.",1,2022,08,10
122,Shockingly bad experience,"Stayed for two nights.
No A/C in the entire building
Mice running around in the buffet area
Employees did not have a clue about the A/C nor cared less about the mice 
Front desk continued to check in guests and didn't tell them about the A/C
The room was dated with the carpet not properly set on the floor
The portable A/C unit provided made more noise than a locomotive 
Totally over priced and does not deserve its rating",1,2022,08,09
122,Chelsea Harbour,"This hotel is not deserve the 5 star rating that claims - it is hardly worthy of 3 stars. The rooms, furnishings, decor and general appearance are badly in need of an upgrade. 
Owners do not seem interested in spending money on upgrading the rooms and facilities albeit the amazing location and views this hotel offers.

That being said the reception staff of Luz and Betty are delightful and so is Vera in the breakfast area. Always willing and obliging to make our stay more pleasant - these 3 kind ladies are worthy of a 5 star rating!",2,2022,08,08
122,Birthday getaway ,Wonderful hotel! Me and my son stayed here for his 13th birthday after visiting Stamford bridge. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The room itself was beautiful. Sky sports in the room really made my sons day! A lovely touch sending balloon's and a cake for my son. Thank you for a lovely evening stay! ,5,2022,08,05
122,Good location but rooms are a little dated,"The location of the hotel is really good. It's very nice to walk around the area. 

The rooms are a little dated but they are very big in comparison to other 5 star hotels in the area. Parking for guest is not at a discounted rate.",3,2022,07,30
122,Very good service / great quiet location,"We visited for a few days and the hotel is a perfect location on the harbour and close to the Kings Road.  The suites are huge with separate living rooms.  I applaud JEY at guest relations who worked very hard, late at night, at successfully moving me to a wonderful room with a view of the harbour because my A/C in my original suite was not working.   He is very friendly, courteous and professional.  The hotel is lucky to have him.  We will definitely return.",5,2022,07,28
122,Wonderful Chelsea Hotel,"My son and I stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa to attend a concert at Hyde Park and it was a great central base for us.
All the staff were great and looked after us during our weekend stay. Michael and Luz were so helpful and we couldn't ask for any more, the service was excellent. The rooms are spacious and extremely clean and comfortable.",5,2022,07,25
122,A SORRY HOTEL,"Millenium has managed to turn a five-star property into a two-star hotel. The hotel looks cheap and shabby - shopping-mall art, self-assembly desks at reception, torn curtains, flea-market yellowed phones, scratched and scuffed furniture. This is the good part. 

It functions even more poorly. NOBODY EVER ANSWERED ANY PHONE CALLS WE MADE FROM OUR ROOM. We barely escaped injury from scalding water in the shower whose temperature wouldn't adjust. So we changed rooms. There the air-conditioning broke down - during a searingly hot night. We spent our whole weekend chasing problems. Ugh

The Hotel Manager was barely interested in our totally dreadful stay

And all of this for five-star prices 

We will not stay at a Millenium hotel again",1,2022,07,23
122,Fantastic staff,"Thank you for great hospitality- and - a special thanks to Vera from the restaurant. Vera, you are a star, thank you so much. Loved our room, relaxing and exceptionally comfortable. We shall return - thanks.",5,2022,07,18
122,One of the Wost Hotels Ive Stayed in.,"My wife and I were attending a charity ball being held at this hotel in June 2022. Knowing London pretty well, I was aprehensive about bringing my car in, but the website advertised ""Valet Parking - £40"". No problem.

I wish it had been that easy. Upon arrival there was a log jam of vehicles on the forecourt with no direction or instruction from any of the doormen. Utter chaos. I had to abandon the car to check in leaving my wife in the car, just in case it needed to be moved. Just as well, as she was shouted at by a member of staff insisting that the car was moved as it was blocking the way. Which was strange, as it couldn't be moved, as, yes, you guessed it, we were blocked in.

Checking in was fairly easy, but when asking about Valet parking, the receptionist looked me blankly and shoved me in the direction of the door staff. The chap I spoke to barely understood English and then proceeded to try to guide me to 1 of two car parks, neither of which he could tell me how to get into. Eventually, I moved some bollards to free up a space at the front and got parked there.

After dragging our luggage into the lift and finally finding our room, it was still being ""checked"" by a member of staff, despite us checking in at 15:40. We were told we had checked in early. Not a problem, he finished and left, taking our room keys with him. Epic. We did get replacement room keys fairly easily though,so I guess thats a plus.

The room itself wasn't too bad, tired, dated, but clean. Bath was nice, shower was knackered - didn't work properly and you had to stand as far away as possible when turning it on to avoid the roaming jets shocking you into cold submission before you stepped in.

There were no plugs for charging mobile devices at the side of the bed, which was hard to believe - even Travelodge have these!

We didn't use the bar facilities, but the evening ball went very well.

Air conditioning was functional, but noisy knocking and clanking as the fan spun. Again, not ideal.

Breakfast was an even worse ordeal. Food quality was good, but, with a room full of residents, there were no clean plates, just 5 dirty / used ones on the pile, and a request for fresh ones was greeted with a grunt and someone dissapearing into the kitchen. Plates appeared 10 minutes later. Once sat down, we asked for 2 teas, which again was greeted with a grunt and a 20 minute wait - watching staff wander past with tea / coffee pots and ignoring the ""excuse me"" requests we made. I'd have happily got my own drinks if the facility was there..but, it wasn't!

Couple this with a young man offering out a middle aged woman for ""having an altercation with his kids last night"", it all lead to a really unpleasant experience.

Checking out was also an ordeal, no clear direction as to who to checkout with (reception desk was manned by a concierge who also grunted when asked questions), but we did manage it, eventually. The parking charge had increased overnight it seems from £40 to £50, but at least I got a paper copy of my bill. Which was nice.

I was really dissapointed at the overall service and the state of the rooms, I expected something different, especially at this price bracket, to be honest, Travelodge Covent Garden give better service - at least they are honest about parking!

If it was me, I'd avoid this place like the plague. Definately won't be going back.",1,2022,07,17
122,Best welcoming,"I decided to spend a few days in London with my boyfriend for his birthday, he has booked a penthehouse for us. We arrived there at 4:00 pm and our room was not ready, but luckily we were welcome by Luz who, in addition to being very competent in solving the problem, giving us a room just for us to change for an event,when we returned around 7 pm and we find chocolates with a happy birthday message .  I have no words to thank you, Luz besides the smile, makes you feel welcome she’s very kind and helpful.",5,2022,07,09
122,DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR DEPOSIT AGAIN!!!!!!,I stayed in May 2022 and am still waiting for my deposit to be returned in July. They put it on someone else’s card and are now ignoring me and won’t give it back. Anyone else have this theft happen to them?,1,2022,07,05
122,Lovely weekend break,"Stayed at this hotel for the first time this weekend for my mums birthday. We had a lovely stay the staff at reception were very helpful and friendly. We had a king Marina view room and it was absolutely perfect we loved it. We visit Chelsea a lot this hotel is in a great location and we will definitely be back soon. 
Thank you!",5,2022,07,03
122,Not the best,"This is the 4th time at this hotel and probably the last , the  hotel is looking very tired and is desperate for renovation , the rooms are big but the catpets , walls are stained and look very 1970 , the staff tbh are good and helpful and house keeping brilliant , we used the pool and spa and the changing rooms were dirty , I love the position of this hotel but sadly it will be the last time I visit here unless it is given a facelift , such a shame",3,2022,06,27
122,Poor Customer Experience,"I have just booked a 3 days stay at this hotel because our usual Raddison May Fair Collection cannot accommodate us this short notice unfortunately.  

So I have regrettably chosen the Chelsea Harbour Hotel owned by Millennium Hotels.  

Prior to my check-in (26 June) I received an online check-in email which states I must complete it prior to my arrival, which I did.  

On that email was an offer of an early check-in at a cost of £40.00. I chose the early check-in and duly entered my credit card details.  

Having not heard anything from the hotel about my request and having received a reminder email alerting me to the fact that I am still awaiting a reply from the hotel about the early check-in. 

I telephone the hotel earlier this evening to enquire as to why I had not received a reply to my early check-in request. I spoke with the Duty Manager Zoldan who speaks in broken English and was difficult to understand.  

From what I did understand from speaking with Zoldan the manager is that the email pre check-in I completed was an ‘automated’ process.  I gathered by his explanation that means I was unlikely to receive a coherent response.  I was told that my payment didn’t work! 

All told I am not looking forward to a 3 day stay if this is the standard of service I am to receive.  What use is it filling in an automated checkin if nobody looks at it or responds to a request made made within it, in short useless and frustrating.  

Won’t be returning to this hotel in any event. I will update my review after y stay and after writing to Millennium Hotel’s Chief Executive Aloysius Lee.  

I will post the CEO’s response.",1,2022,06,25
122,One night stay at Chelsea Hotel,"This was actually my first stay in a hotel near City of London for work purpose. Although the stay was only for 1 night, I used the opportunity to check out many of the facilities that the hotel offers. I was really impressed first of all by how spacious the hotel was. It was neat and clean; the swimming pool, spa and sauna was also great. Deputy Manager Michael was very helpful. I wish the variety of fruits and salads in the continental breakfast was a bit better.",5,2022,06,24
122,Unhelpful bar and from of house management,"We returned from an evening concert, ready for a night cap, Bar manager not willing to serve us at the stroke of 11pm, even though bar tenders were preparing drinks for others. many very unhappy customers at the bar. When we asked if he knew of a bar locally he said ""NO""
We then asked reception and was told by the manager  to try ""Tesco"" and "" deliveroo""  by another member of staff and told no bars open in Chelsea after 11pm.
Top it all, we asked about mini bar in the room and was told this closed at 10pm ..",1,2022,06,24
122,"Not quite ""Made in Chelsea""","Let me be upfront from the start; I usually stay at a Premiere Inn – occasionally at Travelodge. So, I understand ‘class’. Accordingly, the Chelsea Harbour Hotel was well within my comfort zone. Having said that, I’ve never stayed in a 5* hotel, so my anticipation of a night of luxury was pretty intense.

Was I impressed or disappointed?

Well, to be honest, neither. Yes, the suite was very spacious and quite comfortable. You don’t get two televisions and a separate loo at many places – so hats off for that. And the choice of bath or shower was luxury indeed. The bed was enormous (almost the size of Luton) and very, very comfortable (no foam pillows here – take note Travelodge). 

In the morning we wandered down to the spa in our towelling robes and swam in a pool all by ourselves.
 
Yes, this was fun.

But, and it’s a big ‘but’ … why would anyone in their right mind stay in Chelsea Harbour? It’s a vacuous, soulless location which isn’t really in Chelsea at all. This is almost World’s End – and, in so many respects, it feels just like that – a post-apocalyptic landscape full of high-rise apartment blocks – many in mock colonial style, deliberately left vacant by absent landlords who’ve, no doubt, bought properties ‘for investment’. 

The harbour itself is a near stagnant puddle of water with boats that have been tied up and probably never moved in the last twenty years.

This is not Monaco.

But none of this impacts on the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. It’s immaculately clean, fresh and ticks many of the luxury boxes. Was it worth £262 for the night – with breakfast an extra £24pp.
 
Well, no, not quite.

Although, having the swimming pool to ourselves was quite a whizz.",3,2022,06,23
122,Spa morning,"Brilliant time at the spa with my friend Gill.
We both had treatments from April and Mimi 
we did not want to leave.
Great venue great staff. 
Thanks ladies for making us relaxed and pampered.
We will be returning.",5,2022,06,20
122,Viv S,"My partner and I stayed in this 'hotel' during a trip to celebrate his birthday last August. Why has it taken so long for me to write a review? I have been trying to get a response/recompense from the 'hotel' re my complaint ever since then but to no avail. 

We stayed for 3 nights and never once received any housekeeping in our room. No bins were emptied, no hoovering/cleaning and no clean towels. This was apparent also on our floor where rubbish and discarded food trays were left for days in the corridor.

On the last day we were turned away for breakfast because we were given the incorrect times for breakfast on check-in.

I complained to Manuel Garcia, Guest Relations Manager, who promised faithfully that my card would not be charged. This is the email he sent to me:

'As spoken with you at reception this morning,  I will speak with the General Manager of the Hotel to get a compensation for your stay due to the bad experience.  Your Visa Card ending xxx that has been pre-authorised WOULD NOT BE CHARGED (this was underlined rather than capitalised) till I have a resolution from the GM and you agree with it'.

Needless to say, a month later the funds were taken from my account and my attempts to contact the 'hotel' and Manuel Garcia Ever since have been ignored. 

I now have no option but to use the Consumer Arbitration Service.

Anyone with similar issues, how did you manage to get a positive outcome from The Chelsea Harbour 'Hotel'?",1,2022,06,18
122,5 star faulty towers - Health and safety hazard,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights for my wedding, we booked 8 rooms for two - three nights. The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Awful service, do not care, communication is impossible. Staff tried to refund us for additional ice creams with personal cash and asked for change as too scared to process via the system as management would tell them off. Needless to say we did not accept his cash. 

Cot bed collapsed, luckily not on my daughter. Bacteria all in the shower, hotel stank of cigarettes, sweets all under furniture, some weird marks on d to bedding, couldn’t deliver a continental breakfast to my room, took 4 attempts and still wrong. One attempt at a
Continental breakfast was just one orange juice for three people…. 

The friend asked for a steamer for her dress, was told three times to take it to the spa - it was explained on numerous occasions it wasn’t her that needed a ‘steam’. 

This is not even all the issues, but they final straw was when my 2 year old daughter had eaten (never thought to check the date of cereal in a hotel) one month out of date Rice Krispies. We called the lady who was running the breakfast who denied this had happened and tried to walk off with the box, after having to ask for it back numerous times, which she refused, I lost it. I demanded it back and had to unfortunately raise my voice in front of guests so they could see what had happened. She wanted to walk off with the box and dispose. Worried I’m sure of getting into trouble. Which I feel is probably something a lot of the staff are worried about. 

I blame the management of this Hotel, not the staff. They are not qualified, not trained and cannot communicate. It’s not their fault, it’s managements, they are accountable. 

Guest relations manager - Michael, could not resolve as the director of operations “was out of town”. 

I left furious, upset as did my family and friends. Do not stay at this hotel unless you want a rubbish experience.",1,2022,06,11
122,Superb Afternoon Tea!,"The afternoon tea at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel is simply amazing. The selection of sandwiches and cakes went beyond my expectations, with each having a unique flavour. The scones were also very light and fresh. I would personally like to commend all the staff at the hotel, especially Vera, who were not only attentive but also helped to make the day extra special. They took on all our dietary requirements without fuss, with variety not become compromised. Having been to a number afternoon teas in central London hotels, I would say that the Chelsea Harbour Hotel exceeds them all, and certainly one to consider!",5,2022,06,09
122,Great stay,"Great hotel, the staff are always willing to help, they are very friendly and welcoming, they cannot do enough to make sure our stay is a good experience.

Farad the n/manager always greets us with a smile and is genuinely happy to see us, it's like a friend greeting us back.

The hotel location and rooms are fantastic and I would recommend a stay here, it is our first choice. A definite 5/5 and deservedly a 5 star hotel l will be coming back, great work and high standards.",5,2022,06,08
122,Uncomfortable room,"The room was too cold at 7th floor, the heater is not working, I requested for extra duvet at midnight, staff brought electric heate. The maintenance came to the room the following day with ladder to sort the heating out. The room should have check properly before guests move in due to health and safety especially with the ladder.",3,2022,06,06
122,Great visit,"Good visit, stay was great and could not fault the service. Definitely 5* stay. Hotel staff were welcoming and met all needs and went the extra mile in helping make my stay even better. Bar and terrace were definite highlight of my stay!",5,2022,06,04
122,Beautiful views!,"What a lovely, peaceful place between Chelsea and Wandsworth! The staff were extremely helpful and addressed any issues with minimal fuss and solution-driven. There was still a sense of post-covid recovery about the experience and expertise of staff, but this was more than made up for by sheer helpfulness and positivity. We arrived for check-in to be offered complimentary upgrade to a marina view suite, which was the most spacious and deluxe hotel room we’ve ever stayed in - with two toilets, a hallway and our own doorbell!! Can thoroughly recommend room 314.

The breakfast was delicious - exquisite scrambled eggs (which actually stay hot!) and very conscientious staff welcoming and looking after us - try to get a terrace table outside if you can. My wife can’t use lifts, so the staff were very accommodating in accessing the side stairs for us.

A special shout-out to Zoltan on reception, who is a real asset to the hotel!",4,2022,06,04
122,Abysmal customer service.,"I have booked a short stay with my daughters. 
 I required some assistance but unfortunately common sense prevailed. Zero assistance was offered and instead 3 inadequate reception member were just chatting amongst themselves unable to offer simple solution to a situation. 

I have stayed here previously and I can see an obvious lack of experienced staff with courtesy to offer assistance to a mother travelling with children. 

Absolutely disgusted.",1,2022,06,01
122,Poor complaint handling,"We stayed two nights. There was no shower gel and the room was cold in spite of the in-room controller stating the room was being heated. We told reception, the front desk and housekeeping on the floor about the shower gel shortage. Nothing was done, and quizzing another guest they also had no gel.  We were told an engineer would fix the heating.
 Coming back late for our second night we told the night reception of the problems. They stated that the units only provided cooling and we should switch them off and the room would warm up. At our request they provided a portable heater. They could not help with shower gel as they had no key to housekeeping supplies. 
The suites are fine, spacious and clean. The management system for complaint handling non existent.",3,2022,06,01
122,Avoid this hotel,"the hotel seems to be run by people who have no interest in the concept of customer service whatsoever.   Arrived 25 May with 6 other friends / collleagues on a group booking. the recepetion staff tried to tell us we didnt have a booking, which seems to be a common theme here!  the  manager was disinterested and walked off!  when we finally showed the booking confirmation number, there was no apology, they tried to make us pay for somebody else's bar bill and we will be checking the credit card bill to check for duplicate room charges.   the rooms were very pleasant however.",2,2022,05,31
122,Great Hotel,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The room was clean and spacious, and amenities were replaced on a daily basis. Michael at the desk was very pleasant and helpful. It was also incredibly easy to access London from the hotel.",5,2022,05,29
122,Excellent customer service,"Pleasant hotel with spa services and a lovely marina view.

Hotel is bit away from center of the city but within easy reach b public transport or Uber.

Definitely would recommend.",5,2022,05,27
122,Disgusting Health Hazard and dreadful service,"Disliked  · The list is long however the worst thing was the fact that the bed had been made over a mattress protector that had serious blood staining on it. When we complained the staff were disinterested, ,offered no apology and stated that housekeeping had gone home so it could not be dealt with until the next day Disgusting.",1,2022,05,26
122,Not a 5 star experience,"We had booked and paid for our accommodation 3 months earlier so we were disappointed that the hotel had no record of the reservation.  It was resolved, eventually, but the reception staff had no sense of urgency and it felt like they were doing us a favour.
Worse followed.  Within a few moments of arriving there was a noise and a stranger walked into the room!  WTF!!!!  The room had been allocated to another guest!
Obviously it was a big error and a huge security problem.  While there was an apology we had no compensation or bottle of wine which seemed poor.
The room was lovely and the food was ok but the service was adequate at best.  
Definitely not a 5 star experience",3,2022,05,25
122,Incredible hotel experience!,"I had a canceled and rebooked vacation to London and last minute and honestly it's was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.  Michael the hotel manager, Alex, Zoltan and the great staff at this property made my stay perfect (including the private elevator to the spa, pool and sauna).  My airline lost my bags and the hotel called me as soon as it arrived AND brought it to my room.  I probably will only stay at this hotel going forward whenever i return, it's truly 5 stars, no question.  

Thank you to the wonderful staff at this amazing hotel!",5,2022,05,25
122,Will never stay at this hotel again even if they are the last hotel around,"I am appalled by the treatment of this hotel and will no longer stay there in the future. I stayed at this hotel as a day use customer in April , at check in I was asked by the reception (Maria or Mary can't remember) for a £100 deposit in top of the room rate and this was for any incidentals with promise that at checkout this was going to be refunded. It is now end of May and still not refunded. I called numerous times and each time was told this will be in the account 5 days working days. This last staff spoke to (Zoltam) promised he had investigated and that Finance was were the issue was since they had not issued it. he promised it has now been issued and will be in my bank. fast forward a from 17th May to 25th May still no refund. In my years of staying and dealing with thousands of hotels this is by far the worst experience. I will now be writing a formal complaint and will go to any length to get my money back.",1,2022,05,25
122,1 night business trip May 2022,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and once again it was a very positive experience all round. 

Luz on the check in desk was professional and super friendly. I enjoyed talking to her about our backgrounds whilst she dealt with an issue (caused by me booking the wrong dates in the hotel!). She was a pleasure to deal with and deserves recognition for adding that human touch to the guest experience.

Michael the guest manager was also very friendly and helpful so deserves full credit for making me feel at home in the hotel. 

Another member of staff who needs mention is April in the spa - I had a full body massage that sent me to sleep after a hard day. Incredible! 

The night staff (I didn't get their names sadly) were also brilliant. I needed to leave with my car at 2am for work, returning at 5am at the end of my shift. They made everything really easy, at that time of night was an absolute godsend. 

The rooms and hotel are great but the main reason I felt I needed to post a review was to commend the staff at this hotel as I have stayed in beautiful 5 star properties in the past and the hospitality element has ruined the experience. 

Bravo. Keep employing good people!",5,2022,05,24
122,BEWARE as this hotel will take money from your credit card and not refund it,"Sadly, this hotel is no longer well run.  At the beginning of April 2022, on check--in, we agreed a £100 deposit against incidentals.  We had none, but the hotel has held on to our money  for over 6 weeks despite numerous emails, telephone calls and in person requests.  The Tripadvisor reviews on their website have omitted those that are critical, which is very calculating.

The staff are evasive and clearly under instructions to avoid taking any action to deal with guests very real concerns.

Betty, one of the reception staff, promised faithfully to email us yesterday following her 'investigations'.  Of course she has not done so.",1,2022,05,24
122,Appalling Customer Service,I am so disappointed in the way I have been treated by this hotel.  I would never post a negative review but I feel I have to on this one.  All I want is my money back for a service I never received and they promised me a refund and I have yet to see it and I have sent numerous emails.  Don't even get me started on trying to speak to someone on reception.  It just rings out or they don't respond back to you.  It's been a month and I still don't have my money!!,1,2022,05,23
122,Disappointed,"We booked two rooms for a two night stay. On arrival one of the rooms we had booked wasn't available at all. At which point we were offered a different type of room which we felt was acceptable and on first impressions it seems a nice hotel.. but for a high end, high price hotel the furniture and carpets in the rooms are worn and generally shabby.   During the servicing of the room the bins weren't emptied... towels weren't replaced.. tea coffee and sugar weren't refilled.. shampoo conditioner and shower gel weren't refilled..  the electrical safety testing is out of date... we had also booked car parking for our stay - but having decided instead to travel via rail have had to request the car parking charge be requested on more than one occasion... it still has not to date been done. During the stay another customer wanted parking and we said as we had chosen to travel via rail that our parking reservation should be vacant and therefore available... only to be told that the hotel only has 6 parking spaces and there were none available... so it's a good job we didn't arrive by car.. 
Our booking was made through the My Millennium app and yet no reward points have been allocated to the account. The staff have no qualms in point blank lying to your face. I have stayed in many hotels in many price brackets and this one doesn't even touch the level of service received by way lesser priced establishments. I for one will not be returning.",2,2022,05,22
122,Anti-cultural behavior,"On a Friday evening after 10.00 pm the management just asked me to stop playing on the piano in the restaurant since it is “not allowed”. I have to mention they stop serving anything after 10pm, no matter it is alcoholic or not. So nobody in the restaurant, but I was not allowed to play some jazz just because… Very intelligent management and customer oriented behavior. Well done, guys👏",1,2022,05,20
122,Dreadful experience - avoid!,"We booked this hotel through Secret Escapes, as an overnight stop after going to the theatre. We arrived at 12 noon (we had a lunch booking), and were checked in, but told our room was not ready, but would be for 3pm (as stated in the booking with Secret Escapes). I should have guessed likely problems at this stage as the reception/check-in experience was chaotic. They had 3 staff on the desk, but always one of them seemed to be on a phone and it took forever to process each person. My wife and I went for lunch and returned to checkin at 4.15pm, but were told the room still not ready, but to return in 45 mins. This was after spending some 10 minutes waiting to speak with someone - the reception area was just total chaos. We went to the bar to wait and had a drink (I got them to pay!!), and returned again at 5.05pm. The reception area was now in chaos as there were several couple seemingly remonstrating with staff that they couldn't check in as rooms were still not ready. By now a manager had deigned to appear and was trying to explain - he was fairly useless to be honest and reminded of the proverbial rabbit and headlights! We were all told the rooms were still not ready and that it would be put to an hour to wait. I spoke with the manager and said that was no good to us as my wife needed to change for the theatre and our transport was scheduled for 6pm. He said there was nothing he could do. As I had paid for my room from 3pm and my wife and I would liked to have relaxed there for a couple of hours before the theatre I told the Manager to check us out!!!! We spoke to other couples who were having the same experience, and one couple were there as part of their engagement celebrations - I think they might have checked out too! This whole experience was a complete shambles and the management should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves. Coincidence or not, but the Chelsea football team were staying that evening and didn't seem to be having any problems whatsoever coming and going - maybe therefore if you do decide to stay there, get yourself a Chelsea football strip and I'm sure you will get better treatment than more mundane guests!!",1,2022,05,20
122,Worst hotel experience ever - Avoid!,"This place is a disgrace to the hotel industry. The only time that I have walked away from a hotel booking without staying. Disgusting customer service from start to finish.

We booked a room with a balcony for 2 adults and 1 child. We checked in at 6.45pm because they wouldn't let us check in at 1pm when we first arrived. The room given to us had no balcony and no bed for a child setup. After getting our room wrong they immediately offered to cancel our booking (at 7pm) because ""they get people like us all the time"". Shocking!

My 5 year old son was devastated as he was excited to stay in a hotel. He was with me throughout this rude exchange with the reception manager. We ended up getting public transport home with multiple bags which took almost 2 hours.

I have stayed at many hotels for both personal and work. This was by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I find it staggering that they were willing to get rid of us so quickly. I can only assume they did not want a child staying at the hotel. They did not even have the decency to respond to my complaint a few days later. 

DO. NOT. STAY. HERE.",1,2022,05,20
122,STILL WAITING REFUND AFTER FOUR WEEKS!,"Still waiting for a refund four weeks after my stay. The hotel charged me twice.

I have called four times....each time being told it will be in your account in a few days...Still nothing!

Sent  an Email have had no reply in seven days. 

Called again, to be told a refund has been authorised and will take 10 working days to show in my account......let's wait and see.

For a 5* hotel I should not be chasing a refund.

Overall Lovely hotel, shame  the air-conditioning doesn't work,  gets very hot.",2,2022,05,19
122,Lovely hotel but have £300 spare as they’ll charge this amount to your card before you arrive,"I stayed here for my mums birthday in April, she’s a carer so I wanted to treat her to a special trip away and this seemed like the perfect hotel. I had paid for the hotel in advance and on the morning we were due to go I noticed £200 had been taken out of my account, I rang them immediately asking why to which they responded with ‘your room is now ready’ they hadn’t noticed the money coming out so I demanded this was looked into immediately as this is the money I saved for my mums birthday dinner on the trip. When I arrived at the hotel, I was checked in and the money was not even mentioned until I asked for my refund. I assume they would’ve just left it! i was told I need to pay 2p to release the money immediately and was reassured on several occasions the money would go back into my account by the end of the banking day - considering it was already 3pm I said it was very unlikely but gave the benefit of the doubt. At 7pm I went back down to reception as the money still hadn’t been returned - I was now waiting for £300 as they took £100 holding fee, which the manager continued to say end of banking day. It was 7pm and the following days were bank holiday, I asked how I was going to pay for dinner as we’d book to go out in Chelsea but the hotel had £300 of my money - £200 I saved for the trip! There was absolutely no apology or nothing offered to me to make the situation less stressful, they said to get dinner and pay when the money come through. On the night of my mums birthday we had to get a Deliveroo delivered to the room. The morning after I spent my whole morning which was meant to be exploring Chelsea on the bank asking how I’d get this money back, it was now bank holiday to make it worse so I was told I’d get the money 10 days later - I was continued to be told by the hotel ‘end of the banking day’

It’s such a shame as the hotel was beautiful, the room was lovely but It was incredibly stressful - what was meant to be a relaxing break away for a career certainly wasn’t. This review is a month late as I did email the hotel and I haven’t had a response, not even an apology or a follow up to check the money is back In my account. So be aware have £300 spare in your account if you’d like to stay at this hotel.",1,2022,05,17
122,Hardly 5 star,"The hotel is certainly no longer a 5 star hotel. Whilst reception staff do their best the bar staff could not be more curt or unhelpful.
Our rooms were shabby with stains on the floor and  the room needing of  fresh paint.
We were allocated rooms with maintenance staff still performing repair on the air conditioning which continued not to work or leaking water.

We will not be staying again.",1,2022,05,16
122,STOLE MONEY FROM OUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT REASON OR EXPLANATION. FAR FROM HELPFUL. UTTER SCAM.,Stayed one night. Got profiled for a room deposit nobody else had to pay in our group. Then when we left and got home we discovered almost £300 charges to our cards that they were less than helpful trying to sort. Almost 2 weeks later and still no answer and no refund. DISGUSTING. Five stars my arse. SCAM COMPANY. CRAP SERVICE. AVERAGE ROOMS. Manager is about as useful as a chocolate teapot. WHERES MY MONEY? Not to mention compensation for 2 weeks of stress and non returned phone calls and no money. HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE. 0 stars.,1,2022,05,13
122,STOLE MONEY OFF MY CARD!!,"This hotel has taken multiple payments amounting to £300 from my bank, when I have not spent anything with them. When trying to call them I’m constantly fobbed off, being told they can’t do anything and the manager will have to sort it. The manager has yet to be in contact with me and I’ve been chasing this for 5 days now! I’ve called and emailed him with zero response. The staff are incredibly rude and non helpful, with one member even muttering ‘oh no’ when I called again today and even said I was beat emailing him as the manager won’t bother calling me. A large hotel and yet only 1 person can help in relation to accounts and is too busy to ever call anyone?? I doubt it! They are avoiding clients that they have stolen money off.

This hotel from the start seemed dodgy when only some of our party (20+ people) were charged the £100 deposit. Some of whom were charged twice and are still chasing their refund. Clearly someone there is taking money, saving card details and then racking up bills and taking it from clients accounts under the hotel. Even when I called they did not seem shocked at all by the fact they’d taken money from me, so it is not the first time. It has got to the point I have had to freeze my bank account, pass them on to the fraud department and now I was have to contact the police and trading standard.

I have no idea how this hotel gained 5* but I can assure you it is far from it!",1,2022,05,12
122,"Terrible Spa. Outrageously overpriced, outdated and run down.","My partner and I were gifted a spa day via SpaBreaks.com for my birthday, which generously came to the value of £250. We thought we'd have nothing short of a five star experience spending that kind of money, however what we were met with was absolutely shocking.

Firstly, to book ourselves in on a Friday, we were charged an additional £66 - meaning this now came a total of £316.  

The spa itself is tucked away behind the hotel, which in itself seemed quite posh and impressive. It turned out to be tucked away for a reason. We were greeted at reception and given a short tour. 

The ""Spa"" for the hotel promised use of gym facilities, full access to the spa for the day, hot drinks, a treatment each and a light lunch served in the hotel.

The gym was very small and extremely outdated. So we just didn't bother with those facilities. We were given a quick tour to where our changing rooms were, where we were not given any towels and were met with again outdated and dirty changing facilities. In the ladies room the ceiling was falling apart and the door for the toilet wouldn't lock.

The sauna (out of service on the day) and steam rooms were separate for each genders changing room, meaning despite being sold a spa day, to use those facilities my partner and I would have to be apart. This meant the only facility available to us was the indoor pool. Nothing else. For a £316 ""spa day"" that is an absolute joke. It's basically a run down leisure centre. 

We were then shown to the ""relaxation room"" (some deck chairs in the dark, basically) where we were told to ""wait and enjoy some refreshments"". There were none, just an empty box where there may have once been some tea bags, but definitely not for our spa day.

For the treatments, we were to have two ""Caudalie City Living"" massage and facials. I chose not to have the facial but a full body massage. It was fine, no problem with that. However, my partner described her experience as nothing short of horrible. Whatever chemicals were used for the facial burnt her skin and eyes, leaving red markings over her face. The therapist then insisted on a head massage which left oil in my partner's hair despite her asking not to. She asked the member of staff to stop and she didn't listen, carrying on before my partner just got up abruptly so she could wash it off. 

We left the facility just after that, having spent about 3 hours there. It was terrible. We had even taken the day off work for the privilege. 

It was an absolutely appalling facility and didn't come a fraction close to what we were expecting from the amount it cost.",1,2022,05,12
122,Absolutely lovely!,"I had my birthday here and couldn't have wished for more. The staff were polite and professional, the food was delicious and they really helped make the celebration feel special. Would absolutely recommend Chelsea Harbour to anyone",5,2022,05,12
122,Great stay,"I needed a place to stay while visiting family. I was surprised to find friendly staff with a wonderful atmosphere.  The view of the harbour was relaxing from the room.

Will be returning. Would recommend.",5,2022,05,11
122,Giving up on this hotel after 18 years,"I have been staying at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for 18 years yet this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a negative review, so bad was my last experience there.
Two days into our three days day we could not access our room and were informed by reception that we are only booked two nights.
In the moment I was unable to locate my original booking reference so I was forced to pay for the third night.
Once back in Manchester, I located the original booking email on my laptop and set about contacting the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.
Having had the phone ring out four times in succession, somebody finally answered and could not have been less helpful, putting me on hold for up to 10 minutes before I gave up.
I tried again the following day and after multiple of times again got somebody, who took my number and assured me the manager would call me back. The manager never did.
My partner repeated this one more time with exactly the same results. The promise of a callback, with none forthcoming.
I emailed the reservations department telling them they owed me a refund as I have been double charged for my third night in the hotel, and four days later I am still awaiting a response.
Thankfully, American Express have frozen the charge and I’ve taken up the dispute on my behalf so I’m sure I’ll get my money back. But the fact remains that what was a brilliant hotel is now shambolically run. 
The charmless bar staff who used to make some of the best cocktails in London now sneer at you if you ask for anything more complicated than a gin and tonic.
The rooms and the decor are a lot shabbier than they used to be and the food is overpriced and average.
It is such a shame as I really have enjoyed so many good stays in this hotel, but their lack of professionalism in dealing with my problem has been staggering.",1,2022,05,06
122,My only problem was I only did 1 night!,"Right from check in staff were kind polite and accommodating. 
I came for an overnight stay with some friends.  
We arrived earlier than the check in time as we planned to use the spa facilities before check in. We were greeted by a very smiley Mo who catered for all our needs. He informed us that our rooms were ready ( before 3) and gave us 3 rooms on the 3rd floor. If you go to this hotel the marina view room is breathtaking, also had a separate living room which was perfect .  Rooms were exceptionally clean and lots of towels ( robe and slippers standard)
My only down side was that I only did 1 night!
Hotel is a little gem tucked away in Chelsea and dry worth a visit 
I will certainly be back !",5,2022,05,05
122,Amazing experience,"I was attended by the receptionist Luz, and had the best experience ever! The hotel room was breathtaking, with an incredible art decoration. I was truly impressed by the staff attendance, especially from Luz.",5,2022,05,03
122,Beyond disappointing.,"We specifically booked this hotel for a
Birthday weekend as one of us stayed here before and loved it. Unfortunately, it appears that the standards which meant it had lived so long in my memory have slipped beyond recognition. 
When we arrived we were advised we would have been upgraded but the room wasn’t ready. Since we were in no rush, we stated we were happy to have a drink in the bar and wait. The bar was pretty quiet and we selected drinks from the menu; a white wine and a Baileys coffee. The staff made a real fuss about not being able to make “cocktails” despite the item being on the menu, so we eventually settled on making the drink ourselves from its constituent parts. After an hour or so we went back to reception and were given our keys, and a late check out which we had requested was confirmed. 

We went straight to the room, got changed and went down to the spa. The room had several balloons and a plate of chocolates which said “happy birthday”, which was a really nice touch. There had been no warning that there would be swimming lessons taking place, but we were able to find chairs and it didn’t disturb us. The facilities were clean, but the towel trolley was spilling over with used towels and none of the lockers appeared functional. The facilities were also somewhat basic, but were sufficient for our needs. 

On returning to our room we noted a number of faults which we reported to the reception in order that they be sorted. The fridge was not functional: it was dirty, the light flickered on and off, and the temperature was warm. The TV menu and guide in the lounge did not work, and the TV repeatedly turned itself off. We also noted a fake eyelash stuck to a door from, some heavy wear and tear and staining on the carpets, and heavy wear and tear on the furniture. We were assured a member of staff would come to assist us, and we asked that they bring a bucket of ice and more water due to fridge not working. After a significant wait and further calls a man from the Room Service team came up and provided a large bottle of water at a cost and the ice bucket. He stated he could not fix the TV  or fridge and that the maintenance man was no longer working. After some more time, a man from Reception came up to the room. He looked in the fridge and said he would return with a replacement, he stated he could not fix TV and the man would come in the morning, and finally peeled the false eyelash off the door frame. He stated that Housekeeping must have missed it, he also failed to return with a TV.
The following day we left to go to a rugby match and reminded reception of the issues; we were assured they would be resolved whilst we were out. Despite these assurances, we decided to raise our concerns upon returning to the hotel as our experience simply was not the 5 star experience we had expected and paid for. My partner was told that she should put this in writing and offered no help. We were quite annoyed by the dismissive approach so I put the concerns on paper and she returned to ask to speak to manager (see photos). It was apparent to my partner that the manager knew as when she asked to speak about the room he immediately got on a radio and requested that maintenance attended the room. He stated to her he would also send a bottle of Prosecco as an apology. The maintenance team attended immediately and performed a “reset” on the fridge which would supposedly take hours to cool down after, an issue was raised about the remote control was mentioned but not resolved, but the window in the bedroom was opened. Room Service arrived with a bottle of Prosecco and a bill for £47 for it; after my partner stated that she would not pay and that they should take it away, she was then told it was free. Why would a bill be sent then? 
When we checked out none of our issues were resolved and we have experienced nothing but frustration, lies, and appalling service. Even on the day of check out, where a late check out was agreed, housekeeping staff attempted to enter the room without knocking at just after 11am when checkout was 1pm. This is not a 5 star hotel in terms of the quality of the rooms, but more than this the service is not 5 star. One would get a better response from any of the economy hotel chains that are everywhere, and for a fraction of the cost. We genuinely feel as though we have been robbed.",1,2022,05,01
122,In need of a makeover,I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years and it has always been excellent but I would have to say it is looking very tired and needs a new lease of life. It used to be the place to go with a lovely cocktail bar and luxurious everything but now it is soulless,3,2022,04,28
122,Extra Charges Taken,"Beware if you are from another country.

The hotel is nice, we visited London recently from Australia. To find our credit card was getting maxed out over night, they will do multiple transactions which we are still waiting on the refund. 8 weeks later, they use a bank with international transfer to repay the money, which has quote ""gone missing""

The attempted and took in excess of six thousand Australian Dollars.

What was strange though when we were checking in there was a man at reception complaining and very irritated saying you have taken six thousand pounds from my card now its blocked. 

They make you feel like its your issue. 

I had to prove to them they had charged my credit card extra and fight for two weeks, they do it at nights when your sleeping.

My advice stay there, offer to pay cash. They don't accept it, so just be mindful check your credit card statements daily.",3,2022,04,26
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Such a shame this hotel has declined over the years as it was always such a gem and previously you felt so special staying there. The staff seem so unhappy and stressed, gone is the smiley friendly welcome. I'm told the Chelsea team still stay there which I find fascinating!

The best thing is the rooms are all suites so duly spacious, but they are in need of renovation. All credit to housekeeping who keep them spotlessly clean which helps them stay looking a bit better than they might otherwise.

Lunch on the terrace was ok, both beers were served warm and the sparkling water was served in an unopened bottle without a glass, ice or lemon.

The bar, restaurant and room service shuts at 10pm,when we returned at 11pm there was a big group still drinking what they'd bought before the bar closed so it would appear not to be the case that there isn't demand. It did us a favour really, we ordered drinks on deliveroo and saved money.

Breakfast was quite good, a good spread of buffet food and plenty of juices. 10/10 for having decent butter! 

Hopefully it will get the refurb it needs soon to get back to former glory. ",3,2022,04,21
122,Fancy location but away from London attractions and transportation,This was our first visit to UK London. This hotel is nicely kept and connected to the Chelsea harbor.  You can take nice walks on the harbor during your stay. The food and restaurants were very good however the menu's selection is limited and soon became boring.  We had to order in one day. The staff at the two restaurants are very accommodating and friendly. In particular Vera and her staff were attentive and thoughtful.  The main reception area was hard to reach at times by phone. Room service & cleaning was very good.  After being here I realize that the hotel was far from London's main attractions and transportation service. We spend a lot on taxi/uber service to get around London.  Overall a very good stay if you like quiet and being away from the bustle of London and don't mind spending on taxi service.,4,2022,04,15
122,Poor,"Tired hotel with poor customer service. We booked the Chelsea Harbour Hotel during a business trip. We will certainly not be booking again. The hotel is tired, the room we were allocated had not been decorated for at least 10-15years. The staff are uninterested and quite rude. The standard room rate is £220 per night + and in my honest opinion, is probably £100 per night over-priced.",2,2022,04,11
122,Disgusting service,"I am absolutely horrified, to say the least.We were two couples staying here, in 2 rooms.Horrible check in experience as one in the party not have ID on her.Hostile and angry staff.When I went down to the lobby  to check out, I was met with an angry man,saying I was in the way and the area was closed due to the football players staying there that night. I was very confused, saying I was about to check out, and my husband was on his way down, as we were leaving.I was told I could not be there, and had to move.I (horrified)did this,and moved to the side,outside of the lobby area. After a minute he came back,angrily told me again I had to move as the lobby was closed.  I said to him I am not part of the football fans,and I am checking out, clearly stating my confusion of what I am, or where I am meant to be!He again angrily said to move to behind the barriers, or leave (!!),and I could not be there.I was absolutely horrified by this disgusting behaviour,being a paying guest, literally doing what one is meant to be doing at the end of ones stay!I might point out he was in no way discreet, and embarrassed me in front of a large crowd.I raised this horrifying experience to the staff at the desk,who just looked at me mute, without even answering.If there are certain policies in place due to""VIP""guests staying,then we should have been informed about this when checking in!We could have been advised to avoid a certain check out time, or been told to avoid the area between a certain time",1,2022,04,09
122,fabulous service & very clean,what a fabulous place this is - a real find. My stay here provided a much needed rest. The room itself was spotlessly clean & the service provided by the staff was second to none. i would definitely stay here again,5,2022,03,29
122,Appalling given it was  fire alarm attended by 3 fire engines!,"Stayed here 3 weeks ago. Had afire alarm altered at 6am in morning and hotel vacated. Was a shambles! 2members of staff not know what was happening.  Guests inand out the buying, no one updating. No one checking guests names. Lifts still working, breakfast being served and guests told to stay in rooms! Over 2hours of utter shambles with no updates or contact.
Eventually ops guy arrived and started telling people.
Since written to them and still no response. Used messenger and they are useless. 
Yet another hotel that is happy taking your money which seems at any cost and rubbish at customer care skills.

Management don't respond
No one answers the phone 

AVOID",2,2022,03,06
122,Birthday Rest,A lovely peaceful hotel. My  room with a balcony was spacious and very clean and cozy. The staff were very polite. When I came to book my room a young gentleman called Micheal Williams at the reception was very professional and helped me with my booking online as I forgotten my reading glasses. He went above and beyond in his job. It was a nice 2 night stay and walking distance to kings road and Harrods was very energising. A Pleasant stay for me. ,5,2022,03,03
122,Such a downfall on previous visits,"Not sure what has happened to this hotel. Had great times staying here in the past. Now everything has gone backwards. 
We got back from a day out in London at 10pm to be told the bar was shut. We where told by one member of staff that we could order food and drink in from outside, which we did.
Before it even arrived we where told to go to our rooms as we where not allowed to sit in the bar or lobby area. (Member of staff named Ali advised us the duty manager had told him to remove us). Never been told to go to bed at 10:30pm since I was a child!! 
This was even before our food arrived!! So there we where, sat in our room waiting for a takeaway in a so called 5 star hotel. 
We had a number of other disappointments on our stay, £40 parking per night, room mini bar no longer available to name a couple. 
We won’t be staying here again and advise against anyone else. Such a great hotel gone backwards.",1,2022,03,01
122,Avoid this place by all means!,"The saga of events:
- Waiting 2 hrs for check in although have checked in online already (‘Skip the queue’ they said, ‘enjoy more time’ they said). System problems of course… Happy that it wasn’t my fault after all. 
- Some dirt ‘residue’ on the toilet seat, hoping it’s cleaning agent. 
- Room with balcony, so far so nice. However, the lamp on the balcony cannot be switched off in the room because it looks so nice from the outside AND you cannot close the curtain - there is a 1m gap for the light to come in. It’s a known design issue, they said. 
- Plastic pollution in the broccoli (dinner menu), sharp. Luckily not injured. The bar manager was the only person met who really took care and als nulled the whole dinner bill. 
The worst: As mentioned by others already they are sorry but not really. Nothing happens (only the bar manager as mentioned above, fair enough). Don’t get attracted by false 5*. Spend a little more money and get a decent place!",1,2022,03,01
122,Somebody might get hurt one day - stay away,"Lovely patient staff but this hotel is run down and we had an unpleasant experience. Two hours stood in the road in dressing gowns after a fire hazard set off alarms ( we imagine due to a lack of maintenance). The staff didn’t know whether to evacuate us or not. Only on the smell of smoke did we chose to leave and call the fire brigade ourselves. The fire brigade did find a problem and guests weren’t properly looked after.Sauna and steam rooms were in changing rooms so be aware couples can’t spa together. The pool is dirty and people were slipping on stairs. Waiting for a cracked head here - three guests slipped. They also had dirty towels in spa area left for hours. Our waiter spilt our wine on every pour, we had to teach him to twist the bottle. Calamari was pale and soggy, sent back. Windows wouldn’t open. Stained walls and carpets. Empty mini fridge. The staff are really nice however the hotel is run down - see pic. 

Update: We have now been liaising with the staff over the refund they agreed but did not action on our account. The manager advised us that a refund would be made at the front desk and left no instruction for them. It is a completely shambles. Whilst we understand there are staff shortages, we are considerate and understanding of the current climate, however it has been quite tiring trying to get matters resolved. The hotel have offered us a free night but we have declined and they are still not responding to our request for a refund. 

Avoid!",1,2022,02,23
122,So disappointed,"The Spa is nothing more than a noisy pool and two tiny sauna and steam rooms .
The pool was incredibly busy with a hen party as well as other guests 
There are only 6 beds and there were at least 20 people .
Towels, robes shoes every where .
So noisy , added to by a child screaming and yelling and splashing in the pool . 
Not a place to relax more like the local council pool .",2,2022,02,20
122,In need of serious investment,"Lift not working with laissez-faire attitude when informed that someone had been stuck for half an hour.  Poor breakfast with sweaty hash browns and overcooked bacon. A few tiny boxes of Kellogg's and miniature pastries. No alternative milks, nuts, dried fruits.  Staff will try to give vile coffee from a vat unless you specifically request a proper one (which are nice). Breakfast staff are friendly. 

Nothing like as nice as a Premier Inn.

Rooms in need of a refresh and unbearably hot. 
Very nice pool, although the slippery flights of stairs to access the changing rooms are a health and safety disaster. Decent gym. 

2* at best.",1,2022,02,15
122,This so not 5 star,"People never know who people are so guest and customer service should be paramount at all times .
I booked with Secret escapes ..a discount sight ..I was asked in online check in requests .I asked for a view of the marina if possible .
The most coldest of welcomes .A sour faced girl on reception hobbling around on a crutch poor girl .I ve worked in all the 5 stars on Park Lane where welcome stars with the Doorman .
And all these things cost nothing should be inherent of 5 star training ..
Up to suite 107 ..which over looks the car park ..
It's tired dated a nice size but freezing cold .
I just knew it wouldn't be 5 star exp and couldn't  be bothered to complain .
We go to the Spa for a swim...its a nice pool..sauna ..but as we enter the changing room dirty wet towels and robes are strewn all over a bin of tissues cups etc is full to the brim .A 5 star would have this attended to and checked every half an hour .
Swim was nice tho ..
The hotel had no atmosphere it was nt that full .
It was not 5 star service at breakfast it was a Butlins holiday camp exp ..trying to find cups plates spoons ..no method to it ..seat the guest make sure the table is set ..attend their tea and coffee requirements ..The breakfast was tasty plenty of choice but lacked service ..a waiter was asked where the guest could get a straw for child's drink ..he asked his manager ..from the bar ..the bar he says to the guest ..it should have been I will get one for you sir ..that's 5 star service .
We enjoyed our stay but it is in no way 5 star .
The check was the same no how was your stay no thankyou no have a safe journey etc..l just wanted to make sure my deposit was replaced...I askedfor a receipt ..the guy looked at me like I was a leper..your a secret escapes booking ..contact them for a receipt.
I said no a receipt that you have returned the deposit for incidentals ..
107 is the secret escapes room we giggled or the Staff training fire suite perhaps  !!
It was clean etc ..
But as my dear old mama used to say 
You cant polish a turd !
Staff training on service is needed just a smile and a welcome or is that not meant for secret escape guests ? !!!",3,2022,02,13
122,5* Service,"We stayed at the Chelsea harbour on a date weekend for my partner’s birthday.
We received a complimentary upgrade which was  arranged by the lovely Natalia which was such a lovely touch!
Marina view room on the 5th floor was incredibly spacious felt so homely and lovely, we had two bathrooms and a very comfortable bed, own living room seating area with a wonderful balcony view of the marina which was very pretty at night.
Room service was prompt and efficient

Breakfast was delicious And the spa facilities were great, 
Can’t fault our stay and would definitely return and recommend! X",4,2022,02,12
122,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely weekend break at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. Check in took a little while as there only seemed to be 1 member of staff. Looking at pictures on both the hotel website and trip advisor I was very pleasantly surprised with our room, it was huge! There was a living room/ area with sofa, tv, desk and tea/coffee station. The bathroom was off the bedroom and was very luxurious, with a bath, shower, his and hers sinks and separate toilet. The bedroom was also lovely with a huge bed and dressing table/ getting ready area. I really felt like the pictures do not do the rooms justice so would recommend Chelsea harbour take some more up to date ones! 

The only reason this hotel doesn’t get 5 stars from me is due to the “spa”. We went down around 5.30 (after the children's swim time) and it was very busy. The layout was very confusing, with the mens changing rooms being on a whole different floor to the woman’s. The whole place lacked in any kind of signs or hints of where anything was. The pool was cold and the loungers badly laid out, with not enough of them. On top of this, we discovered (they weren’t sign posted) that the saunas and steam rooms were in the male and female changing rooms? Whilst I partly understand this my partner and I did not end up using them as we found this rather odd, we’d have preferred to be together.

We had a comfortable nights sleep and whilst we were next to imperial wharf station, were not disturbed by noise. Breakfast was incredible, with buffet style hot food as well as fruit, yogurt, cold meats and pastries. Again, I cannot fault this.

Overall, a great stay, but do not go for the sake of the “spa”, it’s not worth the money.",4,2022,02,06
122,Perfect weekend,"Perfect location, a hidden gem just 30 minutes from KingsX, birthday weekend was made super special, suites are fantastic, views are superb, service was amazing (especially Vera). We will definitely be back.",5,2022,01,30
122,Disappointed,"Shocking. 
We came here 4 years ago and had an amazing experience so we wanted to come back. We was let down 2020 due to covid and our booking was sadly cancelled but was told when we come at a later date we would be well looked after. 
I pre booked afternoon tea for 2pm but when we arrived they didn’t have a booking and this was a stressful experience needing to send a email to the waitress to confirm our booking. We was struggling to find the email so this became very stressful, at a 5 star  hotel you would not expect to do this. The afternoon tea didn’t come out to us until an hour after arriving by this point I was even more annoyed ! 
I wasn’t happy with the service! 

We then booked dinner for 8pm which was disappointing- staff were lovely and I could fault them but the drinks menu was a disaster- no cocktails and no gin ??? What sort of restaurant doesn’t have pink gin or a cocktail menu. When we came 4 years ago this was all available so why isn’t it now??? 

I wouldn’t be rushing back like I wanted to last time.",1,2022,01,30
122,Good but not that good.,"The location is superb. Clear views over the marina with no traffic noise at all.
The staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly.
Reception, bar, dining areas, lifts and corridors are immaculate.
The room safe wasn't working. When I queried this I was informed that it hadn't been working for some time. I was offered the reception's safe facility but declined. Wandering to reception and back just to put a few items in a safe isn't my idea of convenient.
The pool and spa are clean but the steam room wasn't working on my visit. I suggest you research the 'kids swim times' before you go for a dip though.
My room was clean but old and tired. The carpet in the bedroom needs cleaning, the chairs in the suite need cleaning, there was a some damp in my bathroom and the bed was just a big sunken hole on one side. The water cistern in the seperate toilet was about to fall off.
Room service was great despite the menu in the room not refelceting what was available. The food was delicious, I wish my stay had been longer so I could sample more.
A hat tip to the bell boy who walked out to the main road to flag me a taxi.
Would I return? Kinda 50/50 because of the flaws I've listed. Sort those out and I'd book with confidence every time.",3,2022,01,30
122,Hit and miss,"I had a 2 night business stay here. The first night I was placed in a room that was unbearably hot (in mid-January) where the air-con didn't work. The room also had more minor issues; it had a very weak shower and many of the walls and items of furniture were marked or disfigured in some way, which you don't really expect in this price range. After (foolishly) trying to tolerate the temperature for my first night, on the second day I asked to be moved to a room with air con. The staff were extremely helpful and efficient in arranging this, immediately providing me with an alternative room that had none of the issues the first room had, and was extremely comfortable. I was very happy with the second room, but I must confess I am confused about why the hotel would have placed any guest in the first room when it was clearly not fit for purpose at that time. The cleanliness throughout the hotel was to a good standard, and most of the staff were excellent. The rooms are impressive in their size and have some nice features like good coffee machines,  but feel rather dated",3,2022,01,29
122,Terrible service,"Partner stayed with young son, 1.5 hours for room service, dozen of calls to reception during stay, nobody ever answers or calls back, different staff daily and have no clue, so under staffed. Half the food items not available, even the staff agree that its very poor. The hotel itself is nice, not five star in any way but its the staff that make the place and one star is too much for this place.",1,2022,01,15
122,"Terrible Stay, Avoid","Booked two rooms for New Years Eve after contacting the hotel to ensure the Spa would be open, it was not. despite assurances that it would be. The rooms were dirty, the air conditioning did not work making the room unbearably hot, the bed was uncomfortable with worn out scratchy bed linen and to top it all the toilet seat in my daughters room was covered in urine and had clearly not been cleaned from the previous occupant. Our complaints were brushed aside with the comment ""the hotel business is changing"" I requested a reduction in the rate due to lack of facilities and the problems with the rooms and was asked would i return in the future when i said it was unlikely the reply was then why should we adjust the rate. Terribly disappointing.",1,2022,01,05
122,2 nights with family,"We came with three young kids and a grandparent and had two rooms. The hotel was beautiful, clean and staff were very welcoming. The river view suits have beautiful views of the London skyline as well as the harbour. All the suits are very big. 

We had our first night in the Chelsea suit which had a big bedroom and also separate living room and lovely bathroom with bath and shower. The main difference between this and the riverside room was the view. 

The breakfast was perfect and in such a beautiful restaurant over looking the harbour. We had dinner at the bar and the food was delicious and service was excellent. We think out waiter’s name was Eduardo. 

The man on reception was called Martin and he was very helpful as we changed rooms etc. 

We will definitely be coming back here and had a really lovely break.",5,2022,01,03
122,SPA BREAK FOR NEW YEARS EVE / DAY DISASTER.,"Its been far from a happy new year with this hotel! 
My wife booked an over night stay for us for 31st Dec until 1st Jan 22 at your hotel. We were told check in was 3pm, so we checked into the hotel at 5pm. Upon arrival we was told by reception that the spa has been closed last minute due to staffing issues and will not be open over the new year. We booked your hotel for a spa break to spend some quality time together as a way to celebrate the new year. We both work very hard, and as a way of rewarding ourselves we thought  why not book into a spa hotel for NY. To be told this has closed due to staffing issues upon arrival is not good from the hotel which advertises itself as a spa hotel. Furthermore that same evening at 6pm, my wife tried to book a table in the restaurant for both of us. We was told that the restaurant is closed and again will not be open over the new year. The manager said the restaurant has been shut since September. Again, no mention of this prior to us booking. Myself and my wife then had  to try and book last minute a table for two om new years eve, which was like finding a needle in a haystack. We tried every restaurant in the area but because it was new years eve everywhere was fully booked, we had to result in ordering a pizza takeaway which we ate in our hotel room.

The next morning NYD, upon check out, we spoke to the hotel manager about our the lack of services and asked for a refund. The hotel manager  was very unhelpful and said we need to make an offical complaint.

This hotel has been a huge let down. You falsly advertise your facilities and services to entice people to stay. The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is not the hotel is tries to portray itself. Its a hotel that scams people and you are in breach of the consumers right act!",1,2022,01,02
122,Breakfast,"During my stay at the hotel, I enjoy having breakfast at the restaurant, they have very nice selection of hot and cold buffet together with the excellent service and smiles from the staff especially Vera, Maria, Tracy, Mariana and Adrian. 

My wife and myself wish the staff a happy and prosperous new year.",5,2021,12,31
122,Satisfied with stay,"Parking is a little confusing on arrival
Speedy access to room as checked in on line. 

Suite very spacious and clean with good views of the harbour. Carpets looking a little tired!
No breakfast tea bags in room which is a little unusual.

Breakfast was okay with hot food served from chaffing dishes which is always difficult to keep food hot. Tea I think should be served in pots rather served from a type of flask

A good 4star hotel not 5stars 

A big thanks to Alex H for looking after us throughout our stay",4,2021,12,24
122,"Amazing stay, would highly recommend","Absolutely amazing stay. Best thing about the hotel is the staff, they were so friendly yet professional. Service was fantastic! Hotel was lovely and relaxing. Spa and pool were great and not overly crowded. Massage was good. Rooms were so big! We had a 10 month old baby and she was able to have her own area in her cot in the lounge. It worked so well. Price was really reasonable for London as well! We would 100% go back and recommend!",5,2021,12,16
122,Great Value For Money,"My wife and I returned to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel last night, and it was excellent value for money. 
The gym, pool and spa have now fully reopened and the hotel staff were excellent (as always). The location is great, all the rooms are suites, parking is ideal, and the prices are fantastic value.",5,2021,12,09
122,EXCELLENT........FAULTLESS,A most wonderful and enjoyable weekend spent at our favourite hotel. It is literally a mile from our home here in Chelsea but we do love to be pampered. When we have friends and family we always enjoy a lovely lunch or dinner here. The staff are so attentive and it is quite superb in all aspects,5,2021,12,07
122,"Overall, a nice stay","We booked parking via 'Your parking space' at £15 for 24 hours in the Harbour car park, it was easy to locate and exits into the marina, just a short stroll to the front of the hotel. 
Check in was speedy and friendly (I did the pre check in online, but dupliated it again at the desk, so I wouldn't bother with the online check in next time). 
We took a look at the menu online (there aren't menu's in the room) and tried to call room service, after 15 mins we decided to go to the bar/restaurant. 
The staff in the restaurant were friendly, but the menu on the website is out of date (my 2 year old wanted chicken nuggets but had to settle for just chips as nuggets aren't on the new menu).  
Overall the room/suite is very nice, it could do with a once over from a handyman, for example (bathroom light switch has gaps around the edges, could be solved in about 2 mins with some grout / silicone). 
The previous guest decided we needed a 6am alarm call on the clock radio - lesson learned, next time we'll check it ourselves. 
The main TV wouldn't tune to many of the channels - didn't worry us as we took advantage of the 'cast' and were able to cast netflix from our iphones which we were pleased about. 
We didn't see a receptionist on check out, and nobody made an effort to thank us for visiting, we checked out online and headded off to the car park. The hotel is a great location for access to the thames river boat - we took the boat to the London attractions, then caught the train back, 

Even with some simple niggles (listed above) we were pleased with our visit and would be happy to return.",5,2021,12,06
122,Amazing service and beautiful room,"I have spent the night here on the day of my wedding. 
We were welcomed with a great smile by the gentleman who did our check in.  He was very polite and patient while I took ages trying to find my card.  Later  on my husband went to get us some hot drinks but we were pleasantly surprised when they knocked on the door with a beautiful plate of chocolates and two glasses of champagne.  The room was gorgeous too. I really enjoyed my stay here",5,2021,11,30
122,Wife’s 50th Birthday Celebration Turns Into A Nightmare!!!,"I booked a room (Chelsea King Suite) with breakfast on Sat 27 Nov 2021 for my wife and I to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Spa in Chelsea, London. After checking in to our room, we noted the room was very cold so turned on the aircon to full heat (30 degrees) before we visited the spa to find a small pool area with limited loungers which were all taken and separate steam rooms/saunas for men and women. We wanted to be together, not separated. Had I known this, I would not have booked the hotel. On return to the room, we noted that the 2 aircon vents were blowing out cold air only with a very low flow. The bedroom was very cold. So cold that we stayed under the duvet with our clothes on to maintain some warmth. I phoned Reception to report this and a maintenance person came to the room to resolve. After 20-30 mins which included a large part of the ceiling being opened to gain access to the aircon units which created dirt/dust in the air and floor, we started to get some warmer air but the flow was very minimal/inadequate to heat the room and the maintenance person said he could not fully resolve the issue without bleeding the whole system. We were not happy with this (not wanting to breath in dirt/dust) so packed our suitcase and went to Reception to report the issue to a senior manager (Mr Sukh Dhillon - Front Office Manager), and express our complete dissatisfaction at this situation and request another room. Initially Mr Dhillon informed us that they were fully booked but they could place heaters into the room which we said was not acceptable due to dirt/dust that had already been created in the room. Despite initially saying they were fully booked, Mr Dhillon then said there was a twin room available to which we confirmed that was not acceptable for us as we’d paid for a King Suite and wanted like for like. Mr Dhillon then said that they had an accessible suite available to which we said, we would like to view it first. A few seconds later, we were informed by Mr Dhillon that the person who was checking in at that time had taken the accessible room. At this point, with no viable solution to the issue in hand and as we were completely dismayed by the very poor and incompetent service, I requested a full refund for the room/breakfast (total of £192.44). However, Mr Dhillon explained that as I had booked via Trip.com, any refund would have to be processed by Trip.com on Monday. We asked for this to be confirmed in writing. In addition, the complimentary chocolates and bottle of bubbly which was given to us by the hotel (delivered to our room) was promptly whisked away by a staff member, just prior to the discussion with Mr Dhillon. The final straw of this awful experience was as we were sitting in the hotel reception area trying to find alternative accommodation in London, a hotel staff member (not Mr Dhillon) approached us and proceeded to tell us that the table we were sitting at in a largely empty reception area was now reserved. He then placed a reserved table block on the table and said “we have got 5 minutes before I shut you down”. My wife asked him to repeat what he’d just said as we thought we had misheard him and he again proceeded to say “you’ve got 5 mins before I shut you down”. His aggressive tone and demeanour towards us was disgraceful and consequently we both left the hotel in disgust. Given that we had planned this for my wife’s 50th birthday for many weeks, we are absolutely disgusted by the appalling service and treatment we received from this hotel. It goes without saying that this is completely unacceptable. I have never experienced such a disgraceful, unprofessional service and non-caring attitude of contempt towards paying customers. A so called 5-star hotel (I would say 3 at best) with minus 5 service level and customer experience. Give this hotel a very wide berth for its unprofessional, non-caring and disgraceful treatment of their customers!!!",1,2021,11,28
122,SHOCKING . If you have somewhere to be at a certain time DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL,"I was in a queue of people at 4pm waiting to check in which is normally 3pm. Majority were told rooms not ready. Apart from one lovely Liverpool lady who was given her key - to find there were other guests already staying in the same room !!
5.35pm was given a key to a room. 6 floors up and then another 6 floors down becaus ekey didnt work. I did not have a key for the whole period i was in the hotel because the one room they gave me had a fault with the lock !
Then the safe - was locked so they gave me a code to open it and put my belongings in because by now i was running late. Returned after the match and safe wouldnt open ! They said would have to wait til engineer 8am next day !!
- He came and 25 mins later could not open it .He was helpful as he could be and loaned me his personal mobile charger as mine was in safe so mobile went flat !! And was told after i had to call reception for an update that i  would have to wait til between 11am- 1pm.  
If you have somewhere to be at a certain time DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL !!",1,2021,11,25
122,Thank you Vera!!,"Our stay at Chelsea Harbour was amazing, an incredibly plush hotel for my girlfriends 28th. A massive massive thank you goes to Vera for making our stay extra special, putting on an amazing breakfast spread with a happy birthday message on room service when it wasn’t being offered as standard. My girlfriend and I are super appreciative for the effort that went in from you and your staff!",5,2021,11,21
122,No Corby trouser press,"I was very excited to be staying in the heart of the ‘Made in Chelsea’ set, the Chelsea Harbour hotel seemed the perfect staging post for reality TV career. But after a whole weekend of pouting around the bar, the best contract  I was offered was for PPE supply. I can only attribute this to my slightly creased trousers. When I have stayed in similar hotels in Chelmsford and Newcastle I have been offered contracts for ‘eau de chelmer’ and fog mascara and closing these deals where solely thanks to the Corby trouser press, which is conspicuously absent in this hotel. I would not recommend for the serious business traveller like myself. Breakfast was very nice and rescued the.m star rating somewhat",5,2021,11,19
122,"Stylish, modern Hotel on Chelsea Harbour",Great location  on Cheksea Harbour . Stylish and modern hotel. The Hotel dominates the Harbour but in a nice way. Great views getting better on higher floored suites. It is an all suite Hotel with varying grades available. Ibstaued here years ago when it was The Conrad. Service levels were high then and this has not changed. Entry level suites are very comfortable. Lovely bar / restaurant terrace to front of hotel directly overlooking the Harbour. ,5,2021,11,16
122,Conference Venue,"After 2 years of COVID 'lockdown' we gathered our professionals together for a major conference at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel mid-November.  The venue landed itself well to such an event, with well placed session rooms and a separate exhibition, refreshments and networking hall.  Lunch was then provided just adjacent to the exhibition hall, allowing delegates to easily move between the two.
The conference and hotel team at the Chelsea Harbour were excellent, being very supportive during the event and responding to emerging needs and any issues quickly and positively.
The overall experience was very positive, and a big thanks to 'Chris', our go to man each day for helping us sort those 'on the day' operational matters like the need for an extra table or slight change to times!",4,2021,11,16
122,We had a great time!,"We stayed for one night in September for my birthday celebration.  The staff were very helpful and kind.

The rooms and bathrooms were very spacious and clean.  The bedroom had a separate spacious lounge and the bathroom, a separate shower and bath. However, on our arrival, most of the bathroom items had not been replenished, the toilet bin had not been lined and the bathrooms were generally not very clean.
We called in housekeeping and this was promptly rectified.

We had dinner and breakfast, all lovely. Wide variety for breakfast and huge and delicious portions for dinner. 

The location is excellent, with a train station a few minutes walking distance nearby, buses round the corner as well as the high street with shops not too far off.
Beautiful area, beautiful riverside location for nice lovely walks.

Generally, the rooms and especially the bathrooms are tired and need major updating.
The hotel also needs to install more phone lines as call waiting times for inquiries or even the spa is ridiculous,",4,2021,11,16
122,Very diasappointing afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel on Sunday, October 18. The afternoon tea was a late birthday gift for my dad and at the time I made the reservation, I had requested that there would be no sandwiches with white bread. I also advised that one of the people attending was a pescatarian. I also told the receptionist the afternoon tea was a birthday celebration. When we arrived on Sunday, the very first thing we were asked was whether or not we had pre paid. 
We were then left to our own devices to work out where to sit, and eventually were told that we could sit anywhere we wanted. 

We sat down at a table, which had sticky marks and so I had to ask the waitress to wipe the table. The waitress then asked what sort of tea we wanted. My dad selected coffee. I said I would like tea and asked what type of tea, she had. The waitress looked back blankly at me said, What kind of tea do you want? I then had to ask whether or not there was a menu of teas, which would give me an idea of the selection that was available . This was brought over and I ordered my tea. When the afternoon tea itself turned up there were white bread sandwiches, contrary to my request. Also, there were sandwiches with meat. Again, ignoring the fact that I had specified that one of the people attending was pescatarian. The sandwiches were average at best. There was one extremely strange stodgy white bread sandwich with cucumber, and I think about a half an inch of butter. It was deeply unpleasant and my dad who is not normally the sort of person to complain about anything said he'd never tasted anything quite like that before. The scones were small. Only one of them had fruit and so I offered that to my dad, his reply to me was, I like fruit scones but not burnt offerings. We were not told anything about the food that we were eating so had no idea about what was actually inside any of the sandwiches, nor what any of the sweets were. When I got up to go to the toilet. I told the waitress that we had requested pescatarian sandwiches and no white bread. She said that she hadn't been told anything by the front desk and wasn't aware of that request. I'm not sure why this would have been the case given that I gave front desk the information relevant to our booking at the time of making the reservation. The waitress managed to get additional sandwiches. These turned up about 10 minutes later, when we had already moved on to the scones. Neither the food nor service was in any way consistent with a 5 star hotel and it was totally different to my last visit to the Chelsea Harbour club for afternoon tea which was simply amazing. The whole experience felt slapdash, there was a lack of attention to detail and the quality of the food was poor. Certainly not fitting for a five star hotel.

I contacted the Chelsea Harbour hotel to let them know about the experience.  After more than 2 weeks there was no response at all.",3,2021,11,11
122,Nightmare Stay,"One of the Worst experience I had to undergo.
What supposed be a memorable experience quickly turned into a worst nightmare.  today was my wife's 40th Birthday, to celebrate the once in a lifetime occasion, Myself, my wife and my teenage son checked in to have some memorable time.  I booked a Suite, Marina View King with the intention of a good view, balcony, privacy.
Upon arrival we found my Son’s Ben was broken, when we were checking the bed, my  14 year old son found a used condoms cover on floor and asked me what's this.  The most embarrassing situation a Father can foresee, definitely not this day, not this situation.  Having a teenage Son and finding out these filthy stuffs in one of the so called prestigious Hotel, my nightmare just started. We also found bunch of hairs, marks and strain all over the carpet, all the cabinets had a layer of dusts.

After many many calls to house keeping and reception and after more than an hour later some one came to attend, he said he cannot fix the bed, instead he suggested to fix ourself (suggested to place some pillows under the head rest so the bed can be straight).. what a pathetic way to tell the guests, this is just the beginning.  No one came to our room to guide next steps, after repeated calls to the housekeeping and reception the duty manager came after 2 hours of checking in.  We missed our dinner reservation because no one could attend us in time.  We were left with no room, we did not freshen up, we missed our dinner… all because of the pathetic service.
After repeated requests we were taken from the 6th floor King Suite (the room I booked) to 3rd floor with the room half the size of the room I booked, no privacy, no doors between the room, dirty balcony, 

All the planning I did was waste of time as the room was downsized, with heavy cigarettes smell in the balcony with no view… We ended up sleeping with no choice , no privacy and with Cold take away food.  I will never recommend anyone to book this hotel...

I am going to post my experience in the facebook with all the evidence  like photographs tahts been taken so no one can experience this nightmare again….",1,2021,11,09
122,Great Hotel in London,"Really impressed with our 3 day stay here. Helpful staff, good food and lovely surroundings. 
Our kids had the pool almost to themselves and the spa facilities are wonderful.
Staff here were helpful, polite and we'll mannered. We met Hafiza on reception who guided us through everything we needed and was extremely helpful and welcoming.
A top review for a top hotel in such a great location.

122,Spacious rooms,"Very clean room
Plenty of space in this suite hotel
Comfortable beds, all amenity bathroom
Breakfast very nice in Brasserie overlooking Marina
Manager Vera was exceptionally efficient and welcoming, taking trouble to help with the buffet offering",5,2021,11,05
122,Preauthorisation payments withheld after payment  - be warned !,"Overall I really enjoyed the spa facilities and the staff in the spa were outstanding and professional . 
The room was impressive however the customer service has been very poor and disappointing. I paid my full bill on my departure yet this is my
First ever experience were a hotel withholds a preauthorisation for spa treatments that have been paid !!! 
I have contacted the hotel numerous times and been told it will be resolved this is nearly a week ago snd still ongoing !!!! this is causing me significant stress -be warned if you are planning to stay !",1,2021,11,04
122,Utterly Abysmal!,"I don’t normally write reviews (I am always skeptical of keyboard warriors/Karens on these things!) but this hotel warranted a bad one. Charging £200+ for a room per night you would expect cleanliness as a minimum, unfortunately The Chelsea Harbour Hotel couldn’t even get that right.

The room was dirty and there were stains on the floor (see photos). One of the stains looked like blood. There was dust in the bathroom and the whole room needed updating. It looked old and unkept and there were scratches all over the walls. 

The beds were terrible. Even the slightest movement it creaked. The pillows were non existent and felt like you were sleeping on the floor. Don’t get me started on the curtains…they reminded us of a dirty beige shower curtain! 

Unfortunately we didn’t have time to complain as we arrived at 23:30 at night and had to leave early for business in the morning but maybe it wasn’t a bad thing that we didn’t have to stay that long! 

If you are contemplating this hotel don’t. Spend your hard earned money else where. 

Utterly abysmal!",1,2021,11,02
122,Unorganised Chaos and No Longer a 5* Hotel,"It’s been a few years since we stayed here and I was so excited to take our friends for our 25th Wedding Anniversary celebrations. What a disappointment. Pre booked breakfast , evening meal and afternoon tea. We were never logged for breakfast so had to explain every morning how we had already paid , same for evening meal which we thought would be in the restaurant but was in fact in the bar area with two small tables pushed together and a choice of 2 meals which were just OK and definitely not worth the money we had paid … after this we decided to forget the afternoon tea! On arrival we were asked to pay , an extra £100 was taken just in case we had any extras and on check out today low and behold all the extras we had already included on our room at the time of booking was charged again. Be aware and check everything. The rooms are big but need a refurb. Everywhere looks dated. The cleanliness is great but then so is a Premier Inn. Would we return -  definitely not , we would recommend as a high end hotel - no. It’s hard to say who is at fault for the chaos but I would definitely advise trying somewhere else until the situation is sorted!",1,2021,11,01
122,Beautiful Hotel & Stay,"We arrived at the hotel, checked in and settled into our suite on the 4th floor.  The room was lovely, with a beautiful view of the marina.

The internet access streamed really well and both the bedroom and lounge had smart TV's with Sky Sports, allowing to mirror our phones.

The bathroom was spotless and the room had a mini fridge, safe and plenty of storage space for a family of 3 for a week.

Unfortunately, we did have to be moved due to some work on the floor below, however this was handled very efficiently and we were given an upgrade for the inconvenience where the views were even better and the suite had 2 toilets.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was of a high quality.  There was an excellent choice of buffet style continental options including meats, cheese, yoghurt, smoked salmon, cereals, fruit and danishes along with a cooked full English option which was replenished swiftly.

The pool area was very clean and had a lovely changing area complete with dressing gowns, towels, showers with all the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel following your swim and a swimsuit dryer!  My daughter and I didn't use the sauna or steam room, but these looked of good quality and other guests were using them.

The location is excellent 15 minute walk from Chelsea FC and Fulham Broadway underground and Imperial Wharf is the nearest overground about a 5 minute walk.

An excellent quiet location for a family stay in London.

122,A lovely hotel but they will charge you twice for a week!!,"We had a lovely stay in this hotel but they have preauthorised payment and taken payment for the hotel and the preauthorisation takes a week to come back so we are out of pocket and can't use the £437 in our account as it is frozen to going to them! No one seems to care when I contact them about this fact and they seem to think it is entirely normal... I've seen no other reviews saying this has happened.

I understand preauthorising payment but every other time I have stayed somewhere this has then become the payment.

Really sad they think this is the normal way to do business as we had a lovely stay otherwise.",1,2021,10,27
122,Unable to check in despite having secured booking,"I booked this hotel via Booking.com, giving my credit card details. I travelled from Scotland for a course at the neighbouring Design Centre and arrived on Sunday evening. I went to check in and said I would be paying with ApplePay.  The hotel said I would need a card. This was never stipulated at the time of booking. I told the hotel that my credit card was registered on the booking and I had all my credit cards registered on my phone.  I also offered a bank transfer. The Duty Manager told me I could withdraw cash for the first night. I explained I couldn’t because I only had ApplePay and no cards. He was extremely unhelpful and cancelled my booking. I was turned out onto the street, in the dark, in the middle of nowhere with my suitcase, a single woman travelling alone.  I had to walk the streets in the dark trying to find another hotel, which I eventually did and they accepted ApplePay on booking. ApplePay is a normal way to pay. The lack of customer service was astounding (the Duty Manager didn’t even get up from his seat to speak to me) and the fact he was wanting to cancel my 3 night booking and turn a single woman into the dark with nowhere to go was breathtaking considering the ongoing concern for women’s safety.",1,2021,10,26
122,Worst experience ever -Angel of death to customer service,"I have been staying at this hotel pretty regularly during lockdown for work, each time booking a suite and it has been fine because I was literally the only person staying. This time however I can't stress how frightful my stay was and I actually felt threatened by the duty Manager Angel who is probably the most unprofessional rude and odious person I have ever dealt with.

I booked a marina view suite for £367 per night and phoned to request parking too. On arrival a very nice guy Alex (who was the hotels only asset during my stay) and he helped me unload my car (I had load of clothes because I used the hotel for dancers to try on their clothes that they will wear in a TV ad) and he said unfortunately they had no parking-not a big deal I went to a car park round the corner and paid my £50. I walked back to the hotel where there was a huge queue for check in. Once I finally got to the front I was ushered to another side desk and informed that they didn't have a room for me. I asked why they had let me empty over 25 outfits on hanging rails from my car and let me go and pay £50 for parking just got a shrug. I was quite insistent they found me a room and they offered me a single but I explained as we had a wardrobe day planned the dancers needed privacy the guy was so rude and I said why not contact before arrival so I could find somewhere else he said ""I couldn't be bothered"". Eventually after much wrangling they found me a suite of sorts but definitely not to the calibre or price value I had booked and it certainly hadn't been cleaned it was dirty. I went down to reception to try and get some money off my stay as this room was not a rack rate of £367 but listed as a £200 room. This is where I had to deal with Angel the absolutely menacing duty manager who refused to help and actually said they had tried to move me on because they thought a single woman travelling alone would be easier!!!! He ended up actually looming over me so I gave up because he is a great hulking bloke with a mean demeanour. Later that evening I tried to order rude service and Angel took great delight in just hanging up on me having let me know first he was answering the phone. In the end I had to go down to the restaurant and order room service and ended up in tears of frustration. Honestly a scary vile experience the wheels are falling off at the this hotel.

The next day the whole sorry debacle continued my colleague and I ordered lunch on the terrace thinking it would be quicker than going elsewhere before dress rehearsals. 1 hour later we got cold club sandwich and chips each-which my colleague returned 1/2 an hour later we got an even colder version with fatty bacon it was inedible. The bar was loaded with dirty dishes and everyone on the terrace was complaining and having to wait an age. What an utter disgrace the only thing that is 5 star here is the location it is a dirty, poorly staffed and basically if I could give this review a minus I would",1,2021,10,25
122,What has happened to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel?,"We have stayed several times at the Chelsea Harbour, although it has been two or three or since our last visit.  We could not believe how much the standards have dropped and I completely agree with some of the poor reviews on this site.  On this occasion we booked three rooms and had rhapsodized to our family members about the rooms, the marina view, the beautiful bed linen, the service etc.  In reality, the hotel looks dated, dirty and poorly managed.  The bed linen was scratchy and worn out, the furnishing/decor looks sparce and cheap, chairs in the main lounge and breakfast room covered in stains and the service was absolutely appalling.  Cheap buffet breakfast - had to ask three times for a coffee.   It resembles a hotel that is in financial trouble and very poorly managed  such a shame as it used to be a lovely place to stay.  We will definitely not be returning!",2,2021,10,25
122,Lovely suite but overall disappointed,"Fur coat no nickers, very nice suite but service is not what you would expect from a hotel of this level, I asked for a taxi for 8-30 but was told to use Uber, breakfast was like a cheap budget hotel buffet, dried out scrambled eggs , just don’t expect the personal touch you get from other hotels that you get in similar priced hotels in London.
They seemed to have their regulars that get the special touch but otherwise it’s like a premier inn",3,2021,10,24
122,Very nice room but overall Disappointed,"Fur coat but no nickers .
Very nice suite , there was no personal touch like other hotels we have stayed in for similar money, the breakfast was probably the most disappointing part of the experience, dried out scrambled eggs and tomatoes, a bit like a cheap budget hotel buffet.
The milestone hotel is similar money but they make you feel like they want you there.
I asked for a taxi to be ordered for 8-30 but was told to use Uber .
I think they have their regulars that they will do every for but if you are not in that bracket , don’t expect the special treatment",3,2021,10,24
122,Marina views ,"All suite 5 star luxury, well decorated, helpful reception staff, Bell boys and reception staff. Very limited parking om site but nearby public car park just a few minutes away 

We stayed in a marina view room with balcony, lovely to overlook the marina and buildings all around the marina so no view of the river. The room is well maintained, large living room and bedroom with two bathrooms. The balcony is pretty spacious with outdoor seating. Breakfast is in the restaurant overlooking the harbour, buffet style with a reasonably good variety and quality of food.
There is an on site spa and swimming pool with designated times for children's swimming.

While we were there, the whole Chelsea football team were staying which is supposedly a regular occurrence!",4,2021,10,23
122,A relaxing break at a well positioned hotel with good amenities and service,"I had exceptionally spacious accommodation - bedroom with ensuite, separate bath and shower cubicle and separate WC (plus a separate second one), anda dressing area:  and spacious living room with balcony overlooking the marina.
The hotel is now quite old so furnishings a little 'bashed' but otherwise very comfortable and pleasant, particularly the bar, bistro and terrace.  Lovely swimming pool.",4,2021,10,20
122,Got married at the hotel and booked a total of 8 rooms.,Got married at the Chelsea harbour hotel and booked a total of 8 rooms and the drake suite for the wedding. Communication with reservations team and events team was not great but Manuel and Simon had taken care of all. Want to honestly say a special thanks to Simon Seis. He was so calm and understanding from the beginning an was their whenever I needed anything done. If it was not for Simon’s professionalism and due diligence am not sure if the wedding would have went to plan. Having someone who understands the stress of a wedding an there to assist you whenever you need was really helpful for me. Simon gets 5 stars from me!! Their was issues with our stay and celebration but would not give a low rating as it takes away the credit from from the special few made it all possible.,4,2021,10,20

Lovely location, nice view from balconies Harbour side and that's it!
You will get shouted at from the chubby guy at the bar and told to go and sit down if you dare to ask for a drink, filthy carpets, stained bedding and staff and Manager who have all obviously given up!
Oh hopefully you won't have to use the phone by the pool!

122,Very Disappointing,"I stayed at this hotel about 8 years and really liked the quiet location however while it still looks like a luxury hotel it falls far short of the expected standard.  During a 2 night stay with my wife we got stick in a lift, the sheets on our bed we stained with a burn mark or oil, the cups with the coffee machine were covered in lipstick and had used sugar in the bottom, the toilet seat was broken and the shower control knob came off in my hand.  We reported all to the front desk and did not even receive an apology.  To be fair they attempted to fix the toilet seat (not fully) and changed the sheets.

Very disappointing overall.  They did send me a note asking for a review so here it is!",2,2021,10,18

122,Do not stay here unless you want to sleep on filthy sheets,"This hotel ‘made up’ a bed with filthy bed sheets. Unfortunately for us, we arrived late and didn’t check the sheets properly before getting our heads down to sleep. I woke at 5 in the morning, pulled back the sheets and saw some stains on the inside of the quilt. I realised, to my horror that they weren’t stains that had remained after a wash but they were in fact dried on food to sheets which clearly hadn’t been washed- I woke my mum, who was sleeping next to me and we then discovered a whole crouton between our 2 pillows. We felt so disgusted to have slept in the dirty sheets.my mum was physically shaking. 

Whilst the hotel did change our rooms, the second room had dirty carpets and we are still waiting for the issue to be resolved. I have called the hotel 38 times since 13th September and have been fobbed off by them telling me they will call/email to deal with my issue. They’ve also failed to check me out as my room is still an ‘unresolved case’ and so I’m still waiting for my £100 deposit that I paid on arrival.

I booked via Secret Escapes, who are now taking the case on and they’ve yet to receive any correspondence from the hotel for 8 days now- the service has been truly horrific.

Please do not stay here, particularly during this pandemic when hygiene and the safety of guests should be of paramount importance. 

See pictures below of sheets…",1,2021,10,04
122,Last time we stay,"Complete opposite from our first stay !
This time round , staff were either non existent or not bothered . Room looks tired and dated , can’t use the room safe (lost the only key) no mini bar , wardrobe doors hardly open and the carpet behind the bed hasn’t seen a vacuum in years .
Only reason we moved the bed was to look for an hot water we brought because I suffer from kidney issues and the cleaners took it away with the linen

122,Poor all round ,"Poor service, noisy room right next to the train (I requested a quiet room!)old bed, no one answers the phone, couldn’t drink the coffee, housekeeping knocking on the door at 0845! … just poor all round. Nothing positive to say about this hotel. ",1,2021,09,30
122,A most disappointing hotel experience,"We booked a night in this hotel for our wedding anniversary, it had been our first night away together in almost two years owing to the pandemic and having a young family. We booked this hotel specifically for the spa facilities and we were told when we called to make our booking that the spa facilities included a jacuzzi. We should have been alerted to potential issues at this stage as the person who booked our stay had to ring back three times afterwards to clarify email address and card details etc. perhaps there was a communication/language barrier.
When we arrived at the spa it was clear that there was in fact no jacuzzi, to make things worse both saunas were broken and only one steam room was working. The pool itself was freezing, the pool was filthy (we could feel the grit and sediment at the bottom of the pool, the paint was flaking on the ceiling, the steel rails and ladders were rusting and dirty etc. etc. etc). The pool was also full of kids getting private lessons - so how in all honesty can the hotel market itself as a spa hotel and then charge people top rates for it? Facilities at our local leisure centre are better than what we experienced at this hotel! We reported our issues to the day manager 'Angel' who to be fair seemed sympathetic and agreed with our complaints. We were told that on check out we would have a resolution to our complaint.
When checking out the next morning we met Angel who said he had spoken with the General Manager and that we were being offered a £30 discount. We were extremely disappointed with this offer as our stay had been completely ruined, we couldn't accept this derisory offer as settlement of our complaint so we rejected it. We were then given an incorrect email address to contact Hui the General Manager - an absolute shambles of a hotel. 
Other comments are the robes were worn, scruff and quite rough. There seemed to be an all night party going on in the room next door. A terrible experience overall.",1,2021,09,27
122,Very disappointing weekend,"Just returned from what was supposed to be a deserved weekend break with friends, having booked 3 chelsea suites with balconies at the hotel directly myself the experience didn’t get off to a good start as the reservation came through via email for October rather than September so after another call this was rectified, because of this mixup I called last week to confirm our booking of which I was told everything was in order. Well that’s not what we experienced on arrival, firstly the rooms were not actually ready until 15.45 and once we had checked in it became apparent after going to our room that our room was missing the balcony, another visit to reception to which I was given excuse after excuse (not my problem) about how busy the hotel was this weekend. You could feel what little staff that were working were very stressed and not fully trained in how to deliver an exceptional customer experience, of which you should receive from a 5 star hotel, the place looked tired, unloved and understaffed, setting is exceptional but I would never stay again irrelevant of cost. Millennium Hotels you need to look at the recent reviews as we are all saying the same. It’s not good enough….",1,2021,09,26
122,Sorry to say probably last stay here,"We have stayed here for many years and always enjoyed the hotel. However , apart from a few members of the hotel staff - the hotel services are poor.

No room service - staff do not answer the phone when we were trying to contact concierge / room service to order . 
Bathroom had hardly any shower gels and bathroom products so we were on rations. 
No mini bar stock either !

We had some good service from front desk assistance booking us a last minute table in another restaurant but apart from this, poor service all round",2,2021,09,26
122,Strange way to treat guests,"I rarely give negative reviews and would prefer not to comment most times but in this case:

Our personal stay was straightforward but that was only by chance. Someone else in our party (and others checking in) found that their rooms were not available, and other guests still using the rooms had been prioritised over them.

They had to wait 3-4 hours before their rooms were available.

To cap it all, people also from our party were going to be double charged.

You do not get repeat business if you act like this and management were notable by their asence.

Not worth the risk of going back.",2,2021,09,24
122,Gone downhill,"Having visited the hotel previously I had high hopes for my recent stay. Sadly my stay was poor. On check in we were told our room was moved and they’d need to make up a sofa bed, we asked for our bags we had previously stored in the luggage room to be told we’d have to wait. I can only presume this was because they had VIPs in the hotel and it seemed regular guests didn’t matter in comparison. Returned to the room hours later to find no extra bed (sofa or otherwise) had to then get this sorted at around 11pm. On checkout we were not asked how the stay was. As someone who’s worked in the industry this is appalling especially for how much it costs to stay in this hotel. The coffee stains in the room were also not visually appealing and to be honest I expected better. This used to be a lovely hotel but it seems to have gone drastically down hill.",2,2021,09,23
122,Do not stay here ,"A 1 star hotel posing as a 5 star.

An expensive hotel with rooms that have dirty carpets and poor service. They tried to charge me for a full breakfast but I only had a croissant. Because there was a football team checking in my taxi had to stop 200m from the front door. No apologies from the front desk. On check out they charged me for the room I'd already paided for. No apology again.
No local amenities and tube is 15 minutes walk away 

Do not stay here",1,2021,09,23
122,"Great location, terrific service!","I stayed here when visiting the Chelsea Flower Show in September 2021. The hotel itself is in a great location for various shows and shopping locations, and the room we stayed in (Twin Suite) was spacious and comfortable. However, the service in the hotel was awful. 

We arrived early to check in (2:30) and were told our room wasn’t ready, which was fine as check-in isn’t until 3pm. So we went to the bar to have a drink (£5 for a small bottle of Coke is robbery) and I returned to reception thinking we would be able to collect the room key. No such luck. We were told it would be another half an hour. 

When we finally got to our room it was very nice, but there was no menu for room service. I did ring down to request one but it never arrived. When housekeeping cleaned our room they didn’t replace any of the milk or sugar and I had to request that they bring some to the room, which they did eventually do.

Staff were slow at serving in the terrace bar and completely ignored my mother when she tried to order our drinks, choosing instead to stand and chat to one another. 

This kind of service is not what I expected from a hotel classed as five star and it is a joke to even suggest that it is.",3,2021,09,23
122,Certainly NOT 5 star,"Booked this hotel for my husband’s 50th and arrived at the check-in time of 3pm. Room wasn’t ready due to staff shortages. Ok we thought. They gave us a glass of champagne and we sat on the balcony and waited half an hour. Husband went to check and was told by the same guy that there was actually someone still in our room! Not happy but fine, another glass of champagne! Husband went back in another half hour and was told by the same guy again that management had agreed that the occupants of the room could stay until 6.30!  Are you kidding! Nope! We ended up waiting until 6 until we got the keys to our room. I had wanted to relax and chill and drink the bottle of bubbles I’d arranged for the room and may be use the spa before we were due to go out at 8 but that was scuppered! Had also asked for balloons and decorations but nothing of the sort! The room was clean enough but we had just 1 mug and an espresso cup for our coffee but no spoons!  Breakfast was ok but it’s self service and wasn’t really hot and the coffee was like tar! I then realised that they had charged me again for the room but actually added on an extra £100 for good measure and a further £110 for incidents in the room!  That took 2 people to rectify and I’m now waiting for those charges to be taken off my credit card!  All in all a very poor show for a supposedly 5* establishment! We won’t be going back and I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!",1,2021,09,23
122,Great hotel,"Great base for shows and sites of London. Bus stop C3 100 metres from hotel straight to Earl’s Court Tube Station.
Check in & Check out both went smoothly staff on reception friendly.
Suite was massive. Lounge area usual tea/coffee/fridge. asked for English Tea at reception and this was bought up within 20 minutes.
Balcony with table/2 chairs view of Marina/city/Thames
Bedroom really big plenty of storage wardrobes/drawers. Beds really comfortable. No noise from corridor/other rooms
Bathroom big. Separate shower cubicle, bath, twin sinks, separate wc 
Bar menu limited but good choice. Breakfast good plenty choice on both continental & Hot buffet. Omelettes, poached eggs, pancakes made to order.
Afternoon tea was lovely. Evilin the bar tender who served us during our stay was excellent and coped well under pressure despite the RUDE attitude of some of the guests. 
Spa treatment I had was excellent. Pool very good with 6 loungers and 2 lounge chairs.
The hotel is severely short staffed but all the staff we encountered were polite and doing their best under difficult circumstances. Yes some things are looking a little tired & in need of some TLC but this did not spoil our stay 
We would definitely return.",5,2021,09,22
122,I honestly can’t complain…,"These guys and girls deserve an honest review. I honestly can’t understand some peoples reviews. For the amount they have paid to stay in London I can’t understand how this hotel has got it wrong for the odd few, or I question is it the people who have got it wrong? We paid £150 for a night… 2 mins down the road you can pay triple and get nothing as great as this place! 
I originally booked this hotel via booking.com to go to the rhs flower show. My partner couldn’t do the date I had booked so I needed to change. Booking.com were very unhelpful. So I called direct and they said just cancel with them and we will honour the price you would of paid for the stay. Which I did and was slightly more on the direct website as it was a different date- totally understandable: but when I spoke to Michael on reception he said they would honour the price I originally paid. When we arrived at the hotel we checked in and straight away the receptionist said we could either spend our extra on the bar/on food or they would refund the difference. Michael had noted it on the booking so I didn’t feel stupid asking for money back. 
We headed to the bar- where we had several lovely drinks with great service. The bar does close early but it’s not a late night bar so that’s fine. Great drinks woth a lovely balcony.  Headed to the room. I had mentioned to Michael it was my partners birthday. Thought we might  get a cheeky update if available. No, but honesty the room was great. Clean, huge with bath robes and a proper coffee machine. But what Michael and the team had done which was not expected was leave some chocolate coated strawberries and a bottle of Prosecco instead.. incredibly kind and not expected! 
Breakfast was lovely, staff were incredibly polite and attentive.. we honestly couldn’t of asked for more. 
You can stay down the road for triple the price and get nothing as great as this place… we will 100% be back, thanks all involved :)",5,2021,09,21

The club sandwich was excellent so were the fries and a delicious Pinot Grigio

122,Definitely not five star.,"This hotel was a disappointment and should NOT be considered five star! The service was poor. Extremely poor. Reservation team does not reply to emails, the phone calls are unsatisfactory because the staff are clueless and unenthusiastic. I also asked if they offered any complimentary extras for partners birthday.. they did not. The sauna and steam room are separated so I couldn’t enjoy this element with my partner.

The room was okay but stained carpets etc were a huge let down. The fridge wasn’t even cold. Whole room seems a bit dated. I wouldn’t say it’s worth it and I would go elsewhere.",2,2021,09,17
122,Lovely hotel let down by extremely poor service on many levels,"This hotel was booked for my fiancé 40th birthday as he is a huge Chelsea fan. The hotel and the room were lovely (Chelsea king suite with balcony) but sadly on many levels let down by service. Pre arrival trying to book something special and not rung back and then when I rang again basically told all we can do is give you a small bottle of champagne for £75.  Tried to get an early check in and was told to ring on the morning. Rang 7 times on the morning and either didn’t answer or when they did put the phone down. Tried to get normal breakfast tea for our room as the tea caddy wasn’t stocked. Ignored on the evening and then the following morning it took 3 phone calls to get 2 teabags. The morning of check out trying to ask a question about our membership and told I can’t help you ring my millennium. Such a shame as this is clearly a beautiful hotel, a lovely area and should have been a really amazing treat!",2,2021,09,12
122,Assaulted by a member of bar staff,"Physically threatened before he was removed by security. Completely unprovoked, I believe he was under the infliuence of drugs, utterly unacceptable. 

Was not offered compensation. Was offered ""free breakfast"". Had to chase, was offered either a refund or a free stay- as if I would want to return to somewhere where I was attacked. 

The General Manager, Hui Xu, after I finally got hold of her, promised me a a refund but I have not seen it. She is ""off site"" every time I try to speak to her. 

If I do not recieve my compensation, and a satisfactory response, I will be reporting the incident to the police and taking further action.

122,4 night stay Bank Holiday August 2021,"Five Star Hotel 2019 - definitely not the case in August 2021! 
Dated decor, stained carpets and tatty furniture. Bedroom was not cleaned for 2 out of 4 nights! Tea/coffee etc not replenished. Had to chase staff for an extra pillow that was requested after the first night. The shower when you opened the door smelt absolutely foul. Not sure if drain needed flushing but it smelt the duration of our stay. 
Breakfast was mediocre at best. Definitely not five star standard that we have had elsewhere! It looked and tasted like it had been sat for hours. You could break a tooth on the bacon it was that hard. Fried eggs looked horrendous, did not see anyone brave enough to tackle them. 
Swimming pool and spa were old and tatty in appearance. To be honest I have been to better public swimming pools. 
Let’s just say that our stay was disappointing especially considering that I booked it as part of my wife’s 50th birthday celebrations.",1,2021,08,30
122,Major cleaning issues,"Room clearly hadn’t been cleaned in a long time - cigarette butts, carpet not hoovered, terrible smell of bad drains, bed clothes stained.

Complained to mgt who were apologetic & embarrassed, said they have no cleaning staff due to  Covid but the owners decided to open regardless. Felt sorry for the staff working there as many people complaining/ checking out. We didn’t even stay the night, asked for a refund and checked into the Peterham hotel in Richmond which was lovely.",1,2021,08,27
122,Two night stay.,"We found the hotel was OK, with nice spacious rooms and friendly staff. Check in was easy and staff welcoming. The room was clean but was tired in places with a few stains here and there.
The room did lack a few basics when we arrived, we had no kettle,no soap and no hair dryer. We managed to get a kettle from reception. 
Our room faced the train station so was a little noisy with the trains so would recommend a room facing the harbour.
 The beds are OK but we are used to a more firm mattress. The sofa bed was not very comfortable.
The swimming pool was nice to relax for half hour in the afternoon and spa reception staff very friendly.
Overall we had a nice stay  and was happy for the price  we paid. If you don't expect 5 star luxury and don't pay a high price you should be OK.",4,2021,08,27
122,The most disappointing hotel stay I have experienced.,"Overall very disappointing. Everything other than the lobby is visibly very tired and lacking. Not a 5 star hotel experience at all. Avoid.

Unfortunately the let down started the moment we checked in, we arrived at 10:30pm and were expecting to drop the bags in our suite and get a Friday night drink and maybe a late snack in the bar. Unfortunately the bar was closed. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel…. the hotel bar was closed at 10:30pm and there was no ability to order room service! After seeing our shock we were ‘allowed’ as a special check in one off to order a bottle of something to take to our room from a limited list. Fair enough we thought, no need to get too annoyed and spoil everyone’s day so we ordered the drinks and asked if they could just put a few bar nibbles on a tray when they bring it up? ‘Nope, sorry not possible’. Nothing? Not even some peanuts or crisps…? ‘No sorry we don’t have any’ NOTHING? ‘Well we do have some but they’re all out of date so we can’t give them to you even if we wanted to’ was the final response other than to add that we could go to Tesco around the corner to buy something if we wanted!! erm ok wow!

First impressions didn’t improve much when we got up to the suite to find whilst the rooms had been serviced there were no soaps or other hygiene products in either the main bathroom or separate wc. The employee we ordered the drinks from at the front desk arrived shortly after with our order so we explained the lack of soaps etc. He proceeded to explain that a delivery had failed to come that day and so there was no soap he could bring us at all. SERIOUSLY we’re in an ongoing global pandemic with continuous reminders about hand washing and the hotel thinks it’s ok to just not provide soap (not to mention everything else you would expect to find in a 5 star hotel for personal care)? It’s a (sort of) small thing but in current times possibly one of the most important details. They could even have sourced ‘off brand’ products for the rooms checking in that day… even from Tesco around the corner….. but just to leave an empty (and dirty) tray on the counter in the bathroom is a very poor reflection of the hotel. Eventually the employee brought us a saucer with a few shampoo, conditioner and body wash miniatures on… Better than nothing I suppose! 

Anyway we had a nice cold bottle ready for us and a couple of glasses so I just went to pop the complimentary water into the fridge and….. erm it’s warm! We ask the same employee again…. ‘Oh there’s a switch on the back it just needs turning on’! So he’s on his hands and knees in an instant, pulling a fridge out of the cabinet reaching behind in the dusty void and getting it on for us. Great we had a cold fridge 2 hours later! Is this normal?! 

Oh and water. This hotel definitely doesn’t seem to have heard of the move away from single use plastic. It was a surprise enough to find the water in our room in plastic bottles but when we asked for water at breakfast we were just given more small plastic bottles…. This hotel must get through thousands of bottles a week and could so easily avoid doing so. A totally inexcusable way to run a hotel in the modern world in my opinion.  Not to mention the pretty low grade experience it creates in a restaurant when everyone is eating with multiple plastic bottles everywhere and having to swig from the bottles as no glasses were ever provided without asking separately.

One redeeming feature… they do make tasty sausages for breakfast!

Aside from all the above the hotel is simply very very tired. Corridors feel tired with broken lamp shades. The stairs to the pool and spa feels like a neglected school with paint feeling and bubbling off. The pool itself despite having just been closed for some work is ok but definitely on its last legs with more decorative repairs needed. The furniture and decor in the rooms and the bar / breakfast area is dated and tired. The scrappy selection of tea bags in the room had no normal breakfast tea with none available when we asked for it. Tall weeds were growing in the paving of the terrace to our room. Staff seemed to be run ragged and hit and miss. ‘Service with a smile’ was hard to come by. 

Finally something I would normally just gloss over but might as well mention is the view. We booked a marina view suite thinking that would be a nice view from the terrace. Well unfortunately our room was only on the first floor so most of our view was an ugly barren roof of the bar below and just about able to see a couple of boats on the far side of the marina. Technically I suppose we got what we booked but it was a pretty ugly place to sit out really. Maybe they should offer ‘partial marina view’ rooms and normal ‘marina view’ rooms, if we had known we would have known to ask for a high floor or just not bother.

I do not know how hotels go about getting or holding on to their star ratings but in many years of travelling I have never been so disappointed with expectations vs reality. When this place was built and run in 80s I’m sure it was worth 5 stars, maybe it still has technical things it can tick off to say it has 5 star requirements but seriously I have stayed in 3 star hotels that felt more luxurious than The Chelsea Harbour Hotel.",2,2021,08,23
122,Basil Fawlty has nothing on this mob!,"As a supposedly valued member I emailed the hotel asking for an 'check in' I was told that check in was usually 3pm, but should be fine.

Upon arrival I was informed that early check in wasn't available, however could use the pool. I was shown the pool (which is lovely) and sat on the terrace, grabbed a drink and was served by some great restaurant staff.......That's where the 'positive train' comes to an abrupt halt!

I asked no less than 3 occasions if the room was ready only to be told it wasn't. The time was now 3:30PM!!!!! and asked the manager if the room was ready, to which he said ""He would check, and come inform me"" (He never did)

I then went back to the desk, and was told the room was indeed ready and wrote the number on my room card key.

I tried to open the door, only for some lady to answer and ask me if everything was ""Ok"" as I was trying to enter THEIR hotel room.

Understandably horrified, I went back downstairs and informed the incompetent Duty Manager who checked his system which showed that the room hadn't been cleaned until 3:10PM and had been given the wrong room number anyway.

Awful customer service from him, he did however give me the correct keys and later said he would chuck in 50% off a bill (never ended up being the case) and include a breakfast (Never ended up using because)

My 'spidey senses' were going at this point. Upon inspection I discovered the room was very poorly cleaned, Lumpy bed (with hairs) and generally unpleasant place to relax in.

After grabbing a bite to eat I decided to check out and inform the 'new Duty manager' of my horrible experience. He just shrugged and went ""Meh, sorry about that"" and charged my card anyway.

At the same time, I overheard a couple complaining about the very same dirty room. Talk about causing a stressful environment!!!!!

This is without doubt the worst hotel stay of my life. Awful customer service from front of house to management.

My advice to punters: If you want to place to crash, then it's fine! However, if you require any form of relaxation or sophistication then STAY WELL AWAY!!!! 

The front of house staff couldn't manage to run a bath, let alone a nice hotel.

122,Good location for West London,On arrival there was difficulty with our booking for 2 adjoining rooms which was not dealt with professionally. Eventually resolved but had to upgrade one room. Rooms were generally ok but tired and needs a facelift to bring it to 5* levels which it was last time we stayed. The restaurant and bar areas were similarly tired and dated so we did not use the restaurant facilities. Bar staff were generally not interested claiming they had 2 members of staff and 100 clients to look after - more like 10 ! Fortunately there are many first class bars and restaurants locally. Would probably not stay again until a refurb has been carried out. The leisure facilities were good but tiling around pool needs attention. Money needs to be spent all round to fix what could be a fabulous hotel again,4,2021,08,20
122,Poor service and awful hygiene.,"Indifferent staff. Appalling hygiene.
We arrived at 2.30 for 3pm checkin. Room not ready so we went to the bar for a drink. The bar staff took 25 minutes to serve a tea and a bottle of still water. They forgot the milk. So I went back to the bar to ask. 
6pm. ... Yes I don’t jest the room was ready ... Hooray. But no they gave us a double for me and my son... Hmmm really?!?! we had booked a twin 2 months before. 
So  we then waited another 30 minutes to get our twin. No ventilation in bedroom. The maid had left her mask behind the phone. So no adhering to Covid rules. We asked every day for the room to be cleaned to no avail. Dirty towels left on the table. No replacement of tea and coffee and milk daily. We finally got our replacements on late Thursday night... We were leaving 9am Friday. We spent 4 days here. We enjoyed London , just not the Hotel.  £721 paid for really poor service and standards were grim. The management really need to address the dire cleanliness issues.
No tourist info given to us. No info on the underground. No local formation. We won’t be recommending Millennium Group Hotels. We felt neglected.
The restaurant is poor. So NOT a 5 star!!! I have had better at 3 star hotels. No artisans breads. No pancakes, no melon. Poor range of pastries. Very poor cooked breakfast served in those metal trays. Tea n coffee was like an American dinner. I finally asked for a tea pot. 
The carpets were stained and the coffee table chipped. No biscuits. 
Your nearest stop is Imperial Wharf. But b aware to get into central London it will take a few changes on the underground and will b about 43 minutes. So it’s not central Get the ferry From Chelsea Habour Ferry. The Waterside is a great restaurant. Far better than the hotel. Kings Rd Restaurant expensive and not great. Imperial Wharf had some nice ones.",2,2021,08,20
122,Value for Money,"Nice location if you don't need to be near the tube or in central London, I had a Marina view suite, well furnished if a little tired but overall great value for money for London.

Breakfast was great, room service was a little hit and miss but easy to order in from nearby restaurant.",5,2021,08,19
122,Disappointing stay,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel, rooms are very tired and dusty. The safe, fridge and phone were all broken and the curtains/nets were discoloured. This would be an amazing hotel if it was refurbished. The positive of the hotel is the late check out time of 12pm. Sadly would not return.",2,2021,08,15
122,Certainly not how it used to be,Great check in but failed to inform us that the pool was closed and the bar closed at 10.00pm. We booked dinner at Duke of York Square fabulous restaurant got back at 10.15 to be told bar was closed. We then asked for 2 flute glasses as we had a bottle of champagne delivered by a taxi driver and these were certainly not clean . We have one more night here but would certainly not recommend at this point in time .,3,2021,08,07
122,Disappointing,"I wouldn't rate this a 5* hotel. Check in, staff and reception area all really nice and thought wow this is 5*. The room was dated and needed modernising to make it up to this level of stars. We got charged £25 for some chicken nuggets and halloumi fries to the room for it to arrive with 6 chicken nuggets which tasted like it came from mcdonalds and a few halloumi fries! Disappointing. We chose to eat out for a dinner due to this experience. Paid £40 car parking to secure a space which was worth it. But charging £150 a room is overpriced especially as the spa facilities are closed!",3,2021,08,02
122,Number one choice from now on!,"We last stayed at this hotel 10 years ago when it was the 'Wyndham Grand' but the location suited us on our current visit to London. Having read some of the reviews I wondered if I had made a mistake booking it, or if some of the reviewers have unrealistic expectations - in my opinion they do. This is a higher end of mid point hotel offering excellent value for money. Our check in was efficient and all members of staff we interacted with were friendly, efficient and helpful. The public areas including the corridors leading to rooms are classy and provide the ambiance of a 5* hotel. We found the location excellent, just off the lower end of King's Road and the walks around the hotel along the river are great with a local bar with outside seating on the river just 5 minutes' stroll away. There is a plethora of bars/pubs/restaurants on the King's Road less than 10 minutes' stroll from the hotel. We found that using Uber and the London black cabs made travelling easy and efficient and reasonably inexpensive. If you haven't downloaded it yet, put the 'GETT' app on your 'phone to call a black cab which in our experience, rarely took more than 2 minutes to arrive at the door to the hotel. You need to compare Uber and GETT for each journey to get the best value but we thought using the apps great value. Now to the room. I had booked a Harbour/Marina view room that comes with a balcony and by joining the 'Millennium Club' via the hotel's own website I got a great rate. The view from the balcony with a table and two chairs was lovely during the day and at night. We were in room 304 on the third floor and directly across from a view of the River Thames but in full view of the boats in the Marina. The rooms are so well soundproofed that we heard nothing from adjoining rooms and the helicopters landing at the nearby helipad were interesting to watch if a little noisy at times. The bed was amongst the most comfortable I have slept in and the bathroom comes with a bath and separate shower and is spacious. Toiletries were well stocked as were the coffee making facilities comprising a Nespresso machine with replenished Nespresso capsules on a daily basis. The fridge worked well as did the safe. The separate sitting room was spacious with two chairs and a large sofa plus a work table. Wifi was efficient and the room was serviced each day and spotless. Some reviewers have complained that the furniture is dated, well, yes it is dark wood but perfectly acceptable and in keeping - the doors are light wood and the room was bright and sunny. Would I prefer to stay at a central London hotel in a small room for a similar price - it depends on the purpose of the visit. If it is for one night to see a show and dine in a Central London restaurant well, possibly yes. If it is for 5 nights as our visit was with lots of space in the suite, a great location overlooking the water, easy walking to trendy King's Road and easy taxi access to all of London - you bet, The Chelsea Harbour Hotel wins hands down. From now on it is my 'go to' hotel and I will simply budget an extra amount for Ubers and black cabs. This hotel suited our requirements perfectly and it gave us a relaxed and classy London stay. It is certainly on my list of London hotels to return to and it won't take 10 years again!",5,2021,08,02
122,Really Disappointing Stay,"My Wife had booked this hotel for my Birthday visit to London combined with a meal out.  

On arrival I managed to get an on street parking spot (chargeable until 6pm Sat and free Sundays) 100 yards from the hotel which was far cheaper than the hotel car park.

Check in was easy and room was available.  My wife had booked a harbour view suite, so we were looking forward to a top class room.  

The room was large with a small entrance hall and toilet, sitting room, Bedroom with separate bathroom.   All furnished in dark wood which gave a late 80's or early 90's feel to it.   It was rather tired in places, the large sliding patio door was difficult to open and had no way of locking or securing it from the inside.  

Soon after arrival, we discovered that the TV in the lounge did not work properly (the screen kept pixelating), and the fridge was exceptionally warm.  Reported the problems to reception who said that someone would be up shortly.  After an hour I rang again and received the same promise as before.  2.5hrs later some arrived just as we were leaving for dinner saying they would fix the problems.

On arrival back from dinner (11PM) we were told that everything was working.   To our bemusement, the fridge was even warmer than before , and the TV was unwatchable!!  

To cap off a thoroughly miserable stay, the fire alarm went off at 2.30am, but was stopped before a full evacuation. 

Breakfast was reasonable, the service was very good in the restaurant.",2,2021,07,22
122,Worst 5 start hotel I’ve ever been too,"I have never ever been so disappointed with a 5 star hotel. Utterly shocked. Where to begin?..

First on arrival was greeted by staff whom wished they were anywhere else except there, very abrupt and impolite. (even though they ‘accidentally charged me double for my stay). 

Once entering the room- 602 harbour view suite: 

Lounge- 
Carpet had stains all over the floor, feet were slightly dirty from walking on it. The sofa was covered in stains also, (the types of stains you really do question) did not sit on it once. The mini fridge made the drinks you put in side warmer. You’d think the safe works right? I asked because I needed to place valuables in there and the response I received was “sorry no batteries.” 

Bedroom-
Boiling hot, air con set to coldest setting and it felt like I was in the Bahamas. Filthy hand prints on the ceiling directly above the bed when laying down. Two warm waters next to the bed to welcome you along with dirty glasses for you to enjoy your refreshments. 

En-suite-
Hair trimmings in the shower. 

Balcony-
Wouldn’t dare walk out there unless you have shoes on. View at night is awesome though. 

Restaurant/ bar-
The male staff in the restaurant were miserable the lady staff were lovely and polite. 

Checked in on Friday morning, checked out Monday morning. Room was not cleaned once in my stay even though I had the “please clean room” sign on the door from Saturday morning till check out- absolutely nothing. 

Did not complain once or make the slightest of fusses as my partner was giving birth to twins which made me the happiest man in the world. Looking back, I’m utterly shocked.",1,2021,07,19
122,Not quite what we paid for,"My partner wanted to surprise me for my 30th Birthday with champagne and chocolates in the hotel room on arrival. This didn’t happen and had to request this from reception, even though it was already paid for and requested before we arrived. Very disappointed. Maybe pay attention to people’s bookings when setting the rooms up.",3,2021,07,16
122,"Okay, nothing special","Very average experience. Turned up and was told my room booking wasn’t on the system as I had only recently booked. Was told to take a seat whilst they got it on the system. They then forgot about me and I waited for 30 mins until I returned to the desk and they said ‘oh sorry I thought my colleague had sorted that’. A friends room was also not ready when arriving, they were offered a bottle of Prosecco but I wasn’t despite the same wait. Rooms are extremely large but tired with marks on walls. Breakfast was very basic, would say no frills fry up. There are better places to stay in London at cheaper prices. This is also not in a great location.",3,2021,07,11
122,The worst night away,"I don't know where to start to be honest. I'll firstly start with, I know we are still in the middle of a pandemic and I have taken that into account when writing this review. 
We arrived at the hotel  to check in and there was 2 couples ahead of us, no problem. We didn't get checked in until around 45 minutes later because the staff didn't know whether the rooms had been cleaned so they had to keep running up to the rooms to check them before allowing guests to go up.

The staff at the checkout desk were very harassed and quite rude - customer service costs nothing and covid isn't to blame for this.

When we finally got our keys to the room, we went up to find that although it was tidy it was far from clean. There were dirty used cotton buds on the bathroom floor, the carpets were all stained in various places, and there were cigarette butts all over the balcony.

When we came back in after our night out there was tissue on the bathroom floor which wasn't there when we left which makes us think there had been soemone in our room after we had left.

There was a wedding on at the venue which is absolutely fine, however through the night guests kept coming to our door and ringing the door bell!

The in room tea and coffee facilities were poor. There was only one tea bag. The mini bar wasn't stocked either. 

The breakfast the next morning was cold, not a lot of choice and the staff were extremely rude.

The clock in the room had the incorrect time on it which made us late the next day. 

On check out we weren't asked how our stay was, we were curtly told there was no additional charges to my card and sent on our way.

I definitely wont be staying here again.",1,2021,07,08
122,Covid is to blame for everything!,"This is a really lovely hotel with spacious suites and great views.  However, it currently isn't running as a 5 star hotel and I would recommend carefully checking that they have got their act together before booking.  Covid guidance is being blamed for things that are not at all contrary to it.  For example, room service breakfast is not available, the mini bar does not even have water in it, there are no wine glasses, openers etc in the room, there is no updated information on the hotel services or room service menu in the room, the spa is closed including for treatments such as massage and facial (I am just back from County Hall hotel where the spa and pool were wonderful).  The room had not been kept up well and had water stains on the ceiling and the broken air conditioning had been replaced by a noisy and inefficient floor unit.  I suspect one of their problems may be that they are understaffed, but the staff that they have got are super good and helpful. I am willing to cut anyone a little slack in these difficult times, but it does feel that more could easily be done here.  I am not even holding them to account for being kept awake by thumping music. And how about speedy check out please?",3,2021,07,07
122,Birthday weekend away,Lovely clean pleasant stay.  All members of the family very happy.   Front of house stay very happy to deal with any issues.    We didn’t eat in the restaurant as had other plans.  A big shame the spa or swimming pool not open but understand it due to Covid restrictions. I will be returning,5,2021,07,07
122,Miserable night away!,"Stayed here a few years ago & was so happy with everything BUT NOT THIS TIME
Suite was so tired & in need of some money being spent - the kettle was cheap plastic - lacking coffee pods - no decaf! 
The furniture is so badly marked & outside dirty & worn table chairs.

And if all this wasn’t bad enough somewhere on floor 5 was a very very loud rude guest playing hideous crap music way past 2am - never had to phone reception & complain before but this was not good.

This is not a cheap hotel but also not a luxury stay either!

Shame",2,2021,07,04
122,Weekend Getaway,"Had a great time at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel. We stayed in the Kings Penthouse Suite. The room was lovely, large with a big balcony and some great views of the city. The staff we encountered at reception, in the restaurant and throughout our stay were all fantastic and helpful. A special mention to James who we first met in the bar during an evening drink and then in the morning at breakfast. He was extremely helpful and certainly a staff member you want to keep as he would easily fit in at any luxury hotel around the world. Will certainly return to this hotel next time I am staying in London.",5,2021,06,08
122,"Great location, tired rooms, overwhelmed staff","We stayed here on the last bank holiday weekend. There was a family wedding in the rooftop are which was well organised and service was good. It was  only  30 guests due to restrictions but the team there were great. Apparently this is where CFC stay for home matches but from arrival the reception staff, literally 1 man sometimes 2,  were overwhelmed and completely unorganised and unprepared for guests. As there were long waits to check in and get your rooms, it seemed only 1 person was able to check guests in. So there were guests waiting for bags to be delivered to rooms, guests being given the wrong keys to rooms already occupied. 
We had 2 rooms for my family of 6 and though the rooms were great size, with separate sitting room to bedroom the rooms looked tired, windows were filthy, and he sink in the separate toilet leaked on to the floor. 
The staff in the breakfast room were very helpful and service and food was great! On leaving after the 1 night stay I then found my card was charged more than double the cost, but was reimbursed within 48 hours. I’ve stayed in many hotels and not had this happen.",3,2021,06,05
122,"Some good, some not so good","I love this location & we have stopped at the hotel numerous times over the years.  The views from the rooms are amazing over the marina and the city but I felt the hotel was letting itself down in a number areas.  No concierge when you arrive, there always used to be.  Take your own bags in, park your own car, doesnt feel five star.  Front of house staff very friendly and helpful.  Bar staff were pretty poor.  No eye contact, they werent busy, just CBA.  Once you placed your order it took for ever.  Didnt dine in the restaurant in the evening.  Went to a very nice lebanese roudn the corner.  Highly recommend.  The hotel could take a few lessons.  Breakfast in the morning was not good.  Why are you expected to eat poor quality food that has been sat waiting for you.  In a five star hotel I would expect to have my breakfast cooked for me and served at the table.  Still love the location.  Hope it gets better",3,2021,06,02
122,Great romantic stay,"Lovely stay at this hotel. Fantastic room with good views of the city and river. Good breakfast with good choice and quality.
Staff friendly. Only downside was the Spa not being open, which we knew about and it didn’t ruin our stay. A bit away from some of the sights but a nice location in itself.",4,2021,05,30
122,Great for shooting our video,"Larissa is an excellent events organiser. She managed to get us , last minute, what we needed for this shoot. We’d do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks Larissa ! The food also was really good. Her kindness. Her adaptability. Great location !our football player likes this hotel and we know why.",5,2021,05,27
122,Going to pot!,"This once proud 5* Hotel is going to pot!
No doorman?!?
No parking available!?!
No Spa open?!?
No restuarant?!?
1 Bar Staff?!?
This hotel obviously hasn’t realised that Covid restrictions are not as they were.
Next to no staff all trying their very best with front desk phone ringing for bookings and money to spend being told most amenities are still closed.
Hotel owners are either trying to run this into the ground or haven’t seen that west London is busy and getting back to normal.
What was to be a surprise for my family ended up being one drink and away .. very disappointed 😞",1,2021,05,26
122,Very disappointing ...,"I appreciate this is a very difficult time for the industry, however, basic customer service, friendliness and good manners should surely come as standard in a hotel with this grading. Our check in and check out, by the same member of staff, was appalling. I have never felt so under valued as a customer. I had requested an early check in before arrival, this couldn't be accommodated which is fair enough but there was no ""sorry about that"" just a label handed over for our bags. The receptionist tried to take the price of the pre-paid room again plus the £100 incidentals, again no ""sorry about that"". The room was as expected, a little tired but a good space. Interestingly they are serving room service in the evening but not for breakfast, we rang through and were told we had to go down to the restaurant. So forget all those pictures of people sat in robes having breakfast on the balcony that is not happening yet. Breakfast was a poor selection, no meats or cheeses and pre prepared pots of fruit - not going to dwell on this given the circumstances people are having to operate under, but no toast! Check out was by the same rude, miserable, untrained guy - no ""good morning"" no ""how was your stay"" I pointed out the £20 that had been added for parking (I travelled by train) which was duly refunded and yet again no ""sorry about that"". No would you like a taxi, thank you for staying with us, we hoped you enjoyed your stay, we look forward to seeing you  again - nothing, not even a goodbye. 
This was a meet up with  my London based daughter who I have not seen for months, she was equally appalled with the lack of customer service and she has done her years in hospitality, she said she wouldn't return nor would she recommend. This is a lovely little spot and in the sun I am sure it is truly fabulous but I won't be going back until they sort the front of house out - this guy is damaging your business Millennium Hotels.",2,2021,05,26
122,Very disappointing experience at Chelsea Harbour,"First of all, we understand and appreciate how difficult things are for the hospitality sector and hotel workers at the moment. But we were really upset and let down by our experience at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.

For context, we had booked a suite with a balcony for my wife’s birthday. When we arrived to the hotel and checked-in - we found that despite being able to prove that we had paid for this room, we were left in a room without a balcony with the Hotel explaining they were fully booked..not a good start.

To their credit, they did offer us some compensation in the form of some money off at the hotel bar but we did feel disappointed that our room wasn’t what we had hoped. They did also recognise my wife’s birthday and brought us some complimentary wine (which would have been lovely on a balcony…).

The room itself was okay but lacked some standard things that you expect in a hotel (such as power points near the bed etc). We found out the next morning that the main thing the room was missing was a shower. Instead of spending the morning enjoying breakfast or nice walk - we were left in the room whilst a maintenance worker fitted a part to the shower. The maintenance person was surprised they had anyone in this room because it was known that they were waiting for this particular part. Morning was ruined.

When we checked out, I explained to the receptionist that we had these issues and weren’t happy with our experience. We were told to leave a name and number for the manager who wasn’t in yet and that they would call us. That call never came.

Really disappointing for what should be a five-star hotel in need of customers at the moment. Individually, all of the staff were friendly but there was clearly some wider issues which massively impacted our stay. 

I’m sure it’s a nice place to stay in ‘normal times’ but I’m afraid I could not recommend Chelsea Harbour as value for money, especially during the current times.",1,2021,05,24
122,Incredible experience - hotel staff,"My family and I stayed here for what was meant to be two weeks at Xmas- and ended up being 4 months. The staff at this hotel are so amazing - they became second family to us during this very strange time. Despite the difficulty of the situation they made us feel so welcome and did everything they possibly could to make sure me and the kids were ok and have everything we need. Manuel, Frank , Cristina, Juliette, Gonzague, Ciprian, Alex and all the amazing housekeeping staff - we are so grateful to you all for all your kindness and tolerance! We will be back to bother you very soon and ride our scooters through the lobby! Thank you thank you thank you 🙏 cannot fault anything about this the hotel but  mainly due to the amazing staff who kept their smiles on (beneath their masks 😷 😂) throughout every minute of lockdown- Christmas, birthdays and Easter ! See you guys soon",5,2021,04,20
122,Mr Jamie,Very welcoming staff all dressed immaculately and very welcoming I felt the receptionist went above and beyond for me and all of the staff are just very friendly people staff make your stay as well as a good room and these guys certainly know how to run a hotel will definitely be coming back5 stars from me,5,2021,03,20

122,Best Hotel stay ever!,The hotel was in a wonderful serene location with a tranquil view of the Chelsea Harbour. My partner and I stayed in the Savile suite and it was just beautiful a truly memorable stay. Thank you so much to the team for all their efforts with making our stay special. I'd most certainly recommend and visit again!,5,2020,12,14
122,Computer Says NO,"We stayed last weekend for my birthday as we were booked into restaurant Gordon Ramsay.  It's a lovely hotel and staff are pleasant. However we realised on Thursday evening while packing, that my husband had  booked Thur/Fri not Fri/Sat. This was completely our fault (well his fault) he rang the hotel to ask if there was any way they could change the booking. Unfortunately he was told it was to late to do anything but  the hotel is very QUIET & room is available for £150 .
On arrival we spoke to the receptionist who reiterated that there was nothing she could do as we had booked through Expedia but we could call them. They said they couldn't change booking either but that they would call hotel to see what they could do, there's a pattern forming .  The manager was sorry but could do nothing as its  a Expedia booking and they would charge the hotel if he let us stay??  COMPUTER SAYS NO....
We totally accept it's our error & in normal circumstances you would be losing a nights accommodation charge  HOWEVER your hotel was EMPTY. We saw 5 other people Friday  and at breakfast 9  including us, we were only asking for the two nights you'd been paid for. 
Businesses, including ours are having to change and rearrange work at a drop of a hat, due to COVID If we've learnt anything its how important our customers are and the message BE KIND 
We left your EMPTY hotel, and the manager  wished us an enjoyable rest of our weekend.   We did book another night for my birthday, but not in your Hotel Group. 
",2,2020,10,28
122,A ghost town,"We understand that Covid is impacting hotels, but this hotel should just close down.

Restaurant closed. Bar closed. Pool closed. And hardly a soul to be seen.

Our last stay in London was in a well known hotel and even with covid, you felt welcomed and all the functions of the facility were open.
 
With virtually nothing near by, you must taxi to eat, drink, even if you just want a coffee.

122,"Nice location, away from the bustle ","A nice hotel, large rooms, nice view.  Shame everything is closed but there were very few guests so you can understand why.  Staff helpful and all Covid safety measures in place.  We will stay again when in London.  Very easy walk to Kings road. ",4,2020,10,18
122,Fantastic weekend break,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. The penthouse suite overlooking the marina was a real treat - spacious and luxurious. In difficult times , the staff were very accommodating and did their best to maintain high standards throughout our stay. Special thanks to Roland, Christine and Nihad for another memorable weekend away.",5,2020,09,27
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel during COVID,"We have just returned from an overnight stay at this lovely hotel. Although not the cheapest hotel in London it does have one of the best with views of either the Thames, the Harbour or Chelsea. 
The management are always helpful and eager to please, they have made the hotel as COVID safe as possible and not point did I feel exposed. All the rooms at the hotel are large suites, we stayed in a suite with a view of the Harbour.
At the moment, like most hotels the restaurant and bar area are closed but a short 10 minute walk will see you in the Kings Road where some very nice restaurants like Frantoio Italian.",4,2020,09,12
122,Great stay after lockdown,"I was over the weekend in one of the lovely marina view suites. The hotel is amazing and has nice views of the Chelsea Harbour marina. Nice walk around the area. Very quiet area ideal to rest and amazing beds and pillows for a great night sleep. Reduce breakfast but enough due to the circusntances. A pity that the facilities are not open but I defenetly will give another visit once it is fully operational. 
I would like to thank  Manuel for his effort in going to go the extra mile and Roland. 
Hope to see you soon.",5,2020,09,09
122,Fantastic!,"I stayed at the Chelsea harbour hotel at the weekend just gone I booked a room with the marina view which was stunning, although I was not able to use any of the other hotel facilities I had a lovely stay, the staff were wonderful and very welcoming especially Manuel and Ronald Who made our stay that little bit more comforting knowing they were there if we needed any assistance. Will be visiting again soon!",5,2020,09,08
122,Disappointed for the price!,"not a 5* hotel at all. Location is good as is the view of the harbour. However, for the price for a one night stay the rooms are dated and old. We had stains above the bed and the chair broke whilst sitting on it to do makeup! 
Clearly the room was meant for someone else as a bottle of prosecco was with a note for a couple celebrating a 22 year wedding anniversary...that was not us! 
The air con didn't work and no windows open. 
Breakfast (which costs) was a box with a croissant, bread bun, some cheese and a peice of fruit. 
I appreciate covid has caused issues but the price needs to reflect this and there is no excuse for broken furniture and scruffy rooms!",2,2020,09,06
122,Beautiful hotel ,"My partner and I stayed here and we really enjoyed our time here. Location is perfect, staff lovely, room and view absolutely gorgeous! The room was totally perfect. Immaculate. The hotel itself is to a high standard and the views over the river and harbour are just great, we could see the London eye. Loved it and we will return again soon.",5,2020,03,18
122,Weekend in the city,Was all that the pics promised - just fabulous staff - superb suite with all comforts imaginable. The bar area had a beautiful view of chelsea harbour which was truly relaxing . Weather was dreadful but on a good day plenty shops and pubs close by👍👍,5,2020,03,15

122,LMO Annual Charity Dinner,"We would like to say a HUGE thank you for all the help we received from the Events Team, in particular Nemer who was tireless from supervising his team and accommodating our last minute.com requests.  The dinner hall was immaculate.  The way the evening was managed was an exemplary and made our life very easy, especially when you have 300 guests to greet and give them the attention they deserve.  Nemer managed his Team very well and food was served hot and on time.  All our guests commented how incredible and tasty the food was.  We owe it to the chef!! He did a fabulous job with his team.  Last but not least, a big appreciation to Herveline whom contributed a lot  to the success of the evening and for putting together a very satisfying and convenient package deal.
As always Nemer never let us down and we cordially thank you for that.",5,2020,03,10
122,"Good location, very professional",Booked a meeting room here for a morning in February for 25 colleagues. Great meeting room choices and facilities. The food was excellent. Service was professional at all times. Overall very impressed.,5,2020,03,04
122,Just amazing!,"So we held our work awards ceremony here on Thursday 27th Feb, the hotel itself is beautiful, rooms are amazing, didnt get chance to use any facilities.
There was some miscommunication with the reception staff which was disappointing as we asked them to direct our employees to our registration desk and not everyone got the message so they missed out on a welcome from us.
The lifts also stopped working when we were in the penthouse lounge which was frustrating. 
I just want to call out 2 fantastic members of staff at the hotel and if they work your event then your I  great hands, fird Goce our barman, went out his way for me, was so polite, friendly, he was amazing and his manager deserves to know this member of staff went above and beyond to help me when the lifts broke and he helped get me to one of employees who needed help with something,
And the senior events manager Nemr, he made sure everything ran smoothly, he was very hands on, friendly, made everyone feel so welcome, he looked after myself and my colleague with our food and just went out of his way at all times, nothing was too much trouble. An absolute credit to the hotel, ensure he works your event because he will be amazing for you!!! Thanks Nemr and Goce you are both brilliant!! ",5,2020,03,01
122,"Excellent hotel, fantastic staff, a great experience that I will be repeating","My husband and I stayed here last Friday with our neice as it was her first Chelsea home game and we wanted her to have a lovely time.  The room was perfect with the lounge area and bedroom.  The bar area downstairs was very nice and each time we were in there the staff working were excellent.  We received a friendly greeting at reception too.  The location is great too.  I wish I had asked for a harbour view suite but I will know for next time.

I will definitely be returning to this hotel.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2020,02,25
122,60th Birthday celebration,"My wife and I  have stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel a number of times, and have always enjoyed our stay . The staff at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel will do nothing less than pull out all the stopes to ensure your stay is a pleasant one. So when I decided to have my 60th birthday celebration in the executive lounger for a few friends and family I was confident that would be nothing short of a success. So I am happy to say that my family and friends enjoyed the celebration and was very impressed with the enthusiasm of Nemr Elias  the ( senior events manager) and his staff. We are looking forward to our next visit, and our stay in the Kings Penthouse and the Savile Penthouse. ",5,2020,02,24
122,Five star afternoon tea!,"I took my daughter for afternoon tea today for a birthday treat and we couldn’t have had a nicer experience! 

The food was delicious and beautifully presented with great attention to detail. The sandwiches were fresh and tasty, the pastries pretty and very inviting, the scones were served warm, and the banoffee pie was scrumptious!

Our hostess, Anastasija, was welcoming, friendly and attentive, providing excellent service and a great credit to the hotel.

My daughter was also thrilled with the special dessert that was bought over with ‘happy birthday’ on it, a lovely, personal touch. All in all, a very enjoyable experience.",5,2020,02,24
122,Three day weekend in London,"Great hotel and superb staff. Can’t recommend it highly enough. Make sure you book a harbour view suite, these have a great view down towards the river and across London. Thanks to the doorman who looked after my car!",5,2020,02,24
122,Trading on its location very disapointing,"We stayed at this hotel rather than our normal London visit to the Royal garden hotel Kensington....I wish I hadn't...
View from our room was the side of another building, I mean why go to a harbour hotel and not view the harbour ?
I took this up with the reception lady in the morning who was rather rude and arrogant. Even though the hotel was half empty they didn't offer us an upgrade to a room with a view..So the rooms with views stayed empty and customers like me got a view of the side of a building...Explain the logic in that one !!
Also the food in the restaurant was cold. we sent it back and got refunded on some of it..The beds in my opinion are poor quality and there was no shower gel of shampoo in the bathrooms...And lasty I'm 6 feet 1 inch and I couldn't fit in the bath !!

Not a great experience and we wont be going back !!",2,2020,02,23
122,Our annual charity event,"Having the event management organising this annual charity event this year, made our life so much easier, thank you Zeina and the rest of sales team, you have made a fantastic job. On that evening Saturday the 8th of February 2020 most of the 350 guests were nicely welcomed by the front of staff team and were escorted to the beautifully well arranged venue where a nicely set up champagne reception was laid down for all.
Entering the main dining beautifuly set up room, you really feel the 5 star🌟 place in this nicely located hotel at the Chelsea Harbour.
Dinner was served on time and you can see the enjoyment on all the guests faces as they received one course after other. Thank you chef and all kitchen staff, you did a marvelous job.
Now service staff were amazing, professional, and well organized.
I have to say thank you Nemr and crew, you were really fantastic, serving all 350 guests on time was amazing, and the feed back I received from most is what a fantastic job you all did, thank you again Nemr.
All in all, great Hotel at the Harbour, nicely well spread event room, 
Very good food, fantastic service, we were all made welcome.
We will be back soon for another event hopefully.

122,Fundraiser Ball in the Grand Room,"We held a fundraiser Ball in the Grand Room for 230 guests.  The whole experience was great from start to finish.  Very professional event management team, food & beverage teams on the night were excellent and the managers on the night were brilliant.  Nothing was too much trouble, they communicated very well, were flexible and very professional.  I would highly recommend for a top end fundraiser event.",5,2020,02,20
122,Truly enjoyable!,"A friend recommended to me to come here for a visit and I wasn't disappointed.
My friends and I had a truly wonderful experience having afternoon tea in this gorgeous venue, with this beautiful view. The staff were welcoming and charming. Truly enjoyable!",4,2020,02,19
122,Business Meeting,The hotel offers excellent facilities with clean and light meeting room space. Very good refreshments and lunch provided for our meeting.  The event planner was most impressive in arranging and accommodating everything we required for our meeting.,5,2020,02,17
122,Great stay but sour taste on checkout,"The hotel is in a superb position on the chelsea harbour. Lovely setting and we had reserved a balcony room, we were surprised how big our suite was, plenty of room and it felt special. Be aware, where tea coffees are there are 2 shortbread biscuits these are part of the mini bar costs despite being separated from the rest of the snacks! Cheeky! Most hotels usually provide a free biscuit but not here!

The hotel bar was fantastic and the staff there were very helpful and friendly. Recommend the teryaki chicken, delicious! 

Swimming pool and spa were ok, nice to have them here to use. 

We ordered room service for breakfast which we were asked to sign for. Right or wrongly we hadnt checked under each of the silver plate warmers, then to then find out they had sent an additional breakfast incorrectly. Given the fact we were at the time waiting for the hotel maintenance to come and fix our shower(after 2 calls arrived 1hr later) so I could wash my hair after swimming we agreed to sort this during checkout. 

The male receptionist in our opinion was very unreasonable and asked if we had eaten the breakfast which we had picked a few bits from (surely it was only going to go in the bin? Given the impression that may had not been the case!) He would go and check the tray to see if we were telling the truth?! How to tarnish a great stay! Think some staff customer training wouldnt go a miss! Will we be back? Up until checkout yes, now I am not so sure. Problems can happen anywhere but its how they are resolved which makes the difference. ",4,2020,02,17
122,Very good,"Lovely hotel, spotlessly clean.

Valet parking recommended as parking nearby is a hassle. £50 a night though.

We did however have a strange thing happen in our suite. We checked in which was smooth and went to our room to drop our bags off quickly as we had to leave for a funeral which we were late for. My wife used the wardrobe to hang some of our clothes. On our return the very heavy wardrobe door was off its rails and precariously just standing there! If it fallen over it could have seriously injured/killed someone. We notified reception and the maintenance man promptly arrived. The maintenance man said he had not seen anything like it in the 10 years he had been working there and could not understand that it had come off it’s runners on its own!

I spoke to the duty manager who said he would check to see if our room was accessed during the time we were out. Unfortunately, he did not get back to me. Again in the morning I asked for a manager to call me to explain, but after 72 hours no response. 

Only rated the hotel 4 stars not 5 as a result of the managers lack of communication skills.

We will not hesitate to return though.

",4,2020,02,15
122,Great hotel,"Had a great stay at the hotel. And will come back for another time
 
+ Good location close to water
+ Nice area to walk around in (not for shopping though)
+ Large and nice rooms
+ Lovely balcony
+ Gym facilities
+ Reasonable value for money

-	Only cold breakfast while I was there (could order warm)
-	A bit far from the centrum / shopping streets of London if that’s your main goal of the vacation
-	The opening hours for the pool and gym ended at 9 PM which is very early when traveling on business in my opinion

=> Try to get a room with a view towards the water – a very cozy little harbor to look at",5,2020,02,13
122,Fraudulent activity ,"I stayed in this hotel on Wednesday the 5th February ( a single lady on her own ) I found out on leaving they charged me £107 for mini bar .. for bottles of wine , rum gin etc .. ( I didn’t touch the minibar !) it’s a week later . I’ve spoken with 4 x people and no one will take accountability for this error and refund me .. every time I get promised a call back and they are investigating it .. shocking service for a 5 x star hotel ",1,2020,02,12
122,Great venue for a romantic weekend away,"Birthday getaway for my wife started off on a disappointing note as we arrived at the hotel to hear the breakfast I distinctly remembered booking was not on our booking confirmation, nor were the two complimentary drinks!😏 All credit to the hotel staff though, a quick phone call to hotels.com (through whom I had made the booking) and we were all sorted - turns out there must have been a glitch in the booking system - so, note to self... always double check your booking confirmation! Thanks for helping us resolve things, Manuel & Chiara!👍🏽 Room was awesome - well appointed and definitely worth paying the premium for Harbour view over Chelsea (non-harbour) views. Room service menu very reasonably priced. Breakfast was also great. We’ll definitely be back.",5,2020,02,11
122,Check your Bill here - untrustworthy ,Stayed here and it was ok but not great. Later I saw on my credit card they'd put thru totally false mini bar charges. Queried it and they admitted that lots of guests had complained and the system was down but they have not refunded me. Suing them next. ,1,2020,02,11
122,Wheelchair Friendly Hotel-Top Service,"This hotel is very good also has rooms for disabled access, great size wet room and low beds with lovely table and chairs in room, the hotel is easy to get round with wheelchair parking outside the door.

Hotel is very well decorated and the receptionist lady was very nice & helpful. Guided us about the nearby attractions. Room in which we stayed was very big, beautiful, & spacious. 

Comfy and clean rooms and very friendly staff, recommended! The location is also very great, very close to hyde park and kensington gardens and the old city center by cab. Very comfortable bed, clean bathroom, airco,.. Good value and I will come back here next time!

We liked our stay & would recommend it to others as well.",5,2020,02,08
122,Superb Hotel,Stayed here for one night with my wife for her birthday having stayed here for work once before. A superb hotel which is good value for money compared with other 5star hotels in London. Superb breakfast. Only downside is it is a slight pain to get too by train and tube but worth the effort. ,5,2020,02,02
122,Excellent venue to host a meeting,"Excellent 3 day meeting held at this lovely hotel.   You wouldn't think you were almost in the centre of London when you look out of the window at the view of the harbour!   

Events department (special mention to Herveline) did a great job in organising everything, and Mohammed who looked after us in the meeting room is a credit to the hotel.    Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff, from the concierge to reception.    Restaurant staff could be a little more aware, attentive and faster but apart from that we had an amazing week at the hotel - a little gem tucked away in London!  Thank you everyone.",5,2020,01,27
122,Excellent Service,"A lovely restaurant with a beautiful view of the harbour!

Our waiter Carlos was excellent!  He ensured we were well aware of our choices and showed interest and consideration throughout. To all intents and purposes, a lovely experience was ensured by the level of service received from Carlos.",5,2020,01,25
122,Excellent and Affordable,"With every room a suite .. a very good location .. valet parking .. and an excellent gym, pool and spa,  the Chelsea Harbour hotel is worth every penny!

Add the fact that the hotel is often used by celebrities and top sportsmen and the excellent loyalty program, and it's one of my preferred choices to stay in London. 

The rooms are spacious, comfortable and very quiet - and the staff are friendly and helpful. 

It's very affordable compared to other five star central London hotels.",5,2020,01,24
122,Fabulous event hosted at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel!,"In October 2019 my company hosted a week-long event at the hotel, where we welcomed 100+ of our colleagues and guests who resided at the hotel, for the entirety.  We utilised the wonderful conferencing facilities/meeting rooms and thoroughly commend the impeccable look and feel of the hotel, which is second to none, in the London area.  The location with view and the food on offer is also perfect, but this is wholly complimented by the army of amazing team members who work at this hotel, who are thoroughly service oriented and ultimately, wonderful people!

From viewing the venue, to the seamless planning and endless attentiveness of the Front of House team, Back of House team, and Meeting & Events team - The Chelsea Harbour Hotel helped us host the most successful event, to date!!

With thanks to each of those Heads of Department who personally met with me, in advance of our event and to the General Manager who ensured all his teams were always on hand to assist.  Special thanks to: Zeina Ismail & Daniel Sciberras (Sales), Larisa Cervinschi, Fernando & Nemr (Meetings & Events), Ramy Yousif (FoH Manager), James, Ilvin, Mihai, Daniele, Paul & Federica (Main Restaurant/Bar), Rodney & Frank (Door Men) & Nisha (Spa)…and thanks to all others who were part of this wonderfully effective team.  It was a pleasure to work with you all and I hope to be back to you soon.

With best wishes

122,Lovely festive break,"We stayed at the Chelsea Harbour hotel just before Christmas as a special treat for my husband's 40th birthday. 
Our room was gorgeous and so spacious with a separate living room. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom had a lovely hot powerful shower (two must haves for hotel stay!) The bar was great for a few relaxing drinks and the reception was so beautifully decorated for Christmas, with an absolute showstopper of a tree! 
Would absolutely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again.",4,2020,01,13
122,Our Amazing Christmas Day!,"I just have to say that our experience at Chelsea Harbour on Christmas Day was truly amazing.
I would like to give a big Thank You to the director of operations, Nahid Yasin, and his TEAM, especially:
Dominik, Sherry and Fillipe - for helping me to arrange our stay, breakfast and dinner
Frank - from front of house
Costa  - who looked after us on Christmas morning
Oscar - for looking after us in the restaurant at breakfast
Paul - for looking after us in the restaurant with our Christmas dinner

And lastly, i would like to thank Father Christmas who surprised us with a visit and gift for the children.

I look forward to seeing you at Easter",5,2020,01,10
122,Amazing concierge ,Alexandru from concierge was by far the highlight of our trip. He made our requests happen even the very late one (hours before New Year’s Eve) and worked for us on his off days. One of the best in all the hotels I’ve stayed in. ,5,2020,01,09
122,Special Hotel,"First time I visited the hotel as a guest after working there over 20 years ago. It used to be a Conrad, then a Wyndham and now it is under Millenium management. I can tell a lot has changed but this property will always retain something special. The main point for booking this hotel is its location (if you prefer something more private and tuned down). Second strongest point would be the size of the rooms. Being an all suite hotel guarantees you that no matter what you book you will stay in a spacious room. Third strongest point are the staff. They are all extremely polite and friendly. I can tell that new management have made staff cuts but they still manage to offer a 5 star service. (Barely) This reflects upon individual efforts rather than well tuned all around quality operational standards. You can tell management is lost somewhere in a sales or finance meeting. Staff members make up for it however but still there is so much you can do when you are left alone on the shift. Breaskfast is something they need to work on. Immediately. They cannot continue to compete with Europian 5 star hotels with a breakfast like that. And it all starts with fresh raw materials. They try to make up for it with presentation but really I almost feel bad for the cook when purchasing provides them with such low quality materials. 
I like the new laidback approach of the front desk since having to sit rather than stand for 8 hours surely boosts morale. 
Staff at the concierge are friendly and attentive but they need to purchase a wireless intercom for when they are standing outside. Failure to not receive a call could prove loss of revenue in so many ways. 
Housekeeping tries to do a good job and more or less succeeds but could do better with more focus on detail. It feels like it is under staffed. We checked in a room with visible static dust on lamps and furniture. Also batteries were dead on electronic scale. 
Anyhow despite the above mentioned details which are aimed for management to roll out the creases we still enjoyed our stay and will surely return.
",4,2020,01,05
122,Great staff but rooms a bit outdated,"The staff at reception are really great and could not do enough to help. Unfortunately the beds are the most uncomfortable beds, too hard and the duvets are thin and wispy, not what I expect from a 5* hotel. 
Amenities are good, from a good room service selection to the spa. ",3,2020,01,05
122,Poor attitude -This hotel has changed,"On arrival you are requested to hand over a debit card and they explain that it is normal as they will only require it to hold £100 authorisation against potential charges?  I explained that We were not using the hotel bar etc and we had a function to attend and wouldn’t be adding any extras to the room bill.
The receptionist reassured us that nothing is taken on the card until checkout.

What they failed to tell us was that they actually debited the card on arrival without telling us and when we complained the following day the new receptionist said it would take 5 working days to re credit the funds back to my bank? 

I hadn’t spent a penny in the hotel but was £100 down!

This was company policy! - “we do this to everyone”..

I have stayed at many hotels where a card has been requested to hold a reserved amount but always released or cancelled on leaving - I have never known a hotel to actually charge £100 upfront on arrival (they told us it was just an “authorisation” only and not a transaction). 

Had I not used a Monzo Bank card I would never have noticed this charge - (Monzo instantly messages your phone when any transaction happens on your account, unlike normal high street banks.)

They refused to apologise and made us feel that we were wrong to challenge their policy? The reception desk just said it was tough and would take up to 5 working days to be refunded, “whats the problem”?....!

I paid extra for a return journey back to the hotel from central London to confront them but they refused to accept it was a mistake or that they would  even offer to refund my taxi fare.

Avoid this hotel if good customer service is one your list. Which is a shame as it used to be excellent and a great location if visiting the 606 Jazz club on Lots Rd.

I have no idea when I will get my money back?
",1,2020,01,04
122,Not worth the money ,"Even for the cheapest rooms it’s not a cheap hotel and we have stayed in other London hotels that have been far superior rooms and facilities. 
This was our 3rd visit and the hotel has really got to the stage where it needs a complete return. Rooms are a nice size but dated and worn. 
Breakfast was very poor for the price - prepay £18. No toaster or toast offered. Had to wait for fried eggs, bacon cold and fatty. Beans were cheap and hard. 
Much better quality and cheaper breakfasts available on Kings Road. 
Parking, we used the design centre which was £40 for 48 hours. 
Staff are fantastic, very sweet warm & friendly. 
Highly recommend the pub in Lots road for lunch, nice pub and excellent food. 
We have repeated our visits purely because of the location but think we will start to look elsewhere for our next visit. ",3,2019,12,28
122,Family Christmas visit to London ,"This stay is a massive disappointment. 
Have stayed here many times before and the standard has deteriorated enormously. 
This used to be a 5 star but I would now rate it a 3 star. 
Despite calling in advance to advise on room requirement nothing that had been agreed had materialised. 
My 12 yr old daughter had to share a bed with my mother and my son had to wait until midnight to have a put me up bed installed. 
The rooms are shabby and dated and the hotel is in need of a refurbishment. ",1,2019,12,27
122,Lovely Hotel and Exceptional Staff!,"I love everything about this hotel. The bedrooms are very nice, the staff super friendly and helpful and the location is perfect. Its the little things that made my experience with this hotel memorable and pleasant. for example, I love the coffee machine in the bedroom, the room is super spacious.",5,2019,12,11
122,Christmas Party,"We held our annual event at the Chelsea Harbour and could not have been happier with the way it went. Larisa, Annaliese, Daniel and Nemr made the event run smoothly and to the highest standard. We can't wait for next year. Excellent venue, service and staff

122,Dreamy comfortable bed,I have whisked away for my birthday as a surprise. Enjoyed a fabulous dinner followed by cocktails at the bar. Very clean and discerning interior. The bed was perfect and super comfortable. I enjoyed a delicious breakfast (continental) in the morning.,5,2019,12,05
122,Big Disapointment,"This week was a busy week.Firstly a two day stop at Trump Turnberry then a flying 4 day visit to London for a family reunion in The Chelsea Harbour Hotel.Considering that these two locations share a similar star rating the difference was poles apart.On arrival the room that was booked was not what was booked due to the hotel being “full”.You would have thought that they would have known this when it was booked.Room was adequate but in a direct comparison with Trump Turnberry was not in the same league.
The television did not work,eventually after 3 calls to reception was changed to another TV which didn’t work properly either.Areas of the hotel were “out of bounds”as the Chelsea Football Team were there.Ridiculous considering there were other guests in the hotel too.Food was adequate in the Brasserie,choice limited and when it arrived quality and presentation were poor.Overall the service and staff attention to detail was severely lacking and on the edge of being unhelpful.
Overall we were extremely disappointed considering the rating of this hotel.
I would go on to say that the management should go to the Trump Turnberry and see how a quality product should be presented and run.",3,2019,12,03
122,Simply Superb ,"Really lived up to expectations ... such fun!! 

Staff exceptional 
Food exceptional 
Atmosphere.. electric !! 

On par with The Dorchester, the bed/bedding felt marshmallow heaven 😂 

A perfect hangover !!  ... The sign of a good time. ",5,2019,12,03

122,Spa Day,The best: The service at  the Chelsea harbour hotel spa is one of the best I have come across.  The management is really polite and ready to help at all time. Ola always makes sure everything is tidy Around  and answers all questions whenever  I need help around the club.  I’ll give this club a 5 star rating and would highly recommend it to anyone.,5,2019,11,20
122,Birthday Celebration,"I would like to say a massive thank you to all the staff at Chelsea Harbour Hotel who had made my birthday a memorable day for me. 

All the staff were friendly and extremely courteous. I had your very experienced therapist Ola, who gave me the best massage I have ever had; to top it up she even did a few stretches for me as I complained about back pain. I most say I highly recommend her. 

Overall very good experience and I will be back.",5,2019,11,20
122,Blue Harbour Spa,"I am a member at the Blue Harbour Spa which is part of the chelsea harbour hotel and I would like to give a special mention to the spa team who are always willing to help, especially Ola, Holly, Mimi & Nisha.

Fantastic swimming pool and Gym facilities thank you to all the team.

122,Wow - first class hotel,"This is a 1st Class hotel.  The quality of the rooms and service are excellent.

The welcome is awesome with full valet service and personalised booking process.  The rooms are 5 star and I must mention the automated thermostatic controlled showers - perfect!  The balconies and separate air con systems make this an ideal place to stay.

The only downside was that the bar staff were terrible as they were not trained appropriately - this was at an event but reflected on the service at the hotel.",4,2019,11,16
122,First class service. ,"I have spent the past few months working on and off in London and chose the Chelsea Harbour Hotel to stay at. I am also a season ticket holder at Chelsea and use the hotel for leisure as well. The staff are so polite and helpful and the facilities superb. Every room is a suite so it always feels special. The fact that you can stay for little more than a Premier Inn on most occasions is a massive bonus. Great hotel, great staff. ",5,2019,11,13
122,Superb and  genuinely kind staff.,"I  live not far from the Chelsea harbour hotel. However, I have never stepped foot in this gem of a hotel and so wished I had done sooner.  

In a world where customer service is fast going downhill , the Chelsea Harbour hotel is a dream of wonderful service.  Whoever trains them is a genius they manage to find the best staff, who actually seem genuinely  interested in you and your needs. They are five star 

From Paul who is on the door and worked there for 15 years who treats you like a friend  The bar staff both upstairs and down were so knowledgeable  of wines and charming ,.   I was there for The Autism Hero awards and usually I don't eat at awards as the food is never to my taste but the Chelsea Harbour  hotel excelled and produced a meal that everyone loved,  I will for sure be back and hope the awards are held there  again as they really step up to the mark. If  you an event you need a venue you really  want to take a look as it would be hard finding a better venue.",5,2019,11,12
122,Autism Hero Award Evening,I would like to say a massive thank you to Nemr Elias Senior Events Manager who went up and above for me and my family yesterday. I have a serious nut allergy and Nemir was attentive;considerate and a true gentleman. Thank you so much and Chelsea Harbour you have a truly amazing employee.  Thank you Brenda,5,2019,11,10
122,Amazing waitstaff,"My trip to the Coast to Coast restaurant was simply amazing thanks to the waitstaff. The food was delicious and so were the view. I felt very comfortable and cared for by Beatrix whom engaged me in conversation that had me laughing Throughout my meal. 

It was truly a good time!",5,2019,11,08
122,"Ugly and uncharming, friendly staff, decent restaurant ","This hotel is in my view overrated. Location is ugly, rooms are very spacey (I was in a suite), but they definitely need a refreshing before they fall apart. Cleaning is not impressing. Showers are not convenient. Everything looks 30 years old, including the bathrobe. It is a hotel without style. For what you pay (nearly EUR 300 when I have stayed), you can find much better places  in London.
The staff is very friendly and the food (we had several buffets) is OK.
Location is in a sad corner of London and the lobby reminds a low end airport lounge.
It is just OK and very un-charming. Never again, unless obliged as it was this time for work reasons. Sorry!",2,2019,11,07
122,Lovely Hotel . Amazing staff . Great location,We stayed this week for the chelsea v ajax football match. The front door staff like paul and Jose were so freindly and remembered us and made time to chat. The check in was quick and smooth and even a free upgrade as frequent visitors.

122,Great place - quiet and close to transportation.  Wonderful Staff,"We originally had booked a “home-away” and it was terrible.  We booked at the Chelsea Harbor and it seemed out of the way, but it turned out it was at the public transportation “Oyster” card water taxi and next to the overground.

122,Outstanding ,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London but the service I received here surpassed anything I had experienced elsewhere.  Jose the doorman is the best I have ever met. Alex Guest Relations Manager went above and beyond what was required and took time to show me round and introduce me to staff. Erik, the concierge and Cezar the valet were exceptional. The hotel is quiet and peaceful and I highly recommend.",5,2019,10,14

Thank you Beatrix 😊",5,2019,10,12
122,A very friendly efficient hotel,I recently stayed for 10 days while on a business trip and can’t speak more highly of the service we received. Everybody greeted us and made us feel extremely welcome. The rooms are large and very comfortable. We only had breakfast each day but there was a lot of choice and served in the dining room overlooking the harbour. Looking forward to our next stay already!!,4,2019,10,09
122,Awful,"Stayed at this hotel for one night when attending a trade show in London. The rooms are really big and the location and view is lovely, however that is where the positives end.
The decor is dated and desperately needs a freshen up, the room also wasn't very clean. There were tea and coffee making facilities but just a couple of glass tumblers to use, after asking twice for mugs with no response I gave up the hope of a coffee. 
We found the staff rude and were made to feel that we were an inconvenience when trying to order drinks at the bar on a Saturday night - not even past 11pm!
The worst part was opting to pay the £40 for valet parking as we assumed it would be safer than parking in the NCP - I have since found it's exactly the same car park, just double the price for the pleasure of them parking your car. When our car was returned to us a massive chunk has clearly just been taken out of the alloy, which we immediately bought to the managers attention. He said he would look into this for us however with no way of proving our claim (as the hotel won't allow us to have the CCTV) and with insurance not able to pursue it, they have got away with £150 worth of damage to my wheel.
All I will say is please do not hand your keys over to this place (previous reviews highlight other reasons - wish I had read those before) especially not if you value your car.",1,2019,10,08
122,Great service!!!,"The hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly. 
The food was fantastic . Beatrix was our waitress. Extremely polite, knowledgable and very friendly. She had other tables but never failed to make sure we didn't need anything.

122,Thank you for the great time,"As a guest in the hotel I want to say I am very thankful to Stan. He was polite with my family and me. He showed us the hotel, the garden and the yacht harbor. I am a professionalist in the security industry in my country, so I can tell you that Stan does a great job. He is confident and would take control on every situation. It was a big pleasure for me to meet such awesome collegue from Britan.
Frank treated us excellent. He was always smiling, elegant and careful. He works fast. I hope there is a person like him in every hotel.
Ivelin greated my family and me in the hotel’s restaurant. He was smiling all the time. He respected the etiquette. He answered polite every single question about the food. Although the restaurant was almost full, Ivelin did a great job. We are happy that he was our waiter.",5,2019,10,04
122,"Awoseome people, great holiday.","I want to tell how appreciate I am to the people in the hotel, in particular to Stan. He treated my family and me very polite. We are from Bulgaria and we had some language problems. He was so kind to help us with the documentation and the accommodation. For me Stan is very responsive man. Thanks to him my family had a great holiday in the hotel. Thank you, Stan!
I would like to share my pleasant impressions from Frank also. He was welcoming, polite and kind. He patiently answered every my question. Thanks for the great mood. 
I received an excellent service during my dinner in the hotel’s restaurant. This is all because of our awesome waiter Ivelin. He served us with a smile and good mood. He fully respected the etiquette. He took my order fast and correct. I noticed that he had very good hygiene and I am very thankful about this. There were a lot of guests in the restaurant, but Ivelin payed attention to everyone. I think everyone was pleased as much as me.",5,2019,10,04

122,Expensive error,Unfortunately I made a mistake at the time of booking through booking.com - and I booked  two rooms - one I paid at time of booking and the second one I would have had  to pay on arrival/ check out.  However I only needed one room - this weekend I realised my error and cancelled one room - unfortunately I cancelled the one free of charge but cancelled both. I phoned up the hotel immediately who asked me to contact booking com - who very helpful - and contacted Chelsea Harbour Hotel immediately.  Today Chelsea Harbour Hotel responded that they could not reinstate - despite it being an error.  But I could rebook ..... clearly at extra cost.   With that kind of poor customer service .... I def will never book that hotel again.... they will hold up policy - but there is to me a genuine error and for the hotel to do what is right from a customer perspective.  Clearly not ..... genuine mistake cost me over £300 plus in addition I now need to book somewhere else .....,1,2019,09,09
122,Fabulous afternoon tea with colleagues,"Visited the Chelsea Harbour hotel on a London ""Mystery"" tour in June 2019, arranged by one of my work colleagues for eight of us. The hotel is beautiful & very stylish, the staff were friendly and well-mannered. They explained everything included in the afternoon tea as it was served to us. The sandwiches, scones & cakes were delicious, especially enjoyed the scones that had a lovely crisp top, and were warm and soft as I cut through. A great selection of savoury and sweet for all. Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,09,03

122,Customer Service,My wife used and stayed at this hotel once a month from January to June 2019 this year. This was an academic course in London. The accommodation and overall consumer experience was superb and we will use this hotel again as a family during this Summer. One special callout was the personal service and support by Alexandru Dragomir who is a credit to their business here and supported us brilliantly in our stays Jan-June.,5,2019,07,12

122,"5 stars it is not. Grubby and impersonal. An ordinary chain hotel run by disinterested, complacent staff. ","Twin, Harbour View Suite: We stayed for 3 nights and can say that service and amenities failed to reach 5 star ratings at any point of our stay. Breakfast is a joke, overpriced, poor selection and it is not worth the wait for toast or anything that comes from the kitchen. Screaming kids and staff wandering around clearing and resetting tables when guests have simply popped to the buffet (leaving room keys and possessions on the table!) gives you an idea of what a shambles it is.

The room, upon arrival, had spillages down the bedroom chest of drawers, cup stains on the windowsill, stained sheets and long hairs on the bathroom floor. Thankfully the hairs disappeared after the first clean but the rest of the suite remained grubby. As noted in other reviews, the sliding Wardrobe doors are ridiculously noisy and very difficult to slide but you can’t leave them open otherwise the internal light stays on. 

The shower cubicle was small, smelt of mildew and the base heavily stained. Simple things like tea bags were not replenished on any of the mornings so a call to a disgruntled housekeeper meant that replacements materialised an hour later. The whole suite just felt tired and in need of some TLC. 

We had a great waiter one evening in the restaurant who couldn’t have been more helpful but most other staff gave off the demeanour that they’d rather be somewhere else. 

Check out was awkward as the man on front desk was not clear about what remained outstanding and what had already been charged. I appreciate language barriers are inevitable but when ‘deducted from card’ and a ‘pre-authorised hold on funds’ are used interchangeably it’s impossible to get a straight answer. In the end the only way to confirm the situation was to check with the credit card company. 

When asked ‘did you enjoy your stay?’ we answered ‘Not really, it was OK but no, it wasn’t great’ at that he turned away, pulled the bill from the printer and handed it to us. Why ask how things were if you have no intention of listening or caring about the answer? A five star hotel stay should never be just ‘OK.’ I would not recommend staying here, there are much better places in London where the 5 star rating, and the subsequent price they charge, is truly earned and justified. An ordinary hotel run by disinterested staff. It feels like what it is, a complacent impersonal chain hotel.",2,2019,07,11
122,Lovely hotel. Amazing receptionist Lucy,"We enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable, great located hotel with a lovely lobby. Our room was clean and spacious with a nice view. 
Staff were very helpful - in particular, working the front desk Lucy was one of the most professional and personable hotel employees I've dealt with in a long history of hotel stays. 
The experience was truly enjoyable. 
We will definitely return",5,2019,07,10
122,Great location. very large rooms for London,"All rooms are suites with large sitting room and bathroom as well as bedroom area.  The location is amazing if you are looking to stay in Chelsea.  
Absolutely top notch breakfast was included in our room rate.
Beds and pillow excellent.
Service was amazing from all team member.",5,2019,07,10
122,The Value of a Friendly Face,"My significant other and I are still in the middle of our stay but I am impressed enough to take a few minutes out of my vacation to speak about Paul. Everyday as we are waiting for our cab to head out on the day's adventures, we've noticed our Porter, Paul. He's just generally a lovely man but as a Porter, he is exceptional. Extremely welcoming and genuinely interested in your well being, Paul doesn't just open your cab door or take your bags, he offers good conversation, congeniality and most importantly, an inviting and friendly face in a foreign city. He always has excellent advice and something pleasant to say. In our country of origin, kindness isn't valued nearly as much as my significant other and I appreciate it but because of Paul, we feel our stay is a bargain. A true ambassador for the people of London, Paul may be the best porter the world over.",5,2019,07,08
122,Its a shame ,"When we arrived at about 3 pm, we had lunch and a drink at the bar. As we then went to the check-in desk we then we're told the room isn't ready. This is so appalling that at 4.30 pm our room isn't ready. It was embarrassing for our host as well. Not great and then at 5.15 pm we get our room. This puts stress on my stay as it didn't get time to get ready or relax before heading out. I didn't enjoy the show I went to see because of the hotel. I've left this for a while to review to see if the hotel contacts me or the host, they didn't. Furthermore, the mini bar was also empty as it shouldn't have been. The staff were not very helpful either. Just a bad stay to be honest. Shame as the hotel prides itself on the Chelsea postcode. ",1,2019,07,04
122,Wedding Guests,"The team at the hotel were superb at organising complex directions looking after a disabled guest who was attending a family wedding. The team were professional, compassionate and went above and beyond expectations in delivering a superb service. With thanks to Erikas, who helped to coordinate the whole process.",5,2019,07,03
122,Stunning,"My employer hosted a conference in this Hotel and i was lucky enough to attend, the hotel itself is a beautiful building and it is complimented by truly superb staff. The rooms are excellent and considering the location, very moderately priced.",5,2019,07,01
122,Not 5 or 4 Star,"This Hotel is by no means 5 or 4 stars . Lobby is clean and the check in/out is efficient and the rooms are clean. However for what they charge it's too much, first the Breakfast choice is a joke - if you want something proper you need to order it from the a la carte menu , i ordered toast with avocado for 13 GBP the toast was hard and the portion as small as a biscuit the buffet choice is better in any bed and breakfast Hotel further the waitress and waiter coughed around and chatted how unwell they feel.. great thing to say in servicing food , there outfit could be as well more appropriate. We had a drink in the Bar in the evening , even with only 4 guest took the waiter 10 mins to take our order, and he as well looked sweaty and coughing - But the downside is really the Hotel Floor and  the room doors , when you in your room and someone else on  the floor is closing or leaving  the doors are slamming so loud that  you need earplugs even more irritating if you stay close to the service doors.the rooms are spacious, but the shower is small (even in deluxe room) and the wardrobes having some wooden sliding doors where you need a lot of power to close and open - tv choise limited some channels do not work.BUt the biggest let down is the  spa - first of all you need to walk through the corridors than you find out if (you not on the right floor) that you need to walk back and take lift to the first floor , and than walk some steps down which looks like you walk through a building site, once arrived some unfriendly spa hostess might is kind enough to open you the way to the spa, which is complete outdated (at least clean) but very cramped and as said no where near high class. Will not stay again too much for what it is",2,2019,07,01
122,End of Senoir School Year Ball.,"I would like to thank Ksenia Sildisovafor for supporting and setting up our end of year celebrations. I would also like to thank Nemr Elias the Senior Events Manager for ensuring that from start to finish our UVI pupils ended their school days with a magnificent experience. The Venue was perfect. The food was of the highest quality and professional service and efficiency of the staff ensured everybody had a memorable time.
Thank you so much.

122,Great hotel & great staff,"I was visiting the hotel on June 16, the first time I saw it, I was surprised how big is the room. I absolutely love it, I sleep like a baby. 

The hotel staff was great and warm from reception to F&B, my biggest feedback is about breakfast. You really need to cycle the breakfast menu, since 1 week eating the same thing over and over again it's really unpleasant. 

I really need to acknowledge and personally thanks Erikas Verbyla,he absolutely wonderful, he truly showcase first class service, kudos for him. He assist me from day 1 like hook me up with bus tour and advise me with local attraction, I hope that you can recognize him for his wonderful work

Really planning to go back and stay in the hotel if I ever visit London in near future. Truly recommend hotel",5,2019,06,22
122,Not as good as it used to be,"For a once good hotel, Chelsea Harbour is now decidedly poor.

No hot water (really?!), exceptionally inattentive service at breakfast and a very average breakfast buffet (no menu or freshly prepared options) and they couldn't even get the tea/coffee order right.

I also don't like being charged for items from the minibar which I've not consumed - that's just plain shabby.",1,2019,06,21
122,Excellent Meeting Venue,"Currently at our 3rd meeting using the Chelsea Harbour as our venue!  Excellent meeting space, excellent service from the staff, particularly Mohammed who just helps make everything run smoothly!  Thank you",5,2019,06,19
122,Simply wonderful hotel ,"I have just spent two wonderful days at this most delightful hotel 
It is a must for visitors to London
A most gorgeous setting on the Harbour yet minutes walk from the renowned Kings Road
But by far the most impressive was the level of service received particularly in the Restaurant 
Managed excellently by the excellent Mihai Zamfirescu for whom nothing is too much trouble and his only concern is your needs - thank you Mihai
Also the service provided by Beatrix and Federica who served all our meals was such a joy - delightful people with excellent menu advice and so customer friendly 
We were simply blown away by the level of service- never expected this in central London 
I will most certainly not hesitate to return to this wonderful Hotel 
I know you will not be disappointed 
Well done Chelsea Harbour and thank you so much for this most memorable of stays

122,Disgusting filthy balcony,"1 June 2019 The balcony from my suite was filthy spiders and webs everywhere the light was absolutely filthy it was like a garden shed

Also I booked a table for lunch for with the restaurant manager I chose the table and the manager said she would have everything ready for myself and disabled sister in a wheelchair when we arrived at 3 pm we were refused the table I was outraged I had chosen the table because of my sister in her wheelchair I have contacted the guest relations manager but have had no response

122,A business event made special,"I organized a workshop at the Chelsea Harbour and all of the staff from the concierge to the event's manager was beyond expectations. Professional, friendly and always available. I have a lot of experience in running workshops and meetings in hotels around the world and this was one of the best in terms of service. The food was also top notch from the pastries to the buffet, really good!
The only less positive comment is that the decoration of the hotel is a little bit outdated. Everything is in perfect working order but a general refresh would be good.",5,2019,06,07

It's a great place to stay. The hotel was very clean as well as the room.
I don't normally leave reviews, however, the service we received from Lucy was excellent and deserves recognition. We were extremely impressed by her courtesy and professionalism. She was an absolute pleasure to deal with
Absolutely recommend!",5,2019,06,06
122,NEMR,"We held our annual Payroll & Reward Conference at the hotel. Everything went extremely well but would like to make a special mention to NEMR who really looked after us. He really is a credit to your team. A big thank you for all your hard work from yourself, Fernando and the rest of your team. 

Lina, who looked after our room bookings was so helpful and kind, nothing was too much trouble for her. Anything I threw at her, she dealt with impeccably!

Finally, Annaliese, who again went out of her way to cater to our every need.

Thank you ",5,2019,06,06
122,Work and leisure trip,Our room was great. We were on the sixth floor right next to the elevators and it was never noisy. The room was always taken care of daily and the turn down service was lovely. The room service was delicious and also so fast. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2019,06,05
122,60MLN Congress - Interopa Holidays Ltd EVENT,"A business event for the 60MLN Congress - Polish Community in which we, Interopa Holidays LTD - UK Inbound Tour Operator have organised with the support and assistance of the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. 

In specific, liaising with Annaliese Jackson (Meeting & Events Executive) and Erikas Verbyla (Concierge). Both of which have provided efficient assistance on the services required prior to, during and after the event. 

The Chelsea Harbour Hotel offers suitable space and amenities for business conference/meeting/banqueting. 

Overall a successful event and we extend our gratitude to all the staff.",5,2019,06,05
122,Weekend Break,"We stayed here on a 2 night break to visit The Chelsea Flower Show. We were not disappointed in our choice of hotel. 
First class in all areas and our view across the harbour and the Thames - perfect. 
A vegetarian option for breakfast was much welcomed and delicious, eaten on the terrace in the morning sunshine. 
The staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. 
Bar prices very good for a 5 star London hotel. 
Cleanliness was faultless. 

",5,2019,06,02
122,Great hotel experience,The hotel was great. I went with my family last week and we had a great time. Special thanks to Alexandru the guest relations manager. He provided us with the most amazing hotel experience. Definitely coming back.,5,2019,06,01
122,Beautiful Hotel,"Very impressed with this hotel. Staff were excellent and very helpful. You feet a part of the hotel from the moment you arrive until you depart. Room service was excellent and breakfast was very nice. Rooms were very comfortable, quiet and spacious. An enjoyable stay. Ideal for going to Chelsea Flower Show and taxi service to a West End Musical is very good too.",5,2019,05,31
122,Great Events Space,"My company runs and organises a variety of events, conferences and award shows and while the company has held previous events at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, this was my first time working with the hotel. 

The event space is all self contained on its own floor which worked amazingly, but not only that the staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating, relieving a lot of the stress and pressure that comes with an event. They all acted promptly, professionally and courteously, particularly the events manager Nemr who made a point of making sure our individuals with dietary requirements were looked after personally.

Thanks for helping us make our event a success!",4,2019,05,28
122,Better,"We stayed prior to this time back in August, encountering several problems with service and hygiene we were offered a complimentary stay so we returned to take up the kind offer. 

Much better this time, previous problems seemingly ironed out. 

I’d recommend not closing the bar so early, it’s a real shame not to be able to have a drink in the hotel later in the evening. 

The rooms are really spacious and spotlessly clean but a little dated and bland in terms of style. I’m surprised the Chelsea players stay here before games it’s not of the calibre that I’d imagine they expect - although it is very nice and absolutely fine for mere mortals like us! 

I love the location, it’s London but (if you ignore the planes) such a peaceful, pleasant area. 

Yes parking is costly but hey it’s London and the valet parking team are so lovely and it’s so quick and convenient I think it’s worth it. 

Never had breakfast here until this stay, very good. ‘Help yourself’ section of fruit, cereal, juices etc then cooked to order hot menu. The service was great and it’s a lovely view on to the harbour. ",4,2019,05,27
122,Excellent catering ,"We visited the hotel for a pre Chelsea Flower Show champagne reception and dinner afterwards. The staff were so on the ball and professional. They catered extremely well for my food intolerance and even considered me with the canapes, which is most unusual, providing me with a separate plate. Thanks particularly to Nemr, the events manager for taking such good care of this.",5,2019,05,22
122,Engineering Ball UCL,"It was a wonderful experience, with magnificent staff always very attentive. The food was delicious, not to mention the amazing views that created a perfect environment for a relaxed and enjoyable evening with friends and colleagues.",5,2019,05,20
122,The Hotel is beautiful.,"I recently stayed here for a work event. The hotel is beautiful clean and modern.We had a gorgeous suite with a view from a balcony overlooking the harbour. We had a great 3 course meal in the evening, and the service was excellent, quick and efficient and that was some feat as this was a massive event. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone.
The bed was so soft and comfortable and was asleep in seconds. But waking up and sitting with a lovely coffee on the balcony was such a treat. We then went to breakfast which was a buffet selection of both hot and cold. Excellent quality for both.
I know anyone staying here will be impressed. There is always plenty of people around that is happy to help. Thank you everyone for a great stay.",5,2019,05,16
122,Husbands birthday,"We’ve been to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel many times on football days & always said we would like to stay there. 
Booked it for the weekend for hubbys Birthday and was so pleased I did. Had a beautiful king suite room and the service of the staff here was absolutely amazing.. nothing was too much trouble. We ordered room service the first night and again not too much bother for them and the food was delicious.  This is a lovely hotel and we highly recommend it.
Thankyou for looking after us and we look forward to coming to stay again.",5,2019,05,16
122,Afternoon tea experience (restaurant review only),"We booked a table for afternoon tea last Saturday 11th May to celebrate our anniversary. On arrival the front desk concierge showed us to the restaurant and took our coats for us, handing us over the the restaurant staff to be seated.

We had used a redletterdays voucher to pay for the booking and although we arrived without the voucher printed, the manager asked us to email him a copy and he would take care of the rest.

The quality of food and drink were excellent, just enough teas to choose from. (although it would be nice if they left the menu once the food arrived as we were interested what was in each sandwich /. cake!)

We were celebrating our anniversary and engagement and, after asking the waitress to take a photo, she brought us out a celebratory cake of her own initiative. Pots of tea were refilled without any additional charge..!

Needless to say, excellent service all round and we would very happily return. They made what was a special day for me and my fiancé an extra special one..! 5*!",5,2019,05,14
122,Outstanding hotel team for corporate event,"We recently worked with the hotel team to run a very large corporate event for up to 300 guests.  Every member of staff that we met from, reception, waiters and kitchen staff were a joy to work with an couldn't do enough to help us create a truly fantastic and memorable experience for the end client. In particular Annaliese was incredibly helpful throughout the event, no request was too much and you could see the passion in what she does shine through.    

The hotel is a beautiful venue for any corporate event, we will certainly be recommending our clients to book the space more frequently for meetings, conferences or team building activities.",5,2019,05,10
122,I had a wonderful stay as always ,"I’d like to give a big thank to to Remi and the blonde lady with the lovely lashes at the guest services desk for always making sure our plans were taken care of! 

I stay here about twice a month as my work brings me to London quite often and I always stay at the Chelsea harbour hotel. 

The suites are a good size and the surrounding areas are very peaceful. 

I’d also like to say a big thank you to the doorman and all the staff at the front desk for making our stay as easy as possible.

Make sure to stock up on water as sometimes they’re not refilled but apart from that everything here is perfect! ",5,2019,05,07
122,Excellent hotel ,"We spent only one night in the hotel, from our arrival we felt welcomed by all the staff.
We checked in very early and our room was already ready for us. 
We had breakfast and again the staff were very friendly and professional. Our penthouse overlooked the river and marina. The room is very spacious and clean.
We were also luck enough that Chelsea had a game on and the players were at the hotel before the game. 
We found the location very good as well, it's just far enough away from the hustle of London but not to far taking an Uber. 
We would definitely consider staying here again or try one of their other chain hotels. 
A definite 5 stars. 
",5,2019,05,06
122,Close to Stamford bridge,"We stayed here the first week in April.  We have stayed here a few times before and have never been disappointed.  Reasonably priced for London. Clean, great service.  I will certainly stay again when I come to see the Blues play. ",4,2019,05,04
122,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay,"My wife, granddaughter and myself stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for four nights while my granddaughter was on break from college in Canterbury.   They were very accommodating.   The two gentlemen working at the concierge station, Francesco and Erikas were especially helpful as they always made sure we had everything we needed.  We thank them very much!
I would recommend this hotel for anyone who needs accommodations near downtown London as it's only a quick taxi ride there.",5,2019,05,03
122,Special place,We tend to stay in the heart of the west end but felt like a chance and opted for Chelsea for a change .glad we did .impressive hotel with outstanding staff.luxury all over with great views over Chelsea harbour and a nice walk to the kings road .good breakfast nice evening meal parking .all good,4,2019,05,01
122,Wonderful hospitality and staff,"I have stayed here twice in the last month. Marius Roua, who checked us in, could not do enough for us. Every need was taken care of, immediately. A beautiful slice of chocolate gateaux was also delivered to our room, with a birthday message.  Beds were comfortable, beautiful coffee in room and luxury complementary toiletries were supplied.  Breakfast selection was of the highest standard and totally supportive of different dietary needs. All of the staff were friendly and super helpful. Will definitely choose to stay here for both business and pleasure. Thank you.",5,2019,04,29
122,Beautiful hotel!,"I visited back in March as part of a spa break deal. 

We got a nights stay in a suite, an hour long massage each & a 3 course meal in the evening. 
Door staff on arrival were super polite and pointed us in the direction for check in. 
Check in was super swift and although she mentioned what room we were staying in, we instantly forgot & couldn't read her handwriting...we thought it was 7 but it was room 1 on the 3rd floor. 

The room key operates the lift as well, you must swipe before selecting the floor. 

Our room was perfect in my eyes.
We had a small living room area, a large double bed & the bathroom had a bath as well as a shower. Comfort level was good & the temperature for the room was fine throughout the night. 

We dumped our bags and headed straight to the spa. The spa was a little confusing to find...we couldn't use the lift we had to use the stairs. Once found the staff were super helpful. 
They gave us the usual paper work to fill out & then they gave us a tour of the spa facilities. 

The changing rooms had plenty of lockers to choose from, hair dryers, plenty of plug sockets, water dispensers & you can also get your robes and slippers from here. 
Please note, the steam room & saunas are in the changing rooms - these are not mixed, one for women, one for men. 
The sauna & steam room are at the end of the shower facilities in the women's changing rooms. This made the shower area a little muggy. Showers were nice and large and had a good amount of pressure. 

The pool area only had a handful of loungers & no Jacuzzi which was a little disappointing. 

Our massages were booked at 5pm, we arrived at the relaxation area 15 minutes before. We were the only people in there at that time which was nice and relaxing. 
My massage was perfect - I had a full body massage. My masseuse was lovely & gave me some advice at the end of my massage telling me to use the steam room for my tight shoulder. 

Before dinner we had a little time to kill so decided to enjoy a drink at the main bar area. The waiters here are very professional and know their menu inside out. I asked for a bellini but they couldn't do this for me instead I was offered a Kir Royale, which is very similar. We were asked to sit down after ordering and they bought our drinks over to us. 

Dinner was beautiful. As we were part of a deal we had only the 3 course set menu option. 
For myself it was fine - a lot of delicious options to choose from. Although the other member to the party struggled to find anything for the starters & when it arrived they didn't really enjoy it. 
We had a beautiful table overlooking the harbour, as romantic as it was, there were children screaming and shouting - running up and down...which ruined the mood. 
The wine list has a lot of choices & I loved the fact they stocked Gavi di Gavi, which went beautifully with my second course, fish. 
Our wine was also constantly topped up, which showed the staff were attentive. 

I loved my stay here & would very much like to return.",4,2019,04,29
122,Amazing hotel with very friendly staff,Very friendly staff and amaxing location just next to Battersea Park. There is also a delicious breakfast and amazing facilties such as a spa and gym. I would reccommend this hotel highly to anyone that comes to London.,5,2019,04,29
122,Afternoon Tea,"My sister organised afternoon tea to celebrate my engagement and we had the loveliest time! Food was yummy, the cakes were delicious and the service was really good, particularly from Dominik who looked after us. Really lovely venue! Thank you",5,2019,04,23
122,Amazing Hotel,"Relative last minute booking over Easter weekend, from the moment we arrived we found all the staff to be exceptionally helpful, wonderful comfortable room overlooking the marina. Enjoyed a leisurely breakfast, 
Excellent all round, certainly be back",5,2019,04,23
122,Easter break deal,"Managed to get a great deal over Easter as London was very quiet.  
We booked the marina /river suite which had great views and a balcony.  Some areas could do with a bit of tidying up like worn carpet but generally it was a nice room .
Staff are friendly and efficient.  
Bar is reasonably priced and the breakfast is pretty good. 
Parking is available and well worth it if you have a car. 

I would stay again as the position is perfect for Chelsea end of Town. ",5,2019,04,21
122,Hidden gem for families,"We are travelling with our 8 year old son and wanted a hotel with a decent swimmingpool as well as a separate sittingroom for us parents to be in after his bedtime. Well, this hotel has proven perfect for our needs! Lovely bedroom suite, we have had the pool almost to ourselves for our evening swim and enjoyed yummie roomservice for dinner in our suite. Breakfast in a sunny brasserie overlooking the harbour is a great start of the day. We loved the food and the service (special thanks to Federica!). To top it all the whole Chelsea footballteam checked in last night before todays homegame and our son was completely starstruck! Tip for easy travel to central London: jump on the Thames Clippers and travel on the river. Departures until approx 10 on weekdays. It took us 30 min to Embankment and it was sooo stressfree... The staff has also been going out of their way to assist us so we are sorry to leave in the morning. A BIG thank you!",5,2019,04,18
122,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"We celebrated a Baby shower with a big group of my friends and I have never experience a service just like the one in this hotel. From the pre planning with the Manager Dominik all the way through till the end. They gave us an area all for us in the restaurant. Angelo and his team looked after us during the whole day, my glass was never empty. The service was on best I had in London especially for a big group of girls like us. I would defiantly will come back next time with partner.",5,2019,04,15
122,Amazing Spa treatment!,"I visited Blue Harbour for 1 night as part of a spa package and couldn't fault a thing. I stayed in a marina suite which was huge! I had two toilets, a living space with several places to sit and a balcony. Lloyd the operations director was really friendly and accomodating. The spa was extremely relaxing, the spa manager Ola showed us around, let us choose our treatment on the day and kept our belongings safe. She was super helpful and knowledgeable.   

The best bit by far was my treatment! Mimi the therapist was amazing! I had a scrub and massage and she massages every part of my body. I had a shower part way through to wash of the scrub before the moisturizer and she made me feel so comfortable. When I was on my back she covered my eyes with a warm herbal pack. If I go back again I could 100% ask for her. 

Highly recommend this for an over night spa break.",5,2019,04,14
122,Great location and space galore,"Fantasy location right on Chelsea harbour. Sitting enjoying breakfast overlooking the marina is a joyful start to your day. 
Excellent welcome on arrival and I was well looked after. 
It’s an all suite hotel so rooms are huge and very well equipped. Could do with a bit of updating in areas but it was very comfortable and I loved the space. 

Only complaint I had of the hotel was that I had requested in advance my dietary requirement as dairy free. I was there for a 2 day conference so it meant I was eating breakfast, lunch and dinner onsite. Other than soya milk at break times for coffee, the hotel couldn’t offer any dairy free options. I was pretty shocked. Given it is a 5 star hotel and its trendy location I can’t believe this is an usual request. So it proved difficult to find food I could eat. A colleague was vegan and she had also given the hotel notice of this. But again she had very few choices for what she could eat. Eventually she requested something she could eat for dinner and they went and cooked her something. But nothing has been taken into account in terms of our dietary requirements. Not great. 

Otherwise this is a great hotel. ",4,2019,04,14
122,Highly Recommend!,"This weekend I visited The Chelsea Harbour Hotel with work colleagues. I absolutely loved my time here!
The service is absolutely wonderful, the food is exquisite and the suite I stayed in was utter perfection! 

The views from the suites are breathtaking as they overlook the harbour in all its grandeur...

Thank you so much Lloyd & Ola for being wonderful hosts and showing the best of what Chelsea has to offer! 

Thank you also to Stan, the wonderful therapist who did my Facial massage, it was absolute bliss and I cannot wait to return for more wonderful treatments.

I have attached some photos of our glorious weekend and the stunning views I’m talking about.

I hope this helps someone to make a wise decision when booking a hotel in the area.

122,Such a great venue!,"Just spent a one night spa break here and it was amazing! Great location, food, spa and spa treatment! We were really looked after by Lloyd and Ola who made sure we had a great time!

122,Exquisite Wedding Venue,"I am a wedding planner and i have had an event at the Chelsea Harbour twice now and I have to say its one of the venues that speaks for itself. From the harbour, to the views and to the staffs on deck 24/7. The hotel staffs are super nice, helpful and make you feel like you are home; Gordana who was the floor manager made sure myself and my staffs had all the things we needed to make my clients wedding amazing, from transforming a ceremony room back to reception room in minutes i was amazed.

122,Great staff and fabulous marina view ,We needed 3 beds as we were three friends travelling and a king was not ideal.  The staff sorted it out fantastically and gave us a room upgrade and free breakfast.  Amazing marina view and balcony.  Close to the 606 jazz club.  Alex was great ,5,2019,03,31

122,Absolutely perfect everytime!,"My family have been staying at this hotel for over 15 years and it gets better everytime. We have just celebrated my Mums 70th Birthday there and it was made extra special by all of the thoughtful gestures by the management. You are at ease rom the second you arrive as the doormen, receptionists and concierge welcome you in and can't do enough for you.  All the suites are spacious with fantastic views of the marina and river and great for us a family with children, especially with the added bonus of a lovely indoor swimming pool.  Breakfast and dinner is always faultless with the staff always giving perfect service and I really can't recommend this hotel enough.

highly recommend visiting.",5,2019,03,23

The staff were friendly and the check in process was really great, an open face to face sit down opposed to a guy behind a bench is much better. 

Would certainly recommend this hotel for all people.",5,2019,03,22
122,Lovely Staff !!,"Stayed here again, last weekend. A great all round Hotel, set on the banks of the Thames. Easy walking distance to the Tube , and a small taxi ride up into Fulham. Had a great sized suite, overlooking the Harbour, with a balcony too. Swimming pool was nice and warm, gym also decent. Breakfast was lovely, just what we needed after a night of partying, Lol. Many Thanks, for the Complimentary cake, for my Brother who was celebrating his 50th. Nice touch. Would definitely return. Thanks, guys !!",5,2019,03,21
122,This Hotel was not what I expected!,"After clicking through on my purchase of a secret hotel on Booking.com, I was disappointed to see The Chelsea Harbour Hotel was to be the destination for my daughter, grandson and myself for the weekend.

Previous purchases of this kind have resulted in smaller hotels that had a slightly faded grandeur. This was nothing like that!

I was concerned that the hotel looked too modern, too slick, but most of all, too posh and I panicked. I didn't think we'd fit in and that we would feel out of place.

I called the hotel and spoke to Marius on the reception and he was very kind and reassuring that we would not feel out of place and further, that our stay would be both enjoyable and memorable.

Although we arrived early, we were made to feel immediately welcome and were able to check-in straight away as the room was already prepared. When I say room, I should mention that it was a suite with a fantastic balcony overlooking the picturesque Chelsea Harbour (hence the name).

The suite was wonderfully comfortable and we realised then that we were very lucky to have made this booking. It was everything Marius had said it would be.

Every interaction with the hotel staff was outstanding and left us feeling valued. The level of customer service in the Chelsea Harbour Hotel is exceptional.

After a day at the Museums, my daughter and grandson went for a swim in the Hotels swimming situated in the spa, whilst I filled the bath tub and had a lovely relaxing soak. 
After we had a great family evening followed by a really good nights sleep, This was topped off in the morning by a superb breakfast in the Chelsea Riverside Brasserie.
 
The five star Chelsea Harbour Hotel is situated in the serene Harbour Location with exceptional outstanding Customer Service.

If you would like an enjoyable and memorable hotel to stay in when you visit London, I can strongly recommend this one.",5,2019,03,20
122,Such a seamless day thanks to an amazing team,"Everything about this event went just as it should. 
Ksenia managed our booking and couldn't have been more helpful. She was on hand for any question, any call, any time and it made such a difference.
No request was too big.
The room was perfect and the food was great, but it was really that attentiveness and the friendliness of everyone at the venue that supported us that made this ideal.
Would 100% recommend to anyone",5,2019,03,18
122,Shaun Peart,"Ramy on the front desk was excellent. The suite was extremely well appointed with great reviews over the harbour. 
Don’t eat at the restaurant in the evening but had breakfast in the morning which I pre booked when checking in.",5,2019,03,13
122,MCCC,"Amazing hotel with fabulous staff and stunning views. We had dinner in the main bar area, over looking the beautiful harbour. 

The gentleman waiting on our table was very knowledgable about the menu and was attentive, even though the bar was busy.

Will definitely visit again perhaps for afternoon tea next time",5,2019,03,12
122,Amazing staff and hotel,From the moment we stepped into the Hotel lobby the service was 1st class . I took my husband to the hotel for a midweek birthday treat.

122,5 Star experience in excellent location,"I travel to London for work often and always like to try different hotels.  In working for luxury hotel brand myself, my expectations are very high.  From moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly employees who genuinely cared about my comfortable stay. The suites are very spacious, in room dining is delicious and you must find time to try the Spa! Chelsea Harbor is a great neighborhood and waking up with Marina view felt like being on vacation.  Definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,03,02
122,Very Helpful Staff,"I stay at the Chelsea harbour regularly, and called in last week to have some dinner. As I arrived to the hotel I jumped out of the taxi without realising that I had left my bag (with my passport) inside the taxi. I was extremely panicked as I was due to catch a flight in the morning but the staff at the hotel were extremely helpful. Tayyab along with two other colleagues (I don't know their names) did everything they could to help me try and contact the taxi driver. Thankfully the taxi driver came back to the hotel with my bag a short while later. I was extremely appreciative of everyone's help and I was very pleasantly surprised by how helpful the staff were.",5,2019,03,01
122,Great event and stay,"We held an event at the hotel earlier this month which went really well because of the great staff members.

Big thank you to Annaliese, Lina, Sherry and Angela.",5,2019,02,25
122,Real 5 Star,"Booked as a treat for my son (and me), from the moment of booking customer service was excellent. Was asked if it was a special occasion, explained was a belated birthday day present, and a chocolate cake was in the room on arrival. Staff at the front desk were very welcoming and made you feel as if you were a regular. The suite we stayed in was amazing with stunning views of the harbour and Thames. The food for dinner was delicious and presented well. Breakfast buffet choice was vast, very fresh and tasty, the a la carte cooked breakfast was cooked to order and tasted really good. Drinks were expensive but you expect this in London especially in hotels. Can't wait too come back!!!!",5,2019,02,22
122,Wonderful hotel with great sevice,Very close to Imperial Wharf station where we were greeted by the a very helpful footman who took my case and showed me to reception desk. Very courteous and friendly receptionists. Room 511 was a very clean spacious suite but sadly overlooked the rear so no views although we had a balcony and the sunset. Couldn’t fault our stay and would easily recommend it to anyone. Thank you Team for making us so welcome.,5,2019,02,22
122,Spa Day Experience,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel was so amazing. Holly the receptionist welcomed us with a warm smile. Mimi handled my treatment and she did an amazing job. I felt really relaxed after she was done. We also went to the restaurant, and the bar manager Peter was helpful and a great guy. If your ever in the hotel and the bar, Peter is your go to guy.",5,2019,02,18
122,Spa day experience,"This is my first time visiting the Chelsea Harbor Hotel, and I must say I had a lovely experience. The receptionist, Holly, was really welcoming. Ola handled my treatment and she really did a GREAT JOB!. My boyfriend and I also visited the restaurant and we met this lovely young man, I think his name is Peter. He was really nice and welcoming. I must say visiting London for the first time, this is an experience I won’t forget. I look forward to coming back on my next trip.",5,2019,02,18
122,Avoid this hotel,"We stayed in this hotel when Chelsea Harbour was a relatively new development and it used to be wonderful. Now it seems to be falling apart. Even the staff look tired and fed up. In particular the spa and gym area are not at all five star standard. The gym has old equipment in a crowded room, the lockers are temparamental and the sauna, steam and shower areas are dirty.  I would avoid this hotel until serious money has been spent on it.",1,2019,02,18
122,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,"Beautiful hotel in a great location, less than 10 minutes from Imperial Wharf station. Chris and Daniel were great hosts and I left the hotel feeling relaxed and refreshed. The suites are spacious with lovely views of Chelsea harbour, and have everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel as well as some very nice pieces of art. If you fancy a drink at their very sophisticated bar, I recommend the Clover Club cocktail! Will hopefully be returning very soon.",5,2019,02,17
122,Best Valentine's Day,"It was an enjoyable stay in this hotel, starting from the concierge who welcome us with a warm smile until we check-out the next day.
Please pass my regards to Frank, Angelo and the Chef Kuljit (Hope I spell his name correct) who made our stay memorable.
I recommend this hotel for any one who would like to relax and enjoy the view and also 
 the service.",5,2019,02,15
122,Excellent excellent,"I stayed at Chelsea harbour hotel in October with my family. 
In my opinion it is the best hotel in London. 
The beds are comfortable and luxurious. The rooms are very clean. The restaurant food is very good and every staff are extremely helpful. 

In my opinion Chelsea harbour hotel is London gem. 
Excited for my next stay at the hotel.",5,2019,02,13
122,Excellent,"We had a two days conference at the Chelsea Harbour hotel last week. 

I would like to thank Ksenia from Meeting and Sales department  for dealing with all the sponsors enquires and of course mine so politely and promptly. You were amazing.  
 
Mainly thank you to Lloyd , Angelo ( F&B Manager ), Gordana, Nameer and other staffs and agency staff helping us.
 
As you know we had a last minute change but Lloyd and Angelo were very helpful and accommodating. Lloyd made sure all the sponsor packages were there on time and Angelo made sure we were on track for the drinks reception. 
 
They looked after us very well with an excellent hospitality. We were very impressed and thankful. 
 
Without a doubt it’s our favourite hotel for the Arena events. We are looking forward for the more future event. 
 
They were very helpful, professional and brilliant. 
 
Kindest Regards, 
Omi Gurung",5,2019,02,12
122,Still a London favourite after many years.....,"We have been staying here for many years - 15+. It's fantastic. 
It is great for families who do not want to book two rooms - each suite has a small foyer then splits through separate doors to a bedroom and a sitting room with excellent large sofa bed. They connect and there is a full bathroom on the bedroom side and a second toilet with sink on the sitting room side. 
It remains a lovely place to stay and whilst it is a little West of the centre of the city, we love the peace and quiet yet accessibility via foot, train or taxi. 
The welcome and check-in was polite and professional, as was the valet parking. We needed to change room to gain a sofa bed for my tall son and this was arranged seamlessly. The staff are wonderful and cannot do enough - a special shout for Abdu who even got us bottles of water for our journey home!
The only criticism was that we arrived for breakfast still with 20 minutes to spare yet one of the waiters treated us like naughty children and we had to request everything more than once - the toast, coffee, cooked option menu, milk - and we were told a few times that everything would be cleared and we needed to hurry up. This type of poor service is not at all typical and I hope the individual learns from his peers.
Otherwise, fantastic as ever!",5,2019,02,11
122,Night away,"Me and my partner decided to have a night away from everything and just relax and we couldn't of picked a better place. From the moment we arrived there was 4 people waiting to greet us, can't remember all the names except for Frank and veronica who helped check us in. Friendly and talkative. The suite is prefect, we stayed and chilled in the living room and watched some tv before heading to the bar for food, which was delicious. Our waiter Paul consistently made us laugh and gave some good recommendations on dishes to have. There was nothing to fault, only downside is the suite was so comfy we didn't get a chance to visit the spa which was one of the plans but we didn't wana leave. Will deffenetly be back.",5,2019,02,05
122,Amazing Experience!,"My fiance and I stayed at this hotel last weekend.  The staff were absolutely fantastic and the service was impeccable.  The Front of House team were extremely welcoming.  We particularly enjoyed our meal at the The Chelsea Riverside Brasserie.  The meal was lovely and the wait staff were very hospitable.
I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Staying here was a thoroughly 5 star experience and I am sure we will be back again! Thank you for everything!",5,2019,02,05
122,Surprise Birthday Stay,"Without a doubt my favourite Hotel. Staff and Service exceptional! Views spectacular and amazing food and wine selection. 

A hidden gem in a beautiful setting with easy transport links across the city. Can’t wait to return!!!",5,2019,02,05
122,Excellent service,We held a corporate event for our client in the Grand Foyer for 250 guests. The service was excellent - the staff friendly and quick to help with any requests. Food was delicious and generous portions - I would not hesitate to recommend Chelsea Harbour for corporate (or private) functions!,4,2019,01,30
122,Great stay in Chelsea Harbour,"Wonderful Hotel facing the little marina of Chelsea. It’s incredible being in London with such a view. Rooms are huge, clean, comfortable and quiet.
Breakfast is rich and the staff is very kind.
Special thanks to Mauro and Marius for making my stay even better.

For me the best place to stay in London",5,2019,01,27
122,how lovely are the staff!,"This is a wonderful venue to have a function. The grand room, overlooking the marina is highly recommended, and the food was delivered piping hot. Very difficult to achieve for nearly 300 guests.
The bedrooms are so nice, I did not want to leave. The reception one receives as you enter the lobby is so welcoming and just cannot do enough.
Well done, the whole team but especially Ksenia and Gordana.",5,2019,01,25
122,Fantastic venue for a function,"We held a function at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel this week. The whole events team have been brilliant for booking to the completion of the event. Special thanks to Ksenia, Nemr and Godana, well done. The food and service was fantastic along with a beautiful function room. The guests room are great as they are all suits and very comfortable. We will be back next year!",5,2019,01,25
122,Handy location and great atmosphere !,"Handy location and great atmosphere !
Visit this hotels and bar quite often before going to The 606 Club in Lott’s Lane
Nice location by the marina and a nice walk looking at the boats there
Nice to sit on the terrace if it is warm and relax watching the boats
Great service from the bar
Good selection of bar snacks
GnT certainly hits the mark !

We will return for sure ...
Sometime a little bit busy when the match is home and you may see several of the stars ...",5,2019,01,19

122,Work Event - Couldn't fault it!,"We held our annual Sales Kick Off at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel this year and I have had nothing but a good experience with this hotel, from start to finish. My first interaction was working with Daniel Sciberras and Ksenia Sildisova to put together a proposal that worked for our event and they both could not have been more helpful and they also had some great suggestions and obviously knew their event business very well. They also came and introduced themselves to me on the day of the event which is excellent customer service.

On the day I was met by Fernando who was looking after us during the day and he showed me where everything was and where all the rooms were that we would be using. Everything was perfectly set up and him and his team were wonderful at refreshing water, teas and coffees and making sure we had delicious snacks all day. 

We then moved up to the Bridges Suite for a three course meal, there was a slight problem with the lights as they wouldn't dim but Angelo and his team came up with a solution straightaway which was great. The room looked lovely and had great views over the river and London's skyline. 
Both Nemr and Angela looked after us so well, nothing was too much to ask and the evening flowed very smoothly. As the team onsite were so wonderful I was able to completely relax and enjoy the evening. 

The food we were given all day was delicious, a really nice variety of salads and meats for lunch and then the 3 course meal was very tasty too. 

I really couldn't fault this hotel at all, any slight problem they solved straightaway and the Customer Service was some of the best I have seen. 

Thank you so much to everyone I dealt with who made this a great Sales Kick Off!",5,2019,01,18
122,A wonderful Hotel but a mixed experience!!,"On arrival to the hotel we were greeted by the doorman who was most polite. the reception was also very nice. Our room was on the first floor, it was a fantastic size room and we were very impressed. Unfortunately our balcony view was of a large amount of concrete covered in cigerette butts!!! We could not see the Harbour area at all.When I asked the Reception if there was another room higher up she said they were pretty fully booked up but would let us look at one other which had a street view. All I can say is it was a pointless trip in the lift as the room we were shown had scaffolding opposite our balcony. I had to question why we were even shown this room!! When we returned to Reception was when i had a particularly unpleasant and absolutely unacceptable experience of a Doorman literally putting his hand in my face to stop me from walking to the Reception because the Chelsea Football players were going to be arriving. I was mortified and completely shocked at how this man acted towards me. My partner was none too happy either and I raised it as soon as I reached the Reception. Is this really the way guests should be made to feel? and treated? 
I received an apology from the manager but the doorman simply kept staring at both myself and my partner as he clearly knew what was being said. I felt most uncomfortable.
The food was very nice and we enjoyed the view from the bar at night.
It is a hard situation because the hotel is lovely in so many ways so i did not want to mark it down but after my experience I don't know if I would want to actually return and it was something we had planned to do. It's a real shame Chelsea Harbour Hotel.",3,2019,01,16
122,Another lovely stay,I stayed with my adult son.   The closed plan suites are ideal as we have a bedroom each.   We also have two toilets which is a bonus.   We had a lovely view looking over the marina out to the river - it does not get better than that.   The same as the view in the bar.   The staff generally couldn`t do enough for us.   The two night stay was lovely.   I would recommend this hotel.,5,2019,01,14
122,The most amazing weekend of my children’s lives,"We recently purchased tickets for a Chelsea game. My 11 year old son is a huge fan. We travelled from Ireland to attend the event and stayed 2 nights in the Chelsea Harbour. Due to an issue with the tickets, I had to amend my booking and the reservation team and reception team could not have been more helpful and accomodating. I cannot say enough positive statements about this hotel. Everything was amazing- the location, the rooms, the staff, the food, the ambience. I cannot thank the staff enough for making it an amazing experience for my son. The restaurant manager could not have been kinder to him and the doormen were exceptional. This was truly the trip of a lifetime for him.. not only because of the game, but also because of the staff at the hotel. They genuinely appreciated his passion for the team. I look forward to making many future visits to this hotel. Thank you.",5,2019,01,14
122,Wonderful winter spa break,"We were delighted with the welcome we received from Alex as soon as we checked in. He really went the extra mile to make us feel at home.
The hotel was perfect , lovely spacious rooms and the best facials we had ever had with extremely competent and nice therapists 
We will definitely return for a spa weekend !",5,2019,01,13
122,"Excellent Customer Service, Large Rooms, and Good Location","I've stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel several times, most recently in December 2018.  Customer service is excellent in all parts of the hotel.  Friendly and attentive employees.  

The rooms at this hotel are large by any standards, especially London standards.  Spacious entry, living room, bedroom, and 1.5 bathrooms in each room.  Some rooms have balconies. The beds are comfortable, wifi is strong, and I appreciate that there are outlets in the desk area to accommodate UK, EU, and US power sources.  

The food at the restaurant is good, both at breakfast and if you choose to dine at other times.  Plenty of options for all.   

The location is very good.  It is a short walk to everything that you'd need in Chelsea and beyond.  

What makes each stay most memorable is the excellent customer service.  I look forward to returning soon.",5,2019,01,13
122,Outstanding Customer Service. - Harry Jackson,"Dear Chris/GM

I would like you to personally thank Harry Jackson for outstanding customer service.

He has helped with booking our rooms for our wedding, even though this is not his department. The groups reservation team were being very unhelpful when we were trying to book the rooms.

Harry has gone out of his way to help us secure the best rate for our wedding and even suggested local sister hotel, which we will be taking up the rooms shortly.

If all people had the customer service and attention that Harry has given us, I can assure you more bookings would be made with your hotel.

I would like to recommend Harry for an excellent customer service award , should your company have one each year.

I trust this is all you need from us.

Again i cannot highly enough praise Harry for his Customer Service that he has given us.

Kind Regards

122,Wonderful afternoon Tea,"I recently booked afternoon tea at Chelsea Harbour Hotel for a friends 90th Birthday for a group of 6, we had an amazing time and the food and staff were exceptional. We corresponded beforehand with Peter restaurant Manage you was amazing and answered all my questions. We were looked after so well and Paul who produced a cake with a candle for my friend was lovely.

122,Amazing 5star service,"From the minute you arrive at the Chelsea Harbour hotel you are made to feel welcome from the doorman to reception, concierge and restaurant staff.
We stayed in the Abingdon suite which was just delightful, watching TV whilst in the bath was a treat. 
We stayed over christmas they had put a christmas tree in our room which was a nice touch
We had christmas dinner at the hotel and the pudding (amaretto & chocolate pot) was to die for  
Fredrico the waitress in the restaurant is one of the best waitresses I have come across in a long time she is a credit to the hotel
I have told friends & family about our trip as we will definitely be returning.",5,2019,01,07
122,Exceptional staff,"We had originally booked a two night stay at The Millenium Bailey for the Paul McCartney concert at the O2.
Much to our disappointment the gentleman at the conciergie informed us that our room was not available and we'd have been moved to The Chelsea Harbour Hotel.
On arrival, managers Mike and Riccardo were fantastic in coping with our distress and  making sure everything was perfect : from room to transport, we were treated as special guests.
Breakfast was very good with splendid views over the harbour, the room was spacious and the bathroom even had a bidet !
The premises are not exactly close to an underground station, but a taxi is Always available at the doorstep.
Thanks again to Mike and riccardo who were super !!!
Higly recommended place to stay !",4,2019,01,05
122,Amazing!!!!,"The service provided was impeccable, had a great time with my church. All the staff were lovely, especially Nemr and Angela. Definitely coming back again! The food was enjoyable too, the staff at the bar were funny and welcoming.",5,2019,01,02
122,In need of renovation,Stayed here for a night on new year’s eve. Positive: location. Negatives: Room smelled of stale cigarettes. Rooms in real need of renovation. Standard is just not acceptable when you spend GBP 500 for a night! Max 4* standing. Won’t be returning unfortunately. ,3,2019,01,01
122,"Nice, but could be so much better","We booked spa treatment package and overnight stay and enjoyed it. Staff were friendly and helpful. However, apart from the initial reception area all the parts of the hotel and spa we saw are  in need of major refurbishment,, the spa shower area being quite poor.
The furniture in our suite was scuffed and discoloured, and the sitting room table had a layer of dust. We could not get the main shower to work properly, and had to leave the bath full of water as the drain plug operating lever was broken - and  the heating & a/c unit was not able to warm the rooms.

The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Thames with great riverside walks, but not well served by transport, even taxis were scarce -though there is an overland train station about 5 minutes away - and a riverbus stop too.

If they refurbish we would be happy to go there again.",3,2018,12,30
122,Christmas ,"Another superb Christmas break at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. The new menu is fantastic, caters to all. Lloyd Cole and all of his team did a marvellous and impeccable  job as always ensuring our stay was first class. All staff were very attentive and the bar staff were informative when recommending wines.
Thoroughly enjoyable experience. Thank you",5,2018,12,30
122,Brilliant hotel Riccardo is a top man,"Absolutely brilliant hotel, brilliant service from the minute you enter the hotel to the minute you check out. Staff go out of there way to help you and the guy at reception riccardo all I have to say was a pleasure dealing with him. Look forward to my next trip to London and I shall surely be staying in the Chelsea harbour hotel!",5,2018,12,28
122,Christmas Party - Aerospheres UK Ltd.,"I was a returning customer to organise my work Christmas party for the second time. All members of staff were as great as each other. Emails and phone calls were dealt with quickly and efficiently by Larisa (Senior event manager). Gordana and her team provided an impeccable service on the night.
Location is convenient and the venue is amazing - a bit pricey but worth it.

122,Meetings of Chelsea Harbour Residents Association,"I am secretary of the Chelsea Harbour Residents Association, which for more than 30 years has been representing the interests of those that live in this development where there are nearly 300 apartments and 18 town houses.

Each month we hold a committee meeting in a private room in Chelsea Harbour Hotel and once or twice a year we hold a larger meeting open to all residents in one of its conference rooms.  The facilities are excellent and in addition the service we receive from the hotel staff is always of a very high quality.

I would strongly recommend this as a venue for any business or other organisation looking to hold a meeting.  If required the hotel can also provide a first class reception with drinks and canapes and there is also a large restaurant and bar facilities available which is ideal for anyone also choosing to stay overnight.

The hotel is very easily reached from anywhere in central London and the public transport links have been much improved by the opening of the Overground station at Imperial Wharf which is only a couple of minutes walk away.

                                                                                                                              (Mark Van de Weyer)",5,2018,12,23
122,Back to the best hotel in London,"I recently stayed again at the Chelsea  Harbour Hotel having been away for 6 months and it continues to be the best place in London to base yourself. I have stayed there probably 500 times in the last 10 years and there is a reason for that - it is a hidden gem. The size of all the rooms no matter which one you get allocated are astonishing compared to the London price levels in say Mayfair which is only a 10 minute cab away. The staff are all very friendly, especially the guys who greet you when you arrive. Highly recommend to anyone for a short or long trio to London.",5,2018,12,20
122,Wonderful experience,"Recently spent 4 nights with my family at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. A real 5 star experience. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient. Everyone from reception, to concierge to the GM made an extra effort to make our stay memorable. Our family suite was beautiful and spacious with a lovely view of the Harbour and loved the personal touch of teddies bears for the kids. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone anyday.",5,2018,12,19
122,Excellent Hotel with amazing staff,"After being double booked at another hotel, we were sent to this hotel. Initially we were very disapointed as we picked our first hotel because of location, amongst other things. 
Because of the poor communication from the previous hotel meant we were offered one bed between four of us! The staff at the Chelsea Harbour quickly resolved this issue without us feeling too stressed, we had already had to change a reaervation elsewhere and were getting concerned that we were wasting what little time we had sorting this out! The General Manager came to help, making sure we liked our room before agreeing to it. Gave the children teddy bears- who were both oblivious to the drama. We had two of the rooms with an open adjoining door. The rooms were lovely and spacious. We were now fast approaching missing another reservation but the staff took us quickly to the tube station- 5 minute walk and off we went, finally relaxing. 
On our return, we had a letter from the general manager saying he hoped we had enjoyed our day and let us know they rang our reservation to let them know we would be late with some lovely tins of biscuits. 
The next day the tweens used the swimming pool and relaxation rooms. We really didnt want to leave. The breakfast was lovely and the view was stunning. 
On checking out , one of the floor managers chatted to us while we waited. I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel and what makes it special are the staff. They all went above and beyond what was expected- I can only apologise that I am not naming you all individually! 
The hotel is in a lovely area and we will definately be coming back here! We have lots more exploring to do! ",5,2018,12,19
122,Private Christmas Lunch Party,"Very good view, helpful staff, tasty food.  
We all enjoyed our company Christmas lunch at Chelsea Harbour Hotel.
After the lunch, some of our colleagues moved to the bar and enjoyed till 9pm.
Thank you for your hospitality.",5,2018,12,18
122,A Massive Thank You for another Successful Event,"Without a doubt the hotel will always be our first choice on our future events. A great hotel that provides a marvellous service. From the planning.. thanks to Larisa for making the process stress free, to the Chef's for the sumptuous food, special mention to Chef Kuljit for providing us with the food for our competition, to the 2 angels Angelo and Angela for the patience with the last minute changes and for accommodating every request. To Adlen from engineering for assisting us with the decoration. 

I would highly recommend this hotel not only for the exceptional service and quality of food but also for the facilities that the hotel has to offer and the amazing view of the harbour.

To the Management of Chelsea Harbour you are lucky to have a team who has the can do attitude and provides a service with a smile.",5,2018,12,18
122,Marvellous stay,"Without doubt one of the favourite hotels I stayed during my time in London! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by Jose the doormen. At reception our names were mentioned before introduce ourselves, the receptionist and Manuel the Guest Relations were very helpful. The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!). On the second day with us we enjoyed a great tour that was organised by lovely Galician and Irish concierges. It was a shame not have enough time to spend and enjoy the hotel a bit more. We had two great days here. We will be back! Thanks!!!",5,2018,12,12
122,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel overlooking the boats in Chelsea Harbour. Great suite with a comfortable lounge with good and complimentary coffee and tea (Whittard of Chelsea) facilities, very comfortable bed. A pity that weather was not the best to enjoy the balcony. Reception staff were very welcome and professional, Veronica at the check in and Manuel who accompanied me to the suite while he explained the facilities . I was offered a discount for the new restaurant menu. The service provided by Paul was fantastic. Hotel has also fantastic Spa facilities.",5,2018,12,12
122,A Little Gem hidden in Chelsea Harbour,"Great hotel, service wonderful. Restaurant we could not fault, bar serves a variety of upmarket cocktails and has a great atmosphere. We love this hotel location, we drove there from the south west, as not in the congestion charge zone, not far in a taxi to the west end 20 min by cab. Beautiful Bedrooms with lounge and we choose a balcony over looking the Harbour, it’s hard to think your in London. Super hotel for a weekend in London, but make sure your not on a budget! Worth every penny",5,2018,12,04
122,A Five Star Experience,"This is a wonderful hotel run by incredible staff, making our stay a magical experience. It was particularly special because it was our daughter's birthday and the staff could not have done more to make her day memorable. We wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. Lottie says a big thank you too. x",5,2018,12,03
122,Smart business hotel,"Works well for conferences & awards events. Mini suite spotless and well appointed but at the time of staying building site next door started work at 8am. The only thing I could fault was needing a magnifying glass to read coffee machine instructions and the plug in the bath did not seal well. Otherwise comfy rooms.
Managed to use the pool and sauna, & had the luxury of both to myself for an hour. Pool water nice and warm and sparkly clean. You do need the complimentary slippers as the floors are super slippy in bare feet. Plenty of modern lockers in changing. Steam room not working well enough for me during my visit.
Delightful breakfast resturant mostly self service with lovely view over the marina yachts and very helpful and attentive service team who did not rush us to eat and go which was nice.
Easy to reach by public transport if like me you are not lucky enough to arrive by chauffeur driven luxury car. I took tube to West Brompton & changed there to overground just a couple minutes to Imperial Wharf, exit station, and then 5 minutes walk to hotel lobby. 
My stay was business, I’m not sure the hotel would work for me as a place to unwind. However the terraces and outside spaces possibly change the hotel in summer months.",4,2018,12,02
122,What amazing staff,"We have just left the hotel having run a 2 day event there. The staff we absolutely fabulous, from the events team and Larisa to the banqueting team  Gordana and Fernando and Angel who was so fabulous that they inspired me to write a review.  Thank you for making a 2 day event so easy and copable, you're awesome.",5,2018,11,30
122,The wonderful hotel & amazing staff,"I can not find enough words to describe the splendor of my stay in your wonderful hotel and the wonderful staff you have .
Special thanks to Mr. Manuel I can not forget what he did to help me with the booking and in every inquiry he did not delay in providing help and solutions thank you so much 😊 
Special thanks also to Mr. Brais Perez for organizing wonderful trips and providing assistance in any inquiry thank you so much 😊

122,The best London Hotel for a Leisure trip,"Visit after visit this hotel continues to deliver a quality stay, even were I tempted to try somewhere else when staying in London my family would never let me go anywhere else! The rooms are a great size for family and the spa facilities great. Every member of staff we encountered as part of our stay was tremendous.",5,2018,11,27
122,A Quiet Oasis in Busy London,"Thank you CHH for providing such a warm and wonderful weekend experience. I had the pleasure of being with you last weekend and the price was fair, location perfect for me, and the room and its ammenities far, far exceeded my expectations and are almost unheard of in London. It’s the kind of place where I wish I could have stayed longer. Everything was top notch. Tip: have a late lunch at the Riverside Bar (the “Works” Pizza was outstanding) then retire to the balcony and admire the harbour and the stillness. I promise you, you’ll forget you’re in one of the busiest cities in the world! On top of that, as a local, you are walking distance to The Chelsea Ram a fantastic pub, Lots Road Gastropub, 606 Club for jazz, and one of the best Indians in London that only those in the know, know... Exotikka on Stadium Street. Boris Bikes are nearby on Upcerne Road and an Overground Station Imperial Wharf is outside close by. Take it to Wembley or start a journey across Europe from there. Outstanding. Will be back if budget permits!",5,2018,11,27
122,Highly Reccomend,"Just spent a lovely stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel London ,great place to stay for a special occasion ,wonderful riverside walks ,very friendly staff ,always willing to make your stay special ,will return in the summer to enjoy the fantastic views on the terraces",5,2018,11,26
122,Still good but needs a refresh,"This is a very nice location as it is quiet and has nice riverside walks. It is a 20 minute taxi ride to central London The service was good, friendly and efficient. The rooms are a great size and very good value for London. The problem is that they are now very tired. They have not been refitted in any significant way for 15 years and whilst they are still quite nice they certainly look tatty. Its a shame as it takes the hotel down a few levels. If they did major refit it could change everything.",3,2018,11,26
122,Highly recommended,"We stayed in a balcony suite for 2 nights for our 10th wedding anniversary.  Everything was great, and for a London hotel it is very good value.  The staff were friendly and attentive without being too over-bearing.  We would certainly come back.",5,2018,11,25
122,Great comfort!,"Have stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel many times just because it is so comfortable with large suites and a fantastic staff, always very helpful and friendly. Very comfortable beds with high quality bedding.",5,2018,11,21
122,Quiet location in the middle of a nice residential neighbourhood in Chelsea.,"Love the location, neighbourhood, room and food. Overall it is ideal. Staff are especially nice during the day and breakfast the experience is exceptional. I love to jog around the waterfront and it is a private community.",5,2018,11,20
122,Fantastic Service,"Dined at the bar on a couple of occasions, lovely view and dining area.

Great food very cost effective.

We had a waiter Paul who took care of us on each occasion, anything and everything we needed.

cant fault the service.  A pleasurable visit",5,2018,11,19
122,Anniversary family lunch,"We had an amazing experience having booked the Bridges Suite at the hotel for our anniversary lunch with extended family. The suite is spacious and easily accommodated about 35 of us - both children and adults - and had balconies over looking the harbour. The staffing team at our lunch were faultless, professional, polite and made everything run so smoothly. Nothing was too much trouble for them. A brilliant venue for a larger than usual event!",5,2018,11,18
122,A perfect stay,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is the perfect location for 5 star plus treatment in London. Having stayed there in several occasions recently I cannot fault anything from reception to housekeeping.
Any small problem is dealt with efficiently and professionally. I have found a tranquil place in the hustle and bustle of London with great views and a fantastic value for money option . Please take my advice and give them a try you won’t regret it !!!!",5,2018,11,18
122,Average at best,"Room was ok, service was great, restaurant was slow.
Very convoluted for UBER or taxis to find the correct entrance.
Pool is indoor, and OK - spa facilities are nice.
Room service took very long as well - food is ok.

There is maybe one pub near the hotel, no restaurants or supermarkets, in a good 10 minute walk radius.
I expected more for the money.",3,2018,11,16
122,Amazing Spa facilities,We had a lovely day at the hotel . We enjoyed the Spa facilities and the High tea. Mimi and Ola are amazing and very courteous and the massage was very relaxing.The staff at the bar were also very polite. Thank you.,5,2018,11,14
122,"Lovely looking hotel, but inside needs a lot of work!","Stayed here for a business conference, and it first of all took us ages to find from the station, there’s no straight path just a complicated venture. We were sent straight downstairs to drop off luggage and the staff were pretty rude, this continued throughout our two night stay, the only friendly members of staff were working at breakfast, that’s it! It seemed as if every question we asked we got a confused look and them having to discuss with another member of staff!
We found the WiFi to be bad, constantly connecting and disconnecting. The crazy thing was that there’s no stairs?! Over 60 of us having to wait for 3 lifts which took absolutely ages! The rooms were really nice, great views of the harbour, but again a few issues. Out of about 6 plugs, only 2 worked, and none of these were near the bed. 
Our second day we found our room was left on the latch all day after housekeeping had been, really not happy about that! Lastly, downstairs near our conference room there was a disgusting smell almost like sewage, no staff members seemed to understand when we asked about it. Quite disappointed with the stay and really expected a lot more. ",3,2018,11,12
122,Amazing ,"Visited few times already, last time spent the night in saville suite , highly recommend. Beautiful room, amazing views over the Thames and unforgettable London panorama. The room
Itself was spacious and lovely.’the only thing was the smart tv and connection, we booked the room especially to be able to watch Netflix and amazon prime programmes but were not able to do so. There was a problem with connecting our devices, that is the only thing they need to work on . Otherwise, can not fault, the staff are amazing and accommodating, well
Done again ",5,2018,11,12
122,Business Trip - Corporate Meetings,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks and i felt i was at home. The staff are excellent and courteous. The manager Lloyd is an exceptional guy. He made my stay pleasant. This is one of the best hotels i have stayed at in London. The food was fantastic. I could not fault anything in this hotel. The rooms were very spacious and i recommend you come with your partner or spouse for a full experience. I also want to thank the staff who went out of their way to help with requests - Shane - This guy is a superman! Always willing to help. Brais - Simply brilliant! Alex - This guy was very helpful and friendly. They all made me enjoy London for two weeks! I am definitely coming back to this hotel. The house keeping staff were just professional. I never felt i was away from home. The beds were extremely comfortable...

You will never know how appreciative we all were to have our girls weekend scheduled at Chelsea Harbour.

122,Annual Offsite - Amazing Hotel,"Wow, amazing hotel.  The staff really couldn't do enough for us.  The venue for the Conference was truly fit for purpose, private, large, natural light.  Food was great too, not your usual conference buffet.

Will highly recommend anyone to use this hotel for an overnight or conference booking.",5,2018,10,29
122,Great couple of days,"We stayed for 2 nights and threw in a spa visit as well.
The location is really good, a short walk the Thames or few minutes cab ride to the underground.
The service is absolutely superb, polite, helpful and really friendly.
We had a King Suit which is huge and pretty luxurious, only downside was the carpeting was dirty in the bedroom.
Would definitely go back",5,2018,10,28

122,VIP experience and excellent staff,We enjoyed the location and the VIP experience in the hotel during our business trip. The staff and the managers were excellent with our delegation and made sure that we felt comfortable at all times. The rooms were spacious and had an amazing view at the private harbour. There was only a bit of a noise coming from a building in construction next to the hotel. Thanks!,5,2018,10,22
122,Amazing Stay!,"Had such an amazing experience staying here at the weekend! Attentive service but not over the top, friendly, pleasant staff.  Rooms we lovely and beds comfy. Spa was great too, had a lovely massage. Food was awesome! Felt very rested and relaxed after my stay! A big thank you.",5,2018,10,22
122,Relaxing night away with friends,"From start to finish the experience of staying at the chelsea harbour hotel was fantastic . Staff are attentive and well trained whist retaining a relaxed and friendly atmosphere . Its hard to believe that you are in central London , as it is a quiet and peaceful place to stay . From the bar staff , to the spa treatments and the restaurants standards are very high . Thank - you for a perfect and relaxing stay",5,2018,10,22
122,Perfect place if you look for peace and comfort in London,"I have been there couple of times , and all the time I was surprised about the professionalism of their stuff and the great location.

122,Perfect for a business trip,"We had an amazing 3 days stay in the hotel thanks to the great service of the staff and the responsible managers Lloyd and Stan. Our experience is worth the 5 stars, the location is very central while at the same time the hotel is quiet and well maintained. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, perfect for a good rest. I would definitely recommend The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for a business trip.",5,2018,10,19
122,"Quiet, relaxing location","We've stayed here on numerous occasions and this hotel would always be our first choice for location, room size & value for money in London. Who needs to go into the West End when Kings Road, Sloane Square, Sloane Street & Knightsbridge are within walking distance.",4,2018,10,19
122,Excellent choice for an official 3-day visit,"I stayed in the hotel during the official Bulgarian visit in London. Lovely location, peaceful and calm hotel.Friendly and helpful staff with the Manager Lloyd, discreet but efficient security Stan.
Would recommend for next visits.",5,2018,10,19
122,Standards have slipped - feels left behind ,"We first stayed here for our first wedding anniversary 8 years ago and we were wowed by it. Amazing view, the suite, the quality of the breakfast set up and served in the bedroom, quality of the fixtures and fittings etc.

We returned in September this year expecting the same. Instead, however, we were allocated a room overlooking the front of the building, which is currently a building site, the suite had signs of wear and tear all over the place (odd stain, scratch, stained grout on bathroom floor, the television was the same tv we had at home 10 years ago, the breakfast was poor mushy scrambled egg/stiff bacon, wheeled in on a dirty trolley covered with a pristine white tablecloth and left for us to set up - we had to sit and eat it on our laps, the continental aspect had been forgotten too.

It cost £40 to park the car in the car park for the evening.

Decor in the reception area is also a bit dated - sofas that have seen better days and art work that looks like it’s been there since the 90s.

Overall just didn’t have a good vibe like the first stay.

Staff on reception were pleasant and helpful though.

",3,2018,10,16
122,central well appointed modern hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at this central located and well appointed hotel during our visit to London with our UK friends.
The rooms are spacious, clean and modern overlooking the marina and harbour, it includes a small balcony.
A generous breakfast with all the trimmings was included with our room. 
Bar services are offered.
A cab to the sites and downtown is easily obtained from the lobby.
We found the prices very reasonably for this upscale hotel.",5,2018,10,11
122,Beautiful spacious rooms,"we have stayed here many times and what we love is the spacious sitting room, very comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom with two basins and marble work surfaces. the View of the Marina is lovely and also it is very quiet at night. it is lovely having a balcony to sit on and enjoy a cup of coffee watching the boats. Depending on the room you get morning or evening sun. The staff are very willing and helpful but some don't speak great English which can be a problem. There is valet parking which is very expensive but we used it because it is so handy. The door men and porters are very helpful and extremely grateful for a tip. ",5,2018,10,10
122,A great venue for a conference.,"I’ve been to many conferences and it’s the little things that make the difference.
The location is very good and easy to get to, the hotel looks fantastic and it certainly has the air of a 5 star hotel.

But it was the staff that were very good. Genuine welcomes, happy staff, and attentive without being annoying. The coffee and food was good quality and the room itself was pleasant.

Very good",5,2018,10,03
122,Only one night☹️,"Had the pleasure of staying at Chelsea Harbour Hotel last weekend and cannot recommend it highly enough. It is a lovely hotel in an amazing place. From the moment you arrive the staff are friendly and professional and nothing is too much trouble. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing and the only downside is that because we were only there one night we couldn’t take advantage of all it had to offer. Having morning coffee on our own balcony after a fabulous breakfast was one of many highlights. We will definitely be returning for longer next time to explore both the hotel and the area. My tip - take advantage of valet parking, get rid of the car and get out and about on foot from the river to the Kings Road there’s so much to see a few minutes walk away.",5,2018,10,02
122,Fabulous!!!,"Fabulous hotel , excellent location , the staff were superb , efficient helpful , polite friendly and professional , the food was also fabulous and the room was more excellent, definitely worth the money especially in the area which the hotel is located! Will most definitely be back and would recommend to anyone",5,2018,09,26
122,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing staff - wow!","What a fabulous hotel - unbelievable service from start to finish. Nothing has ever been too much trouble. Every member of staff really went out of their way to help us. The team were amazing - special mentions for Felix, Fernando, Gordana, Atilla, Simon, Costa, Rocky, Angelo, Peter, Dominic, James, Fabrizio and Ewa  to name but a few. Front of house all the concierge / guest relations team were amazing including Amanda, Brais and all the reception team. My biggest thank you is for Operations Director Lloyd - who is unbelievable. His service level and professionalism are outstanding. No other word for it. Thanks CHH for a fab stay!! #highlyrecommended",5,2018,09,20
122,Excellent Wedding!!!!,I was here for a wedding back in August and I can't fault the venue or the Service. The food was amazing and had a fantastic evening. I would highly recommend the venue as a wedding venue or for other events.,5,2018,09,17
122,1990's retro luxury,"Decided to treat ourselves to a luxury break so chose this hotel. The room was a full suite and was laid out well. The only complaint is it's all dark wood from the 1990's which still good quality but a bit dared. The balcony view was over the hotel entrance which once the building work is done will be good. 

Service was fantastic and smooth with all you would expect of a hotel of this standard. Access is easy being opposite a tube or via taxi and would recommend as a quiet treat only a short hop to London centre",4,2018,09,11
122,Lovely hotel. Shame about all the building work not being mentioned.,"Be aware if staying here that virtually all of the area is being redeveloped, noise in some of the rooms from 0800-1700 is pretty unbearable. All of the staff were fantasic and food quality was good too. Shame they dont tell you om the website about whats happening loacally.",3,2018,09,08
122,Wonderful birthday celebration in a 5star hotel in Chelsea ,"We stayed at the hotel for my partners birthday and had a wonderful time. The hotel has only suites and we booked on the top floor overlooking the river and the skyline of London. Rate included already breakfast and a glass of Champagne. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are very spacious with a bathtub and a big shower. Our suite had also a guest toilet, which is convenient if you invite friends to your suite. 

We booked a spa treatment, which was amazing, thanks to Romina in the spa and enjoyed the pool afterwards. 

We had Afternoon Tea afterwards, which was one of the best I ever had and the presentation is very spectacular. Its worth to visit the hotel just for the Afternoon Tea. The homemade scones were extremely delicious. 

When we cam back to our suite we had a handwritten birthday card from the General Manager, which was very thoughtful. 

On the next morning we ordered room service for breakfast which was of a high quality. We were able to enjoy it on the balcony on a sunny morning - it felt like real vacation. 

Thanks to the friendly team at Chelsea Harbour for a wonderful stay.",5,2018,09,07
122,Summer Stopover,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is a nice hotel in a quiet part of the SW. Key & commendable points about the hotel. 
1. The strongest point is the help provided by Gonzague Pruvost (the night shift duty manager) during my stay. He was of such great help to me as I had a challenge - misplaced some documentation & needed to get a new set so I had to work till 3am. He was there available to assist till I finished all I had to do. He also helped book a sister hotel for me when I had to change hotels. 
The staff are generally nice & helpful. 
2. Hotel is walking distance to a train station (Imperial Wharf), which makes commuting convenient. The station is about 4 stops from the Westfield Shopping Mall at Shepherds Bush for all your shopping. 
3. The dining area overlooks the Marina which I truly enjoyed as it was summer. 
4. The room I stayed in (206) was good & spacious. A suite style room with a balcony facing the Marina. 

A few weak points. 
1. Rates are quite pricey. 
2. Breakfast variety is not comparable to other London hotels of this caliber. This can be improved upon. 
3. Upon checkout I was informed that I had taken some mint from the refrigerator in the room and would be billed for it, which I did not take. I found that rather distasteful & gave me the feeling that hotel staff could go into your room, take things without your knowledge and the hotel would bill you for it. It was eventually dropped possibly because it was a small amount. 

Overall, my experience was good with special commendation to the front office staff. It would be nice if the dining room staff can imbibe such the same attitude. ",4,2018,09,06
122,Amazing Lunch!,"A great lunch served by the restaurant on site. Hot bread to start (Yum!) followed by an incredible seafood linguine! I wanted to try the Panacotta for desert but I couldn't fit it in sadly. 

Food and service was great overall - with a menu to suit all appetites! 

The table next door had the afternoon tea, which also looked amazing - I'll be back to test!",5,2018,09,06
122,Unique and very special place,"I visited with two friends and had evening drinks on the spacious, relaxing terrace overlooking the harbour, with its amazing mixture of vintage and modern boats and jet-set apartmenrts. Very peaceful and elegant, and absolutely unique in West London- great place!",5,2018,09,05
122,Spa day and afternoon tea,The spa was lovely and very clean. My friends and I got the aroma massage and it was very relaxing. The afternoon tea was also very nice and the day was enjoyable. The spa is quite small however so would suggest going on a weekday when it’s quieter ,5,2018,09,04
122,Great service and food at amazing location.,We had dinner with friends at the restaurant. Surprised to have these nice views so close to central London. You are overlooking the Chelsea Harbour and can enjoy delicious food in a special location. All dishes we had were great and the service they provide is very nice.,5,2018,09,02
122,Lovely Meal in Chelsea,"The hotel is a kind of city resort in London. Located in Chelsea with views overlooking the Thames and the marina. We had dinner in the restaurant and the professional, as well as friendly service delivered by Felippe was as good as all of the dishes we ordered.",5,2018,09,02
122,Spa day with afternoon tea,"This is a very beautiful hotel, great ambience and the afternoon tea menu was excellent. Each individual's need was catered to and the staff were pleasant and extremely  helpful. I will definitely visit again.",5,2018,09,02
122,"Friendly, chic, great location and gorgeous views","I stayed for three nights during a conference, also held at the hotel. My suite was fabulous, with a wonderful modern decor and huge bed. The bedding felt luxurious as did the towels and robe. The sitting room in my suite was spacious and had its own balcony. There was even a guest toilet.
The restaurant was good, but I only used it for breakfast. The buffet at the conference was excellent. I found th concierge helpful and the room service was fast and friendly. Wonderful location. Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,31
122,Afternoon tea and spa,"The staff was amazing they went above and beyond to make our time there memorable.

The spa treatments were lovely and the facilities were wonderful. 

The tea was great, a special thanks for the hotel as they gave us a lovey present for our friend on her birthday.",5,2018,08,31
122,Fabulous Weekend Stay!,"Me and my Husband stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel over the Bank Holiday weekend. We had a very pleasant stay and will definitely be returning in the near future. We stayed in one of the Suites which was lovely, spacious and immaculate! The bathroom had a bath and a separate shower which was great to have this option. We ordered some room service and the food was very plentiful and we also had breakfast delivered to our room in the morning which was hot and very filling too.
We cannot fault the service which we received, we have visited this hotel a number of times now and each time we receive 5* service which keeps us returning!
Thank you to everyone who ensured that we had a pleasant stay in particular Andreas Stys (Manager) and Maria at the check-in desk.",5,2018,08,31
122,A five star hotel but with a three star actual service.....,"It's a five star hotel , but with a lot of short comings....!!  Air conditioning not always working , a long wait for room service , and with broken down lifts too..!! You will never get what u pay for that's for sure....!!",3,2018,08,31
122,Booked for my wedding night,I booked the Abington Penthouse to get ready in on my wedding day and then spent my wedding night there. Staff did not appear professional or helpful. They couldn’t find my booking at check in and were rude about it. When they found it there was no apology. Nice hotel but staff need to be retrained.,3,2018,08,30
122,Family visit,"An excellent hotel to stay at with your family.  However, the check out seems rushed and I personally felt that it was inconvenient for me to park up outside the front to collect my luggage.  The curtain in our room was heavily stained with some sort of spillage.  The breakfast was great as per usual and I would highly recommend this.",3,2018,08,29
122,Wedding reception,"Visited this hotel recently for a wedding reception. Lovely venue but parking very difficult, on site parking even more expensive.  Area where the reception was was very nice and spacious. Great venue and location just paran issue.",4,2018,08,28
122,Amazing stay in Chelsea,"We stayed for two nights and had a suite overlooking the Marina. We were staying on the 6th floor and could also see a part of the London Skyline (Shard, Gherkin).
The beds a very comfortable and our bathroom had a shower and a bathtub. Friends were coming over for a drink and the living room is spacious enough for four people and we spent also some time on the balcony. 
We had afterwards dinner in the restaurant, which was delicious and the waiters were very friendly. After the dinner we had a drink on the terrace of the bar, also overlooking the Marina. 
After the breakfast, good selection of everything you like to have at the buffet and hot breakfast is served a la carte. Wonderful Eggs Benedict and scrambled eggs with salmon. We went shopping to Westfield, which is just three stops with the Overground away. 
The following day we enjoyed a long walk through Chelsea, Kings Road and Sloane Square – great neighbourhoods. We used the gym, had a relaxing treatment afterwards and enjoyed a break at the swimming pool. 
The hotel is almost like a resort hotel in London and we are looking forward to our next stay.",5,2018,08,24
122,Could be better,"Love this hotel and stayed here many times over the last five years, but it is now  a little tired and the new owners have cut back on some of the nice things that were there before, breakfast is now self serve, toiletries are not as nice and no fruit in the room, and for £280 a night I think it should be better",3,2018,08,22
122,Already packing my bags for the next visit,"I had the pleasure to stay at the Chelsea Harbour for a 3 nights, during a business trip to London. Perfect location, very convenient, with quick and easy access to London's public transportation network. Very warm welcome at the Front Desk with swift check-in. By the way: Absolutely forthcoming and kind-hearted staff, who have understood the true meaning of hospitality: took immediate care of me and my luggage. Bright and very spacious Suite, with huge bathroom. I especially appreciated the large (!rain!-)shower. Big Desk in the living area and definitely some of the fastest WiFi I've experienced in Hotels. The bed was just the way I like it. 
All in all, it was a perfect fit for me! Highly recommend for others too!
I'll be back soon...",5,2018,08,22
122,Weekend Family Visit,"Fantastic staff and great location, my family and I visited the hotel on Sunday had a wonderful and relaxing time. The Management team of Peter, Lloyd and Angelo where exceptional very helpful and professional. All the Bar staff where great can not fault anyone at the hotel and would throughly recommend a visit either to stay the night or lunch and dinner.",5,2018,08,20
122,Keith Johns and Jan Johns,"Absolutely wonderful stay for a long weekend with our daughter /husband and 3 grandchildrenComfortable, staff excellent and food great.The  pool was greatly appreciated by the children. We enjoyed the pool, sauna and steam room as adults",5,2018,08,20
122,Fabulous weekend,"A weekend treat away with a friend made all the more special by the team at the Chelsea Harbour. The room (a river view suite) was lovely. The balcony overlooking the marina and the river beyond was perfect for evening drinks and early morning coffee. Facilities in the room were excellent and topped off with effective soundproofing (an important feature when you are visiting from the 'sticks'). The location is perfect for a mooch along the Kings Road or walking the embankment. 
A special mention must be made of Lloyd, who not only recommended a place to eat but guided us through the streets to the Chelsea Ram. And thank you for the bubbles and petit four - a delightful surprise. I'm thinking of an excuse to stay again!",5,2018,08,20
122,2 very different visits! Both an excellent experience,"I first visited the Chelsea Harbour Hotel when 20 of us went for afternoon tea for my hen weekend in November 2017 - we had such a fantastic time and the afternoon tea and cakes etc were so lovely. Most importantly the staff were fantastic and made us feel so special and so welcome. I went back with my husband to stay for a night for his birthday a couple of weeks ago and we had the most amazing time. The room was fantastic with a great view of the harbour and felt very luxurious. The breakfast the following morning was top notch. Again, what made it so good was the team at the hotel - Andreas the General Manager is so lovely and friendly at the same time as being super professional. All the staff members we came into contact with were similarly great. Although this is a very high-end hotel, it's not snooty, which makes for a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. Thank you very much! We will be back :)",5,2018,08,18
122,Wonderful,"My wife and just stayed at The Chelsea’s Harbour Hotel for my birthday and I have to say I have never had a better experience staying at a hotel in London, this was mostly due to the staff and the general manager, Andreas Stys, whom welcomed us at the reception on arrival. When we got to the room there was a chocolate cake waiting with happy birthday on it and a card. The service and professionalism of the staff was exceptional, we will defiantly return and can highly recommend staying here.",5,2018,08,17
122,Great visit,"Visited for my friends 40th birthday and couldn't of asked for more.

Great time, great service, lovely staff, so helpful, cannot fault our stay at all.  The rooms are nice and bright, the hotel is a fab location and the food is great.

Cannot wait to come back soon.",4,2018,08,15
122,Great hotel but staff need better training,"We 2 nights in this hotel in the run up to our wedding, we informed the reservations team when booking that the rooms were being booked to enable us and our bridal party to get ready for our wedding and that there would be a hair and make up artist, photographer and videographer coming to the hotel the day of the wedding. We gave exact numbers to the reservations team and were told that there was no problem with our requirements, however, when we arrived the front of house staff told us that we could not take photos in the hotel, there was an issue the number of people in the rooms. We were also left waiting over 45 minutes for an extension lead that was needed urgently by the hair and make up artist and my wife had to go to reception herself and make an issue to get the equipment brought up.The hotel is in a great location, the food at the hotel is good, however the training of the front of house staff leaves a lot to be desired.",3,2018,08,14
122,Chelsea Harbour Stay,"The rooms are very nice and we had a suite with a great view. If you like to go to the gym, it's very average. But, our main problem was the service in the bar/terrace. Our food took over an hour to turn up the waiter didn't really care and nobody sorted the problem out. When the food did arrive, it was very average.A mouse also paid a visit to the terrace whilst everyone was eating.",2,2018,08,13
122,Great stay with an fantastic evening at the Someone like Adel concert ,"My wife and is stayed for the second time at the Chelsea Harbour. This time we joined the a Gala Dinner with the Concert of Nicky Ray ( someone like Adel) It was a wonderful evening. Great concert with Adel and the Band which was performing after Nicky had been stunning. The service and menu selection was great. We enjoyed every moment of this special evening. A big thanks to the GM Andreas Stys ( a Real Hôtelière) and his amazing F&B and Restaurant manager +team. We will be back soon !!

122,Five Star City Resort in London,"We read several positive reviews about the hotel and were excited to try it out. Our first impression was great, doorman with a Spanish accent was smiling all the time and extremely helpful. The young lady at the Check In was also very friendly and asked us for the occasion of our stay.
It was a belated birthday present from my partner. He had booked treatments for us at the Spa, which were wonderful. We went to the Sauna afterwards and relaxed a little bit at the pool, which has a good size. When we came back to our suite, the hotel has only suites, I was surprised by a bottle of Champagne with strawberries, which my partner arranged for us. There was also a selection of Chocolates with a personal birthday card from the Hotel Manager. We didn’t have any plans and while the weather was so great, we ordered Room service and had dinner on the balcony with an fantastic view overlooking the Marina. The beds are extremely comfortable. We had an early breakfast and the eggs benedict and the scrambled eggs with salmon tasted delicious. There is also a small buffet with everything you can think of for a good start into the day. We enjoyed the fresh smoothies.
After we checked out, we went to the Frida Kahlo exhibition at the V&A museum and we left our luggage at the hotel. When we picked up, the young lady at the Front Desk recognised us and wished us a good journey.
We had an amazing time and I am looking forward to our next stay in January, when we visit Cirque de Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall.",5,2018,08,11
122,5star birthday celebration in London,"We stayed there on the occasion of a birthday celebration. We booked a suite overlooking the Marina and the River. Its worth to spend the money, because breakfast and two glasses of Champagne are included in the price. 
We received a very nice handwritten birthday card from the General Manager with a cute Happy Birthday plate with chocolates. We wanted to book a treatment in the Spa, but they didnt have any availability, that was the only downside of the stay. 
We enjoyed the sauna and the pool, which was also nice. We had dinner at Sloanes Square and enjoyed our walk back to the hotel on King's Road. We had Eggs Benedict for breakfast, which couldnt have been better. Thanks to the team and the management for a great stay. ",5,2018,08,11
122,Great experience in a relaxed location,"We stayed for 2 nights at the start of August for a relaxing weekend break in London. Staying in Chelsea was a fantastic choice by my girlfriend as one of her friends recommended the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. It is in close proximity to London, literally 10-15 mins in a taxi or Uber and you get to see all of Kensington, Chelsea & Green park which is a perk. The hotel is well equipped with all that is required and the suites are fantastic for short or long stays. The clientele here seem to be on the more stylish end as there were an array of expensive cars parked outside which made us very confident about the area and the hotel. Service was fantastic, especially by a gentleman in the restaurant called Peter who was impeccable from start to finish during our breakfast and lunch sittings. No choice but to give this hotel a 5* review as it is fantastic for it's location and much more cost effective on price than city centre hotels. Great work and thanks again!",5,2018,08,11
122,"A fabulous, hidden gem of a place for evening drinks","I went for evening drinks on the restaurant terrace last night and cannot understand why I've not been before. It was divine. The staff were wonderful attentive, without being annoying. The covered terrace looks out onto the marina and so it was a fantastic spot to keep cool in the August heat. The menu is one of pure joy where all your favourite 
Later in the evening,  we went inside to sit at the bar where the bar men whipped up tasty cocktails- def try an ameretto sour night cap!  Cannot wait to go back again.",5,2018,08,09
122,Weekend ,Another favourite stopover in London. Lovely restaurant and bar overlooking the marina. Spacious and well appointed bedroom. Comfortable reception area when waiting for friends to arrive. Helpful staff who are always pleasant. ,5,2018,08,06
122,Top hotel!,"Chelsea Harbour is a great hotel. Quiet location in Chelsea, top staff and comfortable rooms. We have been there severel times and we will come back. But the breakfast is to expencive in compare to what you get",5,2018,08,06
122,My home from home,"I don't normally write reviews, but given my excellent stays for many years at this property, I thought it would be nice to give something back!

This is by far my favourite hotel in London. Not right in the 'conventional' centre of London but close enough to have the feel of being really central and a very short walk to Kings road, one of the most famous roads in London. The location of this hotel by the Chelsea Harbour gives such a wonderful feel of calm and tranquility and wonderful views far over London. Not to mention the fireworks at New Year's Eve...I cant think of a better place to stay and watch them from.

Now the rooms themselves. Good luck finding bigger rooms than this in London, because you won't! All the rooms are suites, which make it absolutely ideal for families and entertaining guests, particularly when you have 2 bathrooms. Don't expect super modern decor as this hotel is not about that..It retains the older style, luxurious feel with very practical amenities in the rooms, including multi country plug sockets, espresso machines and TVs which you can connect your own devices to. Also all the rooms have a walk in shower as well as a separate tub! And all rooms i have been in have lovely views from a very decent sized balcony. Got to mention the huuuuge beds which are super comfortable. What are they...Super super Kings!?

The hotel also has a pool, a spa, a gym, a great bar with a huge outside terrace; basically everything to keep you busy, and something that has been particularly important over the last few months is that there is excellent air conditioning throughout the hotel, including the rooms.

Another thing that I have always appreciated at the hotel is the friendliness, can-do attitude, and overall high level of professionalism from the staff in all areas, and of course the staff at the front door and the reception are the first interaction you have when entering the property, so that good first impression is essential.    

Food has also been significantly improved in my opinion over the years that i have been going. Breakfast is part buffet and part a la carte and is very tasty with lots of options. Lunchtime you must try the club sandwich and the pizzas from the bar menu, which are hard to be beaten in town. And if you've been looking for your next Sunday Roast venue, this is it!  

So, overall, I'd say it's very hard to fault this hotel. The prices are also very very reasonable for what you get...But book early as throughout major London events (like wimbledon etc) this hotel is sold out very quickly!

Thank you to all of you at the hotel who continue to make my stays so fantastic and who make the hotel run so smoothly. I'll always be recommending you! Can't wait to be back!

122,Wonderful River Views,"Outstanding hotel- welcoming staff, spacious rooms with wonderful view up the Thames, and extremely quiet. It is nice to have a drink outside overlooking the Harbour or from the room balcony. We look forward to returning! ",5,2018,08,02
122,Family Trip,The swimming pool should be condemned and the rooms need upgraded but still a comfortable place to stay with helpful staff and handy for getting to the Kings Road - The staff were generally very helpful except in the bar area where they were slow and at times I wondered if they even understood English,3,2018,08,01
122,Wonderful stay at Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"I stayed with friends over the weekend in July and I highly recommend this hotel. The view is great, I feel like by the sea there. The rooms are spacious. Staff did their best to make sure our stay would be unforgetable. Thank you Ivellin for your amazing service in the restaurant. Will be back soon!",5,2018,08,01
122,Not as good as it looks on the internet!,"We booked a night here for a weekend in London. The hotel looked stunning from the pictures on the website and I have to say I was disappointed by the reality.  Dated 90's decor in the room, no milk or toiletries, I had to keep calling reception to get basics delivered to our room. Had to call twice for the milk then almost got charged for it!  Depends what you're looking for but it's also a good 15 mins walk from the nearest tube so travel there a bit tiresome.  Plus points it was very clean and the bed was huge, very comfortable with good quality linen.  All in all though I wouldn't stay again, one 90's flashback which definitely isn't on trend.",3,2018,07,29
122,Good Value 5* Hotel ,"Margaret and I just spent the last three nights at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel 

I worked on this hotel and the nearby Harbour Club back in the early nineties 

Whilst the world has moved on with the development of venues such as The Ned and others if your in Chelsea you would be hard pressed to find a better hotel 

The restaurant and bar with its deck adjoining the exclusive Chelsea Harbour is a great place to enjoy a meal or drink

The rooms are all suites , the ones on the front of hotel suffer with noise from the railway 

The only negative points are that the hotel is looking a little tired 

Scraps on the lifts and tables look a little less than 5*

Staff are polite and very attentive 

We will return when Chelsea 

The pictures are from our 7th floor suite and across the Harbour

122,Chelsea Harbour - Heaven for couples,"My partner surprised me to a shopping trip to Tiffany 's at Sloane Square. Afterwards we went to the hotel and had some Champagne on the Terrace with some delicious snacks. Suite was so spacious,  the comfy mattresses are just gorgeous. We liked the touch receiving a  handwritten letter by the Russian Hotel Manager Andrei. ",5,2018,07,20
122,Friendly and comfortable hotel,"I have stayed at the Chelsea Harbour hotel several times over the last twelve years. I find it very convenient in terms of location, friendly management and staff and clean amenities. The room is spacious and nicely organized. I enjoy staying at the Chelsea Harbour and highly recommend it, especially to my friends.",5,2018,07,18
122,Lovely hotel and staff,Lovely hotel and staff... my stay was exquisite... all the staff was friendly and nice and made the stay great. David and Mihai were the best as they went above and beyond for me... and every time I visited the bar in the morning David was waiting for me with my favourite coffee before I even ask for it. 5* and more for the service !!!,5,2018,07,17
122,Nice hotel,"We normally stay at the chelsea harbour hotel and never have concerns, We checked in part of a wedding,booked room for just the day wasn't ready at 9am? booked and paid for the room in advance to avoid complications. we tried cancelling but reception refused, we went to the managers desk who thankfully sorted things out,we didnt catch her name on saturday morning. Breakfast was good, not many staff around but all very helpful. bar staff great. we will be back thanks!",4,2018,07,15
122,Great Stay,"As good as promised, I had been recommended the hotel by a frequent stayer and it was as good as expected.  I was offered an upgrade and a free drink on arrival.  Had a great breakfast and will be very happy to go back.

Only drawback was a little noise from the rail line at the back of the hotel.",5,2018,07,13
122,Good assistance,"The hotel is really nice and good, the customer service helped me contact the spa, akos was the one that facilitated me to get information about the treatments and services, now that there is no switch-board. But overall the hotel is awesome.",5,2018,07,12
122,Wonderful stay and wonderful staff!,"I stayed in the kings penthouse suite on the 2nd June 2018 and it was amazing! 
The suite was incredible and one of the few two bedroom suites in London thats still a reasonable rate. The staff were all so friendly and couldn’t do enough to make our stay as pleasant as possible. 
Especially the doormen who made us smile each time we came in and out of the hotel. One gentlemen on the door even ran to meet our cab driver when he was at the wrong entrance to the hotel, we felt so looked after the entire stay. 

Your staff really couldn’t do enough and are by the far the friendliest I’ve encountered. I will definitely be returning to the hotel as soon as possible. ",5,2018,07,10
122,Fading Grandeur,"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel on many occasions over the years . Millennium hotels became the new owners a few years ago and sadly have failed to invest in the property . Rooms are tired , maintenance is inadequate , bits and pieces are missing from rooms , air conditioning was totally inadequate on a first floor bedroom on a recent stay . Staff are friendly and helpful but we could certainly do with more of them in the bar and reception . The bar had 'run out' of snacks for drinks and no one seemed to have the ability or perhaps the authority to rectify this . Breakfast in the restaurant is just ok , a pity because it used to be great , now a poor selection of fruit and fruit juice reminds one of a lower grade of hotel . Rooms are however very spacious , many have great views and the hotel is located in a quiet and peaceful location .Poor staffing levels means reception and room service rarely answer the phone (its often quicker to go downstairs and speak directly to them) , room keys keep malfunctioning and need to be recoded .A hotel with great potential but in dire need of significant investment",3,2018,07,09
122,Holly's 30th Birthday,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel didn't disappoint our expectations one bit... Literally from the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming and friendly. From the birthday touches in the room to the car service provided keeping my secret of the secret dinner location, everyone just made Holly's 30th Birthday so special! 

The view from our room was spectacular especially at night all lit up - wow! And the room was beautiful! Great air con top in such hot weather!

Breakfast was divine! So much to choose from and eating on the terrace was a beautiful end to our stay.

Thank you again to all the Chelsea Harbour Hotel Team who literally made my best friends birthday 🎊",5,2018,07,09
122,Large suites good breakfast,"We stayed here for one night.  The hotel is very pleasant, good food with the restaurant overlooking the harbour.  The rooms fairly large for a hotel in room coffee machine which is always a bonus for us.  Only blip was our room was overlooking the entrance of the hotel but then we did book through secret escapes, so I should imagine best to book direct if you want a better room.  Breakfast is lovely everything you need.  The swimming pool is reliively small with a handful of sun beds so we thought we would spend an hour in the spa use the facilities but we had no where to sit as all the beds were taken.  You can catch the clipper down the Thames directly behind the hotel but check the times because we missed it.  We walked to The Kings Road to do a little shopping and caught the bus back.  Train station is right by hotel too.  Really nice area lots of interior design shops.  Would We go back Yes we probably would ...we enjoyed our stay.  Also you can park nearby (hotel will direct you) for around £30 for the night.",5,2018,07,08
122,Expected better,"I booked this hotel as it had good reviews, a spa and fitness centre. When I tried to book the room that was showing as available on the hotel website it wouldn’t let me. Upon calling the hotel I was told it was not available and that I could book a better room for £10 more with a balcony. They did not tell me that the balcony would over look a building site (by overlooking I mean I was watching the at eye level; felt like I could have had a conversation with them 😂). I was supposed to get a special package with a sports themed gift and nothing was received. 
The room is a spacious with a good seating area & bedroom but tired. Everything in it feels, and looks, like it needs updated. The lights buzz so you want to turn them off. The bathroom looks tired and like my granny’s. The layout could be a lot better and the toilet smells funny. 
The bed looked like it belonged in a budget hotel which is fine but when you pay for a luxury hotel you expect it to be welcoming & comfortable. 
The food came and I was served without cutlery. By the time the cutlery came my food would have been cold - just as well I started without it and used my fingers! 
The TV is a pain - won’t turn on and you have to get up and press the button (I know this used to be normal but not anymore). Once on it takes ages to do anything and sometimes does nothing. When you want to sit and relax in the room this is not conducive to doing so!
The breakfast was ok and the staff were really attentive and helpful. The tea was piping hot which was great! The poached eggs were not. 
A lot of these issues are minor but when you pay a certain amount you expect a certain level. Did I mention any of this at the time, no I could not be bothered. Will I stay again? Not sure, probably not I’ll see where else I can go that could be better!

122,Excellent in Everyway,"Love this hotel. Quiet, clean, refined, but not stuffy. Diverse clientele. Middle Eastern Asian, European. Incredible service. Fresh, airy, open (sliding doors that open!). Lovely restaurant with balcony with umbrella tables overlooking the boats. Great spa. Very, very happy here. An escape from the bustle of London, but very accessible. First class staff.",5,2018,06,30
122,Best Kept Secret in London - but bring back the Top Hat!,"I stay in this hotel at least twice a month when in London on business and have been staying there since it was the Conrad Hotel! The staff are great, the rooms are very spacious suites (top tip - have a room with a 20 at the end - corner room). It is quiet and only cab ride from everywhere you want to be in London. Personally I would not stay anywhere else in London.

One compliant... what has happened to head doorman Paul's top hat and long coat? Hotels should be an experience and Paul (and the other guys too) would always create such an impression when driving up to the hotel and you saw the top hats.

Bring back the top hats and long coats!!",5,2018,06,28
122,Great hotel!,Lovely spacious hotel right on the Thames. Staff excellent with plenty of advice on where to find things. Close to overground railway which easily links to underground. Great pub just 200 metres away. Highly recommended.,5,2018,06,28
122,Simply Amazing ,"I stayed at The Chelsea Harbour for the first time last night- it was only after booking I discovered it was part of the Millennium/Copthorne chain who can be fairly hit and miss. I'm glad I didn't know that otherwise I wouldnt have booked - the Chelsea Harbour is well and truly in a league of its own.
Location is great- across the road from Imperial Wharf Station, and a short walk from Chelsea Harbour Pier where Thames Clippers stop at peak hours. I used the boat and it has to be the best way, a chance to relax even before arriving at the hotel. There's shops nearby too. Only point to note is that if you book an Uber, as I did to leave, they have a tendency to go to the wrong place to pick you up- the concierge was telling me that this happens several times I day whilst I was waiting.
Check in was a bit slow- there was only one receptionist and was dealing with a complex query so bad timing on my part! She was very pleasant and apologetic for the wait though.
I had a suite on the 3rd floor with a marina view and it was well worth paying the little extra for a view/balcony- for me that's what made this hotel. The suite was great- well furnished, clean and spacious and a bed so comfortable it took 2 wake up calls to get me up (I'm not quite sure why I got two, but it's probably a good thing I did!). The ensuite was very spacious, water pressure was great, good quality toiletries etc
The food is very good. I ordered fish and chips from room service in the evening which were fabulous, and had breakfast in my suite which arrived bang on time and was, again, very nice. Being able to start the day eating breakfast on the balcony looking over the peaceful marina was fantastic.
Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my all too short stay at the Chelsea Harbour, and I would happily return. In fact, my favourite London hotel has always been The Tower (I'm there now...) and no matter how many 5* properties I've stayed at none of them have swayed me- until last night! ",5,2018,06,26
122,Incredible - Stayed as part of my weekend birthday celebrations and cannot wait to stay again,I had chosen to book a room at the Chelsea Harbour because I had complications with a booking at another hotel I usually stay at so it was a rather last minute decision but it was all part of my weekend birthday celebrations and they truly made my entire birthday. I arrived before check-in complaining about my day and I was greeted by Magda and Frankie and they instantly cheered me up by simply being two of the nicest people I have met.They allowed me to check in early and once in my room they had sent up a bottle of champagne and a birthday card hand written from them both and the entire team. When I was heading out to go and celebrate my birthday Frankie and then team were so helpful with finding me a cab and I honestly would have missed my own birthday if it wasn't for them. Upon check out every staff member was so helpful and remembered me from the day before and asked how my night was. I also had a treatment booked in the spa and again their staff were incredible. Everyone I encountered were so lovely and not in an overbearing annoying way but just a great team of human beings who also happen to be great at their jobs. I often stay in hotels across London but by far Chelsea Harbour has been my favourite and I don't think I would want to stay anywhere else again.,5,2018,06,24
122,weekend stay with daughter as part of a weekend theatre experience,"From the moment myself and daughter arrived at the hotel as part of a city and show weekend mini break we felt relaxed and looked after!

The staff, all so accommodating and helpful and the spa area was also very relaxing and felt like we had been away for longer as we felt so relaxed!

The high tea and the food was quality and service outstanding. It won't be long before we will be back!",5,2018,06,23
122,"WOW, nothing is too much trouble Chelsea Harbour Hotel team","I recently did a large group booking at the hotel as well as dinners.  The hotel's team was great from start to finish.  Nothing was too much trouble, the service and food for 160 was truly amazing and consistently amazing across each dish that was served.  We were all treated like royalty and I have no hesitation in saying - stay there, take your groups there and the catering for dinners also has the wow factor. Definitely going back there with my groups and events.  Chelsea Harbour Hotel & Team - thank you for everything you do.",5,2018,06,22

122,AMAZING.,"Everything was amazing, the staff, the food, the view the room. All of it honestly so glad I spent a little extra for this place it was 100% worth every single penny. Literally the best night we have had in a long time. Absolutely spotless, beautifully decorated rooms and such caring and lovely staff. Can't express enough how worth it this place was to spend a little extra for a perfect night.",5,2018,06,18
122,Largest LON rooms and fantastic hotel staff,"I recently stayed for 6 nights while attending a conference. By far the largest hotel rooms I'd ever stayed in whilst visiting London. The location is lovely, right by the Thames. The staff were probably the best I've ever experienced, with their courtesy and attention to detail. The rooms were kept impeccable and I felt very welcome. Hotel dining was also excellent. This will be my pick of hotel for my next stay in London.",5,2018,06,16
122,Event Venue with the WOW Factor (and GREAT Service),"Just wanted to send a quick note to say a big THANK YOU to all of you, and the team at Chelsea Harbour, for looking after our group so well over the last 3 days.  The feedback received across the group has been excellent!
 
Food was great, rooms/meeting areas worked well and the service provided has been fantastic.  I’ve also received superb feedback on the standard of accommodation.
 
As an EA,  it is always a real pleasure to work with a venue/hotel who make my life easier – even with all my last minute requests/changes -  I can honestly say, without all of you all, this would not have been possible!   .
 
I would also like to give a special mention to all the daily Ops teams – absolute STARs – all made sure our every need was catered for.

Thank you again.",5,2018,06,15
122,Another execellent experience," Another lovely stay.   Lovely setting, excellent rooms, helpful staff, good value.   We are never disappointed with our experience at this hotel.   We will definitely return.  We always feel good after staying at this hotel that's the reason we will return.",5,2018,06,14
122,Perfect Stay,"This was possibly the best stay in a hotel and spa I've had! The hotel and surrounding areas are so peaceful you would forget you are still in London. I stayed with a group of friends on a one night spa break and have never felt so relaxed. The spa was brilliant with the hottest steam room/sauna I've ever experienced. The staff within the spa and the restaurant afterwards were amazing and so attentive when needed. The whole stay far exceeded my expectations and a lot is down to the hotels location and brilliant team working there. I would recommend this hotel/spa to anyone who wants to escape the city noise and totally relax with good food, drink, views and the best service possible! I will be sure to visit again in the future.",5,2018,06,13
122,Slightly Off Beaten Track but Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed for a long weekend in May and enjoyed immensely. Great spacious room (if a tiny bit dated) with a nice balcony and a good bathroom.

Lovely location on the small marina and a very manageable walk to Kings Road, restaurants, bars and shopping.

Some nice antique shops etc on Lots Road.

Great staff at reception and very helpful concierge staff.  

Breakfast was very good and served for us on the lovely sunny outside terrace overlooking the dock.  Waiters were extremely helpful and friendly.

Overall a very pleasant stay.",5,2018,06,12
122,A mass of contradictions - not good enough for this kind of ££,"This hotel is so utterly frustrating because for every good thing they do they spoil it by doing something stupid and careless.

The hotel is in a stunning location - a positive. The rooms are to an excellent standard - a positive. But they are just part of the overall formula that makes up your overall experience.

The little things that are really big things are not thought important. For instance - when we got there I asked an attendant where my room was - she hadn't an idea because it turned out they had some celebrities there and she was hired security. Not a good first impression.

We then got back late (just after midnight) from eating out so went to the bar. It was still open which of course it should have been as the best hotels don't close their bars until their customers leave. But in the case of this hotel they do. They shut up around 1pm which left us utterly frustrated. Given a G&T is £15 at least it saved our wallets.

We did however ask politely for another drink and were refused. As we were leaving a big group of the celebs came in quite loud. They went to the bar and lo and behold they got it re-opened and enjoyed numerous drinks. When you're paying a significant amount for your stay you don't like being made to feel like 2nd class citizens. The celebs then started a loud sing song without being told to keep the noise down.

We woke up looking forward to a decent breakfast before leaving - which was a big mistake on our part. The breakfast (£23) was the worst I've had in 10 years of stays and vacations and I include a backstreet B&B in Blackpool at £25 per night. Firstly the wait of 30 minutes was unacceptable as they supposedly cook to order. When the breakfasts came they were cold and undercooked. Mine had obviously been sitting around and forgotten about given the congealed fat that had solidified.

There are far better hotels around in London for half the price.",2,2018,06,09
122,Day at the Spa and Afternoon Tea,"The spa is lovely their relaxation rooms are just that, spaces where you can lie down relax drink lemon water and herbal tea. The treatments are professionally done and leave you feeling blissful the staff are polite and always on hand. There was only one criticism the temperature of the spa is hot but i suppose it has to be like that so you can walk around in your swim suit. But it can get a bit much at the poolside. The pool is absolutely fantastic and relaxing yes all the facilities were good. The afternoon tea was good too but i did have to ask for champagne but the staff member made up for it with chit chat!",4,2018,06,08
122,THE LOCATION,Arrival and check i was good and fast despite early Sunday morning.  Room given was excellent.  A big room and clean.  Amenities was great.  Bed was comfortable.  Meeting rooms was nice.  Breakfast spread was good.  Food during lunch for meetings is up to expectations.  Bed was very comfortable.  Walking distance to a Supermarket.  Staff was very cheerful and ready to help.,4,2018,06,06
122,Absolutely Lovely!,Came here for a spa break with some friends and was pleasantly surprised. Although located in London you almost forget that it is. With beautiful views we sat by the balcony in the sun sipping fresh orange juice. The bedrooms were very spacious and each of our rooms were suites with our own living room space. We had relaxing massages in the spa followed by an amazing weekend brunch! All in all its a lovely venue with attentive and friendly staff - no request was too big! Thank you to all at Chelsea Harbour!,5,2018,06,06
122,Perfect stay,"What a lovely place to visit. I came with friends and we enjoyed dinner and drinks at their amazing terrace overlooking the harbour. We totally forgot we were in the city for the evening! It was so beautiful and relaxing. Room was really spacious and very comfortable bed, had the best sleep in a very long time. Will most definitely come back again.",5,2018,06,06
122,Overnight stay.,"Stayed overnight in the Kensington Penthouse suite.  The room was clean, well furnished and very spacious.  We had very friendly and prompt service with all requests met.  Very happy and would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2018,06,05
122,Beautiful hotel with amazing customer service,"This is a real gem of a hotel, situated by the peaceful Chelsea Harbour. It has the best of both worlds; being a stone's throw away from the capital and all it has to offer, whilst being in a relaxing setting with huge bedrooms and friendly customer service. The spa treatments were fantastic, and our brunch was very tasty with good sized portions. It's worth mentioning the hotel suite was huge, one of the biggest city bedrooms I've ever stayed in - and one of the comfiest beds too! I will definitely return.",5,2018,06,05
122,Amazing amenities and lovely staff,"The hotel was a 20 minute walk from where I live, but I felt like I'd been transported out of London to the South of France. The staff were so welcoming and genuine, the food was delicious, the spa was incredible as was my massage and the beds were so comfortable, I didn't want to leave! It's such a great location as well with everything you could need at at reach. I was truly blown away. Thank you to the team for a wonderful stay! I felt so spoilt.",5,2018,06,05
122,They go above and beyond,"When arriving at the hotel I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the surrounding area was! It is a hidden gem and cannot find a fault at all. The spa staff are extremely attentive and cater to all your needs. In the hotel itself the bar and waiting staff are top notch who will go to any lengths to make sure you are catered for properly. With the rooms, they have more space than you will ever need and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept on in a long while. This is the perfect place to go if you wish to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.",5,2018,06,05
122,Amazing!!!!,"Fantastic!! I stayed with a group of friends on the 02/06 and we all had an amazing time! The Suite rooms are huge! Very spacious, modern interior and super comfy... The food was amazing and the portions are huge! We also had a Spa Massage which was one of the best treatments i have ever had, and the Spa facilities are great..

The Staff were all brilliant, Thank you Ola & Lloyd for a special weekend.

A hidden Gem in a fantastic location.

Thanks,
Dean",5,2018,06,05
122,"Great Stay, Great Brunch, Great Views, Great Staff!",Excellent Hotel with amazing views - exceptional service! I would highly recommend this hotel. Ola the spa manager is amazing! I had a pregnancy massage from Mimi she was so attentive and asked about pressure. Easy to get to from London I will definitely be going back!,5,2018,06,05
122,Very very good.......,"Visited early June 2018, had 2 suites with river views, excellent staff from the moment we arrived - especially Paul who greeted us and looked after the car and luggage.

looking forward to going back soon.",5,2018,06,04
122,Beautiful location and exceptional customer service,"I was extremely impressed with the exceptional customer service at this hotel. All of the staff were amazing particularly Lloyd and Ola. I had one of the best massages I've ever had by Angela, I've never felt so relaxed. The location of the hotel is stunning, situated on the water with lovely views across the Thames. The food was outstanding, particularly the weekend brunch. Cold meat and seafood platter enormous and delicious followed by roast beef, chicken and all the trimmings. The desserts amazing too. All the rooms are suites, so plenty of space with huge bathrooms and all the amenities you need. I can't recommend the hotel highly enough. Fantastic for a romantic getaway or girly get together.",5,2018,06,03
122,Excellent hotel and service!!!,"Thank you so much to all of the staff at Chelsea Harbour hotel for a wonderful stay! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone! Out of the hustle and bustle of London but still close enough to get around!
My spa treatment was incredible too!",5,2018,06,03
122,Perfect stay at the beautiful Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"I have had an absolutely amazing time at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. I can not believe how incredibly friendly the staff was and how beautiful the hotel is. My suite was amazing and the food was divine, the afternoon tea was very quirky delicious!! Big thankyou to Lorraine for my amazing massage, I have never felt so relaxed and thank you to everyone for the outstanding service and a special mention for Dominic! I felt so welcome and I cannot recommend this beautiful hotel enough!

122,My birthday ,"Chelsea harbour hotel was lovely, staff were brilliant polite and more than helpful, the Chelsea suite was lovely, spacious and luxurious with everything you need to hand.We had a lovely stay so we will definitely be going back, booking though secret escapes is probably you best bet,I highly recommend for a night away with your partner.",5,2018,06,03
122,excellent service,I live out of town in quiet Kent and wanted to come to the interiors and fabric centre for two days area near the hotel. I was very happy with my choice of hotel as each room is super luxury and the maids were very friendly and not grumpy. The hotel was very very busy when I was there  but I think they coped exceptionally well. I was travelling solo and felt relaxed and comfortable as if I was part of a family. The main bar was lovely and welcoming. My bed did not give me back pain next morning meaning the mattress was good quality. You just have to be relaxed at a luxury hotel like this where I imagine customers think they are very important and demanding. The staff do their very best at peak times. Much admiration.! I wouldn't be as patient!,5,2018,06,01
122,Ms,Absolutely fabulous!  I had a great time here.  I was taken care of so well.  The staff took the time up ensure I was feeling well and had what ever I needed.  The food was excellent.  I felt very pampered.,5,2018,05,31
122,Special occasion,Fantastic hotel. Very peaceful and relaxing and in a great location by the Thames. Very attentive staff. Lots of space for all the guests in the communal areas. Rooms very spacious and quiet so slept well. Wonderful views of the marina and the river from our balcony.,5,2018,05,28
122,Five star all the way,"Many hotels have great standards, great facilities, or great staff. The Chelsea Harbour Hotel has all three. Our stay for a couple of days for the Chelsea flower show lived up-to and exceeded our expectations. Every member of staff we encountered greeted us with a welcoming smile and courteous manor. It is attention to detail that makes a difference, this detail is evident even from the staff you do not see or encounter. It is the complete package of behind the scenes and customer facing professionalism that help make this a true five star experience for its guests. Thank you all, your efforts are appreciated.",5,2018,05,28
122,Not up to the expectations and price,"This hotel is very expensive, even for London and what you get is not up to the expectations. Rooms are indeed very large, too large but lack basic amenities: toiletries are at the minimum and there was not even a shower in the bathroom but a bath with not even curtains...
The breakfast spread is not large at all for such a high-rated hotel (you have the basics of a 3 stars hotel) and they don't give the carte if you don't ask for it. This is not acceptable.
The service is just fine.
Again, if it was not such an expensive hotel, I would understand.",2,2018,05,28
122,Great hotel but not a traditional 5star,"Fantastic location and the extra for the marina view is so worth it.
The rooms are huge and can’t be faulted.
Disappointed with no jacuzzi and the ladies steam room not working properly. Also the lifts down to spa weren’t working and no signs to tell you, woman’s attitude in spa was terrible
Although a lovely hotel the concierge doesn’t help you with bags. Ours wasn’t even in our room although we requested it. 
The bar staff don’t bring you your drinks, didn’t even put the beer out the bottle! No snacks either. So I don’t think the service is 5 star compared to traditional in London but your still paying the same prices. However as a hotel to stay in, it is lovely",4,2018,05,27
122,"Great hotel, if you don’t mind not getting the room you booked","Great hotel. Would have been a full 5 rating apart from the fact that although we had a double room booked, when we turned up at reception, at 3.30pm in the afternoon, we were told no double rooms were available and we would have to take a twin room. The room was very nice, and everything else great, but they shouldn’t mess up the booking process and leave you in a position where you can’t get what you booked.",3,2018,05,26
122,Trip to The Chelsea flower show with my sister,"Such a lovely hotel, staff couldn’t have been more helpful. Friendly, courteous and welcoming, really went out of their way to help.
Really clean and spacious room with really comfy pillows. Good choice for breakfast and afternoon tea was served beautifully.
Great location and so peaceful.
Will definitely be back- thank you to all the staff",5,2018,05,26
122,Where the staff are not bothered.....,"When you arrive by car it is completely unclear where to go and park.... so ended up in a multi-storey car park about 10-15 minutes walk away....

Arrived at 3.30 pm and room was not ready ....because apparently they were full the night before.... staff behind the desk totally disinterested.... only after making a fuss did we finally get a room ... which was unsuitable so had to complain again to some more totally disinterested staff...To be fair eventually ended up in a very nice room.

Another couple trying to check in at the same time as us had booked through Expedia were told that the hotel was full and they didn’t have a room... the couple were told to take it up with Expedia !

That night left a breakfast card on door... morning arrives without breakfast .... eventually checked the outside of the door and of course the card hadn’t been collected. Rang room service .... more disinterest ... and eventually when breakfast did get delivered the guy made some half hearted excuse about being busy . It might be a 5 star hotel but the staff look miserable and unhappy and quite frankly don’t really care...

",2,2018,05,25
122,Great location,"Fantastic hotel, restaurant very average. Staff attentive but the location is great and very very quiet. Amazing peace considering where you are.   Unfortunately the restaurant does not live up to the high standards set",5,2018,05,25
122,Great Experience for my son's 11th Birthday!,"6 kids in a hotel fazes many people! But not the Chelsea Chelsea Harbour Hotel!  I use 5 star deluxe hotels world wide and I am truly vey happy at the no-fakeness of the people at this hotel and sincerely, keep this up!",5,2018,05,22
122,Nice Hotel,"We stayed for one night to go to the theatre with friends , a nice hotel and although we had an initial problem with room allocation the hotel put it right and gave us a free upgrade to a suite with a lovely view over the small marina and the river Thames .

",4,2018,05,22
122,A treat for mothers day that mum will never forget thanks to The Chelsea Harbour Hotel team,"Shaluka, Assistant to the General Manager and Holly from the Sp truly went above and beyond the call of duty to make my mum feel truly special on Mothers Day. Holly was super attentive and really looked after us whilst we enjoyed the spa facilities. not to mention the wonderful back massages that we each had. This, followed by champagne afternoon tea, meant that this was a Mothers Day that my mum will never forget. Thank you team!",5,2018,05,18
122,Exceptional in every way,"This hotel met more than what we expected, every detail in the hotel is impressive, 

we had the Kings suite wich is a beautiful piece of london in your room,  the attention of there personel was great !",5,2018,05,16
122,a great hotel,"Very good location, great staff and lovely rooms. We have stayed there a lot over the years and have never been disappointed. Superb location and extremely easy to get anywhere by bus etc. Parking problematical this time as the car park was being 'updated'(?) but apart from that, extremely good.",5,2018,05,15
122,Business,"The suits are really huge and luxurious. 
The staff was extremely friendly and attentively and the food was excellent. 
The Hotel was perfect for a conference. I had a great time there.
But the room rates are really expensive.",4,2018,05,15
122,VIP STAY,"As part of our organised event at Wembley arena we booked at the Chelsea harbour hotel for our VIP guests to stay with you.
We were ever so please with the attention and shortness offered by the whole team. 
We felt relaxed and we knew that are guests had the best possible attention. Sabrina and Shaluka took care of all
Our needs and kept in contact with us letting us know how everything was going. It took more than a Month of conversations and comunication to arrange our vip guests at the hotel and all times Sabrina and Shaluka were kind patient and supportive. 
Our guests have also gotten back to us saying they were extremely satisfied with our choice of hotel and that the service was over excellent. Above all they mentioned Shaluka was attentive and all times and very professional to their needs and keeping them in contact also with our companies, arranging the pick ups drop of etc. 
We can fully recommend your stay with the hotel.",5,2018,05,13
122,Lovely hotel ,"Had drinks at this hotel with my boyfriend. Atmosphere,drinks and staff was amazing!! Particularly a well dressed young man called shakula who was very helpful.He was very attentive without being intrusive.",5,2018,05,13
122,Poor afternoon tea,"Do not visit - sandwiches were cold and had VERY minimal filling - we had to ask for more and send them back. Desserts were average at best plus there was no atmosphere at all. 
However, service was good and scones were tasty",2,2018,05,13
122,All round amazing!,"As a group of 17, We recently visited the beautiful restaurant for a prosecco brunch. The whole experience was flawless, the venue, the food, the prosecco was constantly topped up and we were encouraged to relax and enjoy our stay, not hustled out when our time had lapsed. Most memorable of all though, was the fantastic hosts Andreas and Peter who absolutely made the day just that little bit more special. Thanks so much for a fantastic day, will definitively recommend to friends and be back for sure! Xxx",5,2018,05,13
122,Impeccable service,Went here for dinner - service was absolutely faultless and the food was good. On a sunny day I imagine the views from the restaurant are spectacular! Very pleased with the whole experience and I would totally recommend.,5,2018,05,12
122,Perfect for match days,"The hotel is perfectly located for match days and is in a beautiful setting, we had a room over looking the marina, hotel staff done everything to make my son's first visit to London special and we can't wait to go back ",5,2018,05,12
122,Amazing venue and staff went above and beyond,"I went to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for the first time for my sisters hen do. We had the bottomless brunch which was very generous the staff were constantly making sure you had enough to drink or eat. The setting was stunning over looking the harbour and the restaurant itself was very nicely decorated. The general manager Andreas was so lovely and organised party games for my sister which we didn't expect with prizes. All of our servers iren, James and Peter were exceptionally good especially Peter who was very polite and made sure we wanted for nothing. The food especially the cakes at the end were to die for. Will definitely be returning again in the future.",5,2018,05,09
122,Great getaway and amazing staff,We had a lovely afternoon in the spa then a beautiful lunch in the restaurant. A great mini escape! The staff could not be more accommodating and friendly! Go and experience Chelsea harbour it’s a great get away.,5,2018,05,09
122,Bottomless brunch,"I visited Chelsea harbour hotel for a bottomless brunch with a large group of girls last weekend. Having been to over a dozen brunches in and around London this was by far the best yet. Our table was in front of large bi-folding doors which let the sunshine and fresh air in with stunning views of the harbour. The sun was shining and the processco free flowing, great quality processco too. We had a sharing type brunch with a mixture of cold starters (including smoked salmon, king prawns, cured meats, potatoe salad, fresh bread rolls and prawn cocktail), the main course was a mixed roast with all the trimmings served in an enormous Yorkshire pudding! Having never been a fan of sharers, (due to my own greed) this is an exception, with huge platters between 3 we were all stuffed to the brim with plenty to spare. The selection of desserts/cakes were the cherry on top although a chocolate addition would be appreciated! I will for sure be returning. Peter Andreas & team catered for our group of 25+ ladies with ease. We found Peter and Andreas to be both professional and a great laugh in equal measure, bravo, fantastic experience all round.",5,2018,05,09
122,Exceptional!,"Having visited the Chelsea Harbour Hotel a handful of times before I was delighted to be welcomed for a bottomless prosecco brunch for my Hen Party!

From the moment of arrival the staff could do not do enough for us. The food was plentiful, our glasses were never empty and the service was impeccable. 

A special thank you to the general Manager Andreas - what a friendly and warm welcome he ensured we had. He also did a little research and did a small quiz which added a little extra enjoyment to the afternoon. Peter the restaurant manager was on hand as he has been previously, to ensure that everything was perfect for us. Nothing was a problem for Peter and he really does go that extra mile! Lastly I would like to thank James and Iren as their personable approach and can do attitude really sets their service apart from other places I have been, also thank you to Jago and Paul too!

I am already looking forward to coming back to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel once again - the decor, service and food really sets them apart from other 5* London hotels.

Huge thank you!",5,2018,05,08
122,What a lovely weekend,"I booked a Marina view suite, 518 what a lovely suite and Fab views of the Marina and the river Thames. Suite was clean, spacious and in a good condition. Upon arrival we encountered a problem with our reservation but this has been quickly resolved thanks to Yago. Staff is very courtous, attentive and really pleasant. Facilities are in a good condition, enjoyed the swimming pool although the Suna and the steam room was a bit of a let down as they are split to male and female with different accesses. Simply if you are a couple then you can't enjoy it together. Apart from this we had Fab weekend.

Breakfast was good with reasonable choices on offer. Will be definitely going back, Chelsea is a nice part of London which I haven't explored in details before. However, I can say that we really had a great time with plenty of bars and restaurants only few minutes away by Taxi.",5,2018,05,07
122,Wonderful afternoon for my nieces Hen Party,"I can't praise this hotel and their staff highly enough for turning a lovely day into a wonderful memory.  the General Manager Andreas couldn't have made the day more special, he was an absolute star.

Thanks again for a great day.",5,2018,05,06

122,Excellent stay at this hidden gem!,"CHELSEA HARBOUR HOTEL - HIDDEN GEM IN LONDON
The hotel is overlooking the Marina in Chelsea. Kings Road with many different individual brands amd luxury brands at Sloane Square are just a few minutes away. It is an All Suite hotel, which is fantastic. Enough space if you stay a little bit longer and a guest toilette, if you invite friends for a drink to your suite. Most of them have balconies and on a sunny day you feel like staying at a resort. Hotel offers also a Spa with sauna and steam room and a hughe indoor pool. Wonderful after a day of sightseeing. The restsurant offers an international menu. Plenty of choices, excellent taste and for a 5 star hotel in Chelsea excellent value for money. We were lucky with the weather and could sit on the terrace overlooking the Marina. Just like vacation. Very friendly and genuine service, which made you feel comfortable. Highly revommendable hotel if you want to have an enjoyable and relaxing time in London.",5,2018,05,05
122,A wonderful stay,"We found this a great location and had a wonderful stay in an efficiently run friendly hotel with great service. A nice Spa with excellent treatments. It was good to stay in a central London location and be treated so well.
",5,2018,05,04
122,Pleasant stay,"We stayed in your hotel on Saturday 28th April. After a week of visiting 3 other European countries this is exactly what we needed - a beautiful hotel! Thank you Chelsea Harbour for making my weekend very special.  I was very surprised with the amount of attention me and my friends got from the management of the hotel. You really know how to make your guests feel special! Yogo, Lloyd and Andras definitely deserve a price! We hope to see you soon!",5,2018,05,01

Massive Thank You to both Andres and Mr Cole for taking their time to write a very kind welcome cards. It made us feel very special! Maria on the reception was very friendly and professional! Definitely worth staying again!",5,2018,04,30
122,Fantastic!,"Myself & my wife stayed here for our 1st Wedding Anniversary. The room was so nice and spacious, and had a great view of the harbour. We went down for a swim in the lovely swimming pool area which was very relaxing, and came back to the room to find a slate with chocolate covered strawberries with a message and a card saying ‘Happy Anniversary’; it was such a lovely thoughtful touch. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a relaxing couples break in SW London.",5,2018,04,30
122,Great stay for a birthday weekend treat city break,"A really nice hotel, with great facilities and service. Left a nice birthday card and cake for me for my birthday on arrival. Rooms are big and very pleasant. 

One down point was the lift to the fitness room/pool was out of order all stay so we had to go a very long route round to get there.",4,2018,04,30
122,Great hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel and was completely wowed by it. Firstly it is an all suite hotel and they are huge. We had a large sitting room, separate bedroom and bathroom. It was clean and very comfortable with everything you need to hand although it is a little out the way it is well worth it and we will stay there again when next in London.

It was a warm sunny day so chose to have lunch in the verandah overlooking Chelsea harbour and what a fantastic way to spend an afternoon. We order the club sandwiches a bottle of wine and some beers which we all thoroughly enjoyed. The staff were attentive without being overbearing.

Breakfast was ok but nothing to special and disappointing compared to lunch the day before again the only saving grace was sitting on the verandah again with the lovely view of the harbour. Their buffet selection is quite small but if you chose a cooked breakfast there is quite a good selection on the menu. The service however was dreadful and very slow and not cooked the way we requested. We were asked if we wanted toast but after reminding the grumpy waiter 3 times the toast finally arrived around 15mins after we finished our cooked breakfast ! We did complain and the restaurant manager who sorted this out for us to our satisfaction.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel",5,2018,04,30
122,"Nice stay, yet a very nice staff","I spent three nights in this hotel as a part of a business trip. Facilities are very clean and there are not too many people at the swimming pool or sauna. 
But that’s not the point. Point is the staff at the hotel restaurant, these folks are absolutely great, full of understanding and they will make sure all your needs are granted. I’d like to five a good feedback to a restaurant attendant Eva, who is always smiling and is one of the nicest people I’ve personally met on my travels. Hopefully her manager will see this! Thanks Eva!",4,2018,04,29
122," Chelsea Harbour Hotel - best choice in London","We stayed again at the hotel for my partner's birthday. Its so fantastic, that the hotel offers suites only. We came to our suite overlooking the Marina and were welcomed with some delicious chocolates and a personal welcome card from the Hotel Manager, very nice touch. We had tickets for the West End and instead of an early dinner we had a late Afternoon Tea. It was perfect. They call it Travel Through Time and the presentstion is amazing. I left my phone upstairs, but this is something you have to experience, when you are in London. Food was also excellent, warm scones, super fresh finger sandwiches and very tasty desserts. Service was impeccable, special thanks to Domenik. It was too cold, to sit outside on the terracce, but we have another birthday to come in summer, which we would like to celebrate in Chelsea.",5,2018,04,28
122,Amazing relaxing weekend,"We had a lovely suite overlooking the marina for our relaxing weekend away, great for enjoying the sun. We ate in the bar & restaurant which was delicious. Huge portions for brunch and reasonably priced. The restaurant terrace was lovely too, eating in the sun & enjoying the view. We enjoyed the spa & pool as well as a wonderful full body massage. Overall we had a great experience, value for money & the staff are friendly & helpful. ",5,2018,04,26

122,Anniversary treat,"Stayed for one night and couldn't have asked for more.  Great location, peaceful but close to the buzz of the Kings Road.  The hotel became aware it was our 40th wedding anniversary and made us feel very special.... it's the small things that make such a difference",5,2018,04,14
122,Wonderful!,"I was fantastically impressed by our experience from start to finish. The staff could not have been more helpful in accommodating our needs, from preparing our room to be ready for an early arrival (I originally only asked if we could store our bags as our train arrived several hours before the check-in time) to adding an extra guest with only 12 hours' notice! The hotel itself is stunning, quietly luxurious and the facilities are fantastic, from the lovely bar overlooking the marina, to the restaurant which even caters for a vegan cooked breakfast, to the rooms and, of course, the wonderful spa. I travelled with my two teenage children for an impromptu mid-week break and they were thrilled with every aspect- praise indeed from stroppy teens! We seriously could not rate this hotel more highly, especially the exceptional staff.",5,2018,04,13

122,Delightful long term stay - I highly recommend The Chelsea Harbour Hotel.,"I stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for over 2 months & had the most wonderful time. The service was second to none - all staff are hand picked and go above and beyond. The suite was huge, the housekeeping looked after me & quickly learnt my preferences & ensured everything was to my liking each day. 

Ramy Yousif & Lloyd Cole (hotel managers) made me feel at home as soon as I arrived & went out of their way to ensure I had a stress free & fantastic stay. 

The spa is luxurious & peaceful - never busy or crowded. I used it every day & will miss it so much I plan to go back as much as possible - every weekend. 

I feel homesick having now returned 'home'! That is how wonderful the staff are. I had an excellent relaxing stay during an especially stressful few months. 

I cannot thank The Chelsea Harbour Hotel enough.",5,2018,04,12
122,Great experience at Chelsea Harbout Hotel !,"The hotel has only suites, most of them with a balcony and many overlooking the Marina. Walking distance to Kings Road and Overground Station – Imperial Wharf – is just around the corner of the hotel.
Friendly service by the Concierge and Reception. We had a nice dinner in the restaurant, which offers good value for money for a 5star hotel and food was nice.
Looking forward to our next visit in summer, when we can enjoy the balcony in the suite and the terrace in front of the restaurant.
Thanks to the team of The Chelsea Harbour Hotel.",5,2018,04,11
122,5 Star Experience!!! ,"I hosted a baby shower at the restaurant for afternoon high tea and we were all completely blow away with the effort and service from start to finish ! They had set up our own big table away for the main diners and also another 2 tables for the gifts. They staff were so welcoming and attentive and we all walked away blow away with the afternoon. I would recommend this for anyone looking to dine with 5 star experience for an affordable price. Again thank you so much for making is such a special day. We will all be back !

122,Awesome place for holidays,"For those who prefer decent service and quiet location — Chelsea Harbour is a perfect spot. Morning coffee with a view on a harbour, spacious rooms, variety of breakfast options (including non-dairy milk and vegetatian choises) is delightful!

122,Easter brunch (Sunday 01st April),"First of all, well done to Andreas Stys for having an incredible team working together to help make my Mother’s (Nanny Sweetpea) 80th birthday / Easter celebration unforgettable.  The first people I spoke to who helped put things into place before the day were Angelo Arti, Sherry and Vanessa... thank you.
On the day, despite Chelsea playing at home, everything for us was smooth sailing. Our waiters, Ivelin and Iren, ensured that all of our requirements were met.
We all said that the food was outstanding and the children enjoyed food from the Children’s menu. The prosecco was the best we have ever tasted and would highly recommend.
The suite we had over-looked the harbour, it was amazing and quiet, ideal for Nanny Sweetpea and the children to rest and have a nap.  The breakfast on Monday morning was delicious, with a lot of choice.  Before we came home I was hoping to push my mother around the harbour in her wheelchair but as it was raining this wasn’t possible.
We are all still talking about our experience at Chelsea Harbour Hotel.
Overall our experience was elegant and outstanding, and would highly recommend staying and/or eating here.
Thank you all so much for helping us make more amazing memories. ",5,2018,04,04
122,"Wonderful stay, everything was to perfection","We stayed here back in February for my partner's 30th Birthday - first of all I would like to thank and mention al the hotel staff - they cannot do enough for you, so attentive, polite and really make you special whilst you are there. The hotel has great management and a great team all working together, making it an unforgettable stay.

Our room was amazing, overlooking the Harbour and you can see the Shard in the back ground. Wonderful views and we had a lovely balcony to sit and admire all this. When we popped out, the hotel team popped into our room to leave balloons and a Happy Birthday cake which was a wonderful, personal touch. 

The spa facilities were lovely, a great big pool, big comfortable changing rooms, complimentary lockers and slippers/dressing gown etc. We had a massage which was amazing and you could really spend a day relaxing in the tranquil relaxation area, forgetting you were even in London. 

The afternoon was completely different, and served on dry-ice as, the presentation was immaculate and you get a lot of cake/sandwiches and delicious fresh home-made scones!

We cannot thank the Chelsea Harbour Hotel enough for their  wonderful hospitality, And we cannot wait to come back again one day.",5,2018,04,04
122,Ms Dicker ,"We went to the Chelsea harbour hotel for lunch on Sunday, we had the Sunday brunch, the presentation of the sharing boards were amazing and the food was delicious! The selection of food was super.
We had a table over looking the harbour, what a view!
The staff were extremely attentive and very helpful, the service was excellent, we will definitely be visiting there again",5,2018,04,03
122,Exceptional Stay,Review is long overdue.   I stayed here for two nights in August 2017 with my husband.  I was also attending a PA conference that was being held there.  I received a delegate rate for the room.  Although it was more pricey than what I would normally pay.  I am so glad we chose to stay here.  The hotel was fantastic and a touch of luxury.  I would definitely stay again.  We had afternoon tea the day we arrived.  They even sat us a little earlier as we arrived slightly earlier than planned.  It was delicious and the best afternoon tea I have had!   The conference was amazing.  Everyone made the stay so good.  I enjoyed dinner outside overlooking the harbour.   Can't wait to go back.,5,2018,04,03
122,Treat in Chelsea,"What a wonderful hotel and treat the Chelsea Harbour Hotel was. Check in staff mixed up a few reservations, but it was quickly fixed. The rooms and views were gorgeous! Diogio was a phenomenal concierge; he assisted myself and our group daily with wonderful recommendations on sites to see as well as easy directions to Richmond and Reading. He was a lifesaver and was glad he was there during our week long stay. He even handed out his business card and said if we got lost to call him directly- very reassuring. Sorin!! He was an amazing bartender- So nice and accommodating, even during the crazy hectic rush of people at times. He made a custom drink for me one night and remembered it for the next night as well. Can’t say enough nice things about those two as well as the rest of the staff. The Monday after our convention, the hotel had placed a nice fruit amenity in the room thanking us for our stay and hoped we were able to relax during the rest of the week with them. Breakfast was plentiful, but wished they switched up some of the hot food items throughout the week to give variety, but all in all, it was delicious.  Can’t wait to be back next year.",5,2018,03,25
122,"Great accommodation,but the food let it down.","My husband and I spent 1 night at the hotel.When I booked it on the phone I was asked it it was for a special occasion,in which I replied that it was our anniversary the young lady said she would make a note of that.Unfortunately nothing was mentioned about that when we arrived.The room was very good,bedroom plus lounge area.
We decided to have some lunch at the bar area ,after waiting almost 40 mins for the food to arrive it finally did.It was very disappointing not impressed at all.
There was no turndown service in the evening,to change towels etc.
The breakfast was very poor the following morning,the attitude of the staff in the restaurant was not the best.",3,2018,03,25
122,Comfort from the cold,"arrived on an exceptionally cold day taking solace in the very comfortable suite and order room service. Prompt service and good quality food. Enjoyable ambiance, cocktails in the bar well made with attentive service. Enjoyable breakfast with reasonable choice. ",5,2018,03,24
122,Afternoon Tea,"Spectacular Afternoon Tea with amazing service! 

Faultless service with an amazing ambiance!! Was lucky to be there for the launch of the new ‘Travel through Time’ afternoon tea menu and WOW! 

100% recommended",5,2018,03,19
122,Cosy,"A beautiful location directly in the neighbourhood of Chelsea Harbour. „Running track“ starts right in front of the hotel to  Battersea Park. Nice breakfast, did not try the gym. Price is affordable and rooms are spacious. Friendly reception desk.",4,2018,03,15
122,Chelsea Harbour - location and quality,"Great stay during a weekend London break. Fantastic setting by the river, by far the best quality hotel in the area which i have used many times. Andreas the General Manager responded to my family’s needs and dealing with things quickly and professionally. Rooms with harbour view are fantastic. Look forward to our next visit.",5,2018,03,14
122,Good and Fine,Stayed at the Chelsea Harbour for  business.  It's a decent hotel. Rooms are very spacious and reasonably updated.  Beds are comfortable.  Good desk and wifi for getting work done.  Nice little balcony and in many rooms a view of a small marina.  The location is somewhat difficult. Really if you need to get about London its necessary to jump a cab up to Earl's Court.  So you are a bit off the beaten path.  Breakfast is good but a bit pricey.  Would I stay here again?  Sure.  But due to the location it would not be my first choice.,4,2018,03,11
122,Weekend Brunch,"Having held our wedding reception here in 2016 and used the fantastic buffet menu as our choice of menu, I was pleased to see the return of Brunch.
You don’t choose from the menu offered, they just bring the whole lot on a board.
Starter was lobster, shrimps, charcuterie, etc and mains roast beef, roast chicken etc all beautifully done, then dessert.
The price is £44, but 2 people could share, bringing the cost to less than the local pub and a lot better. Plus one of the best views in London.
Join the Chelsea Harbour Club for free and you get 20% off food and drinks!
Hats off to Lloyd Cole, the new Director of Operations who was very diligent in ensuring excellent service and listening to our views.
For a light meal try the tempura prawns on the bar menu. Excellent!",5,2018,03,07
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel - brilliant hotel - well earned 5 stars!,"Had a fantastic stay here recently and the hotel was unbelievably good. I don't think there is anywhere in London that gives better service that the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. Gorgeous and spacious bedrooms, great facilities, wonderful food and magic service. Love it here! I will go back as soon as I get the chance! #seriouslyrecommended",5,2018,03,04
122,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Chelsea Harbour hotel twice recently . Great location . Suites are extremely comfortable . Service was excellent from all , including Abdu who was very helpful & courteous . Restaurant , waiters & menu also all very good . This is a great place to stay .",5,2018,03,03
122,Very nice rooms ,"I stayed at the hotel for a business meeting. The hotel is located right next to the harbour with views of the boats and yachts. The room I had was very nice with a large double bed, separate bathroom and study/lounge room on the side. The room had coffee making facilities and very nice chocolates were left in the room in the evening by room service. 
The breakfast was tasty although perhaps a little expensive. Overall the service in the hotel was good. I would happily stay there again ",4,2018,03,02
122,Meeting up with people from the state's ,"Myself and my Wife meet up with some friends of our son's from the states.
They had booked a table in the brasserie restaurant which is nicely laid out overlooking the harbour.
The service was very good and the food was average not quite what I was expecting I thought the food would have been a little more upmarket considering the location and the setting.",3,2018,03,01
122,Stayed for the football,"Excellent location and room suite - however, two points detracted from that. Firstly the bar service was very slow, with several reminders needed to get our drinks, we were told that was because it was very busy, but it didn't appear to be so. Secondly, we were charged £4.50 for buscuits in the room - surely these should be complimentary",4,2018,03,01
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel SW10 0XG ,A fantastic choice with a team of devoted and understanding staff.  My banqueting event in honor of my mother's surprise birthday anniversary banquet was truly memorable! I would choose Chelsea Harbour Hotel again if I have to host another banquet. ,5,2018,02,28
122,Nice hotel in a booming part of London,"The Chelsea Harbor hotel is neatly located in the middle of the Chelsea harbor of the Thames. The Chelsea area is undergoing heavy construction and developers proudly state that Chelsea is soon to be the happening part of London. The hotel sports most facilities from Restaurant, Bar, Conference rooms, gym and Spa. The rooms were very roomy, well furnished and equipped. The staff was nice and helping and the only less positive experience during my stay was the evening meal in the Bar, where the polite and nice waiters offered an extremely slow service. The hotel is also a 15 min walk from the Underground station and a £20 taxi ride from the central parts of London. For going to Heathrow from this hotel, it turned out to be as quick and around the same price to take a taxi as making your way to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express. And going by taxi, you also save yourself the long walk from the Heathrow train statoin to the terminals. In summary, the Chelsea hotel was a pleasant experience and hotel worth a stay! ",4,2018,02,25
122,Dinner with live music ,"I was looking for something different for our Valentines dinner and I’m so glad I booked at the Chelsea Harbour. Both my partner and I were impressed with the ambiance,the quality of the food and the level of service. My partner didn’t know that there would live music,there was a singer performing Adele songs,her favorite singer. She was so happy. All in all we had an unforgettable evening.",5,2018,02,25
122,Super Hotel and so quiet,"The Chelsea harbour is a great choice of hotel if like me you are a light sleeper there can't be a quieter location in all of London .No traffic noise etc it was like being back in the country location wise at the end of the kings road was ok but as I am confined to a wheelchair we got taxis anyway but. Station was close and tube is only a short stroll
Staff were outstanding which you would expect with a five star hotel but they really made the stay amazing ( disabled room 101is good) the concierge Tasi ? Was great 
We will stay here again oh and before I forget Take a swimming costume the pools amazing",5,2018,02,24
122,Amazing!,"This is one of the nicest hotels I’ve ever stayed in. Spacious, clean and extremely comfortable - our room even had two toilets!  

Make sure you lock your door though - on the day we were leaving someone knocked once and then walked straight in to check the minibar! ",5,2018,02,24
122,Amazing Valentine's Dinner,"
My husband said he had a surprise for me, so he took me to the Chelsea Harbour hotel for a Valentine's dinner. The restaurant looked beautiful with purple colours and low lighting. Very nice atmosphere.
Our food was cooked to perfection, was very tasty and definitely of great value.
The service was impeccable, however the highlight of our evening was the singer, Nikki Rae, who was performing Adele songs, she actually looks and sounds like her.
Wow,it felt like we had Adele singing for us.
It was a memorable evening.",5,2018,02,24
122,"Amazing stay, all thanks to people providing service! ",Our stay at this beautiful place was special and it was absolutely wonderful thanks to the team that made it so perfect. From check in to restaurant and manager Angelo who made sure we have a special service and wonderful dinner! Thank you all and good work - we will be back ,5,2018,02,23
122,London Visit,"I was visiting friends who live near Chelsea. We always tend to dine at nice restaurants but this time we opted to visit the hotel just on the other side of the marina. We had dinner in one of the banqueting suites. Food, service and entertainment was second to none. I pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend a visit. ",5,2018,02,21
122,Perfect match,"This hotel has everything you wish for. I got a treat from my hubby who booked a Suite with evening meal and a Spa treatment.

The suite was spacious and very clean, our food was divine and my treatment was so relaxing, out of this world.

If you travel to London and you want to treat yourself, this place is a must.",5,2018,02,21
122,Fabulous Evening,"Such a hidden gem of a hotel in Chelsea Harbour over looking an array of beautiful yachts in London! We had a fantastic, fun filled evening at an event  'with Someone Like Adele' - Nikki Rae and The Jackie Brown Band I haven't danced so much in years! we enjoyed a Veuve Clicquot champagne canapé reception and a four-course amazing meal. Definitely a Five Star, Five Diamond venue and thank you to Andreas and Lloyd amazing hosts of this very memorable evening.... looking forward to the next one!",5,2018,02,20
122,An unexpected delight (Valentine’s Gala Dinner & Dance),"A last minute dinner booking at this superb hotel turn out be and unexpected night of delight. Arriving just after 8.30pm we were warmly greeted seated. The suite was tastefully laid out and with two complementary glasses of champagne we soon settled down to what was to be an exceptional evening of food (4 Course Meal), fun and entertainment.  Toping bill was Nikki Rae Someone like ADELLE followed by the Jackie Brown Band playing such hits as “I feel good”, “Everybody need somebody” and so so much more! The service was impeccable and the wine flowed and very soon we were all on our feet dancing!      
I would like to take this opportunity to say a special vote thanks to Andreas Stys who was the perfect host for the evening. Please let us know if you hold any further events, we will attend!!  
",5,2018,02,19
122,Best hotel,The best service and knowledge staff spotlessly clean cannot wait to return plus good transport links into central London nice place to stay if you are visiting Stamford bridge I stayed with my 9 year old granddaughter and did a tour of the stadium which we both enjoyed and cannot wait to return. Plenty of restaurants which cater for anyone but not necessary to go out as the food is very good at the hotel,5,2018,02,19
122,Celebrated Valentine with my wife at the Hotel,"We booked our Dinner at the Hotel for a Dinner and Music on the 14th Feb. 2018, And i would say, the best food i ever had, The Duck for the main was Beautiful, We thoroughly enjoyed our meals with great music and champagne,",5,2018,02,19
122,Romantic Valentine's Day,"We were staying for one night in a Suite with a balcony and harbour view. We celebrated also our Anniversary and enjoyed Champagne with truffles. Just for one minute on the balcony, was too cold outside, must be wonderful in summer. We had a handwritten letter from the Manager, which was very thoughtful. Dinner was served in the restaurant, which overlooked the harbour. They served four delicious courses. We enjoyed the friendly and attentive service. We were served by the Manager Pete, what a pleasure. They had a female singer with an amazing voice. Time was flying and so enjoyable. Highly recommendable hotel.",5,2018,02,19
122,Valentines Meal,"Came here for a Valentine's meal with my fiancé and would easily recommend this venue for a meal in a heartbeat. 

The food was sensational and very well presented, the waiting staff were attentive and ensured that our evening was the very best it could be. 

If anyone is looking for a fantastic place to take their better half on a date then I would highly recommend getting a reservation here.",5,2018,02,19
122,A five star experience,"The large reception area is a bit soulless, but the elegant well-equipped spacious suites set the tone for this excellent five star hotel. The restaurant and bar overlook Chelsea Harbour, and the menu offers an interesting mix of simple meals or more sophisticated dishes. The extensive wine list has numerous options for the discerning palate.

The service throughout the hotel and spa is truly delightful. Customer focused, swift, resourceful. Truly a differentiator.",5,2018,02,17
122,A superb hotel,"I regularly visit London and wouldn't stay anywhere else now. Having stayed at various 5 star hotels in the past I stayed here after a recommendation. I've stayed here twice and both times the quality of service and friendliness of staff have been of the highest level. This hotel is spacious with great facilities, spa and swimming pool, large bar and restaurant with terrace overlooking the marina, reasonably priced parking and best of all, every room is a suite, giving you that space and comfort of 2 rooms rather than feeling cramped like you do in many hotels. It's a little further out than I used to stay but my favourite restaurants and bars are still close by and its a short taxi journey to Kensington, Mayfair and the shops beyond, so still by far a much better option. I look forward to my next stay when I intend to stay in and enjoy the Sunday Brunch with live music. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave I haven't yet found a fault and have just relaxed knowing my stay will be pleasant. I hope it manages to maintain this level of quality.",5,2018,02,17
122,10 out of 10,"We had lately brunch with friends and found out that they offered a menu with live music on Valentine's Day. Food was as good as last time, friendly waiters and the entertainment was great too. We will come back soon.",5,2018,02,16
122,Great stay,"Fantastic suite and wonderful staff, perfectly located to visit London with a family. The hotel team couldn’t have been more helpful. Breakfast overlooking the marina was perfect, selection from the buffet or a la cart was wonderful. Will no hesitation in coming back soon. ",5,2018,02,16
122,Great Music,A fantastic Valentines Day ! We arrived to a very friendly welcome and shown to our lovely suite. We then had a beautiful 5 course meal and were entertained by a brilliant trio performing the sound track of love. ,5,2018,02,15
122,Evening meal in the restaurant,Very impressed with excellent service and fabulous food.A relaxing atmosphere to just have a drink in the bar and look across the marina. The spa facilities with a very nice pool are spot on. Special mention for Paul in the restaurant and Sorin in the bar. Well done Chelsea Harbour Hotel!,5,2018,02,15
122,Great afternoon tea ,"We only went there for an afternoon but we were delighted by the welcome and the care of the waiters. Many thanks in particular to Paul and Alan who made my wife feel like at home. 
Definitely would recommend it.

",5,2018,02,13
122,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"This was our second visit to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.

I recently took my family (5 adults and 3 children), for an afternoon tea to celebrate my parent's 52nd Wedding Anniversary. What a delightful afternoon!!

We were treated to a variety of different tea options, tasty sandwiches, delectable scones and beautiful patisseries. We enjoyed very good service by the friendly staff. They had prepared a special chocolate cake for my parent's wedding anniversary at no extra charge!

Our kids loved the afternoon tea too. It was the first time we had taken them to something like this. The staff rounded off the kid's trip to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel with a warm cup of luxurious white hot chocolate. Smiles all around!

Peter Krajca, the Hotel Assistant Manager, deserves special mention. When we left, my wife forgot her glasses on the table. (We thought she might have forgotten them on the train.)  Peter emailed us to ask if they could post the glasses to us. Another testimony to the wonderful, special service we received. 

If you're looking for an inexpensive, yet tasty and very well-rounded English Afternoon Tea in a lovely setting, I can highly recommend the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.",5,2018,02,13
122,Made our Wedding,"We chose Chelsea Harbour Hotel due to its proximity to our wedding venue.  The hotel and in particular the manager, Lloyd, could not have been more fantastic; in fact it was like having second best man for the wedding.  From arranging transportation, resolving last minute problems with the wedding (unrelated to the hotel!!), procuring the most fantastic flowers and adding surprising touches to our suite we could not recommend them more.  The Hotel is in a fantastic location and all of the staff were friendly and could not do enough for us. Our room on the penthouse floor was perfect and it was a shame we could not stay longer to enjoy it.

Thank you Chelsea Harbour, particularly Lloyd, we will be back!",5,2018,02,12
122,Perfect stay,"Chelsea Harbour has a good location near to the River Thames at Imperial Wharf on the Overground Line and is convenient for the 606 Jazz Club in Lots Road. The rooms are big with a comfortable bed and the restaurant and bar offer a good selection of food and drinks. The staff is outstanding, big thank you to the young lady with short hair at the reception.",5,2018,02,12
122,Great Hotel with friendly Team,"went there on saturday for a drink at the bar before going for dinner with my wife, I've just moved to Chelsea and it was my first time coming to Chelsea harbour . To my surprise there was live music at the bar and they have such a beautiful terrace .
Diogo booked us a car to take us to our restaurant and he was just so friendly , we will definitely take him up on his word and will come stay at the hotel at some point  in the future ! Was a perfect start to our evening!",5,2018,02,12
122,Great Chelsea Harbour hotel!,"I had never heard of this hotel and stayed there only because the business conference I was attending would be held there.  I'm delighted I did!  The conference facilities were ideal and very well organized (the food delicious, by the way) and my room - suite - made me feel very welcome, with a lovely view from the balcony of the marina below.  The bed was marvelously comfortable with terrific pillows, and on the last day I was there I was able to indulge in a swim in the hotel pool - very attractive, large, great lighting - and the sauna was an unexpected treat.  I had signed up for the Millennium loyalty program and got a 3 nights for 2 price that made it all the greater value. Finally, the staff made me feel very welcome and they were helpful every step of the way, from registration, to the moment it was time to head to Heathrow.  I highly recommend this venue to business and tourist travelers alike.",5,2018,02,11
122,Must go,Me and my partner went on Friday to have a drink at the bar and Diogo was extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you so much for the amazing service and lovely live music. Would definitely recommend :),5,2018,02,11
122,Amazing,"Beautiful, such a great view and room, room service was quick, staff were so friendly and it was definitely worth the money! I loved my time at the hotel, I’m so glad I booked this amazing place for my six year anniversary ",5,2018,02,08
122,Lovely hotel,The hotel and staff were lovely. The only negative was that the room was extremely cold with no option to heat the room which did affect our stay as we were unable to sit in the lounge part of the room,4,2018,02,06
122,Amazing Wedding Anniversary,"My husband surprised me with a weekend in Chelsea. It was our 10th Wedding Anniversary and we were welcomed by the Manager of the hotel. We were staying in a suite overlooking the Marina and I found out that the hotel had only suites. Very spacious, extremely clean and elegant interior. He booked a treatment in the Spa which was wonderful. We went to the sauna and relaxed at the pool afterwards. When we came back to our suite we had a nice letter from the Hotel Manager and a selection of chocolates. We ordered a bottle of Champagne and with some snacks and had a gorgeous afternoon in our Suite. In the evening we went to a very elegant restaurant at Sloane Square - Five Fields. It was amazing. We came back and enjoyed a last drink in the bar, where they had live music. Next morning we ordered breakfast via Room Service and enjoyed the view overlooking the Marina. My new favourite hotel in London and I am looking already forward to our trip to London in summer. Chelsea Harbour again - for sure! Thanks to the team and the management for a perfect Anniversary weekend. ",5,2018,02,05
122,Amazing stay,"Lovely hotel in London, so much different than the ones we usually
Stay , out of the way but lovely, all rooms are suites, we had one on the 7 th with lovely Marina view, loved the balcony as well, the room is huge with separate guest toilet , big bathroom with shower and bath, lovely
Homely feeling, staff nice from reception to room service, although we informed them it was our anniversary they didn’t do anything for us.... which was little bit disappointing.... well, we had amazing stay , will definitively be back ",5,2018,02,05
122,"Great hotel, great staff, mediocre food, horrible spa","The hotel is beautiful, the staff is amazing (definitely the strong point of the stay!). We had a very pleasant stay, a concierge who helped us book a restaurant and tickets for a musical and a nice and comfortable room (the bathroom could use a small upgrade though).
The roomservice food and the breakfast was so-so, not bad, but not memorable, and quite overpriced. The contents of the minibar were definitely overpriced (140GBP for HALF a bottle of champagne!).
The spa was terrible... The pool was icecold, the sauna/hammam were tiny and seperated men/women. Not a good feature of the hotel. 

Overall the feeling was very pleasant after the stay, the staff made up for the spa and food issues.",4,2018,02,04
122,Excellent,perfect it was perfect  .The hotel staff are simply great and hearty and welcoming. It is a pleasure to have a warm and personal relationship.The rooms are large and very spacious. Very comfortable. The level of cleanliness is amazing. The beds are very comfortable,5,2018,02,04
122,Let down by breakfast servive.,"This is the second stay where the hotel's booking website had a glitch with the payment. Each time we had a message asking us phone in and pay. When we provided payment details with the original card it was ok. Receptionist at check-in very difficult to understand. No problems with parking or luggage. Suite very nice with great view.
We informed the staff at breakfast that my wife is gluten free. We had to ask twice for g/f toast. The poached eggs came on non g/f toast. The original order for tea and coffee came to nothing and we had to ask again. No g/f pastries available. Other 5 star hotels manage this as does the 4 star Hammersmith Novotel.",4,2018,01,31
122,Treated like a King!,"I stayed here a while ago on a company trip and it was a fantastic experience right from check in to check out. I should mention it was my first time to stay in a 5-star hotel so I had little idea what to expect. Upon entering I was instantly greeted with a smile and a very courteous gentleman showed me to my room with my bags, much to my surprise!

I nearly needed a map to find my way around my own room! Very spacious, and the view over the harbour was simply amazing. We had a few drinks in the bar downstairs and a beautiful nights sleep afterwards. Unfortunately, I awoke late and would not make it to breakfast on time. Instead, I treated myself to some delicious room service. The breakfast was very hot and plentiful. 

It's location is very near the train station and only a short hop away from Westfield shopping centre if that's what you are after!",5,2018,01,30
122,A wonderful hotel my family has been staying at for 25 years.,"Wonderful Hotel. My family has been using the hotel since it was first built 25 years ago. It has changed hands many times since then(Hilton, Wyndham, Millenium as it is now) but always remained a fantastic place. It has a modern, beautiful style and both the bar and Reatraunt and very good. The Bar is livley. On a friday and saturday there is usually either a saxophone, piano or other such type of musician.(I can't speak for other evenings). It is a livley bar with a good selection. The restaurant  is perhaps a little under used but very elegant with white table cloths and beautiful food(Lobster Burger is my pick!!!).

The rooms are all suites. Very spacious. Helpful especially if you are staying for a longer duration. Also if you have young children and would need two rooms elsewhere, why not put them in the sitting room and stay at such a lovley hotel for effectivley half the price. There is a cloakroom and ensuite in nearly all rooms.

Leisure facilites and equally as good. 

Truly though, the 'x factor' of the hotel is the harbour. It allows you to have a lovley view amd terrace to have a drink or eat on and get away from the dense city. The views from the view are wonderful. I would advice paying the little extra for a marine. view.

Staff are marvellous and service is excellent. Moreover, there is no shortage of staff and they are never frantically running around, which I appreciate. Special thanks to a Bulgarian chap in the Restraunt who I have forgotten the name of unfortunately. Had a very nice conversation with him about Morocco.

Finally thank you to the manager and director of operations.(Mr Stys and Mr Cole respectively). Both men were very pleasant, and helped make our stay super. The hotel is in good hands.

Thank you for your years of excellenc.  ",5,2018,01,29
122,Good views in Chelsea,"This hotel is well located in Chelsea and has good views of the river.  

The rooms in the hotel are good and seem recently renovated,  the staff is attentive and the meetings rooms had a lot of space a plus in London.",4,2018,01,27
122,Such a Tranquil Location to stay at in London,"We had always noticed this hotel when visiting the Design Centre at Chelsea Harbour. We had decided to have a 3 day break away from home in London. A tranquil location overlooking Chelsea Harbour with easy access to the Kings Road either by taxi or bus.
We had a suite overlooking the marina with a view of London towards the Shard.
Welcoming reception, helpful doorman and concierge. Appetising served breakfasts.
Good parking available in the Design Centre car park a short walk from the hotel.
A little aircraft noise if you sleep with an open window.",5,2018,01,24
122,Delicious afternoon tea,I went there last Saturday with some friends to have an afternoon tea. I loved it! All the food was delicious (cakes and sandwiches and a good selection of teas) and the staff was incredibly nice and professional.,5,2018,01,22
122,Excellent Hotel Outstanding Staff,"We visited the Chelsea Harbour Hotel at the weekend, had a throughly enjoyable and relaxing time. The staff were very helpful and could not do enough for us, totally professional as well.
We will definitely be going back again soon and recommend it as our preferred Hotel in London",5,2018,01,18
122,“Just Wonderful”,"We stayed for two nights at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel. This was our 3rd visit in the past few years. Really friendly staff, made to feel very welcome at check-in. Lovely harbour view suite, immaculately clean and well presented. Had a few drinks in Bar, plenty to choose from. Breakfast was very good, once again, lovely friendly staff, what a difference it makes to see lots of smiling faces. Unfortunately, because of a fairly hectic schedule we did not dine in the restaurant apart from breakfast. Imperial Wharfe overground is 5 minutes walk away. We really enjoyed our stay and we hope to visit again soon. Highly recommend.",5,2018,01,17
122,Chelsea Harbour,Great hotel for views and door/reception staff. Avoid breakfast very expensive in saying that nothing wrong with the quality just the staff are useless in there. Is a lovely hotel though and I will be back.,4,2018,01,16
122,A New Year's Eve To Remember 2018,"""Not the Bentley tonight, Sir"" as my husband and I got out the car. We are not such regular guests that it was a pleasant surprise to be remembered I thought, 
""Good evening"" I replied, ""We thought we would have a low key NYE""  I said smiling as we walked into the Hotel. 

Then the Head Concierge welcomed us, such a lovely man, always so helpful and trying to accommodate,  asking us if we were in the Hotel for dinner? 
""Oh no, just drinks tonight"" 
'Come with me...."" with a gesture towards the lift and continued ""The Penthouse Bar"" 
We've opened it to resident guests for drinks tonight, and you'll be able to see the fireworks on the balcony"" My husband and I we thrilled because nothing like this had been planned.  It was a really cool space to be in, great vibe, dimmed mood lighting, really chilled, guests mingling as if we'd all known each other before. And we had a great view of the  London Eye and the fireworks! 

 Thanks to Andreas the General Manager and all his staff on the night who simply made our night so special. It was lovely to have such a warm welcome from him and all his team. Highly recommend this Hotel, we eat in the bar at least once a month with our son, and it's always a relaxing special night out.",5,2018,01,15
122,Amazing Rooms,"Love the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. You can’t beat the rooms. They are large and high quality. Like a home away from home. The room service food was fantastic. The staff are friendly and attentive. The pool could be slightly warmer!

",5,2018,01,14
122,Excellent start to the New Year ,We had another memorable stay at the Chelsea Harbour hotel thanks to the hospitality of the staff who excelled in providing every comfort and great service. Special thanks to the staff at check in and new management who are doing a fantastic job in setting new standards of hotel management. ,5,2018,01,13
122,Most Incredible Stay - Twice!,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Marina Suite twice in December and we have received the best service. The staff are friendly and the rooms are impeccable! We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast - both scrumptious.

These are the most value for money hotel rooms we have booked in a while - clean, spacious and of course luxurious.

Vadim especially took care of us and ensured we got a room of our choice!

We will definitely visit again x",5,2018,01,11
122,great rooms,"We stayed for two nights over New year in two harbour view rooms, and thoroughly enjoyed the comfort and style of this hotel. Staff were professional and friendly, and as a regular guest of a sister hotel to this one it was fabulous to be recognised and the extra touches were very welcome indeed!
Thank you, we will be back!",5,2018,01,11
122,Fingernails in the Bathroom!,supposedly 5 star and its a lovely location on the marina but there were other peoples fingernails in the bathroom ;-( Once you couple that with old and creaky hard as rocks mattresses and dated decor it just doesn't add up for the price.,1,2018,01,11
122,Friendly staff,"I use this hotel a couple of times a year for business and social trips to London. Yes the hotel is slightly dated in it's decor and rightly so it doesn't have a 5 star rating. However given that every room is a suite with room to swing a cow (and I've paid twice the price to stay in a central London hotel room where I couldn't swing a cat), the price per night is incredibly reasonable. It is also one of the only central London hotels in this price point which has a swimming pool and spa / gym facilities as well as being perfectly situated for nice little runs along the embankment to work off some of the excess of London restaurants! But most of all I always get a very warm welcome from the doormen Abdu and Jose who greet me like an old friend, it immediately makes me feel at home and nothing is too much trouble for these lovely smiling guys. In short I always look forward to my time here and the little decor niggles are irrelevant unless you're going to be a Diva about it....",5,2018,01,08
122,Birthday treat,Overall as I expected for this hotel. Couple of issues but staff were more than helpful to get resolved. Unfortunate that works started on second morning which woke us up and breakfast was not delivered on time to the room but reception did all they could to make amends.,4,2018,01,07
122,Disappointed ,"We booked in for 2 nights at the end of a little uk trip before we flew on to Europe. We checked in late (8pm) on Friday night and the staff were all lovely at check in. Got to the room and views are lovely as is the room itself. I went to have a shower at midnight and there was no hot water. When I called down to reception they offered to swap rooms but as it was late I said it could wait till the morning. The lady who was manager was great and gave us a cheaper room rate for the night for our inconvenience and the water issue was resolved too. We checked out at 6am (Sunday 7th January), and the “manager” (French guy I think) was not good atall. All he was interested in was taking my card. He didn’t ask how the stay was, was just not bothered. Very dismissive. He took my card and never even asked for a signature or a PIN number. He then charged me for 2 full nights valet parking (which is £40 per night - also ridiculous considering what you’re paying for the room). When I questioned the 2 nights valet he just said no and that was it. Although there was a sign on the front door saying up to 10hours £25 and 24 hours £40. And as we checked in late I shouldn’t have paid for 2 full nights as the second night was under 10 hours. He then informed me that they had no valet at this time so I have to get the car myself. This doesn’t bother me (I’m not a spoilt princess haha) but don’t charge me for something and then not offer that service anyway. Having this all happen upon checkout left a bitter taste. If any of my staff acted in this way they would be sacked. Would not return nor would I recommend. For the money there are definitely better options. The saving grace for this place to not make it a 1star rating were the check in staff and the First Lady manager who I dealt with - all very professional.",3,2018,01,07
122,Sweet Suite Honeymoon,"My fiancée surprised me with a stay at this hotel. He loves Chelsea FC and this hotel is the closest luxury hotel to the Stadium. We started with a tour at Stamford Bridge and I got a shirt with our initials at the store next to the stadium. Made him more happy than me, but then we went to the hotel in a nice Bentley, a white one. We stopped near by the hotel and he invited me to a drink in his favorite pub opposite the hotel. So cute of him. Finally we made it to the hotel, lovely welcome by the staff. Our suite, the porter told us, that the hotel has only suites, was very spacious and my partner organized a personalized cushion with the embroidery of our initials and the date of the Chelsea match, when we met the first time at the stadium. I have never thought that Chelsea FC would change my life so much. ",5,2018,01,06
122,Christmas shopping on King' s Road,"We come every year for Xmas shopping to London. Central London is so packed and all the shops you need are on and near King's Road / Sloane's Square. It takes you just 5-10 minutes by taxi to the hotel. The Xmas decoration in the lobby was so wonderful. A large tree in the lobby and richly decorated trees everywhere. The hotel has only suites and it's very comfortable that you have enough space for your suitcases and to unpack all your bags. Hotel has a large indoor pool, seperate saunas and steam rooms for men and women. Treatments were pre booked, because Spa was busy at the weekend. Before we went out for dinner we had drinks in the bar where a saxophonist played live music, nice atmosphere. Staff very helpful and smiling. English breakfast served a la carte and tasted very good. Excellent selection of fresh breads with a nice selection of cheeses. Highly recommend a suite overlooking the Marina. ",5,2018,01,04
122,Amazing suites and delicious lunch,"We stayed after NYE and started with a delicious lunch in the restaurant. Staff was extremely friendly, especially the Swedish Restaurant Manager. We went to the Spa and enjoyed a very relaxing back massage. Nice to have a pool for swimming afterwards. Checked in and just then we realised, that we were staying in a Suite, the hotel is an All Suite hotel. Great to have so much space and a balcony. It was the birthday of my son and we received a personal letter from the Manager with a nice assortment of chocolates. 
Breakfast was delicious, nice buffet and egg dishes were freshly made. Close to Kings Road and a enjoyable 30 minutes walk to Sloane Square. Looking forward to our next stay in summer when we can sit on the terrace overlooking the Marina.",5,2018,01,04
122,First class hotel,"Excellent accommodation that is only a 10min walk away from Stamford Bridge with the added bonus of the team sharing the hotel with you night before game.

Room was spacious with and added sitting room.",5,2018,01,03
122,New Year's Eve,"A lovely overnight break, good value, lovely views from our suite. All the staff from concierge upwards were charming.. Wine list could have been better. Excellent breakfast. Parking - very good service. Did not feel rushed, totally relaxing.",5,2018,01,03
122,Disappointing Birthday Treat,"Stunning rooms, however service doesn’t match! The staff were unhelpful, a counter fell off the wall in one of our rooms and the staff were poor! 
Builder came and repaired and left an awful mess, sadly didn’t match the price we paid, very disappointing!",3,2018,01,02
122,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"This hotel is excellent value for money.  All the rooms are suites.  The location is lovely overlooking the harbour.  The staff are wonderful and cannot do enough for you.  The only problem with this hotel is that once ordered, drinks take far too long to be served in the bar.",5,2018,01,02
122,"Fab hotel, perfect for business or pleasure","Had a short but fab stay in the Chelsea harbour hotel in December. 

Really friendly and welcoming staff on reception

Really nice bedrooms, all of which are suites with a separate lounge and bedroom. I loved my stay here.

 Having held events here previously I would also recommend the various meeting space that they have. 

Be it pleasure or business, definitely worth checking out.",5,2018,01,01
122,New Years Eve ,"Just left an incredible new year stay. From the minute we got there the service was incredible. 
The cocktails at the bar were fantastic and the bar staff were full of festive cheer.
The room was better than we could have imagined with an amazing view for the fireworks at midnight.
A special mention to Jim on the front desk who ensured our stay was perfect. He's a real credit to the hotel.",5,2018,01,01
122,Lovely stay,"My daughter and I stayed at the hotel after a busy couple of days in Central London. I must say it's her favourite place to visit... Refreshing to stay somewhere where you can feel relaxed and yet is accommodating for children. 
The staff were very friendly and met any requirements we had. 
Highly recommenced.",5,2017,12,29
122,Christmas at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"We had a lovely Christmas Day. Lloyd and his team did an amazing job.Staff were amazing , great location, lovely river views.
Food is a very high standard . Plenty of variety and fabulous children's menu",5,2017,12,29
122,"Very nice room, but hotel location is a bit tucked away","I attended an event here... a bit difficult to reach via Tube (had to take a cab, and Chelsea football club was playing, so very congested), but the size of the room made up for that.... definately not what you usually see in London! Friendly service too, very little to complain about.",4,2017,12,27
122,Disappointing - not worth the high price,"My partner and I stayed at the hotel for a special Christmas treat on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We paid a lot of money for the suite and expected a five star stay. We left disappointed. 
Having walked past a built up building site near the tube with very little else nearby I arrived at the hotel somewhat surprised by the bland location. 
When I arrived I was welcomed politely and then offered an upgrade to a larger suite for £70. I accepted as this would also include breakfast. It was not explicitly stated that this was per night, so we were stung with a double cost at check out. When I mentioned this at check out, I was basically laughed at and he insisted he had said per night. I didn’t feel like I could say anything as the other receptionist was saying he had, even though he wasn’t there and proceeded to laugh at me. I was trying to be polite and gentle and not demanding but I wish I had now. 
We also raised some other issues that were dismissed and I felt foolish for raising them. The receptionist, when I talked about a room service overcharge, said “I’m not going to argue about £9.” This flippant comment made me feel like I was being argumentative but I was just questioning the incorrect room service bill. I left the hotel embarrassed and upset.
The room service food was nice but they forgot some parts of the order and I had to call and request them. 
The breakfast was average and started with the embarrassment of being told it wasn’t included. This made us feel awkward as it was part of the upgrade I had booked. The supplement to have an al a carte option is a joke. The pancakes with syrup and bacon cost £7 more then the package breakfast and are the same as cheap packet pancakes that are usually free in buffets. The traditional cooked breakfast was dry and lacking flavour. There were some nice options on the continental buffet but not worth the price. 
The rooms were ok, a bit dated and business-like but spacious. However, There was only one shampoo etc for 2 guests in the bathroom. 
The TV online guide doesn’t work so we could not see what was on. I mentioned this at reception and he said it had been like this for a 2 months and agreed it was pointless to have a tv with no guide. After 2 months I’d expect it to be fixed and an apology might have been better than agreement. 
The bar is sterile and over priced. £19.40 for 2 drinks and unfriendly service.
Given that it was Christmas, I would’ve like something a bit more special. I have read other reviews of guests getting a personal note from the managers over the festive period. We didn’t get this. I wonder what else we didn’t get.
Having checked my bank account the amount charged is not the same as my invoice despite checking this with the reception at check out. I will now have to ring and check this bit fear I will be mocked again for questioning a ‘small’ amount. 
I left regretting having spent our money at this hotel. We made the most of it but could have had a better time for less money else where. 
I won’t be recommending this to my international colleagues and students who often stay in places like this.",2,2017,12,27
122,Amazing one night in Chelsea,"Me and my partner stayed for one night over the Christmas period and I have to say it was outstanding!

The Suites where super clean and the service was first class! 

We ate in the bar one evening where we were greeted by a host of people keen to service our every need. 

We where particularly impressed with Angelo who was watching over the eating areas to ensure all was running like clockwork and always on hand to answer any questions. 

We also met 2 managers Anand and Llyods who where keen to know how our stay as and if there was anything more they could do for us!

Thank you to all for a great stay we will be back...",5,2017,12,27
122,One night,Have stay one night first time in this hotel and I have to say that Everythang is amazing clean and friendly staff from the reception to housekeeping Kinga from the reception she help me to check in fast and very professional... housekeeping Elisabeth “from Hungary “ she has amazing personality very friendly and make you’re day better I been very tired and upset of late fly Elisabeth with 5 min conversation make a smile on my face Every hotel should have an Elisabeth!

122,"Suites only - So, so Sweet","My partner surprised me with a stay over Christmas. We had a Suite overlooking the harbour which was great. Got a personalized message from the Hotel Manager Adarsh, so sweet. Can't wait to come back in summer. Our bedroom was  so clean and crisp, that what makes luxury hotels so wonderful. By the way  breakfast was fantastic, especially the fresh honey ",5,2017,12,25
122,Thank u Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Yet another amazing stay at the Chelsea Harbour hotel! 
We went for my partners birthday and I asked for some flowers in the room and I was amazed at how nice they were! The reception staff also wished her a Happy Birthday on arrival!
Again all staff from the front of house to the house keeping were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble even for me Miss Fussy eater! 
Thank you Chelsea Harbour Hotel again, didn’t disappoint!!",5,2017,12,23
122,London's Hidden Gem,"I highly recommend The Chelsea Harbour Hotel. You won't find a more balanced, high-quality, first-class services hotel for the value. Being able to run The Thames in the morning, to having numerous pubs, and restaurants in walking distance, to an outstanding breakfast option, to the harbourside bar, the place is just great. My highest compliment is for the ever friendly, highly reliable and amazing staff. From top to bottom, they did everything possible to assist my 40-day stay on my business trip. I have been here 6+ times in the last 3 years. This is the only hotel I'd ever recommend.",5,2017,12,22
122,Couples night out,"The staff were  friendly and had a positive attitude. Room was spacious and bed very comfortable. 
Breakfast was excellent. They surprised my husband by providing him with a beautiful cake for his birthday and decorated the room accordingly. We were attending an event at the hotel so didn't visit any sites in or around the area",4,2017,12,21
122,Lovely memorable stay as usual...we keep coming back year after year !!,"Brilliant hotel..nothing is too much trouble..""Lara"" the guest relations manager is very attentive and any issues are sorted super quick, this really is a lovely hotel in a great location, rooms are very spacious with lovely big marble bathrooms with both bath and shower with double sinks,",5,2017,12,20
122,Lovely,"We had 2 suites, the staff, food and location were perfect for us.

The staff could not do enough and were very friendly, we will definitely be back to stay. 

The food both dinner and breakfast again excellent with wonderful service.",5,2017,12,18
122,Wonderful say for our family in the Chelsea  Harbour Hotel,"Booing was easy, and the hotel offered us a great deal on 3 rooms for my daughter 21st birthday overnight stay.  In all areas the staff were helpful, friendly and welcoming, which I don't always find in London.  The rooms/suites are spacious, and beautifully appointed, with plenty of hanging space , 2 toilets, and very comfy beds ad pillows.  A bonus is no traffic noise too !  The Bar staff were excellent and anticipated our needs, even providing a small cake for my daughter when they found out it was her birthday.  Overall a really great experience  and we will return.  Thank you .",5,2017,12,18
122,Superb Service,"Our stay at this hotel was superb. The staff are excellent; nothing is too much trouble for them and they are all so attentive - we were made to feel special. The suite we stayed in was more than adequate with a terrific shower and very warm duvets. We had two meals in the brasserie, both of which were delicious, looking out over the marine. The location is excellent, only a few minutes walk to the station. Looking forward to going to stay there again and having time to try out the pool!",5,2017,12,17
122,It’s a great hotel,"All good apart from breakfast where Service still needs improving.

As I’ve said in previous reviews I like this hotel, located in a quiet area it has space everywhere and the rooms are like none other in London. The bar staff were professional and friendly, I think one was Italian and the other from Spain. I had a bottle of red with a pizza while I dined alone as the wife was off out to theatre with friends. 

I’ve had the pizza before and it was good then, no change. The bar for early Friday evening was nicely busy but not full by any means, a musician playing his sax which was nice. 
The rooms gave a fully stocked bar, excellent large safes, a good bath, shower and lounge, I didn’t get a marina view but that is worth doing especially the ‘with balcony’ suites.

A sound sleep in a comfortable bed with blackout blinds. Anyway, off to breakfast, great seat by the window ordered full English and omlette (the latter for me). After quite an age breakfast arrived but what lukewarm as if it had been hanging around on the pass which was disappointing, my wife’s toast was nowhere to be seen. Eventually I got up and went and asked for some.

Breakfast seems to be a particular let down here, in fact it’s the service not the food and as the laid out spread is good. Perhaps the answer is not to go for the cooked option?",4,2017,12,17
122,Superb Saturday Stay,"I wasn’t sure what to make of The Chelsea Harbour Hotel when I booked. Just over £200 for the last decent Saturday out before Christmas in a suite only hotel for a 40m2 room which has an enormous bed, a dressing area, lounge and generous bathroom.

There has to be a catch?

Not really. Staff were very accommodating, room wonderful, bed comfy, breakfast great, all wrapped up in a super location.

Parking - if you’re not able to squeeze in one of the handful of spaces in front of the hotel, they direct you to a secure car park round the corner (under 2 mins walk) where you can nestle between Bentleys and Ferraris for £30 a night.

If I had to quibble, at 6’6” the shower head would only allow washing of everything from nose down without bending and £20.25 for a glass of house bubbly is a tad steep... but hey, look at where you are I suppose.

However, should you be fortunate to bump into Abdul on the door, you’ll find one of the most welcoming and charming doormen in London. Instantly cheery and full of sensible help, everyone is important to him whether you be a self-possessed Chelsea footballer with a flash car or an average joe on a night out with the Mrs. 

We had a superb stay at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, profiting from the standard late check-out to have a lazy breakfast and a lovely start to a Sunday.

Will return for sure! ",5,2017,12,17
122,Tries hard but lets itself down,"We stayed for one night over the weekend. The welcome from the doorman and reception staff was very good and it felt like they were offering a very good level of the service.  The rooms do let them down however, as they are rather tired and could do with a refurb. They were clean and the beds were comfortable though. 

The service in the bar was slow. We ordered two drinks and it took 15 mins to arrive. This was frustrating as having taken our order there were staff floating about but no one started making the drinks until 10 minutes later.  You then get stung with a 12.5% service charge for the privilege of waiting.  We tried to get some drinks at the end of the night at 12.30am but we were told the bar was closed.  This was disappointing for a Saturday night in London especially since there were several staff members floating about not doing anything else.  

Breakfast was OK although there was not a huge selection. ",3,2017,12,17
122,Sunday brunch,"An incredibly vast selection of savoury & sweet options. Fantastic crepe station - lots of topping choices! The room was filled with natural sunlight, a glimpse of the river & a singer doing covers in the background. ",5,2017,12,16
122,Afternoon Tea,I visited Chelsea Harbour Hotel to have the afternoon tea with my friends. We had a warm welcoming by a duty manager Daniel and a very pleasant service that was provided by the restaurant staff. It was a great choice of sandwiches and excellent home made scones. The whole experience was exceptional and beautifully decorated. Definitely will be back again. ,5,2017,12,16
122,Fantastic stay!,"This hotel exceeded all expectations, I have stayed in a lot of 5* London hotels and this one was amazing! The staff were super friendly and couldn’t do enough to help. The food in the Brasserie was really nice and the rooms were very spacious, comfortable and accommodating. 
Would highly recommend staying here every day!",5,2017,12,16
122,Amazing Hotel,I didn’t stay in the hotel i was there for a Xmas party. The venue was amazing the hotel stuff extremely helpful and the views to the harbour wowwww. The food was excellent as well. Expensive rooms. Highly recommended  ,5,2017,12,16
122,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel: Comfort, Luxury and Peace","My husband and I recently stayed at the luxurious Chelsea Harbour Hotel. Nestled between Chelsea and Fulham, the hotel is a haven of calm from the bright lights and fast pace of the West End.  From the grand entrance hall, with its opulent décor and stunning Christmas tree, to the chic bar and elegant restaurant, we fell in love with the place before even seeing our room. We stayed in the River View King Suite, which had breath taking views of the London skyline and overlooked the yachts moored in the Harbour. Apart from the suite’s generous proportions and the absolute comfort it provided, we were struck, most of all, by how peaceful it was. After a swim in the beautiful pool and a good night’s rest, we left energised and refreshed (and looking forward to our next stay!)",5,2017,12,14
122,Nice hotel with comfortable good value suites,Nice hotel with a nice view over Chelsea Harbour. The suite was spacious with large bathrooms. We had a marina suite which had a pleasant balcony too. The room was noisey at night as it was opposite the three lifts in the hall and we could hear other guests coming and going. The room service menu had very little for vegetarians which was disappointing for a hotel of this standard. ,4,2017,12,14
122,Sooo nice,Had a really nice stay at the Chelsea Harbour. It was my first time there and i was amazed by the xmas decorations! Door man was really helpful with my bags on arrival and the general service was fabulous! ,5,2017,12,13
122,Great restaurant,"We came for a friend's birthday and had the most amazing time here. The staff were so so kind - Ivelin and Peter were the best waiters. Such a beautiful hotel, I definitely recommend this place!! The food was great too. ",5,2017,12,09
122,Fabulous restaurant ,Had the best time at the Chelsea harbor restaurant. Peter and Ivelin provided the greatest service. Food was delicious. Can’t wait to go back. London was such a fun trip and Chelsea harbor hotel was a highlight. Lots of shopping near by. All together great night. ,5,2017,12,09
122,Birthday !!!!!!,We had such a fabulous time at the hotel and the restaurant. Such amazing food! Huge shoutout to Peter and Ivelin for the best service. Made my birthday the best!!! I got the chicken breast it was so yummy!,5,2017,12,09
122,Luxury without the pricetag of Central London,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and the recent stay once again didn't disappoint. It was time for the annual Christmas trip to London with the wife and 2 year old son. We have used the Chelsea Harbour hotel many times before so decided to use it again and although its not central London its very easy to get to places. The Hotel is situated next too Imperial Wharf station with regular trains running to Clapham junction and into London and next to the Chelsea Marina.
Paul (Concierge) is very polite when you arrive and makes sure you  can park at the front while unloading your car and helps with the baggage. 
We were then looked after at checking in by Vadim and we opted to upgrade the room. Every room in this hotel is a Suite meaning the rooms are very spacious, very well designed and you have all the facilities needed. Our room over looked the marina with a balcony. 
On the Saturday evening we relaxed in the Bar with some great cocktails, an amazing Pizza (recommended by Carina) and listened to the Saxaphone player. It was a very relaxing evening.
Sunday morning was spent in the Pool and relaxing in the sauna and steam room - followed by a good breakfast in the restaurant. 
The hotel is very clean, the staff are very polite and professional and the location is superb. I don't think there is a better hotel in London for the price tag of the Chelsea Harbour.",5,2017,12,08
122,Lloyd Cole has relaunched the famous Sunday Brunch,"When this Hotel was opened on the 5th January 1990 it became famous for its Sunday Brunch, overlooking the Marina of Chelsea Harbour. Both my sons had their conformation celebrations here, and friends from Mayfair, would make a B line for SW10 to enjoy the sumptuous Sunday Brunches in the relaxed 😎 atmosphere of the Harbour.
So imagine our delight, when the famous Sunday Brunch was relaunched last Sunday!!!",5,2017,12,06

122,"Lovely Hotel, lovely staff, nice accommodation in an interesting area.","I had stayed at this Hotel many years ago when it was The Conrad.  It cant have been a 5 star in those days as my friend and I occupied a corner suite overlooking the harbour with two sided balcony!
On this occasion, we could only afford a side facing room, sadly it overlooked all the scaffolding and work that was taking place on the Design Centre building.  That said, the workmen didnt start making noise until a reasonable time so this did not disturb us.
The accommodation, suite, lovely and spacious giving the added bonus of being two or three doors can be closing off any noise from the corridor and lifts next door to our particular room.  On our first morning, chatter in a nearby room very early caused me to speak to the occupant and I was surprised to find the room opposite the lifts occupied by about eight burly African looking gentlemen!  I think my attire terrified them and they were very apologetic.

Unfortunately, a breakdown in communication (language barrier) meant that the cystern in our toilet plopped loudly all night and despite complaining to staff on our first morning, this was never remedied.  I think when I mentioned it on leaving, the staff member to whom I had reported it, had not understood ""cystern"".
The location of the Hotel has become somewhat more enclosed than years ago, with modern tower block apartments throwing a shadow over it, but the area in which it sits, Lotts Road, is really interesting, with a few nice bars, shops, studios and as I have mentioned, the fabulous Design Centre next door.  If you like walking, you can walk the Kings Road and Fulham Road's from here.
The doorman on our arrival was particularly nice and went out of his way to help us with parking.
I would also like thanks passed to the housekeeper, Micheline, who kindly found an item I had left in the room and posted it to my home.
If the price was right, we would definitely return.",4,2017,12,01
122,Nice Stay,"Recently we stayed five nights in the Chelsea Habour Hotel where we had not been before. We liked the location of the hotel, apart from the heavy, noisy air traffic to Heathrow and a heliport on the opposite side of the Thames. From our suite on the fourth of eight floors there was some view of the city which we enjoyed very much. The rooms are elegantly furnished and decorated, apart from the dark blue curtains which absolutely do not fit to the general style of the hotel. Lobby, bar, restaurant, the present Christmas decoration are all high-grade, elegant and discrete. We were happy with the restaurant (excellent meat, great British and Irish cheeses, e.g.), though breakfeast according to earlier experience in London hotels might be improvable. The suite was absolutely clean and in (almost) perfect condition. Friendly staff. Generally speaking, we were happy in this hotel and should like to stay there again.",5,2017,11,30
122,Great stay as usual,I have been coming to the hotel for a number of years. The standard is always high. The service is particularly good. The facilities seem to get better each time. The shower was great; the internet was more than adequateand the bed was as usual comfortable. I will definitely be coming back.,4,2017,11,29
122,Excellent all suite hotel with very friendly and helpful staff,"In from Barbados I’ve stayed the last couple of weeks while getting medical treatment in London.
The rooms are all suites, the atmosphere 5 Star light (relaxed!) and the staff are the best I’ve seen in any hotel anywhere",5,2017,11,28
122,Great hospitality and amazing service!!!,"My fiancé and I recently stayed in the Seville Penthouse at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.   From the moment we arrived the service and staff were excellent. The room was extremely spacious with terrific views of the harbour.  We were staying at the hotel as we were having our engagement party in the City. The staff are extremely friendly and catered to our every need. We were surprised to find a lovely cake and card in our suite congratulating us from the manager Andreas and his team.  
The Christmas tree in the lobby was gorgeous and we managed to take a few pictures with it with the assistance of the staff who were so helpful.
I would definitely stay here again and could not recommend it highly enough!  Thank you to everyone who made our stay so enjoyable and special!",5,2017,11,27
122,Another visit with continued excellence,"I am a frequent guest at the hotel and each time my husband I visit we are met with such a warm welcome from all the staff. We stay here because the suites are large,beds are fantastic and the views over the marina great. 
This time my daughter and I had supper in the bar ,our waiter Alan was brilliant and responded to our needs professionally but with such warmth and sensitivity. My daughter had been caught up in the Oxford street incident ,which thankfully was a false alarm, but  we had both been a bit shaken up for a short while.
All the staff, the facilities and the rooms are excellent and over the last 4 years we have been staying  we have not had one complaint . A great find .",5,2017,11,27
122,Good apart from breakfast ,"Booked to stay at hotel for one night- rooms spacious and clean. 
Had a good lunch in the restaurant.
Used the pool which was a decent size for a hotel and wasn’t busy.
Staff were all pleasant.
The only downside was breakfast which was an utter shambles.
We asked if we needed to book a table, there were 7 if us in total. We were laughed at and told there was no need.
We went down to breakfast at 10.15 am on Sunday, we were met by a queue to be seated. There was utter chaos with unset tables and hassled looking staff. The woman on the desk was keen to say there wasn’t room for us despite us having a pre paid package that induced breakfast! After telling her we’d been told there was no need to book, we were seated. We had a drag a chair to the table ourselves. We ordered hot drinks, then cooked breakfast. The buffet was pretty empty and hadn’t been restocked! Our Cooked food came before the drinks, one meal was cold - we were told it would be replaced instead they reheated eggs & hollandaise sauce!!!?? Grim.
We were still waiting for cutlery cups and got drinks! Eventually after a lot of nagging, getting up, chasing staff etc we got our complete order.
In short you should either take bookings for breakfast or get more staff - what you offered us was a shambles.",3,2017,11,26
122,Spoil yourself at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"""I felt really spoilt from the moment I arrived , a charming receptionist to check me into an amazing twin bedded room AND a huge siting room with a fabulous desk to work on and, great excitment  ,a mini bar ( which I managed to resist! however it was very reassuring to have it there ) . I was delighted to find that housekeeping had made my room immaculately clean, the linen is cool and crisp and the bed so comfortable sleep came easily albeit in a strange room.  Next morning I was able to go down in the private lift in my costume and dressing gown to have an early morning swim , what bliss! .later 
that day  I managed  to fit in a ""head and shoulder"" massage much needed after a day,s work. and There is hairdresser if you need it.
I ate twice in the Restaurant , the food was exceptionally good and beautifully served. Breakfast ,despite the dining room being full, was served very quickly and the bacon was scrumptious having been chargrilled.Congratulations to all the staff especially the 
young man who called the lift when he saw me approaching along the corridor ,
Full marks ""  

 I wrote this to the management after my first visit , I feel it sums up how I feel about the hotel  ,having  stayed many times since and each time my experience improves I,m so looking forward to my stay next week.
Marianne Topham",5,2017,11,21
122,Great service,My girlfriend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner at the hotel. Service was excellent and food was outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone to wind down after a busy day at work. Great view from the restaurant/bar and very private. ,5,2017,11,20
122,Mrs,"After many pleasant stays at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, I simply had to write a review as my last one was exceptional. I had mentioned briefly during my booking that it was mine & my husband's wedding anniversary the night we were looking to stay. Not for one minute did I expect the hotel to remember or indeed acknowledge this detail but how wrong I was. We were congratulated at check-in which was a nice touch, but the real treat, shock and excitement was upon walking into our suite to find the most impressive, talented and extravagant decoration that I have ever experienced in any 5 star hotel around the world. Rose petals were arranged in the most romantic and artistic way in the bed room, bathroom & living room. It was so breath taking I had to take and include the pictures in this review. I also asked and found out the name of the incredibly talented lady who had spent the time and effort to do this (Petronella)
After a fabulous night and delicious breakfast in the restaurant it was time to leave but we will most certainly be returning!!!",5,2017,11,20
122,Excellent business trip,I had an excellent stay which lasted for 2 weeks. I was pleasantly surprised at the consistency in attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to be in Chelsea. ,5,2017,11,19
122,Quiet and relaxing,"We set out to have a lovely few days to celebrate out 25th wedding anniversary.  
What a lovely hotel. The staff from the outset were amaxing and so accommodating.  We were  booked into a harbour view room, which overlooked the small harbour off the Thames. The room was nice,  a little  tired,  but still luxurious. 
   The suite was very spacious, with our  own living room.  The bed was very comfy and we had a few good night's sleep.  
   The food at the hotel was ok,  with a special mention for the cooked breakfast!!
  Overall a nice stay. Had an issue with the bill, which was sorted eventually by Lara.
    Will return to experience the hotel again!!",4,2017,11,19
122,Comfortable luxury ,"And every need attended to. Clean, quiet and very relaxing. Good food in the Brasserie and would recommend a stroll west along the river. Lovely place. Good stroll along the king’s road in Chelsea to Sloane Square too. Very relaxed. Lovely to find in London. ",4,2017,11,18
122,"Wow, outstanding","Check in was polite and slick, then up to the most immaculate suite where everything was just right with a super comfy bed with beautiful quality bed linen.  I didn't get to use my lounge but it was nicely done.  Staff were helpful when I thought I'd lost my necklace (I found it nestled in my cleavage!).  An amazing 'spot on' hotel and I hope I'll be back again.",5,2017,11,18
122,"A visit for afternoon tea, and it was excellent","We booked afternoon tea as part of a spa package but I've reviewed them separately because I wanted to give this element of the day an excellent rating. Efficient and friendly service, a glass of champagne to start with, delicious sandwiches and cakes including a separate vegan selection for one of our group. The waiter picked up on the fact it was a birthday celebration and arrange for a special plate of birthday cake which made it even more of a special occasion. Would definitely go back here for afternoon tea.",5,2017,11,16
122,Excellent,The hotel was immaculate and the room was very luxurious. The service from the front office staff was excellent. The Porter / Concierge was particularly accommodating. Thank you for a very pleasant stay.,5,2017,11,14
122,What outstanding service!,"When I went along for Afternoon Tea on Saturday, I was expecting a lovely afternoon out but I was blown away by the level of service by the incredible team at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel.  We were all spoiled rotten and the bride-to-be was treated like royalty.  Gorgeous food as well...highly recommended.",5,2017,11,14
122,Excellent service,"We had afternoon tea for a hen doo on the weekend and had an amazing time, 5 star service and great food. Many thanks Andreas (The manager) for making our visit so special! Highly recommend. They made the hen feel so special. We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",5,2017,11,14
122,Exemplary Customer Service,"I had often wanted to stay at this hotel but being fairly local, I had to wait for a good enough reason so I booked a spa break for my partner's birthday. The day before our visit, I received a call from the manager to advise me that the pool would be unusable due to unforeseen circumstances which was a shame since the spa was one of the reasons for choosing the hotel, however I was offered a room upgrade to compensate and this more than made up for any disappointment. Our suite faced the harbour and being on the 7th floor, we had a view across the Thames to the London skyline. 
Every member of staff from the moment we arrived were charming and welcoming and we felt that nothing would've been too much trouble. In addition to the upgraded room, we had chocolates and champagne delivered to the room for my partner's birthday during our spa visit, which meant surprise for him and a another special treat. 
There are transport links nearby with an overground service a few minites walk away and the nearest tube for services into London is just one stop along. 
I am very happy to recommend this hotel and look forward to our next visit.",5,2017,11,13
122,Afternoon tea - service above and beyond,"20 of us turned up for afternoon tea but there was a mix up with bookings and they weren't expecting us.  The hotel were amazing in resolving things and went above and beyond to make us feel extremely special and spoiled.  The GM, Andreas, was very charming and nothing was too much trouble.  All of the staff were lovely and worked really hard to make our afternoon a joy.  Afternoon tea was delicious with an amazing choice of sandwiches, cakes, scones, tea and prosecco or champagne.  I would really recommend this for a wedding shower, family gathering or to spoil a friend or partner.  A very chic venue to boot.",5,2017,11,12
122,Afternoon tea fit for the Queen!,"We were a group of about 19 women who had booked an Afternoon Tea here. After a slight misunderstanding with our booking, we were treated like royalty with perfect service from all the staff (special mention to the manager Andreas and Peter who both did a fantastic job of looking after us).  They catered for all our dietary needs (& there were quite a few - vegetarians, vegans, no pork, mint tea, green tea, mixed tea, normal tea!!) and the food that was delivered was absolutely delicious.  The best afternoon tea i have had.  Even now as i think back, i can still smell and taste the freshly baked scones.  Heaven!  We were not staying at the hotel so i can not comment on the rooms but the rest of the hotel - the bar, the restrooms, the foyer etc. were all clean and there was always a member of staff available to offer help and/or guidance.  To top off a lovely afternoon, we were all given free Prosecco and the hen herself was given a voucher for 2 people to stay at the hotel.  Great service, great food, great hotel.",5,2017,11,12
122,Threatre and birthday break,"10/10 very please with our stay would take the time for a walk along the river, you can walk from the back of the Hotel to the river. The staff were very friendly and professional and even left in our room a piece of cake and bottle of wine on our return from the theatre. Never had such a treat before like that and I have stayed in many 5 star hotel over 50 years. ",5,2017,11,08
122,Hidden treasure,"I have stayed at the Chelsea Harbour on a few occasions. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by the most impeccable, charming staff. Vadim welcomed us with a smile and his staff are a credit to him. We were lucky enough to stay in the Kings Suite and the views of London were breath-taking. We sat in the bar and had cocktails and again the staff could not have made you feel more welcome. This is rare in a lot of hotels in London as sometimes you can feel a little intimated but the smiles and friendliness of the staff only made us relax and feel as if we were home from home.  I cannot rate this hotel enough. It was an absolute pleasure staying here. Although you are staying in London, you feel as if you are a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of the big city.",5,2017,11,06
122,Excellent ,Very clean & comfortable. Staff were very helpful and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely be staying again and would highly recommend. Close to museums and galleries with most in walking distance ,5,2017,11,06
122,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"I Highly recommend this hotel my daughter and I were made to feel welcome.The staff are very friendly,nothing too much trouble.Our suite was so comfortable ,wish we could stay longer but plan to come back.This Hotel is in a quiet part of Chelsea lots to see and do ,handy for lots of shopping Galleries and museums,in fact we walked to most .See you again Harbour Hotel ",5,2017,11,06
122,One Night Break ,"We stayed here as we were attending the ‘Spirit of Xmas’ fayre at Olympia. The hotel was very lovely, The staff (Vadim) on the main reception were great. Unfortunately I do not like lifts unless see through or very big and modern, so we had to go up the stairs (which needed unlocking.) They were most helpful and all staff we came in contact with were professional and friendly! Breakfast was slightly confusing as we did not get told how it worked and unfortunately due to the sight we booked through, we had a twin rather than a double. Vadim really tried to rectify this for us. The room was slightly chilly and I agree that for a view you need to have a harbour facing suite, but we enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back. Beautiful suites, nice food and friendly staff! Thank you! ",5,2017,11,05
122,Well done!,Excellent charming staff and a clean welcoming environment made for a comfortable stay. I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in central west London. The door staff were particularly helpful and engaging.,4,2017,11,02
122,Exceptional experience on our Wedding Day,"We had a truly exceptional recent experience at this hotel.  We were at the hotel with our 3 children and parents for 4 days.  In the middle of this was our Wedding.  We were made to feel incredibly special.  The hotel is lovely and the rooms are great.  But what made this for us, was the staff.  They went above and beyond.  We can't thank them enough.  Little things like champagne on arrival after our Wedding, fixing our cake that had been damaged en-route, lining up to see my wife and kids off on their way to the registry office, and generally spoiling us.  Whereas they did things that I would've expected they also did things that were unexpected and lovely.  After one such example of the hotel staff going above and beyond, I was told by the registrar that we were obviously lucky to be staying at such a lovely hotel.  All in all a great experience, a great hotel and great people.  It was perfect for our wedding.",5,2017,10,31
122,The service is very personal and attentive!,"I booked this hotel at the recommendation of a close friend. He told me that the location is very good and that the service is very personal and attentive.

The check in process was smooth and very friendly. The rooms were clean and functional; the view from the room was amazing!!!

I would like to say thank you to one of your managers Lloyd for his time and for being so helpful. We accidently met in the lift and while talking to him I had all answers I needed. I know that I will stay again and will recommend your hotel, especially after talking to Lloyd and trusting him that all his passion and future plans will make this hotel even more exceptional and special. Well Done an Thank you!",5,2017,10,30
122,Almost,"Good location, friendly staff. food is overpriced and usually there is a problem with at least one meal.
Rooms are very good size and comfortable albeit a little tired . 
But for access to kings road and west London it is good value. 
Good to have valet parking.
We will use again. ",3,2017,10,23
122,Birthday treats ,"My partner and myself had an amazing weekend at the Chelsea Harbour hotel for my birthday. The service, room and food were more than we could have asked for. The location also meant that we were within a short distance to all London attractions, shops and top class restaurants. I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again. ",5,2017,10,17
122,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed with a friend for a Wedding in London so unfortunately didn't spend much time in the Hotel, however we could not fault it and would like to have stayed longer and used the spa facilities.
The location was perfect for us being only 10 mins from the Church.",5,2017,10,17
122,great week ends,"I and my partner have a lovely week in at Chelsea Harbour Hotel, my partners have enjoy his birthday greetings form all staff and surprise cake in the room when we arrive from our Dinner. even we only stay 1 night we do enjoy and love the room.
All staff are very welcoming and friendly . Recommend to all my family and friends.",5,2017,10,16
122,Thank you!,"We were very content in terms of service, cleanliness, value, location, sleep quality and rooms.
The only thing you have to improve is the channel choice of the tv-program and the internet connection in the room.",5,2017,10,15
122,Lovely experience,"My mother and I really enjoyed our stay.The hotel views are amazing.We loved sitting on the balcony and looking over the marina.Last time we visited we had a suite on a higher floor,that was better as we could see down the Thames.Staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble.Food is delicious.We have booked to visit again,this time for 3 nights from Dec30th and hope to have a high floor.",5,2017,10,12
122,"Wonderful hotel, poor menu",This is a wonderful hotel where every room is a suite and we have stayed there over a lot of years.  But standards have slipped and the choices on the menu in the bar/restaurant have been progressively diminishing and becoming less interesting. ,3,2017,10,12
122,Excellent hotel,"I was there for business meetings and events, 10 minutes walking from Stanford Bridge stadium, so it was a perfect place to stay.
I stayed on a suite in the first floor, very comfortable, bathroom was very good and the place is very quiet on nights, in the mornings some trains start early and cross through the bridge in front of my room, anyway I was already awake.
I only had breakfast, variety of fruits, ham and cheeses. Nice.",5,2017,10,08
122,Good location great overall stay,"This was one of the sort hotels in London we loved. Hotels all over are pretty expensive.
This was overall a good deal. Comfortable stay and good location, a nice and safe neighbourhood. Love this hotel will stay here again for sure.3 days was good enough in London.",4,2017,10,04
122,Excellent stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"We chose the  hotel in preference to The Gloucester, where we had stayed on a number of occasions but consider that that hotel is in need of a total refurbishment. My wife and myself thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel which will now be our hotel of choice whenever we visit London.",5,2017,10,04
122,Birthday treat,"A really nice stay, staff were friendly and the facilities excellent. As it was my wife’s birthday there was a nice surprise in the room when we got there - a chocolate cake with happy birthday written on the plate. Nice touch.",5,2017,10,03
122,Better places to stay,"I have reviewed and stayed at this hotel before and have to say I don’t think I’ll stay here again in a rush.
I came here with my Mrs for 12 year anniversary last weekend.
We booked a Marina View which was located opposite the lifts which was noisy, the room reeked of smoke, cigarette burns in the carpet and no glasses to pour our drinks.
Having called the reception around 5 times we were relocated by a very helpful young lady called Julia who was very nice and apologetic and relocated us to another suite.
It took the shine off the occasion and probably wouldn’t stay here again in a rush, there are other hotels at the same price that are just as good if not better for the price we paid.
In addition, don’t bother signing up for a membership with these guys, they don’t honour their points scheme, having stayed with the hotel on lots of occasions they never issue the reward points. Most recently I asked for an update as to why points haven’t been added and 5 days later I’m still chasing.
Really disappointing.",1,2017,10,03
122,Fabulous hotel,"What a great hotel! The room was terrific with lots of space, quite rare for a European property. I was traveling solo and the room was so comfortable. Itesd great to have a room that felt more like an apartment with room to stretch out and relax after a long day of sightseeing. Will definitely be back. ",5,2017,10,03
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel Review,Extremely pleasant and enjoyable stay as always in the Chelsea Harbour hotel. We are already looking forward to our next trip in November. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel is brilliant. ,5,2017,10,03
122,"QUALITY""","Had an amazing stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel this past weekend. The staff are genuinely concerned about customer satisfaction from the doorman (who are readily available to assist with parking as we pulled up to the front of the hotel), the reception staff (who welcomed us with a warm greeting and waiters and waitresses (who took time to go through the menu and gave us really good meal suggestions).

This Hotel an all suite hotel (the only one of its kind in London) meaning our room had separate bedroom and living area + balcony overlooking the harbour. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and took advantage of the Spa facilities, we used the pool and sauna hopefully next time we can squeeze in a treatment. 

If you're travelling for business, leisure or simply just need a #staycation I would most definitely recommend this Hotel. 

Its two thumbs up from me :o)

N.M",4,2017,10,02
122,One night stay,"Stayed one night with my wife to attend my daughters 30th. Beautiful hotel and suite overlooking the harbour and river. Expensive but excellent quality. The only criticism is that there’s no parking, you have to go 300-400 yards away, pay £30-40 and walk back which in the rain would be a pain. ",4,2017,10,02
122,5 star experience!! 5 star service!!,"Stayed from Friday to Saturday and it was amazing!! Good size room, nice view and very clean!! We had the Marina View Suite. The room was exactly how it was on their website!

Dinner and breakfast couldn't have been better!! Thank you Ivelin and Edwin

Clean and warm swimming pool! Staff were all courteous and very helpful from the doorman that help parked my car, ordering room service to the restaurant staff. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I will definitely stay there again for sure!

Only downside was we couldn't afford to stay another night lol!",5,2017,10,02
122,Change of management?,"I used to live locally and this hotel used to be our go to place to host our guests who visited out of town or relax with a glass of wine overlooking the river. But it has really gone downhill, the place is clearly looking dated and the staff can't be bothered to even smile at reception when they check you in! The housekeeping is a shambles and breakfast is a joke.Looks like there has been a recent change in management and speaking to one of the old time door staff it is not going so well. Such a shame as it used to be a beautiful hotel.",1,2017,10,02
122,Amazing dinner with friends!,Another amazing dinner at Chelsea Harbour Hotel! The new menu is just amazing. You have to try Mushroom Risotto-the best I have ever eaten so far. And Pistachio Tiramisu was delicious as well. Thank you for excellent service.,5,2017,10,02
122,Afternoon tea,"Had a fantastic afternoon at this lovely hotel, can not fault it , food was great and the staff very attentive and professional , and a big thank you to the manager, Andreas who made us feel so welcome and very charming.",5,2017,10,01
122,New menu and service 5*,We have been visiting Chelsea Harbour for the past 2 years. It never lets us down. Always great service and delicious food! This time we were pleasantly surprised with the new menu! Well done Chef as well as Ivelin and Edwin! ,5,2017,09,30
122,"Great hotel, great view and great staff","This is my second visit to this beautiful hotel with a wonderful view. I would like to offer special thanks to all the staff at this hotel
from management , reception staff , Room service and doorman .
They were all very kind and friendly and were wonderful staff assistants .
I will never forget my happy stay in this hotel 
I really miss that comfy mattress & pillow 😍
Thank you all again 💐☺️

122,Riverside brassiere ,"Myself , husband and 2 children dined at this restaurant on a Sunday and it was extremely pleasant with a sophisticated atmosphere. Our food was delicious and the service first class . 
The terrace area is so beautiful over looking the harbour and we will return again and again . 
",5,2017,09,27
122,Afternoon Tea at Chelsea Harbour Hotel - A Hidden Gem,"The afternoon tea has been upgraded in improved a lot. Now they are serving tea with Whitard which has made the afternoon tea experience more elegant and pleasant. The sandwiches are delicious and the view is fantastic. The price is a surprise and it is good value for money for such a nice place. 

The hotel provides a timer for brewing tea....that is so unique and so far it is the only hotel or tea house has this service, as far as I know.",4,2017,09,01
122,A shadow of its former self,"My wife and I have used this hotel for many years from when it was badged the Conrad Hilton to the Wyndham and now undee the management of Millenium Hotels, which it has been for a few years.

My first mistake was complacency when booking via Booking.com and not paying attention to the price. I normally pay between £250 and £300 For a room.  Occasionally it has been it a bit more but that has always delivered a Chelsea Suite or Marina Suite and generally very agreeable.

I arrived this evening to find a room that was perhaps the worst I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Dingy, poor amenities, stained carpet and at the extortionate price of £426.  I had to ask for another room which I was given with some degree of disdain from the young, surly and clearly not very service and hospitality minded man on reception.

Whilst a better room, layout-wise, the hotel, for the first time, is one where either it's owners have placed pressure on the management co to deliver better returns or where the manger itself has sought better incentive fees for itself at GOP leve via demonstrable cost cutting against an aggressive rate strategy.  Even FF&E standards have taken a nose dive - such a shame.

I for one will not return to what was once a great property and first class hospitality experience. Alas - no more.

I'm scoring this property low for the simple reason my benchmark is what it once was and is no longer. I can stay at the Savoy  or Claridges for much the same price and receive with the benefit of their far superior understanding of guest experience and hospitality.",2,2017,08,30
122,Lunch on the Harbour Side,"An enjoyable and relaxing visit, the staff were very friendly and helpful and could not do enough for us. The perfect place to eat, drink and escape the hustle bustle of London for a couple of hours. I would also recommend an overnight stay too as we have stayed here many times and keep coming back when we need a night in London",5,2017,08,29
122,Riverside Brasserie,"We just discovered this restaurant at this Hotel. What a nice place and what impressed us the most was how staff was so eager to please us. 
Only a mark down for the food which is a bit bland and not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel property in London.

Nevertheless we will definitely give it another go very soon.",4,2017,08,26
122,Disappointing Tea,"Last year a special tea was organised as a gift for my husband and I. What a very bad experience. The greeting was great...no problem. The gift received was presented and was a surprise. From then on ...disaster. The waitress could not have been taught how to serve a drink as she served from the opposite side of the table, on a tray and the glass slipped off tray into my lap...and soaked my dress. Apologies were given but waitress stressed. Tried to mop table so I suggested we move table. Moved table. Tea served...just plonked in front of us...no explanation of sandwich fillings, types of cakes etc.One plate for sandwiches and cake. Cutlery missing. Left to our own devices. Left restaurant with nobody asking if we had enjoyed experience. Would not and have not recommended.",2,2017,08,25
122,a wonderful stay every time,"We visit this hotel frequently and we are always impressed how helpful and friendly all the staff are . Everyone makes you feel welcome . The suites are large and airy with brilliant views over the marina ,the beds have crisp sheets and large pillows and the bathrooms have a bath and separate shower. The highlight for us though is a large pool ,well equipped gym and running paths all along the Thames . A few night here feels like a holiday rather than a hectic weekend in London .",5,2017,08,22
122,this hotel never fails me,"this hotel never fails my expectations , beautiful view and convenient location.

only 10 minutes drive to major locations in central London.

under ground station is very close by.

the hotel is all suites hotel (no normal rooms) but suites are at other hotel room rates!
I really enjoy staying here as it is very clean and spacey.",4,2017,08,21
122,Another great stay at The Chelsea Harbour,"Love this Hotel, great  Suites especially marina views with a balcony, comfortable beds and really well appointed bathrooms with all the things you would expect.
Excellent food in the restaurant or bar and a very good breakfast choices, if your lucky enough to have good weather eat breakfast on the terrace overlooking Marina.
Great location, if you don't mind walking you can be on the Kings Road in 15 minutes and we walked to Westminster Pier in 1hr 15minutes.  If you don't like walking jump on the train at Imperial Wharf which is a stones throw away, so easy to can get anywhere.
The staff are so helpful and courteous nothing is too much trouble.
We are looking forward to returning to this lovely Hotel next time we are innLondon..",5,2017,08,19
122,SHOCKED AT RECEPTION,"I booked two rooms in March 2017 for the 4th & 5th August as we were hosting a dinner in Chelsea on the 4th and going to a wedding in Chelsea on the 5th, so it should go without having to say this we WANTED to be in Chelsea.
On arrival we were asked to see the management, we were told they were moving us to the Baileys Hotel---- we were not impressed. The young girl we were dealing with appeared not to know that we had booked two rooms, one being for our daughter and husband, they were in the air flying into Gatwick, so difficult to get in touch with them.
We were told that a whole floor was out due to an electrical fault, now obviously we believe what we were told, although it seems a little odd that the second room was not mentioned when we were asked to move hotels. It also turned out that they had a wedding for 400 on the night of the 4th.
Well basically we were not moving, if we had wanted to stay in the Gloucester Road we would have booked it, we did make an offer of moving to their sister hotel in Grosvenor Square, subject to having the same standard of rooms, as we had stayed there before.
In stead of having a quite time in our room to freshen up we said we would have lunch and wait for things to be sorted, after awhile Nader Neishabouri (Front of House Manager) came to our table and said that two rooms were being made available, obviously we were delighted and thanked him.
The rest of our stay was free of any nasty events, and the staff were excellent, having drinks and supper on the 5th over looking the harbour was lovely.
One criticism of the room would be that the bed is in a wooden frame which sticks out from the mattress, as it is inside the frame, and unfortunately my wife hit her leg badly on this.
Anyway full marks to Nader Neishabouri, we would return--I think.",4,2017,08,17
122,Lunch supper,The bar is great spot for the area. Thanks for the warm welcome of the attentive staff and their attitude. Good cleaning impression. A point down for the kitchen that didn't fulfill my expectations . Hake cheviche to be reviewed.  ,4,2017,08,10
122,Great Hotel ...,"One Of My Favorite Places To Stay In London.  Yep, It's A Little On The Pricey Side, But You Get What You Pay For.
Superb Location, Overlooks The Harbor.  Nice Ambience, The Rooms Are Really Nice, All Combined With Top Class Service.  ",5,2017,08,09
122,Short Break to London,"The hotel is not central London but is not so far out as to be any problem. Imperial Wharf Station 5 minutes away as is the Thames for a wander.

So in many ways better than be in the Centre.

Staff were great, friendly, helpful and the rooms spacious and clean.

I would say to any reader coming to London to give the Chelsea Harbour Hotel a go.",5,2017,08,09
122,Perfect for visiting the 606 jazz club,My wife and myself use this hotel a couple of times a year when attending the excellent 606 jazz club which is 5 or so minutes walk away. Superb suites with great outlook from a harbour view suite. Lovely breakfast. Only downside is parking in the nearby Design Centre underground car park. £40 a night seems a bit steep (I know it's London).,5,2017,08,08
122,Watched a fist fight in the bar,"First the location.  The neighbouring area is called World's End, and that about sums it up.  It's miles to the nearest underground station.  There is an overground station next door, but unless you're going to Clapham Junction that's not much help.  There are busses along the Kings Road, but if you don't know the routes so well, that's a pain. Developers are clearly trying to push the area as a design hub, but the transport connections are awful.

Then the hotel.  It's fine. Nice big rooms, clean, comfortable.  The front office staff were all friendly and helpful.  So as somewhere to sleep, it's fine.  But expensive,

Finally, the bar. Oh my word.  It's like entering a parallel world. I've never seen such a disorganised, middle aged bunch of male bar staff making a meal of serving so few customers.  They seemed to leave the menial work to the female staff, who had to wash and replace glasses while the machos strutted. Incredible. There were four staff for five tables used and they couldn't cope...they seemed to spend more time arguing among themselves.  But the real drama was about 10pm.  There were about six of us talking at a table , the only others were two single women sitting separately at the bar nursing drinks.  One of them, a British women had tried joining our conversation earlier, saying the oddest things, then thankfully she returned to the bar.  When suddenly she leaps up and punches the other women in the face, screaming the foulest obscenities.  After the initial shock, a porter came and separated them.....and let the attacker sit back in her seat.  We couldn't believe it.  We assumed it was a turf war, so we quietly slipped away to avoid any further drama.  Dreadful place.",1,2017,08,03
122,A holiday feel in London,Stayed here when attending Wimbledon. Hotel was tuned into the Wimbledon theme through the flower arrangements and shuttle service. The reception area is simple glam and you are greeted by a lovely friendly concierge.  The restaurant and terrace are great and it feels like you are in the South of France.  On the whole staff are friendly but there are one or two who are frosty and need a bit of customer service training. We had a suite which was comfortable and well furnished with views of he harbour. The breakfast was very tasty and just right in portion size. Great location so would return.,4,2017,07,29
122,Afternoon tea ,"We came here for afternoon tea. The station, Imperial Wharf, is no more than 5 minutes walk away so you can get to here very easily  (we caught the train from Clapham junction). The hotel was classy as soon as you entered. We had a couple of drinks in the bar area which was lovely. They had an outside terrace but it was raining but you still had a stunning view of the harbour  (it felt as we were abroad not in London). The drinks weren't that expensive for the area or London  (rose wine 6.50). 

Anyway afternoon tea. This was awesome and would really recommend. Lovely views over the harbour again. Lovely restaurant and excellent service. The hot chocolate was the best I've ever had. Again the price was reasonable as well. The food was your typical sandwiches and scones and there was 5 different sweet varieties to choose from. It was presented wonderfully. Would really recommend for anyone wanting a great location, wonderful food and stunning views.",5,2017,07,23
122,Expensive but classy,"This hotel is in the heart of Chelsea/Fulham and is in a great location. 
Very clean and great attention to detail.
Great for public transport links with Fulham Broadway tube station less that 10 mins walk.
Drinks are expensive but there are nearby pubs and restaurants available.",5,2017,07,22
122,Lovely Ambience of Jazz on a Lazy Sunday Afternoon,"We had a lovely Sunday buffet lunch which we extended to to enjoy the jazz music in the bar. 
I think the lead musician was Ralph on keyboard. Lively but chilled. Is this a regular fixture?
Best regards,
Veronica White",5,2017,07,21
122,Great jazz venue on Sundays,"I discovered the Chelsea Harbour Hotel Bar from a friend who lives in the development and was pleasantly surprised when an amazing jazz pianist and bass player turned up a few weeks ago as we were having our Sunday roast at the buffet. The piano player is Ralph Lewars - and it seems he's pretty well-known on the London jazz scene - and the bass player was just incredible with him. We absolutely loved his music and the buffet is very tasty, especially the desserts! (Go for the French crepes!)

We returned last Sunday having heard Ralph was playing again and this time he had a very talented drummer and bass player with him. With lovely views over Chelsea Harbour, good food and great music, it's a great way to spend Sunday just lazing around and listening to the mellow sounds of live jazz played to a very high standard. I've never really been much into jazz before but this is definitely turning me into a fan. It's a great live music experience and a perfect family or couples day out. I'll definitely be returning on Sundays.",5,2017,07,20
122,Great place ,"A most unusual location for London a private harbour great views 
Food is ok drinks good but expensive 
The hotel is great though again expensive but it's popularity means that's just my opinion!! Will go back ",5,2017,07,19
122,Been coming here for 27 years; never been so disappointed,"This was a hotel that stood out for its great service, accommodations, and a phenomenal gym. Successive years just witnessed a decline but none more so than when it went under Millenium Hotel chain management. Gone are many of the regular staff, and even regular guests you would see at certain times of the year. I Have been a big user of the hotel but this stay last week has got to rank as the worst ever. The pullout sofa bed was broken and the people who came to put the bed on didn't care that it was broken or slanted - or didn't know what to do. My daughter woke up the next day with a rigid and aching back. When I mentioned to the check out folks that the bed was broken they shrugged their shoulders. The toilet seat in the guest bathroom looked like it hadn't been changed since the hotel opened. Really terrible service. Not long before everyone who were regulars here stops coming. They just keep raising the rates - and putting nothing back in to upkeep the hotel. Terrible and shameful.",2,2017,07,18
122,Flawless service for a business event,"Earlier this week I delivered a training event at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. We had a room in the lovely penthouse suite which had amazing views and a gorgeous interior as well as a fantastic huge balcony. Everything I needed was taken care of, which is so rare, and there was nothing I could fault. To top it all I had a really lovely guy called Mohammed looking after me who was so professional, kind, attentive and all round brilliant. Nothing was too much trouble and he is a real ambassador to the hotel. I'd have no hesitation rebooking especially if Mohammed was looking after us once more - thanks Mohammed! :)",5,2017,07,14
122,5*,"We stayed at the hotel on the 11th July, after a super day on tennis a Wimbledon.
My biggest regret is we did not spend enough time enjoying the hotel and the Harbour.
The reception was very efficient and friendly and the rooms were excellent with everything you would expect.
If you stay at this hotel make sure you take advantage of the facilities",5,2017,07,12
122,"lovely hotel, nice location","stayed here one night got free upgrade to river suite,what a fantastic room and views over London.
The only negative comments would be on the service.
in bar area tried to switch on patio heaters on verandah but did not work,asked waiter and he said he would find out but never returned.
when we paid I asked what happened he did not return he replied its not working.
in restaurant service was really slow,asked for some strawberry jam and waiter returned with a small basket of jams but no strawberry?.
food was very good.
on check out was not asked was everything ok with my stay which I thought should have been asked.
I would stay here again and recommend it though.",4,2017,07,12
122,Coffee with a view,Stopped off to have a coffee and a few drinks at this wonderful hotel. It is simply lovely. Very courteous staff and ultra nice. The bar has a lovely outdoor patio overlooking the harbour. I must stay there.,5,2017,07,10
122,Passed with flying colours,Decided to sway away from my usual London hotel and test the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.  We were given suite 208. Absolutely perfect for the price with a view. Cannot get decent comfort in London anywhere around this price. The only downside was £52 for breakfast and the fact i had to go and find my own parking . But after saving on such a comfortable stay i have no complaints. The staff at the bar were super friendly. I am very happy with the stay here and i think i have found my new hotel when in town. Thanks Chelsea Harbour you will see us again soon. 93% overall for the stay.,5,2017,07,09
122,Work dinner on the terrace,"Lovely location to have dinner on the terrace. I was very disappointed with how alow it was to get arrved when it was quiet. Drinks not turning up and being wrong. This was a issue, which I raised to them. Surprised they didnt aend over a comp round l, as a gesture of good will. I would expect betrer from such a big name place. The steaks were like minute steaks, where they actually came and told me they also forgot to print my dinner order as well. This meant food was delayed too. On a positive note, the potato wedges were amazing, the best ever and bery well cooked. Flat mushrooms were nkcd. I would say the wine selection would need to be reviewed, as it wasn't paticular good on the palate and has a poor selection picked out. I would however return to see if their standards have been raised.",3,2017,07,08
122,30th Birthday Treat,"We stayed here as part of a weekend in London and loved the hotel. Set In a peaceful location the hotel is a perfect tranquil retreat in the heart of London. The staff were all fantastic and friendly, and couldn't do enough. Sure the hotel is not the cheapest but the setting and facilities are 1st class! The balcony in the room or the bar for drinks helped to make a sunny weekend in London even more perfect. It's a bit of a walk to the kings road etc but not too far if you have the time or inclination, otherwise taxis are readily available outside. All in all a perfect hotel, and I would recommend. ",5,2017,07,03
122,Lovely afternoon tea!!! ,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. It's a really beautiful place with fantastic staff. The afternoon tea is lovely, the scones were absolutely delicious and the cakes were pretty and yummy. All the guys who work there are great and really caring. I can't wait to come back! ",5,2017,07,02
122,Breakfast at Brasserie,Very nice a quiet location. An ideal place for a romantic weekend or a stay in London for business meetings. Good service. Staff is making sure the guests are well looked after. The hotel is around 45min away with taxi to the station and tube to Liverpool Street/ city centre.,4,2017,07,02
122,Amazing dinner,"I have been here with a friend for dinner. Nice food, nice atmosphere and great staff. The service offered by the supervisor Alessandro has been perfect and we really enjoyed our dinner thanks to him. 
We surely will come back. ",5,2017,06,30
122,Outstanding Service ,"By the far the best value for money in London is at this property, the suite was very clean and had a great view. The staff is very friendly and professional. Housekeeper is top notch and consistent. I think I had the best authentic Italian food at this hotel. Will definitely visit again.",5,2017,06,30
122,Lol noon/valentines & 🇨embassy 🇿 visit 🇨🇿,"Very nice but also very expensive 😀 💖 we enjoyed our stay love the pillows 💖everyone friendly and helpful, no drought beers, had nice swim and sauna😀 lovely shops and close to rain network but rather long stretch to Kensington place gardens 😀",5,2017,06,28
122,Should haven given 1 star but....,"So... after staying in this hotel on many occasions over a period of 25 years, we have seen many changes, from hotel owners (name change) management, decor and food. What has always remained is the stunning location, fabulous rooms and views. 

This trip was a a couple of nights away with some special friends. Two Riverview rooms booked.

On arrival we were told that they were unable due to ""technical difficulties"" to accommodate us for our first night in the requested rooms. Needless to say, we were very disappointed after singing the praises of these fabulous rooms to our friends. 

I'm not going to go into detail of how things on our first night went from disappointment to anger, because the way the management and especially Vittoria handled the situation was above and beyond any complaint we could ever have. 

With this in mind we will without a shadow of a doubt continue to stay and recommend this fabulous hotel to anyone who is looking for a five star experience with fabulous rooms, amazing staff and one of the best breakfasts I ever had 10/10 but trip advisor only goes to 5!!",5,2017,06,26
122,Great Hospitality!,"Popped in for a few drinks on the terrace with some friends and the attention the staff gave us from the moment we approached the bar was superb! 
Cocktails and food were delicious too and not overly priced.
I definitely recommend this spot if you are out and about in Chelsea!",5,2017,06,26
122,Excellent property and great service,"I was in this hotel for 3 nights this month and i had an excellent experience overall. the location of the property is scenic with the harbor view however there were no sign boards at the access road from the main road. other than that rest all was fantastic. the check in was smooth, the rooms were very spacious, beds very comfortable and washroom was also a delight. the breakfast spread was excellent. the eggs to order was very tasty and so was the entire menu. We had a meeting and a 7 course formal sit down dinner as well in the hotel's top floor and all thing and facilities were top notch. I would definitely like to stay in this property again if i can... Highly recommended.",5,2017,06,24
122,My worst ever hotel experience ever and I have never written a review in 20 years,I am here in a sweltering June and for the second night in 3 days there is no air conditioning.  The management is laughing doing nothing but saying open your windows. The problem is the low flying planes keeping you up.  They will not send out staff for ear plugs.  I am disgusted,1,2017,06,18
122,Good harbour view,"Weekend trip to London with family to see London and landmarks.
Best location in centre east reach of the city attractions.
The hotel was nice, clean and inviting.
Checked in and went to room all good and had good night sleep.
In the morning had breakfast continental buffet with the yacht harbour view very grande, excellent choice and will definitely return.",5,2017,06,18
122,Hidden Harbour gem,"Where do I begin? I've been using this hotel for around 6 months now and it never disappoints. Meeting rooms, bedrooms for guests (all suites) and a terrific restaurant and bar that serves a great Manhattan.

Sunday buffet is a veritable feast and the English breakfast is epic.

Service flawless from front of house to back.

Stay here, eat here. It really is all good.",5,2017,06,13
122,room service was great,"I have stayed at this hotel for one night nearly 7 months ago, I was actually visiting my friend and as she didn't want to go out so we ended up eating in the room. It was a nice room and I had the best chicken schnitzel ever. I stayed the night and I quite liked it. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice. The only problem is I think they do not have a car park for the guests or at least not a free one. It is very close to a tube station though.",4,2017,06,11
122,MID RANGE LONDON HOTEL,"This was my third visit and i can honestly say it has not changed at all which is both surprising and disappointing for a London hotel .
I only stay for business and would not really recommend for a family holiday.
The rooms all suits are a good idea but are a little tired and need updating .
Breakfast the only meal i have had over three years and three visits is a farce.
The staff try hard but have no management orchestrating how the room should be serviced.
The food  tea toast all come at different times and the result is always frustration.
Most of the above is an easy fix however i feel the hotel will not listen.

122,Chelsea Riverside Brasserie,"I have just spent a wonderful week here and Regina at the hotel restaurant has made my stay even better.  She was attentive, kind and patient.  I looked forward to seeing her smile when stepping down for dinner.  Enjoyed the service and food so much, I returned 3 out of my 5 nights!  Thank you Regina!",5,2017,06,06
122,Perfectly ok - apart from lack of sockets in the right place,"The hotel itself is fine: room service is good and the food quality was fine; bed was large and comfortable,

However, for a relatively new hotel, the lack of power sockets near the beds is inexcusable.  The only sockets were either by the worktable (in the other part of the suite) or by the TV (out of reach from the bed.",4,2017,06,06
122,BRILLIANT ,"I booked this hotel for a afternoon tea for my friends 50th. On arrival we were 30 minutes early, they did say we could sit straight away, or have a drink. We decided to have a drink at the bar. The cocktails were lovely and reasonable price. The bar gentleman was very friendly, and joined in with our banter! Our table was next to the window with a view of the harbour which was nice. There was about 5 different choices of tea which I thought was good. The food that came out was lovely and fresh, also the scones were warm to :) We wasn't rushed by the staff, and was asked a number of times if we wanted more tea. It was a relaxing atmosphere which made it pleasurable. After tea we headed back to the bar for our coffee as we wanted to sit in a area where we could people watch! I would certainly recommend this hotel and afternoon tea it was brilliant thank you to all the staff :)",5,2017,06,02
122,Great service in the Bar,"I called in to the hotel to enquire about room rates and was impressed by the reservation staff who dealt effecently with my requirements.  I decided to have supper in the bar and although the staff were new  they again were attentive and the food was fine and came quickly. I was particularly grateful to one the waiters who went out of his way to help me as I was recovering from an operation on my hand and was unable to cut up
my food , he then kept watch and helped me with pepper mill and various other things I needed. Great service I look forward to my stay in the hotel.",4,2017,06,02
122,Mrs Ann Davies,We had a wonderful spacious suite with balcony. Staff were very helpful and friendly especially Paul the Concierge who delivered tickets by hand to us in the bar as he knew we were waiting for them. Excellent breakfast and lunch. Will be visiting again next time in the area.  ,5,2017,05,29
122,5 star?,"I like this place and the location having been a few times however this time around I'd need to question the service levels.

The rooms are great, the view are great, the food is great (you get the picture) however at breakfast we had to ask for toast when having full English (when isn't cheap), staff were scarce and when the admittedly new waitress brought the toast out she put it on an empty table which we ended up questioning. No jams offered...

The previous evening we dined casually out on the veranda as it was hot hot hot at 10.30pm, just a couple of pizzas but they were very good.

At checkout it felt like I had to wait a living age to pay as only one staff member on, in fairness it did seem the doorman went to the back room to usher more staff but it didn't work. On previous visits the hotel had staff in abundance who knew what they were doing. 

Maybe the new ownership/management isn't going so well?

For some reason I couldn't get the wifi to kick in either.",3,2017,05,29
122,Marina Suite!,"The room was very spacious, lovely views over the Marina with a good sized balcony. Reception staff were great and overall I lovely hotel. The bar service was abysmal, if I hadn't of known differently I might have thought that they had never worked in the hospitality business. Breakfast service was sadly no better, although the food was very nice. Choose this hotel for lovely rooms and location but do not expect top end service.",4,2017,05,29
122,Relaxing afternoon,Great breakfast with Lovely river view on a sunny day. Very busy with plenty of people mostly Chelsea locals. Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Will come back to try their Sunday brunch for my birthday in July.,5,2017,05,27
122,Slow service,"I went to the hotel's Harbour Bar & Terrace for birthday cocktail and lunch and left rather disappointed. We ordered 2 cocktails that took over half an hour to arrive! The service was too slow (even paying the bill involved a distracted bar tender). 

Notes from a wheelchair:
Hotel access is pretty good and the bar/terrace is roomy. To get to the bar you need to use a platform lift. In my opinion they could've installed a ramp. 

Disappointingly the waitress walked straight past me with our lunch (as if disabled people don't eat) and when the next table told her it wasn't their food (and only two tables full on the terrace) she disappeared! She later returned with her supervisor that must've told her it was my lunch after all (and that disabled people can and do order food by themselves)!

I'll think twice before returning to this bar!",2,2017,05,27
122,Great experience with a view ,Went with some friends who had recommended this place as a hidden gem. The terrace is beautiful overlooking the harbour with quaint boats docked aside expensive yachts. Just had drinks and did not sample any food as were going for dinner. We also had a lovely chat with Mahesh the hotel manager who told us about the spa. We are staying with friends nearby so will plan another visit to try their spa. ,5,2017,05,27
122,"Terrible service.  GM ignored issues and left, in front of me.","I am a guest here and I come in after a long day for a quick meal with a glass of wine.  After sitting at the bar for over 5 minutes with not even a hello from the staff, I left to speak with the manager.  As I was doing this, one of my associates had already asked for the manager, as he had waited over 30 minutes and had asked three times for a menu, which never came.  I asked to speak to the GM of the property.  The MOD went and spoke to the GM in the lobby, in front of me, per my request, but the GM boarded the elevator and left us standing.  In no way is the service at this property up to any standard of their star rating.  Inept, slow and not concerned service.  I left hungry, angry and with no resolution.  The MOD tried to help my associates and got them back into the lounge.  They ordered two Mojitos, and were served two margaritas.... really.  I was asked can they send up room service... with zero confidence in the staff to complete this task, I went to bed hungry... literally.  If you come here expecting bar and food services at night, then you will most likely be very let down and wonder why your paying for a premium hotel property. Avoid at all cost would be my recommendation.  Completely unacceptable, from top to bottom. I can not imaging a GM of a property getting on the elevator and leaving when a customer is asking, for two, to speak with him with timely issues.  I will look forward to speaking with corporate representatives.  Hopefully, this is not the corporate culture, but just a poor excuse of a micro-culture within this property.  AVOID this property.  There are too many other options in the wonderful city.",1,2017,05,26
122,"Afternoon Tea, You get what you pay for, this was terrible","I booked afternoon tea at Chelsea Harbour Hotel mainly because of it's location overlooking the Harbour I thought it would be very nice as a Birthday treat. I was somewhat surprised that it was only £22 per person but what a bonus...so I though as afternoon tea is usually more expensive. I booked online and I must say I was impressed with the list of dietary options available. There were 2 of us so I choose 1 person Pescatarian and 1 person Halal. 

When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted rather coldly by the Manager, I am assuming he was the Manager as he was the only staff member wearing a suit. He showed us to a table outside on the terrace it was such a lovely warm day...a rarity in the UK. He gave us the tea menu and asked us to choose, the tea arrived after about 5 - 10 minutes. When the tea arrived I asked whether our dietary options had been noted. No, they had not, so I explained what they were again. We then waited for about 45 minutes (which we felt was too long) for the selection of finger sandwiches, scones, petite fours etc... The waitress brought the selection to our table without explaining what the items were, she simply placed it on the table and left. 

The sandwiches were acceptable (I am trying to be generous) the vegetarian options on white bread were unworthy of finishing as the bread was stale so we left those. The scones were not fresh they were hard and cold. The pastries and petit fours were inedible very poor quality we literally could only stomach one bite of each thing we had to leave everything on the tray. I bit into a mini eclair and the cream was so rancid and off I spat it out into a napkin, I could not even digest it. There was a mousse served in a shot glass that neither of us dared to try because it was so stale looking and off colour around the edges...you know when dairy has been sat out not refrigerated or when it is off, it was exactly like that. 

The person I was with didn't want to make a fuss, as it was supposed to be a birthday treat, but we were hungry and unable to eat what had been presented so far so we decided to order something else from the lunch menu. We asked the Waiter Iveline if we could see the menu, he saw that we had not eaten anything from the afternoon tea but he said nothing to enquire about it. Then we waited and waited for the menu for about 30 minutes as Iveline had forgotten about it, he apologised when he eventually brought it to the table (bare in mind it was not at all busy), but by the time the menu arrived we were rather fed up and had lost confidence in the quality, we did not want to risk more substandard food so we just asked for a coffee instead.

Again we waited and waited for another 30 mins no coffees arrived, Iveline forgot again, so we just asked another waited for the bill, we decided to go and find another restaurant, we  paid and left, at least the coffees were not added to the bill. 

So in a nutshell...obviously now I know why the afternoon tea is only £22, it's because it is completely inedible, which is such as shame that this experience soured the Birthday treat. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, I'd actually go as far as to warn people against it. Hence this review.",1,2017,05,26
122,Very comfortable hotel but needs to improve bar and restaurant services,"A very comfortable hotel and a very quiet one by London standards. The suite although a little dated was very well appointed,clean and well stocked. Although we didn't see the room staff the room was beautifully presented on our return each evening. Front of house staff were very efficient and provided a good check in and out service. The main flaw was the disjointed service provided in both the bar and brasserie very nicely decorated areas but the staff seemed very confused and lacked some direction. The food we did manage to get was well prepared and nicely presented.
All in all a comfortable place to stay but could do better.",4,2017,05,25
122,Nice hotel but it didn't really hit the mark this time unfortunately...,"The hotel location is very good and the valet parking useful, reception staff were very friendly and efficient... The rooms were good over all and a good size however the service wasn't as expected from an hotel of this type. Breakfast was average quality but delays in service were ridiculous, a 45 minute wait that irritated more than a few guests. Also, the bar closed early and even as a group of residents you could not get a drink after this, paying this sort of money you would think that a member of staff could operate some degree of bar cover when 20 or so people have not finished their evening. Apparently not, so we had a choice of heading in to town, going to bed early or utilising the mini bar. We chose the latter and we ended up with an unofficial party in one room. Not ideal, far from it but we enjoyed a couple of drinks and were at least able to finish our evening less abruptly and remove some of the bad feeling that occurred after the announcement that the bar was closed and we couldn't even sit in the bar area... Any issues we or any of our guests incurred seemed to emanate from a general lack of staff, I doubt the hourly rate for staff would be of a major consideration considering the spend per head so I would suggest false economy over all if the issue is spend related. We have stayed at the Chelsea Harbour before and that was fine so we may apply benefit of the doubt and try it again to see if the issues were a one off. I would however be unable to recommended the Chelsea Harbour at this time to anyone else based on our last stay and the reasonable level of expectation that anyone would have in regard to booking a hotel of this type... Hope my comments are of use.",3,2017,05,24
122,Good Location and Well Presented..............,"We arrived at the hotel for our first visit and we were pleased we had booked to stay there.

The front of house staff did a very fine job of welcoming us and we were assisted to our room with a staff member bringing up the bags. The suite that we had been allocated  exceeded our expectations and we could not fault it in any way.

We had a couple of meals in the restaurant during our stay which overlooked Chelsea Harbour and again , we were very pleased with what was offered. Good food, well presented and at a reasonable price with a high level of customer service.

The only negative was when an older Indian guy who supposedly was the European Manager of the hotel chain was holding a meeting with the hotel staff in the restaurant and was abusing them, swearing at them and making guests within the restaurant feeling extremely uncomfortable. Suggest holding such meetings behind closed doors and not near the customers.

Other than that, a really good hotel to stay at and is highly recommended.",5,2017,05,22
122,Nice hotel but wrong for a spa break,"My friend and I booked in for a night away, primarily as a luxury spa break, in what I knew to be a nice area that was easy to get to by train for us.

I want to start by saying the staff were excellent throughout our stay - polite and very friendly - our waiter at afternoon tea couldn't have done more for us.  

We started with afternoon tea.  It wasn't the best afternoon tea I've ever had but certainly far from the worst.  Sandwiches were nice, scones were perfect, cakes weren't great but we were full anyway.  We had prosecco rather than bellinis.

We then checked into our room.  We'd paid a little extra to upgrade to one with a marina view and were so pleased with the suite they gave us.  Sitting room, bedroom, dressing room, bathroom with shower and WC, plus a separate WC room. The best bit was the balcony overlooking the marina - a sun trap in the morning.  Can't fault the room in any way.

We were however very disappointed with the spa even though there was nothing wrong with it per se.  It just wasn't the type of spa you go to relax on loungers with friends - in fact I couldn't imagine spending a day there (as I've done in many other places) - so we were pleased we'd done the afternoon tea instead of getting down there any earlier or booking treatments.  There were some loungers but they were occupied, there was no jacuzzi.  While there was a very small sauna and very small steam room, they were in a corner of the ladies' changing room and were uncomfortably hot.  We did eventually get some loungers but the noise of the kids in the pool didn't really aid the relaxation.

We had expected to find a bar or restaurant in short walking distance to the hotel but we didn't find anything so ended up in the hotel bar having some food and drinks.  It  was fine, but pricey considering it wasn't anything special.  The bar was quiet when we arrived but empty by the time we'd finished.  So we just went to our room and had an early night.  We decided against going for breakfast as felt it would just be more of the same.  

Location wise - it was a beautiful setting, just so so quiet, so lacked atmosphere.  

Overall it had a very 4* hotel feel rather than 5*.  But was substantially cheaper than the other 5* alternatives I'd looked at, so it wasn't an issue.  Would we go back?  Probably not, unless I had to be in Fulham for another reason and just wanted somewhere nice and clean to stay overnight.",4,2017,05,22
122,Lunch on the terrace,"The terrace overlooking the Chelsea Harbour marina is a lovely place to sit and have a drink or some food from the bar menu. We were disappointed at the complete lack of staff clearing tables though and every empty table was littered with cups, glasses and plates. We took glasses of wine out from the bar and we had been sitting for a good 25 minutes before a waiter came and asked if we ""minded"" if he cleared it, although we had pushed it to the other end of the table and it clearly wasn't ours!

We ordered the vegetarian club sandwiches and more drinks and the bar staff are very friendly and the service was prompt. The sandwiches were delicious and well presented- the accompanying chips were yummy. 

It's a beautiful, peaceful spot to relax. The pianist in the bar/restaurant area is very good and the decor of the hotel is luxurious and welcoming. 

",4,2017,05,22
122,High servicelevel and perfect Location ,"Good experience due to the high servicelevel and the staff personality in the reception, nice room with balcony and a great look to Chelsea Harbour, and a super location in the heart of Chelsea, London. ",4,2017,05,19
122,What have you done to this beautiful place ,"Actually don't know where to begin, what has happening to this hotel this year? I have stayed quite a few times at this beautiful property it's like an oasis in London. The staff have always be attentive and friendly which I expect in this level of hotel that is what I am paying for, to feel special . Now it's like where have all the staff gone!! Huge changeover of staff and it shows, the hotel looks dirty and tired you don't expect it from a 5 star property, I was not even greeted on arrival. it's like cut backs have been made this year.  Don't have this service in their Singapore hotels.

All the old friendly staff have left, when I was checking in there was an older Indian gentleman talking extremely rudely to everyone including guests stating it was his hotel and if they didn't like it they could go. Well to be frank if that's the attitude of the new management they I will not be returning. 

Seen the same sort of scenario at breakfast of staff being shouted at in front of guests. NOT FIVE STAR

Rooms are good and spacious at the property balcony and windows needed cleaning, room service took forever, reception unwelcoming, no toiletries in the bathroom 

Dare not complain may of been evicted ... once the dream hotel to stay in London, but will not be giving it a wide berth sadly 

",1,2017,05,18
122,Shocking staff on the door,"Absolutely shocked by the unhelpful attitude I had to put up with on arrival. I was arriving for business and the first person I was greeted by was one of the rudest most condescending hotel staff I have ever met in London (and I regularly visit all the 5 star venues). The first person to greet you as you drive up (I believe his name was Abdu) offered parking for £25 or told me to go away and park in the NCP. Then I asked if I could unload my valuable equipment into the hotel and he told me to leave it on the sidewalk. As I was doing this another door man came over to help which was nice, and I said to him I would like my car parked and could I pay by card - to which he replied yes...but then we don't get anything out of it?! He shouted over to 'A' saying this and A shouted at me gesticulating wildly, ""look around lady there's no parking!"" This is after offering to park my car not a minute before. 

As a first impression of a 5 star hotel it's completely shocking, making my evening harder and being treated in such a rude manner. I can only assume they are only interested in pocketing the cash they get, they are clearly not at all interested in providing a good service. 

Once through the door the other staff are delightful but it's a complete shambles before you make it in there and I would never confidently hold a business meeting here or recommend the hotel for events for fear of clients being treated so rudely on arrival.",1,2017,05,12
122,Fantastic Hotel with beautiful decor ,Lovely helpful staff at the reception. Beautifully designed. Flowers everywhere when you walk in. Room niece and big with nice bathroom. One problem I couldn't make coffee maker to work :(  Tv in both rooms. ,5,2017,05,09
122,5 star service at recpetion,"I rang up the reception with some questions on the hotel and room I was looking to book for my anniversary as well some questions on becoming a member of the millennium hotel group. I spoke to an amazing lady called lyche at reception who was incredibly helpful and very accommodating with all my requests In regards to making it a very special stay. 5 star service and a glowing example of customer service. Needless to say I registered as a member and booked the room immediately. It will be my first trip to the chelsea harbour hotel and am looking forward to my visit.

Steve G",5,2017,05,08
122,nice if you have a balcony,Dining service is very slow and rude if you dont want exactly what the menu says even though I wanted stuff left off and not added for the same price. No power points for charging near the bed or sofa which was highly inconvenient  and I have NEVER come across that before. The lighting in the room was just awful and instructions in pictures for coffee machine were not only worse than ikea but couldn't see them properly in the terrible lighting. Doorman ignored you if you didn't arrive in a luxury car,3,2017,05,07
122,Afternoon tea with a view ,"Had a lovely afternoon tea, a fabulous selection of sandwiches, scones and cakes.  The bellini cocktail was delicious and refreshing.   Service wasn't the best tea instead of coffee and very very slow....  40 minute wait.   It was a delightful treat all the same.  ",4,2017,05,01
122,Great afternoon tea !,Had a lovely afternoon tea with my mother. Staff were very polite and found us a table by the window with a lovely view overlooking the marina. The cakes were delicious and the tea hot to the last drop. We were on a groupon offer including a Bellini cocktail. Highly recommended it ! ,5,2017,04,30
122,Afternoon tea ,"What a wonderful afternoon, such a great mothers day. They accommodated our large table very well. We were concerned as the service was quite slow, until all the plates came of beautifully crafted cakes and amazing freshly baked scones! Then we realised why! It was certainly worth the wait! 

:-) ",5,2017,04,28
122,Enjoyable Overnight Stay,My wife and I were in London for one night to attend a concert in Chelsea.  This hotel was a short walk from the venue and so it was an ideal place to stay.  We upgraded to a suite which looked over the harbour and it was definitely worth it.  The views from the balcony were great.  The suite was spacious and the shower was particularly good.  The staff were friendly and welcoming.  I would definitely stay here again.,4,2017,04,28
122,"Beautiful hotel along the Thames river in London, England.","We stayed at the hotel in December prior to our flight home. The bar area was beautiful, and the rooms were very clean, well designed, and comfortable. This hotel was a bit difficult for us to locate since we are not familiar with the London area, but it is definitely worth the trip. We had room service for breakfast, and though it was a bit pricey; it was worth it for the convenience, and made our departure less stressful. Also the quality and quantity was fare for what we ordered.",5,2017,04,28
122,Not 5* in Any Way ,"After what should be a great London break left feeling deflated. 
This hotel is should not be classed as 5*. 

From the start of the arrival the valet was unsure to ask us if we wanted the car parking, no one came to take our bags. 

We called up and added an additional person to our room prior and upon arrival no bed was ready no extra towels, dressing gown or water. 
We had traveled down from Manchester at 5am for a conference and wanted a power nap before heading into central to watch a show. This wasn't possible due to all the faffing! 

The wifi didn't connect in any location. Phone or laptop- 
Called up at 8am to reception who passed my call over and no body answered the phone! I tired three times and gave up after an hour. 
This left me unable to work due to no help in assisting in getting internet on my laptop! What a joke! 

To ease the frustration we decided to go to the spa and have a swim and sauna. The receptionist was nowhere to be seen and when  found her it was clear she hated her job from her attitude. In the changing room there was dirty towels left on the shower floor. the steam steamroom was out of action. After a quick swim when we came to shower the shower door would not shut! Had quickest shower of your life and hope no one walked past! 
There were no plastic bags to put your wet swimsuit in. 

It is such a shame or experience was not up to scratch, as the location is perfect. 

This hotel really is not up to five star standards unfortunately. 

",1,2017,04,27
122,Afternoon Tea,"Visited on Saturday for afternoon tea, lovely service and the waiter James was splendid nothing was to much trouble. Beautiful view of the harbour and the hotel was very clean. My only dislike was the sandwiches I don't eat cream cheese or salmon would of preferred tuna or egg. But all in all the afternoon was lovely. ",4,2017,04,25
122,Overnight stay,"I bought an overnight stay for my husband's birthday hoping to see some of the Chelsea team players but didn't see any but never mind.
I paid extra for the marina view suite which didn't disappoint the view on a very bright spring morning was amazing. Couldn't fault anything there, we had bathrobes but no Slippers which was odd. 
We had a meal there late in the evening which was very nice but bit expensive.  
The staff were very welcoming and happy to help. 
The suites are very comfortable and roomy, also came with a balcony.  If you want luxury then this is the place to go.",5,2017,04,23
122,Nothing but Positive!,"Checked in early and this wasn't an issue even when it states check in is 3pm, upgraded to a harbour view and was not disappointed. The rooms are immaculate, the room has two bathrooms, a sitting/lounge area with tea and coffee facilities with a coffee machine, a mini fridge, safe, wine and goodies. It also has a balcony of its own and of course the bedroom, the bedroom its self is of a very good size. 

The room was spotless not a bad word to say about it, very clean and very spacious. The balcony is also of a good size fitting two chairs and table. The view of the harbour is something of its own, id recommend paying that little bit extra for this. 

The staff are very polite, friendly, well mannered and know how to treat guests. I believe the woman who helped us out whilst staying here was called 'lychee' credit to her, thank you! The concierge was very polite always had a smile on his face greeted us every morning, didn't catch his name! 

We ordered both room service in the evening and breakfast alongside eating in the restaurant one night, again nothing to fault the food is delicious, the prices are very fair and decent for a 5* hotel, very good value for money! The only thing to comment on is that Room Service isn't that much more expensive as a 12.5% charge for room service and in the restaurant is added either way, not complaining as again very good price for what you get! 

Hotel is a couple of minutes walk to the bus stop and the tube, isn't much around the hotel however just the view is worth it. There is a shop just seconds away from the hotel. Since we loved it that much we will be returning again in October, already can't wait to be back! ",5,2017,04,14
122,Great birthday treat ,"This hotel is amazing was very surprised when checking in to see how spacious the rooms were we have a sitting room, a huge bedroom with nice closet and a huge mirror especially good for applying make up. The bathroom was lovely two sinks and was decorated lovely. On arrival the chefs at the hotel had sent me a chocolate cake spelling happy birthday which was lovely. The spa facilities are lovely the swimming pool was a dream in the morning would definitely recommend staying here the location is perfect as well looking out at the harbour at night and being not to far away from shops and bars. If your looking at this hotel don't just look book it!!!",5,2017,04,13
122,A pretty view of a collection of eclectic boats,"Great location with its own dock great ambiance 
Big hotel most staff seem to guess what you want as their English is not their native tongue but that's fine it adds to the charm
I ordered on the heated outside terrace a vanilla and chocolate ice cream desert it came in two seperate bowls 
His face when I put the vanilla in with the chocolate and gave him the bowl back was a treat!!!

122,Convienent Location to Putney Embankment,"Suite style hotel which was very comfortable and clean.  My suite overlooked the harbour with a balcony.  The suites were spacious, one bedroom, and one living room with a pull out couch and two bathrooms. The sheets and pillows were great.

The staff was helpful and the breakfast was good with many choices. I would stay here again.

No electric outlets near the bedside table so had to charge my phone across the room which was inconvenient.",4,2017,04,10
122,Afternoon Tea,Went with family on weekday afternoon.Staff so helpful very attentive offered to take photos for us and kept filling up the teapot. Cocktails pretty amazing very chilled atmosphere definitely go again.,5,2017,04,09
122,My 18th ,My family of nine came in for afternoon tea and I honestly couldn't think of a better way to have spent my 18th birthday. The food was fantastic and so well presented. It also was really good value for money. The only thing better then the food was the service that we received. The staff were so helpful and nothing was to much bother. They were so pleasant and we couldn't fault them at all.  We can't wait to come back and next time maybe stay overnight. ,5,2017,04,05
122,"Great view, Poor facilities.","After booking through there website I stated that it was my partners birthday and us becoming newly engaged and if they could add petals to the bed and empty out the fridge for a cake I had bought, upon going into the room my request was ignored which was annoying. 
We stayed in the double marina suite, the view was lovely throughout the day and night however for the price and location of the hotel the room was very outdated. 
When going into the bedroom and trying to find somewhere to charge our phones and plug a laptop in apart from the plug for the television there was NO plugs in the bedroom at all which was so inconvenient and to be honest ridiculous. 
During the night the bedroom got soo stuffy and hot even though all heating facilities were turned off, which resulted in a uncomfortable sleep. 
Overall me and my partner was very disappointed with our stay as we had such high expectations of it, if you are planning on staying here i recommend marina suite which includes a balcony as it was the only bonus.",3,2017,04,04
122,"Great hotel, fantastic value for money...","...but repeated (second time this has happened) scam to charge additional mini bar items if you take a single item. Even after repeated requests to resolve no response. Worth staying at this central London hotel for the value it provides, just keep clear of the mini-bar!!",2,2017,04,03
122,Great stay,"Great hotel with spacious rooms. Staff friendly and welcoming.

Peaceful location away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Views over harbour and river great.

Food good and bar area is nice to sit in.",5,2017,04,01
122,Nice stay,"Hotel with great location and nice views to the harbor. Very spacious rooms, comfortable beds, slept very well. But - as for business traveller - WiFi connection in the room was poor. Breakfast was good, but service was very far from expectations for 5* hotel.  Waiters somehow were able to ignore quests, we had to wait to be served more than 20 minutes in the morning.",4,2017,03,31
122,Superb,"Beautiful Hotel in the heart of London. Very scenic around the harbour pier and away from the main hustle which makes it suitable for a business meeting with nice food. 
Friendly staff, good service. Rooms are clean, and designed very well. 
Recommend to anyone staying in and around this area or looking for a meeting space. ",5,2017,03,29
122,Lots of fannying around but don't come to the mark,"Another 5 star hotel that over promises and under delivered 
Don't get me wrong , the staff are lovely and talk the talk, but when it comes to it it's the little things that make the difference 
For example room service food was rank. Also it was cold . Ok ...it was only burger and fries but at £15 I would expect it to be warm and not cold 
I would also expect it to come with some kind of relish or sauce 
When pointing this out I had to wait another 10 mins before giving up
Then I opened a bottle of wine and there were no wine glasses
In the morning there was no milk for the coffee

Yes all very picky but it's what you pay that extra bit for don't you ?",3,2017,03,29
122,A superb stay ,"Upon arrival we was greeted by smiles from the staff. Once checked into our room, we realised we didn't have a room overlooking the harbour as we were based on the ground floor. When we highlighted this to reception, Patrick was very accommodating and happy to make the adjustments for the transition nearer to the top floor. In addition, complimentary champagne and chocolate was presented for the inconvenience. 
The rooms at the hotel are very spacious and offers two WCs, a contemporary bathroom, a very comfortable bed and stunning views over looking the London skyline. The swimming pool is modern and decently sized, whilst the spa facilities offers a calm, relaxing environment that I would definitely recommend. 
The bar in the lounge is perfect for unwinding in the evening as it over looks onto the water. Breakfast offers a vast selection and tastes delicious. 
This hotel is an excellent stay and the hospitality service can not be faulted. ",5,2017,03,23
122,lovely stay,"i like the Hotel and the Location is great for me and very quiet . the suit is big and very comfortable . there spa is quite reasonable . there services is good and the food is normal , i think it is a great experience to feel just like home",5,2017,03,20
122,Sunday Treat ,"We stayed here for 1 night as we had a boat trip organised on Sunday afternoon but didn't want to be in a busy part of town. It's very quite in the area & our suite overlooking the harbour was pleasant. A few minor points would have given a higher rating however...The Coffee & Tea in the room should be better quality to match this type of hotel i.e ditch the Tassimo & get Nespresso units, Twinings would be better than PG,  Also there was not enough milk available. The towles are somewhat rough & should be better quality but apart from these small obviavations we had a lovely stay. Would definitely  recommend if you want a quite location in town by the Thames. ",4,2017,03,20
122,Husbands birthday ,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my husbands birthday and also our wedding anniversary , having only ever stayed at London Me or the Sanderson as we have 6 children we can only get 2 nights away on our own husbands and my birthday so we do like to stay in a lovely hotel !! Was nervous that it would not live up to the other 2 hotels but wanted to try someone new !! Had no need to be worried at all absolutely loved this hotel we got upgraded room as a birthday surprise from the lovely lady on reception which made our stay Evan more fantastic the room was beautiful , was so impressed that 2 days after we came home we booked the hotel up for my birthday in April , can't wait to return on 21st I'm on countdown for another lovely stay would recommend this hotel to anyone  ",5,2017,03,18

Have to leave at 4.45pm to meet clients at Chelsea football tonight and I'm sitting in the bar waiting for someone to tell me when my room will be ready. Not impressed. Will be a very quick shower and change. Had upgraded to marina view - what a waste, won't get time to see it!! Now 4.30m and none the wiser. Disappointed 😞",1,2017,03,13
122,Delightful location,"We visited the Brasserie for breakfast on a Sunday. The staff were very attentive and charming. The food was well presented
Having a window seat was a bonus, looking over the small marina, and the activity therein.
Hope to visit again soon, on the last Sunday of the month they have a brunch organised should be good.",5,2017,03,13
122,Impossible to sleep!,"This is a beautiful hotel. The suites are spacious and comfortable, we had a concrete view but we knew when we booked that it wasn't a harbour view. The staff are friendly and efficient. The spa facilities are nice and the massage was great. We didn't eat here because £23.00 for an English breakfast is extortionate and we went out in the evening as there are plenty of bars and restaurants on the Kings road. The main complaint we had was that at night the bedroom was so hot it was impossible to sleep! We had twin beds and we had the air conditioning as low as possible but the thermostat was indicating the temperature at 25 degrees! There is no way if opening the windows so we had a restless uncomfortable night. The air conditioning system needs a complete overhaul. For this reason we will not visit this hotel again which is a shame because it had a lot of really good features.",3,2017,03,12
122,Saturday Night Stay,"Had a fantastic stay at the Chelsea Harbour, stayed in a Marina Suite having booked through Secret Escapes. The room was fabulous with a lovely view over the Marina. The breakfast which was included was lovely. We also ate in the Brazzerie Resturant where the food was superb,guests benefit from 20% Discount. You can park on street on a Saturday from 1830Hrs - All day Sunday for free. Really is something special. Staff were so accomodating and friendly to.",5,2017,03,12

The hotel is located alongside the Thames within a stones throw of the London water bus which gets you quickly and scenically into London centre. We stayed in a King Suite which was huge, amazing bed, large separate lounge with balcony, with the baby having a lot of space to lounge around was fantastic. I would stay again!",5,2017,03,10
122,Great Hotel,"Overnight stay

122,Brilliant Conference Venue in London,"I ran an event at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel today.  It is a fantastic venue, the conference team, in particular Patricia was knowledgeable, efficient and communicative from start to finish.  The staff on-site looking after our needs on the day, Fernando and Mohammed were completely focussed on our needs and those of our guests.  The suite used was light and well appointed and the food was of the highest quality.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this venue to anyone.",5,2017,03,01
122,A beautiful harbourside hotel,"We were staying at the sister hotel Copthorne Tara, and were moved here due to a technical problem.  We stayed in a beautiful king sized suite with everything we needed including mini bar and coffee pod making machine.  Very spacious and comfortable.  Parking was just offsite and private and the nearest tube a 10 minute easy walk.  Breakfast was tasty.  Staff were very pleasant and welcoming, thank you we had a lovely stay.",5,2017,02,28
122,Home away from home,"Always stunning coming back to Chelsea harbour Hotel. Always well received! Paul , the doorman and all the staff provide best service . Harbour view room with views of the Thames. So serene! So spacious too.  ",5,2017,02,28
122,Very nice hotel spoilt by Food and Beverage,"After checking into this 5 star hotel, for our wedding anniversary weekend,  with very pleasant and helpful reception staff we went to our suite ( not accompanied ).  The suite was very good, well equipped and three spacious rooms.
We decided to eat in the brasserie after reading the hotels website.  A fairly empty restaurant we were asked if we had booking , and a big deal of looking to find a table then took place.
Sat at the table fo about 15 minutes before the waiter apologised and took our order.  Drinks arrived, so far so good !   After another 20 mins our starter arrived, deep fried calamari and prawns with a dish of tartare sauce.  The fish was well over cooked and the calamari was inedible, hard , dry difficult to chew.  This we returned as not acceptable,we had waited so long we decided to cancel the main course and leave the restaurant.   We then attempted to find food in the hotel, but no other restaurant !  We set to complain to the duty manager, who obviously had not been trained to deal with a complaint.  The restaurant manager offered us a burger or a pizza in the bar !  Eventually we agreed to have the main course sent up to our suite.  Review of those two dishes would take another page.!
As a 5 star hotel the food and beverage department clearly needs attention.  I would not expect the sort of standard in a three star hotel.
A very pleasant and decent hotel who's reputation is being ruined by the standard of Food and beverage operations.  Perhaps a better quality Chef ?",3,2017,02,27
122,One night in London to attend a celebration,Stayed for one night to attend a celebration.   The Hotel is good as near the Chelsea Harbour car park and when visiting this part of London.   Suite was clean and good coffee machine but the bathroom needs an upgrade for the shower head and trying to get hot water for a bath.   Check out also needed a person who knew what they were doing but otherwise a good stay.,4,2017,02,24
122,Amazing staff..excellent food,"I stayed with my friend for one night in this amazing hotel. The view was very good, the room was very comfortable and   the reception staff was very friendly and everything was perfect.
We had dinner in the lounge bar and the food was very tasty and the service was excellent.
The bartender Trajce was amazing, so friendly and very very good. Thanks to him we felt like home because of his amazing behaviour. We tried some cocktails, probably the best that we've ever had and then he  offered us one of the best wine and the best service in a very long time. A big thank you to Vlaad as well which  was very nice and funny. 
They put a smile on our face in a very sad day!!
Thank you very much to everyone.
I will definitely stay in this hotel again!",5,2017,02,19
122,Fantastic hotel ,We often stay here when visiting London. It's a luxury hotel with great rooms and views. The service is excellent. The new New Year's Eve parties and wonderful and we will all be returning on our next visit to london. ,5,2017,02,18
122,Afternoon Tea,"Visited on a Friday for Afternoon Tea.  We were the only people in the restaurant, which was a little off-putting at first, but it was absolutely lovely.  The welcome received from the staff was friendly and genuine and the service was impeccable.  The tea itself consisted on 4 finger sandwiches each, 2 large scones (one with chocolate on top) with clotted cream and jam, and a selection of chocolate desserts.  For my personal taste there was too much chocolate (I know, can there ever be too much?!) but it was still a very enjoyable tea and reasonably priced.  We were seated in the best table (imho), a round table right in the middle by the window overlooking the harbour.  As dusk fell it was lovely when the lights came on but I would imagine it is fantastic to sit there in the summer and people watch.
We arrived via Imperial Wharf station and walked the long way round to the hotel - however you can nip through the car park which is right opposite the station and up the stairs and you come out just opposite the entrance to the hotel.
We found a groupon voucher for our afternoon tea, but even without it would still be good value at £18.",5,2017,02,18
122,High standard hotel ,"We stayed for one night in a marina view suite. From the front I don't think the hotel looks 5 star at all, it looks dated and a little tired, however as soon as you step inside it completely transforms into a classy and contemporary reception. Check in was smooth and quick, we even managed to check in early as we had treatments booked on the spa before check in. 
Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a lovely comfy king size bed. Was nice to have two bathrooms, and defiantly had an apartment feel to it, plenty of closet space, with robes & slippers included as you would expect from a 5* hotel. we were on the first floor so we didn't have a great view of the marina at all due to the roof from the restaurant and bar below coming right out and obscuring the view, this didn't bother me too much, it would of possibly though if We were staying longer, if you want a view request a higher floor.
We had spa treatments which were excellent, the pool is nice, the only thing I didn't like was the fact me and my husband couldn't use the Steam room and sauna together as they have separate ones for male/females. If I'd known this it may of affected If id booked here or not.
I used the gym which has good equipment in, a little on the small side and you may struggle if it gets busy but it was quiet when I used it in the afternoon and again the following morning.
We didn't have breakfast here due to easing the reviews on here of it being over priced, we walked towards kings road and there are plenty of places to eat for a fraction of the price. We paid £40 to park our car, and we were able to keep it there the following day until we can back from the Kings road to go home at 2pm 
All the staff we came in contact with were all extremely helpful and polite. It's a really nice hotel and I would stay here again.

122,Spa And Massage,"Spa and Massage for two was so delightful and relaxing, the spa and swimming pool is beautiful and calming with great staff (all are beautiful by the way) all well mannered and well presented. The massage rooms were also beautiful, smelt delicious and set you in the mood for deep relaxation.",4,2017,02,15
122,Slow decline,"Used to visit this hotel regularly when it was a Conrad Hotel. My last visit only served to underline the decline in standards; cold food, no in room entertainment (it was broken) and what appears to be a stretched work force. ",3,2017,02,15
122,just returned from a wonderful weekend in chelsea.,"Our weekend was won in a charity raffle and initially it was difficult to book via email as many agents replied to emails that had not read previous emails, eventually all was confirmed. upon arrival we were greeted by consiage and escorted into the hotel whilst he parked our vehicle. (£40 per night, this was advised on asking agents) our bags were carried for us and check in was easy. chelsea suite was spacious and cleaned to a high standard. Breakfast was also a good experience as waitress was very attentive. Spa was well managed with lovely staff too. overall all staf were very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,02,12
122,Great stay,"Booked for overnight stay in London which was a very easy process.
Staff were attentive and they valet parked my wife's car as she arrived before me.
Room was a suite and very spacious and extremely comfortable. Ordered room service breakfast which was delivered at the time requested.
Only downside was lack of water for bath / shower.",5,2017,02,12
122,"Nice hotel ,but very overpriced,rude and impersonal! ","The hotel itself looks great, was very impressed by the architecture and the finesse of all the hotel and surroundings.
The staff on the other side, reception and concierge was polite and professional, but the f&b department was a big disappointment! Starting with the manager which was always rude to me and my family! As if he wont care about this business! ",2,2017,02,07
122,Be prepared to pay extra for everything save from oxygen,"First impressions, to me,count for a lot. As a travel blogger, I've visited many hotels across the world, and when I booked this hotel for my Mum for a birthday treat, I went all out expecting this to be an amazing experience. 

The first impression of the hotel itself was impressive. The harbour really is a beautiful setting. When we arrived, the helpful doorman directed us to a car park which isn't run by the hotel. This meant, after paying £317 for the room, we were then stung for around £35 in car parking charges. 

You would think, somewhere that advertises on every single booking website that it has parking would actually have parking, but no, and none of the reception staff were particularly bothered that before we had even stepped into the room, the experience had now cost me £350.

The room was lovely - we booked a marina suite, and you couldn't fault the view at all. The bathroom and the bedroom were incredibly cosy, and the living room was a nice addition. 

Because we had booked this as something of a chill out night, we expected to spend a long time in the spa. Unfortunately when we arrived, the spa was an experience that was quite underwhelming.No jacuzzi, cold pool, very tiny sauna and steam room. The best part of the spa is actually the relaxation room, which just goes to show how mediocre the rest of the spa was. For something that costs so much, I expected a lot more. you can book a nice spa hotel in the Essex countryside for a fraction of the price. 

We decided to come back to the room as the choice between the icy pool and the tiny sauna was too much. This benefited me actually, as I was hoping to catch up on some work and make use of the living room desk while my Mum relaxed and watched TV.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that the WiFi signal is probably better in the middle of the Andaman sea, I couldn't do this. 

Another thing that was 'included' in the room rate was breakfast. So after having no luck with the 'parking' and no luck with the 'wifi' that was advertised as being included, I decided that there was no possible way that the third thing that Chelsea harbour had promised me could go amiss. 

Wandering down to breakfast in the morning, we were impressed with the views of the harbour from the restaurant. What we were not impressed by, were the extra charges levied on most of the food you actually want for breakfast.

Honestly, the best bit about this experience was the room, and even that wasn't so fantastically amazing that I would stay again. I honestly feel like I wasted money.

I could of booked a cheap weekend abroad for the money I paid for this one room, and it really wasn't worth it.",3,2017,02,05
122,Lovely hotel but unhappy with booking confirmation ,"Hotel was booked by calling directly, I asked for a double room with
Breakfast. The lady told
Me that the only rooms left were
Marina view rooms which was fine and she took all my details and payment. I asked once again to make sure it was a double room with breakfast.

We arrived at the hotel at midday and our room was ready. The receptionist said she had upgraded us so we went to our room on the 6th floor.
It wasn't an upgrade it was the room I had booked!
The room itself was lovely, each room at the hotel is a suite so there is a bedroom and living room, it was very clean and spacious. A great view of the marina and the city in the distance.
The bar is nice and the food that people were eating looked very good too.
In the morning my wife and I went down too breakfast, gave our room number and were seated by the window with a nice view. As we had eaten quite late the night before we were not that hungry so just had coffee and a croissant each but there was a good selection available.

On checking out I was presented a bill for £39.40 and when asked what it was for I was told breakfast! I questioned it but was told that the room didn't include breakfast! On booking I had double checked that breakfast was included and had I known in the morning that I was going to be charged I would of just made a coffee in the room! Having paid over £200 for the room it was a little disappointing to be charged for coffee and dissapointing that when we went for breakfast the staff didn't mention that we would be charged! 

If people are booking direct with the hotel over the phone then ask them to send a confirmation rather than just a reference number over the phone. 

",4,2017,02,04
122,"clammy and stifled, hard as a rock","£200+ per night twin suite, yet the air conditioning blowing hot air not cold and of course no windows that can open meant a stuffy airless night in Chelsea. 
The couch in the suite was as unforgiving as my missus and the t.v tiny with no movies unless of course you pay for them. There were finger print marks all over the shiny surfaces and a firm bed meant this was little comfort at all for a premium hotel. 
The website did not explain how and where to park, but on arrival the option was valet £40 for night! or drive 5 minutes round the corner to a subterranean option of a tenner less. Breakfast was £20 extra, I didn't opt for it because after night in this hot, clammy stuffy clip joint I needed to come out for air.  
Not rated at all I'm afraid.",2,2017,01,28
122,Spot on!,"Great hotel! Rooms and decor are to a very high standard. Food - first rate and service to match!, Staff - helpful, flexible professionals who just cant do enough to make your stay/event go well. I was really impressed and wouldnt hesitate to go back there again!",5,2017,01,27
122,Buffet wedding party,"Being regular visitors to the hotel, we decided to use the monthly Sunday buffet for our party. It is the best food and the biggest variety that I have had at any wedding, and several guests have been back since. The added attraction is that unlimited buck's fizz or prosecco comes in the price.

you just have to try it, the whole fresh salmon is wonderful, and there is whole lobster and crab, plus roasts and lots of salads, smoked salmon shrimps etc.

There is a large offering of delicious desserts which are totally irresistible plus cheese.

Service is impeccable. Make sure you reserve!",5,2017,01,14
122,Great place all round,"I love this hotel, having stayed here 6 times I've always had a great time.
Great rooms, good staff, nice bar and excellent location.
Close to kings road and all the brilliant resteraunts and bars.
Top place to stay!",5,2017,01,14
122,Works free stay,"I won this 2 night holiday treat from work and I have to say this place is brilliant. We stayed in room 517 which was a Chelsea suite and it had everything that we needed for a couples weekend! The bed was super comfy and we were given free water and a coffee machine in our room which made my weekend. On our first evening we ate in the bar an as you can see from our pictures the view is amazing, we spent the evening in pure bliss watching a couple live life on their yacht! The bar staff were amazing and allowed me to choose food from the restaurant. I would recommend the Petto dipollo al forno OVEN ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST, HARRISSA, SAFFRON QUINOA SALAD AND PUMPKIN SEED for £18.00 this was delicious especially for someone who doesn't usually experiment! On our second day we took a venture out to winter wonderland and whatever you do do not get a black cab to the city always order an über, this cost us £8 on the return instead of £30 on the way which if we had of known would have saved us £22. The only down side to this hotel is that the men and woman's sauna and steam room are separate from eachother however on a whole the hotel is great and all t he staff are friendly! We left our tooth past at home and we were given a free little tube by a nice man on the reception and as you can see from my picture it's the little things like that that make your holiday! If anyone requires anything at night from a shop there is a Tesco approx 10/15 walk away which was ideal for a couple who would forget their heads if they weren't screwed on. ",5,2017,01,07
122,Birthday getaway ,Myself and hubby stayed here for a weekend getaway. It was lovely. We stayed in Marina View room. Beautiful Marina view from the window. Big spacious room and lovely bath with fluffy robes and slippers. I felt really pampered . We ordered breakfast with room service and it was amazing. Brought in a big trolley with fresh tea and coffee and fruits. We were able to eat in our room at our own pace. The food was more than enough for both of us. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic getaway .,5,2017,01,03
122,Fabulous stay,"Went for New Years Eve
Fabulous room -lovely large suite on 3rd floor,no noise
Great room service 
Staff very nice
Great breakfast -good choice and well presented 
Security staff very professional 
Hope to return 
Would recommend",5,2017,01,01
122,Not ideal for central London,"We booked a lastminute.com late deal and took a chance as we have never stayed in this part of town previously. The hotel is located in an area which has and continues to enjoy huge urban renewal. On arrival it was disappointing to be told that we would be getting twin beds as that was all they had. So much for a romantic weekend! The rooms are laid out as suites. The room had more of a short-let vacation accommodation feel than a luxury 5-star guest room environment.

The hotel itself is nice and staff are keen to please but don't stay here if you are expecting a simple train ride into and from central London. Chelsea Harbour overground station closes before midnight (at the weekend!) so you could be left contemplating how to get back if you stay in town to see a late show. 

Also, although modern and spacious, I would rate this place a high-end 4-star. There are a few niggly things that impact the overall atmosphere - including the lack of adequate sound-proofing (we could hear every conversation from either side of us - even with TV on). It is also just a little too far off the beaten path to stroll anywhere with much activity to speak of.",4,2016,12,30
122,Good but not great,"Good hotel. No major complaints. Friendly reception, concierge and door. Bar ok but not very efficient. 

For an upmarket hotel it took way too long to be served. 

Room-suite comfortable and well maintained - but it missed the finishing touches - water not replenished, flannels not replaced, etc.

Massage good but involved journey up cold service-elevator in bathrobe. Masseuse was a little late and apologised.
 
Hotel is expensive - probably the norm for London. I would not rally against this hotel, but it is certainly not spectacular.",4,2016,12,27
122,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,I came to the Chelsea Harbour hotel for afternoon tea and I cannot stress enough how amazing it was!! The staff are so amazingly helpful and the afternoon tea was beautiful! You can see the whole of the harbour from the window and I can't wait to return.. Would highly recommend!,5,2016,12,25
122,Nice place to stay in Chelsea,"Very good spot at the end of the Kings road in the heart of Chelsea .The hotel is modern .good parking .staff good and attentive.
The rooms are all suites .we had a room on the 7th floor overlooking the boat moorings.
You could see up the river to the london eye at Westminster.
Breakfast was good .
We visited the spa and had lovely masssages .",4,2016,12,24
122,Service and good views,"Stayed in hotel for 3 days with my wife and 2 children in a marina Suite.
Large room with both bedroom and living room.  Plenty of space and very good amenities.
The view to the harbour and Thames is very good.
Pool in the basement is also worth a visit

The area is very quit but still close to the shops in Chelsea

Very close to Imperial Wharf overground station so can easily get around.
Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,23
122,Dinner only,"We were here for a group dinner Christmas night out  the week before Christmas.  we only used the restaurant and were not staying at the hotel.  
Dinner was expensive but decidedly average - at best. Side dishes eventually arrived when most of us had finished our meal.  Staff kept saying  - ""it's just coming"" -  but we either had to eat a cold meal or wait for the potatoes and veg to arrive!  We were just about the only people in the restaurant so business could not be the problem.",2,2016,12,19
122,50 th birthday celebration ,"It was my friends 50 th birthday . We stayed at the Chelsea harbour hotel . We had two beautiful suites. One was upgraded to a larger suite over looking the harbour which was wonderful . In both suites we found complementary birthday cake which was a lovely touch . 
The hotel had a wonderfully serene and tranquil feel . All the staff were attentive and efficient . In particular Lara and Peter . They went the extra mile to make our stay special . The breakfast was outstanding and we reluctantly checked out vowing to return . This hotel exceeded our expectations.",5,2016,12,14
122,All the toys of central London - with the choice of tranquility if desired.,"What a fantastic hotel.  Rooms wonderful, spacious and quiet.  We chose river view although view was in the distance it was overlooking harbour.  Pool and spa also lovely to ease aching body after long walks. About 45 mins from Piccadilly on a bus - but I love double decker buses.   Boat service available Mon- Friday at commuter times - approx 30 mins. Within walking distance of kings road shops, pubs and restaurants.  Lots Road auction house on doorstep - fabulous for a good mooch! ",5,2016,12,13
122,"Returning to a ""happy memories"" hotel in the UK.","We have stayed in this hotel at least a couple of times before over the years. The big advantage is the room size - it's a suite hotel, good value, and you have lots of space in your suite. Even if it is a ""bit out of town"", you are not that far from the bottom of the Kings Road, and there are some interesting restaurants and bars around the adjacent Lotts Road area, so you are not exactly stuck out in the sticks.
The biggest problem with the hotel is that it is tired, and it really needs a big refurb. The carpets, sofas and bathrooms all need a complete revamp. Then it would be a really good hotel. The staff are excellent, friendly, and in the main efficient, but the hotel needs a complete overall. The worst thing about it was the incredibly inefficient and slow internet. Even the staff admitted that it was very poor, particularly for things like Skype calls, but there was nothing they could do; although apparently the ""system"" is due to be replaced in the New Year. Not good enough for a 5* hotel in this day and age. Businessmen need top quality in room communications.",3,2016,12,11
122,Probably worth the gamble ,"Booked through last minute as a secret hotel. Took a bit of chance. On balance I think it was a good gamble. 

The one major downside is the location, getting to Sloane square to travel into town i tried walking to it, going overground from the adjacent imperial wharf station, walking to Fulham Broadway! Each took 30 mins which was a little frustrating.

Positives were the rooms, they really were great. A sizeable bedroom, bathroom, 2nd toilet, dressing room, lounge. Was there for 4 nights so had 4 breakfasts. They were good, the cooked breakfast brought to you rather than buffet which was nice. Personal preference but I didn't like the coffee. The pastries didn't appeal to me, they like like someone swung by sainsbury on their way home the previous night. The hotel did have a higher end atmosphere, spaciousness and elegance.

Would I stay again, yes if I were taking the wife at the weekend where you had time and wanted to be in central London. No if I was working near Liverpool St like I was, but that was my issue not really the fault of the hotel/location!

Bear in mind that the alternative would have been a premier inn, for the price paid.

",4,2016,12,11
122,Amazing Hotel!,"One of the best hotels i have ever been. The employees at the reception are very kind and all the staff is very kindfull. They are allways ready to help with anything you need. The rooms are huge, with spectacular beds. All of the meals where very good. The Breakfest cointains a great variety of food, and the lunch and dinner are well prepared and tasty.
A Hotel that i definitly recommend.",5,2016,12,07
122,A Gem in Chelsea,"This is one of my favourite hotels in London. Quiet, peaceful yet it is just a few minutes away from shopping and good restaurants. The view is beautiful, facing the marina. All rooms are one-bedroom suites, good for families as well. 

The afternoon tea is beautiful and the price is unbelievable (25.00）for a 5-star hotel. Be honest the food is much better than many hotels that are selling afternoon tea at 50.00+.",5,2016,12,07
122,Excellent in every way,"Stayed for a Saturday night and had a wonderful suite overlooking the harbour, great staff, great room, excellent breakfast. We will stay here again the next time we visit London. Thoroughly recommend this hotel you will not be disappointed in any way",5,2016,12,07
122,Very good conference,"We held a 2 day residential meeting.  The event was well organised by the hotel events team.  They were always on hand.  We were very well looked after in our meeting space by Mohamed and Fernando who were Very efficient, attentive, polite and happy to help with any queries.  The rest of the team were also very good.  
Accommodation is also very good, spacious suites with excellent facilities.  
Would recommend and also use them again.",4,2016,12,07
122,Excellent Hotel,"I booked a party of 10 for a day long business meeting followed by overnight stay. The Events Executives Patricia and Daniel were extremely helpful in the planning and execution of my meeting and accommodation.

The hotel location affords a degree of privacy and is away from the hustle and bustle of the Kings Rd. The car park is adjacent and easy to access. On checking in the high calibre of personnel employed is evident.  

We stayed in Marina View King Suites. The standard of décor and furnishings is excellent with an enormous comfortable bed with the most amazing pillows!

Breakfast was a relaxed an pleasurable experience with ample numbers of staff to take your order. I opted for the smoked salmon and scrambled egg, first rate! My colleague went Full English with all the trimmings which looked and tasted excellent.
In summary, I would definitely stay here again and recommend you to try it too.",5,2016,12,03
122,"Very nice hotel, beautiful location","The hotel is right on Chelsea Harbour - a small inlet off the Thames. The hotel is on the far side of the harbour and we had a balcony on harbour view.
Nice reception and a bar, you can take a sit on the terrace overlooking the boats in the harbour .Staff very friendly.
The rooms are all suites,big ,nicely decorated and very spacious,comfortable beds. 
Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,01
122,Lovely Stay,"Spent a weekend here celebrating my wife's birthday. 

The hotel is in a great location and it is but a short stroll around the marina out onto the Thames footpath where, despite the chilly November weather, we had a stroll after breakfast on both mornings of our stay. 

Good things to know. 

The staff are polite, friendly and plentiful. 
The rooms are proper suites so you can sit on a sofa and enjoy a movie. If you do want to get crumbs in the bed there is also a TV in the bedroom. 
The bed was huge! 
There is Tesco store within a 5 minute walk. 
The spa is very nice with both sauna and steam rooms in the changing rooms so no mixed sauna bathing and the pool is great. 
Room service is fast and the food good. OK we only had a pizza but it was very nice. 
The breakfasts are very good. Good produce well cooked. 
The suite was clean and tidy and housekeeping were excellent. 
There is parking nearby which costs £30 per day. Ask the concierge on arrival and he will direct you. 

Down sides. 

The furniture in the suite is dark and dated.
If you are an art lover then avert your eyes. Not sure who did the interior design but they had a particular eye!
Whilst the breakfast was excellent the experience was inconsistent. First day we each had a rack of toast and small pots of red and brown sauce delivered with our breakfasts.  The second day only one rack of toast and no pots of sauce. Little niggle I know but the lack of consistency in an otherwise well run service was all the more noticeable because of it. 
Final niggle. When we checked out the concierge was talking to a friend so my wife, who had a broken arm, had to open the door herself. 

Bottom line would I stay here again? The answer would be yes. 
",4,2016,11,29
122,Time for an overhaul!,"Stayed here at the weekend. We were on the first floor and also a suite in Penthouse. Both rooms are so dated! TV in the penthouse doesn't fit the space in the lounge. The sofa was frayed with a big threadbare hole in it, cigarette burn on the table, water stains on all the wooden tables and surfaces. The room on 1st floor, equally grotty and dated. For the prices they charge are simply not reflected in the room prices. This hotel is in dire need of a makeover. The breakfast was equally poor value and poor quality at £23.50. Save your money and stay elsewhere ",1,2016,11,28
122,Lovely,"The hotel is a bit out in the middle of nowhere but that didn't matter to us as we were on a girls spa weekend. 
We'd booked a suite as there were three of us and it was huge. Loads of room. It was also clean with plenty of towels etc. 
The spa was nice. Slightly funny layout as it was on a few different floors all linked by one staircase. It's not a luxury spa but it did the job. 
What made it for me was the staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Their attention to detail was great. 
The restaurant was also good and the food yummy. 

The only thing that let it down a little was the bill at the end which we had to query and which had to be referred to the reservations team. It's worth checking your bill carefully. ",4,2016,11,27
122,Best massage in London,"As a long time regular still think this is the best massage in London. Pity that like many hotels they undervalue the need fir investment in their spa facilities - the gym needs an update as do the showers and lockers

",5,2016,11,26
122,Great Place to Stay,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is a great place to stay. The Bar has two for one drinks between 5-7 each evening with free bar snacks (the sicilian olives are beautiful). The bar staff are friendly and engage in conversation which makes solo travellers feel at home. The food in the restaurant was superb.
Being a little out of the city is made easy by its location to Imperial Wharf Train Station or there is always an Uber not far away.
There was a slight misunderstand with my account when i was checking out but Cherie from Reservations sorted it out quite quickly, i was even given a complementary coffee and salad while i waited. The rooms are all suites with separate lounge rooms which makes them more like small homes rather than hotel rooms, all in all a good experience",5,2016,11,26
122,"Had no idea this was now a Millennium property, but regardless it was nice to return.","I used to stay here quite regularly for business trips, so the familiarity was very welcome.  I love this part of London, and even though the service was in some parts lacking at the off set with a blatant lack of initiative, the general feeling is that the staff want you to feel welcome and that nothing is too much trouble.  They just seem as though they are feeling their way at the moment.

The rooms are great,  The F&B is slightly odd; for example, a bacon sandwich on cheap white bread is more than 12 pounds. I would have paid 2 pounds in a caff for something better. But overall it is a welcome respite from the chaos of London life for an expatriate trying to cram 3 months of life into 1 week.",4,2016,11,19
122,Leisure,Visited for 3 days early November . Booked with Booking . Com which was fine Requested suite overlooking harbour but sadly it overlooked a drab stone building . Overall good value for money but I feel it was spoiled by this Gym and spa average and certainly not 5 star plus staff in gym were rude and need update on social skills and how to be welcoming  Staff were OK otherwise Room service fine Would book direct with hotel if visit again to ensure I was sure that my requests were guaranteed before arrival A big plus was it was very quiet ,4,2016,11,18
122,Recent London stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel on Fri 4th and Sat 5th of Nov to attend a wedding. The check in to the hotel was easy and our suite was lovely, clean, warm, with excellent facilities and great views over Chelsea Harbour. We decided to have a cocktail in the bar, before heading out to eat, this was a disappointing experience. Neither of the two bar men on duty had heard of Pisco and so couldn't fulfil the request for a Pisco sour, this was changed to a request for an amaretto sour, an amaretto on ice was brought! Eventually a woman, not sure if she was the bar manager came and our drinks were successfully produced, this took over 20mins. Not sure if the barman were new but they lacked knowledge, of a good bartender/mixologist. 
We had in room dining, club sandwiches, before heading out for a wedding, and these were delicious, my partner and I shared a traditional chicken and avocado club and a vegetarian club which had aubergine and mushrooms. Service was prompt and the food was fresh and hot.
Staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful and apart from the cocktail experience we had an excellent stay and would recommend. ",4,2016,11,16
122,Excellent service and suite,"A single night stay was a real delight. Warmly welcomed at reception, quality décor and excellent suites. Our suite consisted of a large living room with TV and all the facilities with a riverside view, a large bedroom also with a riverside view and TV as well as an exceptionally large ensuite with shower, bath, double sinks and toilet. 
The deal included a Pizza and a movie in the room. The pizza was large and good quality. Breakfast was excellent with a wide range of items on the buffet alongside a selection of 4 main breakfast options. 
The service throughout was excellent, from arrival through to departure, particularly Alex on reception who took care of our booking. Thank you.",5,2016,11,13
122,Quiet and comfortable West London hotel,"This hotel has become a favorite of ours for visits to London. Although outside the center of the city, the Chelsea Harbour Hotel is a modern, well run, comfortable hotel. Our top three favorite things are the super-spacious rooms with separate bedroom and lounge, excellent breakfasts, and proximity to Imperial Wharf overground station to connect into town.",5,2016,11,12
122,Secret Escapes special offer was very special ,"Needed a few days in London for a Conference mixed with a few days away with my wife. Originally booked a premier inn but had this offer through subscribing to a daily paper. 

Upgraded on arrival to a Marina view suite which had all you would need and more. 

Needless to say the whole experience was five star and was better value that a box at Premier.

122,1 night stay after event in london,"I stayed in a suite with twin bedroom and sitting room.  Plenty of space in both rooms and hallway.  Bathroom could have been bigger considering the size of the suite.
Very well equipped: 2 tv, desk, safe, mini bar, Tassimo coffee machine, tea tray, hairdryer, laundry service, bathrobes and slippers, iron/ironing board.
Excellent breakfast in restaurant with views over Chelsea Harbour.
Complimentary access to Spa with pool, sauna, steam room and well-equipped gym.
5 star service.
Quiet, secluded location but still easy to get to Chelsea and West End.  Imperial Wharf overground rail station a few minutes walk away.",4,2016,11,06
122,Hidden Gem ,"Visited the Chelsea harbour hotel for afternoon tea with my partner. Great hotel with great customer service. Beautiful views of the harbour, modern well furnished hotel. Great food. 

Beautiful spa, however not great for couples seeing as sauna and steam rooms are separate for men and women. 

Great hotel would definitely recommend.",5,2016,11,04
122,Really enjoyable stay,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my 15 year old daughter and we loved The Chelsea Harbour Hotel. We bought a Secret Escapes deal where you get bed, breakfast, pizza and a movie, which was great. I've never been so relaxed during a trip to London. We had a marina view suite, which was very spacious and comfortable, and both our pizza and our breakfast was delicious. I'd definitely return and despite it being far from the cheapest place to stay in London, it was definitely worth the money. 

The only slight down sides I'd mention is the tired pool area and changing rooms, and some of the furniture in the suite was a bit scratched or scuffed, but this was not off putting and there were no issues with cleanliness. ",5,2016,10,30
122,Business meeting,"Held a business meeting in Chelsea Harbour.  Meeting space was great & the service provided by Fernando, Mohammed and the team was exceptional. They were always willing to help and made everything run smoothly.",5,2016,10,27
122,The place to stay,"I booked a stay at this hotel for a special birthday celebration. The Hotel was superb and the staff excellent. The room was immaculate and the bed wonderfully comfortable. Our stay was elevated by the staff who went above and beyond the normal booking to make this visit truly memorable. The hotel is in a quiet nice location with great views. 
I will always now book a millennium hotel in favour of the other large group I have booked before and have of late not impressed me.",5,2016,10,26
122,home from home,"We have been coming here for more than 12 years now. It isn't as smart as when it was a Conran , the suites are a little tired now but its great to have a balcony looking onto the Thames where you can sit out and pretend that you are a local and look at the boats. Its a real secret location tucked away at the bottom of the Kings road perfect for a romantic evening. The bar has been decorated in a tacky style and the drinks are far too expensive so I would recommend a trip to the Tesco by the station . The staff are always excellent and the lighting in the spotless bathroom is great. So many hotel rooms in capitals are cramped , this is the opposite. And if its match day at the bridge you will spot football folk.",4,2016,10,25
122,Business Meeting Workshop,"The facilities were excellent for our needs and the staff were extremely polite, responsive and willing to help even with our continuous changes to timings, room requirements, etc.  I would definitely hold future business meetings at this hotel.",5,2016,10,24
122,Sunday Brunch at Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Sunday brunch at Chelsea Harbour Hotel is good value for money. Been there twice and each time thoroughly enjoyed my meal. There was plenty seafood available, variety of salads, roast lamb and beef. Good selection of desert.
Staff were attentive and friendly.",4,2016,10,23
122,Zombie hotel,"Some hotels look alive, this one is working in ""zombie mode"". I even suspect it was still born. It has no soul of itself. Looks like one of those ugly modern American hotels. 

The decoration is appalling and even though the hotel is new, things are surely deteriorating without anyone apparently caring. 

My room was in front of the train station and as is was poorly insulated I was awaken by the first train, not to mention the fact that airplanes flight over the hotel every 3 minutes.

I had a nice balcony but the door to it were locked. 

The room was big but lots of little things were malfunctioning:
- barely able to connect to WiFi
- tepid water early in the morning (not funny when you want to shave)
- lights constantly on in the dressing cabinet
- impossible to modulate the temperature in the shower
- impossible to fully close the shutters
- air conditioning from hell (had to be shut down)

Brekfast awfully expensive and mediocre.

Conference centre was mediocre with very low ceiling (too bad we got the wrong measures for our booth).

Finally, the hotel is in a dead end of London with not much around except for construction work.

To conclude, this hotel wants to be in the luxury segment but fails to deliver. Far too expensive.",2,2016,10,22
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"The hotel was of a very high standard in terms of decor and service.  The food was of a good standard.

What let it down for me was the noise of the train station near to the hotel and the constant noise of aeroplanes.",4,2016,10,21
122,Great location and fab pillows ,"We booked this hotel as it looked very nice from the pics. Unfortunately when we are in London we tend not to spend too much time at the hotels which is a shame. 

But we had drinks in the bar and they were nice (shame the main bar didn't stock jack Daniels - since the mini bars did) but the alternative was nice apparently. 

Breakfast was very nice and the yoghurts very creamy. However, for this type of hotel I wouldn't expect standard sliced bread toast. 

We opted for a suite which was huge and felt very luxurious. The pillows were amazing what can I say - if I had room in my suitcase I'd have loved to take them home with me. You just melted into them. 

Very nice and we will be back ",5,2016,10,14
122,Not bad ,"This was a nice hotel. Room was lovely, Staff were pleasent. Nice views. Would visit again. Everyone seemed friendly, lovely food, lots of things to do, everything was in walking distance, like I said, would visit again. ",4,2016,10,02
122,Shame they changed it!,You no longer have tables to eat st just few at the side and outside on the terrace.  I understand wanting to make  it more a bar scene but The bar felt lifeless with no atmosphere and empty   As the only few tables they had were not big enough for 6 people we went into the Chelsea Harbour brassier eaten here for breakfast which is great but for dinner it's small portions over priced and rather bland.  I had sea bass which was cooked well but all 6 of us thought all the food was very average.  The waiting staff in the contrary are amazing very attentive friendly with good knowledge especially the Chinese looking waitress was super efficient and really friendly nothing too much bother   She organised a cake with happy birthday for my daughter. Thank you  for making it special sorry I didn't catch your name ,3,2016,09,18
122,Work function and celebration dinner,Great service and great value. Food catering was great and the cheese selection was amazing. Easy getting taxi back to West London. Facility looked to have been through a recent makeover. Internet was great.,4,2016,09,17
122,Nice Enough,"The location is fantastic as its right on the harbor in Chelsea.  Although, with all the road construction, my driver had a bit of a problem finding the correct gate to get into the area.  Taxis drivers on other days where fine though.

Checkin was smooth and quick - they were training a new front desk agent, so probably quicker at times.

The room was okay, nothing to write home about frankly.  Slightly worn, but nice enough.  Room service was quick and friendly.  

The rooms could do with a refresh, but are clean.  Honestly, nothing bad to report but nothing stellar either.  Worth staying if you want to be in Chelsea and can get a deal on the room rates.",4,2016,09,15
122,A place that makes you feel beautiful!,"Pack your best high heeled shoes, most beautiful dress and bring all of your jewellery, because this is the place to wear them. 
This is the hotel where you can feel beautiful and appreciated. 
There are lovely ladies helping you to make your bed before going to sleep, good looking guys with red roses bringing your breakfast in bed and a really nice waiter who delicately lays napkin on your knees before dinner. 
Rooms are perfect as are the beds with good mattresses and wide selection of pillows.
If you are a guy - take your lady there because she really deserves it!",5,2016,09,14
122,"Lovely, lovely, lovely",A 3 night stay in September was super.  Our balcony with harbour view was an oasis in the middle of the city.  Only downside was helicopters and planes crossing overhead but the double glaszing kept them out.,5,2016,09,13
122,Luxurious!,"Arrived for a weekend of special plans only to be told we weren't booked in! My other half had mistakenly booked the wrong month!! Fortunately Peter the Manager arranged a room for the night, taking away our worry! He was very understanding! We missed most of what we had planned that day but our room, the view & friendly staff more than made up for it! It was a brief but relaxing stay! Very luxurious! Looks like we won't get a refund for our error with site we booked through so will be delighted to return again next month...will pack swimwear!",5,2016,09,12
122,Good rooms and view.,"Located at the touristic harbour.Nice terrace. Average rooms. Relatively slow internet connection. Very Poor breakfast. Not very helpfull staff without being rude. Spacious lobby. Located in a nice area.
",4,2016,09,11
122,Good nights sleep but not too clean,"Had a night here in a marina view suite. Room was pleasant on 4th floor but dusty. Someone's else's mini bar bill in the mini bar and a sequin stick on button on the basin in the 2nd loo in the suite.Dust on coffee maker and cups so we didn't use them.
This was obviously not cleaned with any care but the bed was large and very comfortable.
Room service breakfast was nice and generally the hotel was good.Standards have definitely dropped as visited this hotel regularly in the 90s and it's not as it was.
May stay again or perhaps go to the Millennium at Stamford Bridge next time.",3,2016,09,11
122,"Very poor service, disastrous breakfast, rude staff but nice rooms","Visited for 4 nights while attending business event at Olympia. Got off to a very bad start when we arrived laden with luggage in pouring rain. I checked in while all our luggage stood outside getting drenched, a porter just standing around watching us.
We then had to push the big luggage trolley ourselves through the lobby and into the lift.
Rooms were nice, very spacious, but housekeeping very poor, toiletries and coffee not restocked. No bottle opener, tv not working, only one water glass.
One of our party's corridor was constantly full of screaming kids throwing crisps and cereal around, not cleaned up.
Breakfast was shambolic. My chair was covered in jam, no orange juice in jugs, no milk or sugar on table,  eggs bendict tasteless and cold.
The breakfast 'tasting buffet' was laughable, half empty, stale pastries and congealed jams.
Staff are all unmotivated and stressed.
One night we went into the bar at 11.15, there were about 4 tables of people sitting outside on the balcony. We took our drinks outside only to have a staff member come charging out shouting that the balcony was closed due to licensing restrictions. He stood with a radio in his hand ordering us back inside in an aggressive and horrible way...very embarrassing for all concerned.
A beautiful hotel in picturesque setting, but staff attitudes are appalling. I suspect very weak management. Would not return.",3,2016,09,09
122,Nice corporate hotel,Came here for a business conference.  Was not disappointed- rooms were spacious and service was quite good.  All the staff were helpful and attentive.  Would not recommend for those seeking boutique/romantic experience but fits the bill for any business trip.,4,2016,09,08
122,Drinks,"Came here for a drink whilst staying with friends, we found it to be a beautiful reception and a nice bar, we sat on the terrace overlooking the boats in the harbour it was very pretty and a great setting. Drinks are not cheap but as to be expected in a hotel and due the the area. Whilst here we saw Diego Costa of Chelsea fc and hear that it's a hot spot for celebs so worth stopping by. I would recommend to go for a relaxing drink.",4,2016,09,07
122,Needs to be better for the price,"Stayed one night in a river view suite , very spacious and great view , but the room needs refurbishment at some stage , everything looks dated and tired

Dinner was nice but the menu was very simple , breakfast was ok but not helped by two staff arguing over one sending photos of the other to another person , these things shouldn't be done in public.

The hotel was partly closed off when we left due to the Chelsea team staying at the hotel , which would have annoying if you wanted lunch",3,2016,08,30
122,The exclusive hideout of many celebrities,"I regularly stay at this hotel while on business trip. Location is great, suites are gorgeous, and the spa is amazing. 
Perfect place to stay while visiting London. Posh and beautiful neighbourhood.
Stephanie, the GM, is the most pro-active and caring hotel manager I have met so far. She will always find a way to make your stay feels like a very special moment!
And the icing on the cake - it is not unusual to take the lift with a famous pop star, topmodel or footballer!",5,2016,08,24
122,Just okay...,"Four nights at the Hotel in a river view suite on the 7th floor, however, a new building is going up and blocking the full view of the river. Our family of four were recommended the Millennium Hotel by a transplanted Chelsea native as we could all stay together in the suite and it had a pool. Note: The pool temperature was pretty chilly. The room had one bedroom and an uncomfortable, aren't they all, pull out sofa in the living area. There were an oddly configured bathroom and a powder room in the suite. The hotel, every part of it, seemed dated to the 70's-80's and kind of a cold vibe. The hotel needs to be updated...especially the rooms. The bathrooms should be redesigned...lose the old soaker tub and include a shower bigger than 32""x32"". The hotel's clientele seemed international to very Middle Eastern. The hotel is in the Chelsea design district, which is okay, but at the end of King's Road in Chelsea and a decent 15-20 plus minute walk before starting to come across any shops or restaurants. We liked the World's End Restaurant (or Pub, or Market) on King's Road. Although on the River, it was still 15-25 pounds to get anywhere like Westminster Abbey (the start of the touristy area), or up to the Knightsbridge area. It is kind of out of the way if you are there as a tourist but at least it is in the city center. We arranged transport to Heathrow for 80-100 pounds.",3,2016,08,22
122,London's best kept secret,"For anyone visiting London, this is an absolutely ideal spot.  Quiet but centrally located and a doddle to get to all areas.  The food in the brasserie is superb (especially the club sandwich) and the staff are all exceedingly friendly and helpful.  I cannot rave enough about the pool; masses of natural light, comfy loungers, perfect water temperature, fluffy dressing gowns and surprisingly quiet.  The sauna and steam rooms are great (separate male & female). The atmosphere around both the hotel and spa is lovely and it seems to attract a very friendly clientele.  Can't recommend highly enough.  I long to go back!",5,2016,08,22
122,Sunday Brunch,its now  back every third sunday of every month great food and entertainment and lovely staff and an ideal setting for families and friends to get together. I used to come years ago and so happy this has retuned so book early to avoid disappointment. ,5,2016,08,21
122,Lovely hotel shame about the service,"The hotel is right on Chelsea Harbour - a small inlet off the Thames. The hotel is on the far side of the harbour and I paid for an upgrade to have a balcony and harbour view. This was well worth it. It is an all suite hotel and the room was split into two sides - the lounge and the bedroom with en suite. It had a separate shower as well as a bath. The room was excellent. The hotel itself is quite a way from an underground. The overground stops at Imperial Wharf which is a reasonable walk but is a north/south service so using a taxi is essential. 

I was with colleagues and going out to dinner, so only really interfaced with reception, bar and breakfast service. Shortly after I arrived maintenance knocked at my door and informed me they had come to change the lobby light. They agreed to return after I had gone out which they did. Whilst they were perfectly polite as a woman travelling alone I would have thought the hotel could call ahead to say this was about to happen. 

In the bar we sat & waited to be served. The bar was very quiet and there was one barman and one table waiter. After not even being acknowledged by the waiter, as he passed several times, I got up and went to the bar. When we were ready to leave the same thing happened. We were in clear site of the bar man who, if he had bothered to look around, could have indicated us to the waiter - who walked past us keeping his eyes dead ahead.

At breakfast the serving staff were different but the service similar.The service staff were very efficient at taking room numbers.  Again very quiet and I had ordered a hot item and toast. The toast hadn't arrived. The waiter disappeared, appeared, and disappeared without a glance. Eventually I got up and walked over at which the waiter tutted and disappeared for 5 minutes put my toast on the table and walked away.

At check in I asked that our three rooms be put on one bill. The very pleasant receptionist spent some time clicking the computer whilst we waited. On checkout (we were going to catch a train which we missed) I had to wait again as I was only presented with my room bill, not all 3. Again the clicking - surely that must not be an unusual request?

Anyway I did fill in a comment card. My general tone, as here, was the room was great but the service we experienced had shortcomings. This was the response; 

""Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We highly appreciate our guests’ comments as they help us to improve our service, ensuring that we deliver an experience in line with our guests’ expectations. Please accept my sincere apologies for the shortcomings you had encountered during your stay. I can only assure you that your poor experience is not something that usually happens as our guest satisfaction is of vital importance to us. At The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, we pride ourselves to provide excellent service and I do hope that you will give us a chance to prove this to you when you are back in London. Yours sincerely, Stephanie Segoura -General Manager"" 

Whilst I am appreciative of a response - who thinks that my comments are going to result of any review of anything or that the General Manager has written this. 

Having said that I probably would stay there again for the reasons outlined. It is a lovely location and a great design, rooms etc and providing you are happy to take a taxi it is ideal for the Kings Rd.",4,2016,08,18
122,Great Hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel. The staff was exceptional and my room was big and beautiful. Things to do while staying at this hotel...1. go for a walk along the harbor, 2. have a glass of wine on your balcony, 3. order room service for breakfast.",5,2016,08,17
122,Luxury weekend,"Stayed in Chelsea Harbor Hotel en rote to a festival. 
Amazing room. Staff were exceptional. So friendly and helpful. 
Bloody Mary's were worth waiting for. 
The luxury feeling in the suite with dressing gown and slippers was amazing. Felt like a million dollars for such a good rate. Definitely stay there again for a treat.",5,2016,08,12
122,amazing hotel,"hotel doesn't look great from the outside and could do with a re-paint.  but the inside makes up for in tenfold! it is a really lovely hotel, rooms have very nice views.  rooms are big with living area too and fancy coffee making facilities too.  if you're travelling with a baby they provide proper wooden cots, no travel cots.  your baby will sleep very very well!!",5,2016,08,09
122,Mr,"This was our 5th visit. Having been offered a free stay after our last visit which could best described as carnage we looked forward to an enjoyable stay at a premium 5 star London hotel. In the past we have had some enjoyable experiences at the hotel. Food, staff and hotel itself have been very good. HOWEVER I am not sure if it's just our luck or thing have changed but we have been left feeling we will not visit again. 

On arrival yesterday 27th July, at 1410hrs we went to the check in desk. We were informed that our room was not available and that check in was at 1500hrs. No problem with that as that is the time they stated. We left our bag and went for a walk having been told that they would call us when the room was ready. At 1520hrs we returned to the hotel having not been called, to be told they were just inspecting our room. We retired to the bar where I asked for two large glasses of Savignon Blanc only to be told that they did not have any. We then waited and waited for our wine to arrive and in the end reminded the staff who had obviously forgotten. 

We then went to our room which was lovely as they usually are, and should be!

At 1800hrs we went to the bar prior to going out. We ordered two glasses of what was now available ... Savignon Blanc! The first two glasses were to warm! The second bottle opened was also too warm!! In the end we asked the barman to get a cold bottle which he did from the chiller at the rear of the bar. 

Having returned late last night from a great night out we were woken or should I say disturbed at 0845hrs by the room door bell ringing. I got up went to the door and standing there was the chamber maid waiting to clean our room. I have since been told that this is normal procedure to empty the rubbish! Quite frankly I find that ridiculous. Are they really saying that they wake/disturb every visitor at 0845hrs to empty their rubbish??!! 

So having been given a complimentary stay after our last stays debacle we end up with another ruined visit. 

I spoke with the duty manager this morning who was polite and understanding. I have told him we will not stay again. We have stayed all over the world in hotels. When you pay lots of money you expect and deserve the best. Having recently stayed in the Regent Berlin the two hotels are complete opposites, the Regent service makes the Chelsea Harbour look like a Premier Inn (and I stay in plenty of those for work!) 

Shop around before you pay a premium price. There is a new Hilton DoubleTree 200yds away from this hotel which is half the price and not half the standard of service.",1,2016,07,28
122,Rooms are getting shabby,"We have stayed here several times. This summer we were put in older rooms on lower floors even though we paid for better views. Pre Booking requests were not honored or acknowledged, such as adjoining rooms. The rooms we were in were looking tired and shabby.  The doormen are first class. The restaurant and bar staff were better than last year, they were good! We eat breakfast out because in the hotel it is over valued and we dont always want a big breakfast. For 5 people it would be $150 to include it in the booking, in a nearby place it would be less than half the price. still good value compared to other hotels",3,2016,07,27
122,Great Stay,I had a very relaxing experience. All the rooms are spacious suites with separate living rooms and balconies . The food is very good especially the pizzas. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I recommend the harbour view rooms as the view is stunning.,5,2016,07,26
122,Fun location with generous sized rooms,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is perfectly located for all things fun in West London.  The hotel itself is smart with pleasant staff and valet parking.  The rooms are very generously sized, quiet, comfortable and with views of the harbour available, a must stay in this area of London!",5,2016,07,25
122,Amazing treat!,"Took the River Bus from the Embankment directly to the hotel, wonderful setting, professional and attentive from the minute we walked through the door. We were there on a Secret Escape Offer which included pizza, popcorn and wine, it was brought on a table to our Suite (all Suite hotel) by a very polite uniformed waiter, wine was a good quality and we really enjoyed the experience which was nicely concluded with an excellent breakfast overlooking the harbour in the morning.",5,2016,07,24
122,Lovely stay,"We found this place on secret escapes. We had a lovely suite overlooking the harbour which made coming to the city on a hot summers day feel like we were abroad. It's nicely done with a complete service. Balcony was a great touch, quiet too unlike many hotels.The patio doors kept us cool overnight. The only downside with them being open was the sound of the aircraft to city airport. It didn't affect our experience though and would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,24
122,A good nights sleep in London,"This hotel is in a lovely location. Hard to believe you're in the centre of London.
Spacious room, comfortable bed, good shower, lovely bathroom products and a lovely view. Friendly service at breakfast too. Great stay.",5,2016,07,23
122,Lobster & Whispering Angel,The restaurant are currently doing a special of grilled lobster served with delicious rose - its fabulous!  We sat out on the terrace last night and I would highly recommend it whilst the weather is so great!,5,2016,07,21
122,Superb Sunday Brunch..!,"Excellent Sunday Brunch - best in London.! Went with family, very wide buffet choice, something for everyone.
Quality of food top end, and huge variety of starters, roasts, desserts and crepe station.
Staff are friendly and attentive. Live piano player.
All in all a great way to spend a Sunday, we give it top marks.!",5,2016,07,18
122,2 night stay gorgeous,"This hotel is stunning stayed for 2 nights for Wimbledon. The staff cannot do enough for you. The rooms are all suites.
The bar has a balcony that you can sit out on and look over the harbour.
This hotel is not cheap but no more than you would expect for 5 star in London.
One thing though is the breakfast service was shambolic couple sat next to us waited an hour for bacon and eggs we waited 20 mins for tea and our toast was cold and only just toasted which arrived 15 mins before our breakfasts at £23.50 per person you would expect better service! ",4,2016,07,16
122,"No room, despite having prepaid in advance","I went to check-in to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel on Wednesday. When I got to reception, there was a guy at one of the check-in desks who told me I'd have to wait for his colleague while he proceeded to do what looked like nothing at all. Not a good start for a 5-star hotel...

Eventually someone else came out, took my name, confirmed my booking was for one night before disappearing saying he was going to get his colleague to check me in. The front of house manager emerged, and very apologetically told me that there had been a mixup with my booking and that they did not have a room for me. I was initially very annoyed as I had just gotten the Tube and Overground out to this hotel, and now I had no place to stay. I asked what they would do about it and the manager confirmed that they would put me up in a suite at a sister hotel. I asked about the location and he confirmed South Kensington. I asked if they were going to pay for the transport - I didn't have any Sterling on me at the time so couldn't pay and reclaim, and he said he'd email the other hotel and the doorman should be able to sort it out with the taxi driver.

A 15 minute cab ride later, I arrived at the Bailey's Hotel, just next to Gloucester Road tube station. A fantastic location but I wasn't overly enamoured by the hotel on first glance - it certainly didn't look like the same standard I was expecting from the Chelsea Harbour. But the suite was excellent to be fair, and it was a bonus being so close to a tube stop (hence this review being 2 stars and not 1).

So in the end it worked out fine, but it's still completely unacceptable to put a customer - particularly one who has paid upfront - in this position. Fortunately I wasn't overly bothered about the location, but if I was staying there to be close to Chelsea or the Harbour, this would have ruined my stay.

In fairness to the front of house manager, he was very understanding and patient as I vented my frustration, and they did handle the situation well overall. With all that said, I certainly won't be booking the hotel or any of its sister hotels again.",2,2016,07,15
122,What a hidden gem ,"Stayed in London for the last six months each week in various hotels.  Decided to try this one and it is superb value for money. Genuine 5*, basic rooms are suites and superb. Great spa and gym. 

The bar has a lovely view over a small ""harbour"". Staff really friendly. 

Absolutely faultless will definitely stay again. 
",5,2016,07,14
122,"Top , but ?","Super dooper place to stay , it's got the lot . Now the but . Stupid prices for a drink , food £46.00 for margarita pizza and bottle o wine , £7.00 for a bottle of water , £19 for bottle o beer and a glass o prosecco , my wife and I got a really good deal with Secret Escapes 50 odd per cent off price for a brilliant suite . Could not have afforded to stay otherwise . Would do it again with deal because like I said great place to stay",4,2016,07,14
122,Excellent Hotel,"Great hotel, excellent high level accomodation and staff. Nothing is too much trouble and great attention to all the details of your stay.

Rooms are fantastic, many overlooking the harbour connecting to the Thames. Great sound systems, TV and coffee facilities, comfortable beds and surroundings

Bar and wine list is great, craft ales available also. Room service food was excellent and piping hot (a rarity in my opinion).",5,2016,07,10
122,Tuesday Night Stay,"Was only here for one night as on a flying visit to London so I didn't get to sample the food etc 

The room (suite) itself was superb nicely decorated and very spacious. 

Not too expensive either given the location. 

Bar is nice and the service is  very good. 

",4,2016,07,06
122,Another excellent stay at t he Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"I stayed here again while attending Wimbledon with customers. This hotel always delivers, from the friendly doorman, check in, reception area, and the actual rooms.
I was given an upgrade this time to a room with a small balcony over looking the harbour. It was just a shame I wasn't there longer to enjoy it fully.
Rooms are very well appointed with a separate living area, good king sized beds, nice big bathrooms with a separate shower and bath, plenty of fluffy towels, dressing gowns, slippers, coffee pod machine, excellent free wifi.....I could go on.
It is not in central London, but there is a station very close by. However a similar room in a central London hotel would be almost double what we paid.
My only niggle, was the very slow service in the bar for drinks and food, and a mix up with the order. They were not up to their usual standard, hoping this was just a blip.",5,2016,07,05
122,Lovely rooms & great breakfasts,"We have stayed here many times & it's a superb hotel only downside it's not central.
The rooms are so quiet & blacked out that you could sleep all day.
Breakfast in the room is wonderful.
The reception staff are very helpful & there is always a taxi outside.",4,2016,07,03
122,Loved it! ,"Went for one night to get away from all the stress and that is exactly what it did! Loved every part of the hotel, spa & leisure facilities!  Very expensive but you get what you pay for 😊
Already going to be booking my next stay very soon.",5,2016,07,01
122,Could be better,"went and stayed here for a wedding and the reception was in the hotel function room, rooms were clean, service was reliable, location was relaxing only negative thing was the pricing and during the wedding a guest had a allergic reaction they said they cannot do nothing about and never concerned themselves",3,2016,07,01
122,Sunday Brunch,"What a fantastic Sunday Brunch, highly recommended ,great display and huge choice from oysters and Sushi to Sunday roast all overlooking the harbour...hard to beat.
Fantastic display
Take a few hours out and totally unwind.

A very excellent experience.",5,2016,06,30
122,Contempt for the customer and for contract law,"This hotel is as it appears on the website - it is what it is.  However I was appalled when I arrived late Tuesday night to find that the room I had booked and prepaid, in full, through the hotel's own website, had been given to someone else.  This was a King harbour view room - a treat for me and my wife after our daughter's 21st birthday party.  Instead we were offered either a twin with the same view or a king without.  We took the latter and were refunded the difference in price, though only after asking.  The attitude of the reception staff and of the duty manager, were, sorry, but that's how it is.  Tough.

Now, in the great scheme of things, no big deal, right?  First world problems etc.  

But I think this reveals a pretty worrying set of attitudes.  The hotel chose to sell my prepaid room to someone else, presumably because they thought either I wasn't coming or because they just wanted to make more money, or both.

This shows a contempt for the customer and a contempt for contract law  Effectively the room was no longer theirs to sell, having been contracted for me to use that night, and having accepted full payment from me in advance for that service.

So anyone reading this might well come here, get the room they booked and have a perfectly fine experience.  But be advised, from my experience this is a place where the customer, the human, the individual, comes pretty low on the priority list.",1,2016,06,30
122,Comfortable suites,"This is an all suite hotel overlooking Chelsea Harbour with its moored yachts and The Thames beyond.  This whole area is undergoing a radical makeover and is the 'new Chelsea'.  River buses run on weekdays but not at weekends.  Trains run from Imperial Wharf station which is near the hotel.  The Design Centre is adjacent to the hotel with many showrooms exhibiting avant garde home furnishings but is only open on weekdays.

The staff are friendly and accommodating yet the restaurant service needs to improve to maintain its 5* rating.  

The hotel package deals are worth having.",4,2016,06,28
122,Fabulous second birthday trip!,"I booked this hotel as we were visiting London for a Gangster tour as part of my Husbands birthday. I have never stayed here as always thought it was a little out the way but wanted some 5* luxury as a treat. We were not disappointed! The hotel looks fabulous and is fabulous. Our Marina View suite was spotless and had everything we could possibly want. We had a deal with a free pizza, popcorn and wine too! That was perfect when we returned from our tiring trip and we could just have it all delivered to the room and chill out in our comfy lounge watching a movie. Perfect! Everything was very cosy and the sheets were a fantastic thread count (I am very fussy about sheets!) The shower was truly powerful and the twin sinks perfect. I also loved the balcony looking out into the harbour. We will definitely return to this hotel for a chill weekend when we can enjoy it more and visit the spa and Chelsea itself. The only think I could find to moan about was the lack of plugs next to the bed so that shows how great it really was! See you soon 😊👍",5,2016,06,26
122,"Elegant, Efficient and Exclusive","Top marks for our recent stay at the CHH. Discrete and courteous service throughout our stay. Room service dining was excellent and attention to detail outstanding. Breakfast was a most civilised affair and the waiting staff attentive and efficient  Our suite was designed with comfort and practicality in mind, the bed super comfortable. Décor throughout was tasteful and flower arrangements stunning. Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,22
122,Nice last minute stay!,"Nice hotel in a nice location on the water:) My husband had booked for us as a last minute birthday treat for me. Living in London ourselves it was a welcome breath of fresh air and change of scenery. The Chelsea suites are lovely, tasteful, clean and big. Food (room service) was reasonable and tasty. Friendly and attentive staff. A generally good stay and would recommend...:)

*Only niggle was that there should have been a coffee machine in our suite but for some reason it was missing much to the receptionists confusion when we called down to ask if we could have some coffee sachets as we had a kettle and tea etc but thought it strange no sign of coffee, even instant:D A machine was located and brought to us swiftly in the end...",4,2016,06,21
122,Just Amazing,"From our arrival to leaving and everything in between was fantastic and faultless, such a lovely location, such lovely staff, wonderful cocktails and an upgrade to a harbour view I would recommend, our room was amazing (twin bedroom) we stayed for one night, to go to a concert, we didn't leave the hotel until it was time to head out to the concert, we had our dinner in our room, with the balcony over looking the quay.. Bliss.",5,2016,06,20
122,rooms ok restaurant auwful,"supposed to be a  5 stars hotel and expensive as if it really is, the rooms are at a 3 stars level, which I do not mind if I pay for a 3 stars, still it's ok, I can get over it, but what really finds me disappointed is the restaurant, both food and service. No reason to spend a lot of money for something you can find in a cheap restaurant anywhere in London, sure the place is overlooking the water but please, let's be honest and realistic, the panorama is not the one in the Capri gulf or in some bright ocean front place in Greece... manager there was an unorganized young lady who tried her best but service was poor, again for the price paied. There is a lot of space for improvement and implement a manu that is a 5 star.",2,2016,06,19
122,Mid week break,"Had a very enjoyable mid week stay here recently.  We had a river view suite, with a private balcony.  The suite was lovely and spacious, very well equipped, comfy bed, mini bar, had breakfast in bed one day, was fantastic, fabulous views, friendly attentive staff, had a really good time, would stay there again.",5,2016,06,15
122,Perfect service!,"I came to the hotel with my friend, who bought the spa day and afternoon tea as gift for my birthday.
We had a really good time first at the spa, later at the bar and eventually duringr the afternoon tea, whose esthetic presentation was amazing and flavours delicious.
I was stunned by the incredible service of Roberto, one of the waiters, who even gave us 2 glasses of Prosecco and took care of us.
Thank you everybody for this amazing day!",4,2016,06,15
122,Fantastic stay .... 5 star treatment.,"Stopped for 1 night on a secret escapes package which included pizza/ wine etc.
Room was fantastic ... We found this to be a fantastic 5star hotel and very attentive staff throughout.
The suite was large, great lounge and bedroom with 2 bathrooms and many extras / towels / slippers / robes / free access to gym and pool which was very good.
Breakfast excellent - vegetarian English superb.
Located in a very quiet area of London with walking along the Thames very pleasant.
A brilliant stay and would certainly stop again when next in London.",5,2016,06,15
122,Fantastic Spot,"Having been coming to London for years I must say I have found my favorite London Hotel. Everything at the Chelsea Harbour is top notch. The suites are up to date and spacious. All amenities are top of the line. And, the staff could not be friendlier or more attentive. Also if you love showers, and who doesn't? The showers are the Chelsea Harbour are like water therapy. Nothing better after a long day trekking around London. So if you are looking for a top class hotel The Chelsea Harbour is your place",5,2016,06,15
122,Not impressed at all.,"When we arrived the receptionist asked if we wanted someone to take our bags up but we declined, to be honest when you spend around £250 per night for a room they should automatically take your bags and show you the room so didn't feel it was a good start. We booked a marina view suite but most of our view was the restaurant roof with a multitude of weeds growing and the back of the hotel looked pretty shabby. Our room had two doors only one would open and that was very hard to move, appears that maintenance has been neglected.
There was no hot water coming from tap to bath so used shower, supposedly a 5* hotel and they don't even check that everything is in order, not impressed.
As it was our anniversary Maria on reception kindly sent 2 glasses of champagne to our room with some chocolates which was very much appreciated but the next day the chocolates that were left (quite a few) were taken away by the cleaners!
Had dinner in restaurant one evening, little choice on menu but prices were not too bad. The waiter brought us some wine that we had not asked for and thought they were probably complimentary but when we received bill the wine must have been added as the price was far more than we had in food, and the bill was not itemised which is very bad practice.
This hotel may have some 5* facilities such as spa and pool but I have had better service and seen better upkeep in 3* hotels.",3,2016,06,10
122,Stayed for Chelsea Flower Show,"Booked a Marina view overnight to attend the Chelsea Flower Show and for my husband's birthday.  Room was lovely and spacious with a fab view.  Had a few hiccups but we will try it again next year.  I booked online and in the comments section I asked for extra pillows as I have neck problems and it was also my husband's birthday and made the hotel aware of this as I had read that they do leave a slice of cake in the room for such an occasion.  I also emailed saying that we were attending the show and needed to drop off our luggage but if our room was ready that would be great.  We arrived about 11.30am, was told our room was clean and just needed Housekeeping to check it over which was fine so was asked to sit in the Reception area and we could go up in about 10 minutes and they would and tell us. We sat patiently for nearly half an hour and then I went back to Reception to enquire about our room, it was ready but the staff had forgotten about us.  So we were told not to worry about our luggage it would be brought up, we said we were in a hurry as we were off to the show and we wanted a quick freshen up as we had been travelling all morning.....we had to call for our luggage.  Also the extra pillows and maybe a slice of cake were not in the room so as we left I spoke to Reception where I said that I had emailed the hotel about a couple of things.  Granted when we came back the same member of staff remembered us and informed me that they couldn't find my requests so I had to say again, the pillows were brought up but sadly not a slice of birthday cake.  Then in the evening we went to the bar, it was a Saturday night and very quiet and I asked for a glass of Merlot and Chardonnay to be told there wasn't any Chardonnay......I am in a 5 star hotel in Chelsea and no Chardonnay, I wasn't too impressed.  The next morning we went down for breakfast, had a full English but it was stone cold, my husband ate his I sent mine to be heated up as it was so cold.  The staff were all courteous and helpful but there was one member of staff who needed to sort his body odour out, it was very bad indeed and not nice to endure while trying to eat.  The hotel itself is lovely, the location great but these few things did let it down but as I said we will try it again next year.",4,2016,06,06
122,Depends why you are visiting,"I booked the Secret Escapes deal here for a night, as I wanted to spend some quality time with my hard working busy husband for my birthday. So was especially looking forward to a spa day with him  and was sorely disappointed. Nowhere whilst reading reviews for the spa did I see that there were separate steam and sauna rooms for men and women in their prospective changing rooms. So my relaxing quality husband time was spent seperatley. If I had known this I would not have booked this experience here, and I did look on the Health Clubs website itself. Also the pool area was cold even though I was told it was heated to 30 degrees. My steam room was one of the best I have been in but my husbands was apparently cold with little steam.

However the hotel itself is beautiful,It is in a lovely peaceful location  with no traffic noise whatsoever, my Marina suite was very large, spacious and comfortable, with a beautiful view. The bathroom was massive with a separate bath and shower, the shower being one of the hottest most powerful I have been in. The bed was a good king size and extremely comfortable, the pillows were amazing. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful and polite. Breakfast was sufficient, nothing to rave about but did the job. 

The question is would I stay at this hotel if I had to pay the full rate? No, there are equally good hotels to stay in in London for a better value.I only picked this hotel for the spa facilities that sadly left me wanting.",4,2016,06,05
122,Clearly not as important as other guests.,"Stayed here on 03/06/16 with a group of friends for a celebration. Something was happening at the hotel when I arrived as there were people waiting outside the hotel and inside there were more security than at an airport. 
On the night of the 03/06 we were informed that the bar was closing at 01:00, we could not order drinks after this point. However, a large group entered the bar around 00:30 and were allowed to keep ordering large rounds of drinks even after the bar closed. When we asked if we could get drinks (about 01:30)  we were told that the bar was shut and this would not be possible. How is it that the other group were allowed? 
The following morning I had taken my luggage back to the car. I went back to the hotel to use the toilet and to check out when the door man, in an extremely rude manner, told me to make my mind up about being inside or out and that if I re-entered the hotel I could not leave until a large party had vacated the property and I would have to go inside and wait behind a barricade. My car parking was due to run out in 20 minutes so decided against going back inside as I was then anxious that I would get a parking ticket should I get stuck inside the hotel. 
I later found out there were a group of celebrities staying at the hotel. I was unaware of this until afterwards. I am appalled that due to their booking I was treated like a second rate customer. 
There was no need for the doorman to speak to me in this manner. I had no intentions of speaking to any of these celebrities, and he should not just assume as we were female that we would. 
Unfortunately this event ruined my stay at the hotel and I would think twice before booking again. I do not appreciate people talking to me in a derogatory manner.",1,2016,06,05
122,Parents of young children! Give yourself a break with a daycation in style,"We booked a suite for 'day use' in order to get a much-needed break from raising two small children. We made use of the swimming pool, the sauna and the steam room, had lunch in the brasserie overlooking the marina and high tea in the bar overlooking John Bishop. The service was excellent throughout, the suite was well appointed and spotlessly clean and the facilities were a treat. To stay all day, use all the facilities, have lunch and high tea still cost less than the overnight room rate.",5,2016,06,04
122,brilliant,"our flat is being refurbished so needed to stay in a hotel, excellent choice because even though in town we dont feel the congestion. had peaceful few days, our baby loved the walks on riverside recommend to all",5,2016,06,04
122,Wonderful Afternoon Tea and Spa,Fabulous place from spa to bar! We had a wonderful and very relaxing afternoon topped off with fantastic service and attention to detail from Roberto. A very special day indeed! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a bit of pampering and relaxing!,5,2016,06,03
122,Still an excellent place to stay,"We have stayed at the Chelsea Harbour many times over the years in all its guises but the reason I am reviewing it now is that my faith in the hotel has been restored.  We had an unfortunate visit back in March when things were not handled too well but it is one of our favourites and we decided to give it another try.  Our car doors were opened, our luggage taken in and up, the check in staff were charming and our room had a lovely view over the marina.  Everything was clean and worked.  The rooms really are proper suites with separate areas and two loos and lots of space and although the decor and furniture is much the same as it has always been, they still manage to be reasonably contemporary and elegant.  The bed is big and comfortable and there are excellent tea and coffee facilities.  Breakfast the next day was good although they could extend the muesli side of things but my full English was hot and pretty good.  A great place to stay if you are in this part of London",5,2016,06,02
122,"Very nice hotel, lovely waterfront location, a bit off the beaten path","We have stayed here a few times and really enjoy it. The rooms are HUGE for a city property--all suites, with sitting/sofa/desk rooms and separate bedrooms and balconies. The bathrooms have separate toilets, multiple sinks, bathtubs, and quite small showers (oddly). The buffet breakfast is amazing, though I wouldn't spend the fortune they ask for it; I've had it when it was included with my room package. You can easily hop a bus down The Kings Road to all of London, and you can walk from here to some nice restaurants and parks.",5,2016,06,01
122,A Grand Experience.,"My wife and I recently stayed at the fabulous (Chelsea harbour hotel) not to our surprise it lived up to it's reputation as being one of the best 5star hotel's in central london. The welcome was fine when we arrived and the staff were very  attentive, and showed us to our rooms. We received a complimentary pizza with a bottle of wine, on our arrival  and we also ordered a sandwich brunch which was very filling and my close siblings came to share our extended celebrations for my wife's birthday!!! We will be going back in the near future probably spend a longer time there, and have a swim next time. Blue Whale.

eputatio",5,2016,06,01
122,perfect location,"great hotel, fair pricing, location next to rush hour river taxi was EXCELLLLLENT considering the traffic in London these days. spacious rooms, terrific amenities, restaurant could use a bit of extra help",5,2016,06,01
122,Afternoon tea with poor service,"My partner and I decided to try the terrace overlooking the harbour for Saturday afternoon tea, after all its a very pretty location and quite peaceful. Unfortunately our visit was unsatisfactory. We arrived and were told by one of the three bar staff that we could sit on the terrace and they would come and take our order. 10-15 minutes elapsed and nobody had come to even give us a menu. I went to the bar to ask for menus and returned. Another 10 minutes, and again no one came to take our order Again I returned to the bar, staff were unapologetic and just made excuses. The bar was not busy, 5 tables with 10 guests max and three staff. The waiter did follow me to take our order and to wipe down our dirty table. Still no apology for having us ignored for 25 minutes. Our cappuccinos arrived luke warm (sigh), another trip back to the bar to complain, this was really feeling awkward and embarrassing at this point. Luckily a more competent staff took over and things progressed a bit more smoothly including replacement drinks. We did not pay the 12.5% service charge.  The hotel and view was lovely, the service for a 5-star hotel was shocking!",2,2016,05,29
122,Harbour Delights,"STUNNING. Stayed here for two nights . Good location for the flower show. From the moment we entered we were made so welcome. Nothing was too much trouble . The twin suites were beyond expectation. The food was superb and the service from Roberto was simply the best. Sitting on the terrace overlooking Chelsea Harbour in the afternoon so relaxing. Everything about this hotel surpassed all expectations.Thank you to Stephanie, Michael, Roberto, Maria and all of their staff for an unforgettable stay.",5,2016,05,29
122,NFL game in London,The hotel was outstanding! The staff was helpful and friendly. Very comfortable clean rooms. We went to London for the Chiefs game although Chelsea was outside of London a little it was a very charming area with lots to do.,5,2016,05,28
122,Not any port n a storm,I had a wonderful experience here a few weeks ago. It was large afternoon and we were greeted with three different menus to choose from. The food was delicious and the service extremely friendly. Fantastic location overlooking the harbour. Great value for money and a must if you like being near water (still) whilst eating. Definitely will be going again soon.m,4,2016,05,26
122,Midweek pleasure ,"The best kept secret in London dining?  Just had another fabulous meal overlooking the marina at Chelsea Harbour.   Restaurant principle Roberto always goes the extra mile to make every visit very special, even in a busy Chelsea Flower show week! ",5,2016,05,25
122,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed here for four nights on our trip to London.    The location is wonderful, right by the Thames  and positioned by a small harbour.  All the tourist attractions are  easy to reach via the overground (3mins walk away) or the clipper river boats and again only minutes away.

The hotel itself I couldn't fault, clean, comfortable and with lovely spacious rooms.   

The bar area overlooked the harbour, the drinks were a bit pricey so we didn't partake very often, also the atmosphere was somehow lacking.

All in all,  this is a very nice hotel, cracking views and yes I would certainly return.

",4,2016,05,25
122,Great Deal,"This stay was booked on a Secret Escapes deal, it inc 1 night stay with breakfast & pizza, popcorn and bottle wine delivered to the room.

We enjoy walking so staying here which is about 3 miles from Central London - Harrods , Hyde Park etc was not a problem as the walk there is pleasant and nice areas to be walking through. 

We were offered an upgraded room at a £40 charge which I felt was a fair price but I didn't upgrade because the only advantage was a balcony overlooking the harbour and due to cloudy rainy weather I wasn't going to benefit from it, otherwise I would have done. 

The room was spacious, clean, great bed and linen (slept really well) and because we had had a lunch out in the city the pizza & popcorn & wine came in a treat at about 10pm ( could have ordered it for anytime) delivered as proper room service on a trolley with ice bucket etc (nice touch) because the room was a suite it was nice not to be eating in the bedroom too. Our son joined us in the evening which wasn't a problem with hotel staff. 

Cocktails served 5-7pm every day 2 for 1 was a good deal too and the bar had a nice setting by the harbour, just wish it had been warn enough to have sat outside on the decking area. 

Breakfast also couldn't be faulted great choice & well cooked!

Well Done Chelsea Harbour & all your staff we will definitely be back & recommending you to our family & friends. Also well done secret escapes for a great deal!!!

",5,2016,05,22
122,GREAT!,"My wife and I spent the night at the Chelsea harbour hotel for our anniversary and we had an extremely enjoyable stay. 
The staff are excellent. Friendly and welcoming. In particular Amelie on reception was first class in all aspects. 
Our room/suite was really nice with a stunning view over the harbour. 
Breakfast was yummy with a good choice of food. 
We had a great time and would certainly come back. ",5,2016,05,22

122,Spa Day with afternoon tea,"We had a lovely pampering session in the spa.  The afternoon tea was superb.  We are a group of school-friends celebrating our 60th birthdays.  Our wonderfully attentive waiter, Roberto, started us with a complimentary glass of champagne and was friendly and professional.  He made us feel really special.  The setting was fabulous with art work in the dining room, gentle music and a lovely view of the harbour and the yachts.  We all highly recommend this for a great treat and relaxing day. ",5,2016,05,19
122,Miss,"An amazing experience all around. First we Had a beautiful neck,back and shoulders Massage, very relaxing. Then off to the pool(only disappointed that the pool was 1.5m deep all round and I'm quite short so was tippy toeing to keep above water), would be nice to have a shallow end just to be able to sit and chill, but other than that really nice. Then cooled off (figuratively speaking) in the sauna and steam rooms...to finish off we had afternoon tea in the restaurant and our waiter was ROBERTO, he was really lovely, friendly, attentive and brought us all we needed to make my birthday spa day out an experience to remember. Very happy very satisfied, would defiantly recommend and would ask for Roberto to wait on me again anytime .... Yaaaay!!!!!",5,2016,05,18
122,Spa day with afternoon tea,"I had a fabulous spa day with my friends in Chelsea Harbour Hotel. After that we went for the afternoon tea, we were serve by Roberto who gave us a splendid customer service with a little surprise cause I let them know it was my friend birthday...
Everything was so delicious, we enjoyed it and hope to be there again. 
It's a place to be!!!😉",5,2016,05,18
122,Business and leisure,My wife accompanied me to London. This hotel worked really well. I caught the ferry to the city and she enjoyed being out of the smog. Great service very attentive always smiling staff. Good room with view over Barbour. Food and drink a it pricy. ,5,2016,05,18
122,5* stay,"Very impressed with every aspect of my 2 night stay. The room was beautiful, facilities excellent and the view over the harbour was relaxing yet ever changing. All staff were pleasant and helpful - everything you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.",5,2016,05,17
122,Cant fault Chelsea Harbour!👍🎖,"The hotel was immaculate and the staff were superb from arrival to departure. Food excellent, suite spacious, clean and tidy. Will be returning as soon as get a chance! The situation to the city and west end are close without being on top and the view from the restaurant and glazed bar is stunning.",5,2016,05,17
122,"Interesting, fun location!","My first time to London was made even nicer by staying here. Room was stylish, roomy and very clean with a fun view of the magical glass domes of the Design Centre. It is located within walking distance of the river, trains and a few sweet pubs. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Food in the restaurant was delicious! My friend and I had jet lag and were thrilled to be able to have a full meal at midnight in the hotel restaurant. Would stay here again if given the opportunity.",5,2016,05,16
122,Good dinner and service,we came late for the dinner but the dinner is served excellent and the service is really good with Roberto.  He even speak our language.  And he is so nice and funny.  We all love him.  We will come back next time.,5,2016,05,15
122,"Wow what a waiter, a refreshing change","I had afternoon tea in the restaurant, nice peaceful surroundings overlooking the marina. I must say the waiter Roberto was lovely and welcoming and very attentive but not intrusive in any way. 

He certainly had a lot of knowledge and it was pleasing to find someone with experience rather than many new contract staff you can get in these types of hotels. Please keep these staff, it makes a difference to the customers experience.",5,2016,05,13
122,The best waiter...ever!!!,"We attended afternoon tea for a friends birthday and the the service was absolutely fantastic. Roberto was friendly, attentive and all around amazing! The food was fresh and scones were warm and yummy. 

Staff were so friendly, especially Roberto",5,2016,05,11

122,Awards night ,Absolutely fantastic hotel probably one of the nicest I've stayed at rooms are spacious with all u need highly recommend to anyone for a nice treat for the weekend harbour views and great access to railway station ,5,2016,05,11
122,An Amazing Spa And Champagne Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my partner booked a spa day at the hotel with champagne afternoon tea. We were given a very warm welcome upon arrival and shown around all of the facilities. The receptionist at the spa couldn't have done more for us - thank you!
Although not huge, the gym had plenty of equipment. The pool was a nice temperature and there weren't many people so we were able to swim at our own leisure. The steam room and sauna, again were pretty much empty which made for a very relaxing time. There is no jacuzzi and the sauna and steam rooms are separate for males and females. Me and my partner were a little disappointed by this as we wanted to spend the day together - but that's my fault for not checking.
The changing rooms were large and well equipped with decent lockers/hair-dryers/shampoo/conditioner/bath robes and slippers.

When we finished we were directed to the main reception of the hotel and were shown to the restaurant. We were seated by the window with a beautiful view of the harbour (shame about the weather - would be glorious on a Summers day).
Our food arrived quickly as well as our champagne and tea and everything was fresh and delicious!

I was presented with a birthday cake which was a wonderful surprise! And the staff were happy to give us take away boxes for the cakes we couldn't finish.

I will definitely be returning, the spa and hotel ensured I had an exceptional birthday!

Thank you!",5,2016,05,11
122,Disappointing hotel in great location,"This hotel is in a great location and is a 5 star hotel, but does not quite make it.
First the good things, the reception, concierge and customer service staff were great, however: the internet did not work, the room (while great size - we had paid for a suite) was just slightly unkempt - it needed a deep clean, the main toilet did not flush without a great deal of effort, the TV channels in the room are bizarre (and a number just didn't work), the canapes in the bar did not take into account gluten free considerations (the staff had no idea), it took four attempts to get tea with breakfast.
You do not expect the above with an expensive 5 star hotel, as said the customer service staff tried their best, but thy admitted it was not good enough.  
This hotel has changed hands a number of times - it needs a managerial overhaul.",2,2016,05,11
122,Great afternoon tea! ,"We had an amazing afternoon with my best friend who visited me from outside of london! 
The afternoon tea was dreamy and we had amazing team looking after us! 
Thank you Maricci, Ivelin and Paul at the door who took his time to not only show us the way back home but also to tell us a bit about the hotel! 

I highly recommend this place!  ",5,2016,05,10
122,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for one night in May , in a suite. Was very nice room. Breakfast was under par for this 5 star hotel. Had toast with English breakfast but no butter anywhere, had to ask twice and by the time it came had finished eating, so slow. Wasn't even busy at that time. ",3,2016,05,10
122,Amazing afternoon with fantastic service!,"Beautiful location with an amazing staff and great food. A huge thank you to Ivelin and Maricci from the restaurant. Your service and all the surprises were so lovely! Really appreciate it!
And thank you Paul (concierge) for all your efforts and a great chat :)",5,2016,05,09
122,Would like it to better,"Location, view, service are lovely!
BUT you pay all this money & they give 2 white & 2 brown sachets of sugar in the room. Strange! The window in the bedroom can't be open, which is probably for the safety reason (still can fall off the balcony), that makes it extremely uncomfortable to sleep, as it is so hot & the air-conditioner makes no difference to the temperature! 
Enjoyed the pizza served in our room, as the pastry was thin! Could have warmed the plates!
Continental breakfast was nice, but English breakfast was OMG! Scrambled egg from the pack, the bacon & sausage the cheapest qualty!",3,2016,05,08
122,Very good hotel but better organisation needed!,"Beautiful hotel in a lovely location. I visited family here and we ate in the hotel brasserie, the food was amazing and our waiter Roberto was also fantastic. Only thing that let it down was the fact it was understaffed for an anticipated busy evening resulting in slightly slow service. Roberto and the rest of his team worked very hard to maintain high standards but better organisation by the management to get the right number of people working was needed.",4,2016,05,04
122,fantastic service,"Staff all round very good
we stayed for week. clean fresh friendly very good food clean rooms beautiful views from the bedrooms lovely cocktails fantastic bar staff.
especially Roberto at the bar excellent service",5,2016,05,04
122,CONSISTENTLY EXCELLENT,"I stay here regularly for work and now occasionally for leisure too.  While not that close to a Tube station (Fulham Broadway is the nearest, about 15 minutes walk away), it is right beside Imperial Wharf Overground, which has great links to Gatwick Airport.  The hotel itself is great, with all rooms being suites i.e. you get a living room as well as the bedroom!  The staff are extremely helpful and the hotel has lost nothing following its move to become part of the Millennium group.  While the food in the hotel is fine, there are a number of worthwhile alternatives in the area - Lots Road pub and Kish Mish on Fulham Road to mention two.  Being at the end of a cul-de-sac makes the hotel very quiet and walks around the harbour itself and the river are very pleasant on a nice day.  The location might not suit everyone but I've rarely been disappointed with my stays here.",5,2016,05,04
122,Surprise location,"We found the Chelsea Harbour Hotel not only a excellent hotel but it is in an excellent location which was a great surprise, we went there on a last minute choice as we usually stay in Mayfair or Kensington and so glad that we did, it reminded us of Marina Del Rey California or Clarke quay Singapore. We stayed in a marina view suite which was in the central position of the hotel room 412, we did have room 108 to start which had a poor view of the marina, we mentioned it to the duty manager and he had no trouble relocating us to the 4th floor which was much better and gave us a good view of the Marina and Thames from the left and right sides. The room was spacious to say the least for a London Hotel, there was a lobby area with toilet & washbasin, large seating area with television and safe, espresso m/c, mini bar and leading from there to the good sized balcony. the bed was super king and very comfortable, the bathroom and shower was of a good size and of high spec, toilet and bedit, I thought the room in general was one of the best i've stayed in in London. Bar and food was of good quality with the self sevice hot and cold breakfast being excellent quality also.
I must give a special mention for the Duty Manager Alex Moraru, he was so helpful and he genuinely cared about us having a wonderful stay, well done Alex.",5,2016,05,02
122,Excellent location and facilities,"We shall certainly stay here again as we were impressed with the room and the hotels facilities , particularly the spa . The only let down was service In the bar which was very slow on the two occasions we used it . Other than that all the staff were very friendly.",4,2016,05,02
122,"5 Star Luxury, really!!!?!?!?!??","At the upwards of £250 per night we had very high expectations of this hotel during a last minute break to the capital.  However on the whole this hotel disappointed, and reading some of the glowing reviews I’m wondering if we stayed at the same hotel!?

The hotel overlooks the harbour and is in a very exclusive part of London, sadly that’s where the ‘premium’ feel of the place left us.

Our room wasn’t ready upon arrival at 2:50pm, which wasn’t the best start, I asked if we could have a cup of tea and was simply pointed in the general direction of the bar, where we bought 2 very plain teas for the eye watering cost of nearly £5 (including the 12.5% service fee for the effort of pouring the water and the travel of 5 metres to the table)

Throughout our stay we really felt his hotel was run by accountants by the little penny pinching issues.  There were no biscuits in the room (not essential but typical in most hotels costing significantly less than here)  Despite being advised in the hotel guide not to drink the water, only 1 small bottle was provided for 2 people in the room?
We had to ask the helpful room maid for more tea bags, but she warned us to hide them or they’d be removed in the morning.  Is this really a 5 star Chelsea hotel, again penny pinching I think!!!!
We ordered room service and the food was cold, we were called shortly after to see if we were happy with the food.  When I told them it was cold, I was told in broken English ‘but it arrived on time, so that is good, and rang off’ again another Fawlty Towers moment during our stay.
There was an error with our checkout dates but the staff were very helpful and friendly but still ½ hour to sort out.
The breakfast is very low standard, dry bacon, low grade sausages to name but a few, again what I would expect in a £40 a night b&b not here.

Overall we were extremely disappointed with the stay, as previous reviewers have commented I question how this place is 5 star.  Having stayed in many 5 star hotels in and around London, this is the worst by far, and poorer than many 3 star hotels.  

Other than the efforts of the staff this was a very disappointing stay.",2,2016,05,02
122,Amazing Staff,"I attended a recent Career Summit in London that held at Chelsea Hotel and I lodged in the hotel for four nights. It was such a great experience staying in the hotel. Apart from its great location, the hotel staff are equally amazing. Each guest is accorded special attention and pampered. 
I will recommend Chelsea Harbour Hotel any day to anyone who wants value for money.",5,2016,05,01
122,Really nice hotel,We found the hotel really good with excellent service. The rooms are very spacious for the money and although not the most modern they are very well presented and really clean and tidy. They have a nice classic feel to them. Breakfast was great and service excellent. We'd happily stay here again,5,2016,05,01
122,The chelsea harbour hotel ,"Just came back from the chelsea harbour hotel. SWent with G.F for her birthday. Loved the room very clean and tidy. Well set out with plenty of room, and a bacony 
Great view from room of the marina. And part of the Thames. Nice and quiet area. Staff very friendly helpful and polite. Would go back in the future. Nice thought by the staff leaving a lovely piece of birthday cake for my G.f. which was nice cause wasn't expecting anything. Thank you.  

 ",5,2016,04,29
122,Friends & Family Weekend in London,"Stayed for a weekend with friends visiting from France. Rooms spacious to accommodate our families, front desk staff very helpful to allocate rooms next to each other, in the bar Laurentiu was always with smile and handling all our special requests.
Will come back when visiting London.",5,2016,04,27
122,Lovely Birthday!,"When you don't know how to spend your birthday, you can find a place here!
Around 3pm I came with my boyfriend in the spa without reservation and we had the access to sauna, pool, steam bath includes towel and slippers.  
All the staff was kind and courteous, above all Mr.Roberto at the restaurant, he has good manners, I really appreciate the tablecloth on my table, almost impossible to find in London!
I had an enjoyable birthday.
thanks everyone to make it possible!",5,2016,04,26
122,Superb stay,"We recently stayed for 2 nights at the hotel and found the rooms, staff and service impeccable. We paid the supplement for a marina view which was worth doing. The restaurant and bar area were good to relax in the evening or take a walk along the promenade by the river. The overground was only 5 minutes walk so it's easy to get into Central London.",5,2016,04,25
122,Great hotel. Great location. ,"The balconies overlook Chelsea Harbour so it's quiet, peaceful and relaxing. The suites have all the facilities needed. The bathrooms are superb. I have stayed here several times and would thoroughly recommend it. And it's great value for money! ",5,2016,04,25
122,Poor service lovely hotel,"We stayed here in Feb 2016 for work... We are in the construction trade, let me erase that picture of that dirty workman out of your head quick... We are not dusty or dirty in anyway but every time we arrived at the hotels the doors weren't opened for us like everyone else just before us. You could barley get a hello out of the staff and they looked down at you constantly. All of the above really gets me going!! We are paying customers and I can bet that we kept our rooms a lot better than most! 

I gave this hotel an average rating due to the fact the way the front of house staff were. All that aside the Chelsea harbour hotel is a very reasonably priced hotel. Very clean and it is one of the only hotels I think which all the rooms are suites!! Very spacious and very clean. Importantly the shower is amazing :)",3,2016,04,20
122,Great Stay,"For an overnight stopover, or longer, Chelsea Harbour Hotel is THE place to go. It excels in every department, from the welcoming doorman and reception staff to behind the scenes staff in the kitchen. Nothing is too much trouble and everything beautifully served by discreetly attentive waiting staff. My room was large, bright and airy …all was spick and span and I wanted for nothing. The huge comfortable bed and the quietness led me to oversleep. Many a large hotel just pays lip service to food and wine but here they clearly care about where their food comes from and it is beautifully cooked and presented. The wine list again is well put together and there are some familiar names as well as a few lesser known ones. All at sensible prices. At breakfast there is a fabulous buffet along with a good choice of classic dishes to start you day. At departure, the staff again are terrifically polite ..wishing me a good day and really meaning it! In all, this is a really well managed establishment run by an energetic young team who are clearly going places. May they thrive and prosper.",5,2016,04,20
122,ANOTHER FANTASTIC STAY,"Without doubt my favourite London Hotel.

I have stayed here on and off now for a few years and it offers a stunning location, spacious and well appointed suites and above all, excellent staff who are well trained and provide a high level of service.

In particular I must mention Michael, the Food & Beverage Manager and Mark, the Breakfast Manager. Hard working and hospitality of the highest order.

These 2 employees typify the desire to offer the guest the very best service in a relaxed and welcoming fashion.

Nothing was too much trouble and they were always on hand to ensure our stay was a very pleasant one.

Once again we will return and maybe next time I'll invest in a balcony suite! 

Keep up the good work.",5,2016,04,19
122,Fabulous hotel - a lot of it comes from some of the best members of staff in London!,"I have stayed at the hotel many times and honestly consider it one of the best hotels in London, especially taking into account quality and price ratio compared to some other cramped central London 5 star hotels with often snobby staff. I also know why I keep coming back to the bar and restaurant there - the view of the harbour is lovely and serene, and also - they managed to find and nurture the best waiter in all of London, Roberto. Actually, probably the friendliest and one of the most professional staff I have ever encountered in hotels worldwide, and believe me - I have been travelling extensively all over the world for the past 20 years!))  I very highly recommend that both London visitors and locals alike visit Roberto for dinner in Chelsea Harbour hotel or simply a drink and enjoy the quality of service and the view :))",5,2016,04,19
122,Very Good,"I had booked a Hendo for 6 people for a afternoon tea and spa, really nice experience, looked after very well by Robento very friendly and helpful. Spa was really nice good facilities pool, steam , sauna , all staff very helpful .",4,2016,04,18
122,A secret escape,"My wife and I spent a Saturday night at this hotel, as we were going to visit the Rolling Stones Exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery the following day. The location of the hotel is ideal for exploring West London/Kings Road and has an over ground station Imperial Wharf close by. We found the hotel to be very unfussy for a 5 Star and the staff friendly and helpful. We had room service on two occasions and found the quality of the food to be first class. We would stay here again without hesitation.",5,2016,04,18
122,Amazing visits ,"Robento was really helping us to find the right food for us and he was so kind he was so helpful and so funny and there was a amazing service the food didn't take long and the food was delicious and well cooked .the people were so lovely,and helpful specially robento 
",5,2016,04,17
122,Lovely restaurant ,"I came to eat with my family, and the place was amazing, the staff where brilliant, especially Robento which was really helpful and nice. The food Was great, we had the steak which was amazing and great 
Would recommend it to everyone! And is great for everyone ",5,2016,04,17
122,A good hotel with some odd water issues.,"Firstly the location of the hotel is ok. I lived in London a while and know the area so getting out on foot from the hotel was easy and the overground is right outside so that's pretty good. If you have troubles on foot a taxi is always outside the hotel foyer. 

The hotel is quite lovely. It's clean and specious and my room was on the 7th floor.  It had a large bathroom with a separate walk in shower and another WC at the front enterence. The balcony could be accessed by both the bedroom and the lounge area too. 

My real issue is the shower. I'm only 5,3 and faily petit. The shower cubical had a huge rain head attachment which meant when you are in there you can't actually escape the water to wash your hair properly or your body without it washing right off!! Very annoying believe it or not. Also I think the water had a softener treatment or attachment which after stopping and starting the shower countless times to get a wash I couldn't get rid of the greasy feeling in my hair or my body. I did use the branded toiletries which would usually be fine. Yes I know, this seams such a little thing but this drove me crazy. 

The spa is brilliant. I had a body massage which was booked on good Friday on the same day which was wonderful and a good price. The pool was heated and a great size for some exercise. The spa and pool is laid out quite oddly on different floors but I do believe they did have access for anyone with disabilities. Another great point was the elevator that was at the end of the corridor to take you to the spa so you could stick your robe on and head down without having the fuss of being slightly soggy in fron of other guests later. 

Breakfast was lovely and in the warmer months a terrace over the small harbour would be wonderful.  I found room service a tad expensive and with a small pub just down from the hotel and a coffee shop just opposite the overground line you don't really need to partake 

It's a good hotel at a good price in a good area 

Please sort out the showers though. Such a fab bathroom and a poor design, even using the digital button for the shower seemed to be a pain too!",4,2016,04,11
122,Afternoon tea with excellent service,"A friend and I visited the Chelsea Harbour Hotel spa with afternoon, as a package deal. It was quite a cheap deal so we didn't expect to be treated with the care and attentiveness that we received. The afternoon tea was lovely - the bread was slightly stale and the cakes weren't amazing - but otherwise perfectly nice. Our waiter Roberto was what made the experience wonderful however, treating us like princesses  - nothing was too much trouble. Proper old-fashioned service - just like it should be!",4,2016,04,07
122,Lunch,"When the sun shines it's easy to forget that a big businessy hotel can produce quiet, impeccable service and fabulous food.

but thats what the CH (as we call it in SW London) does very well.

In the Brasserie restaurant, overlooking the bobbing harbour and its boats, and if clement weather, sitting on the terrace itself, watching the comely residents stroll by with their kids and their dog, there's a very cosmopolitan feel with diverse languages spoken - Welsh and Italian in the morning, and in the evenings Roberto's Spanish elan.  

The food is really excellent by the way.

Regulars get the family treatment.

A fun place with bags of quality and despite the fact that the Chelsea FC team stay here before big games (Im a Man U fan) it is is a haven (possibly a tax haven) not to be missed.

",4,2016,04,05
122,"Fab food, great chef","Went to eat with friends, am following strict food diet this week so asked Mark if it was possible to mix some of the dishes - Mark asked what I wanted and I asked for sea bream and spinach - no oils - he came back and the chef made me beautifully steamed sea bream fillets on a large bed of spinach...presented as beautifully as  my friends who ordered from the menu...thank you Chef",5,2016,04,05
122,"This one's for you, Roberto x","My friends and I indulged in a late afternoon tea at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, where we spent many hours chatting and relishing through their delicacies. However, early into our lunch, a situation occurred involving champagne being spilt over the front and back of my friend, resulting in my friend having to sit sodden for the duration of the lunch. Although we felt the waiter who spilt the champagne was not very apologetic, the primary waiter, Roberto did not let this fault his performance and made the rest of the stay very adequate. And in doing so, Roberto provided us all with a glass of free champagne after the small mishap our friend endured. 
Seeing this was my big 18th, Roberto did not fail in making my experience special and memorable. This was achieved by Roberto not only bringing out a cake with candles and many of the staff singing Happy Birthday to me, but accompanied by a Cosmopolitan.
Overall an enjoyable afternoon with delicious food but was just unfortunate about the incident (which we all had a good giggle about!) 

Yours sincerely,
H+M",4,2016,04,04
122,Still lovely but room for improvement,"I have just returned from a long weekend at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.  I wrote a review last year and rated the hotel 5 stars but a couple of things have changed and although a lovely a hotel it was spoilt by the disgusting service we received at breakfast this morning and the noise of aircraft and helicopters that we didn't notice last year.

As lots of reviews have said the hotel is lovely.  We had a river view suite again on the 6th floor with a balcony and as the weather was nice made use of having the patio doors open and watching the world go by.  Check in was great with our car being parked for us, luggage taken out of the car and followed us up to our suite.  The room had a TV in the lounge and bedroom with a stereo system to listen to music and a nice coffee machine.  However a couple of free biscuits would be a nice little touch. As I mentioned last bathroom is lovely but spoilt by having a single shower in such a large bathroom

However I was awoken at 5 both mornings with aeroplanes going over about every 5 minutes which got busier as the day went on.  I don't know what has happened but we definitely did not notice this last year.  In addition there is now a helipad diagonally to the hotel so helicopters are coming in level with the hotel to land and there were about five helicopters that came in the short space of a couple of hours this morning making a nice lay in impossible.  We found the room very warm and as other people have said the air conditioning not working and we couldn't open the window as due to health and safety the hotel are not allowed to leave the handle in the room.  I shudder to think what would happen if there was a fire in the room.  We asked for a handle, they came up opened the window for us but still didn't leave a handle and the cleaner came up and shut it again about 1/2 hour later!,

We had breakfast both mornings, and the service wasn't great yesterday as th girl that room my husbands breakfast order didn't understand English.....so why is she put in a public facing job???  The breakfast area was a little busier today, but certainly not full as they would have never of coped,the service was disgusting.  Firstly we waited to be seated by Michael, who thought it was more important to carry on playing on his computer and left us waiting for about 5 minutes, my husband said shall we just sit down and his reply was 'no wait and I will seat you' so we waited another 5 minutes.  He eventually seated us and took our drinks order, 10 minutes later and we had to ask for our drinks; he hadn't put the order through so they had to ask us again what we wanted.  Then we had to ask for our food order to be taken.  We ordered two English breakfast and toast, I asked for runny eggs as my husbands eggs yesterday were rock hard.  We received the toast and was advised that the butter would follow.  5 minutes later, and the toast then cold, we had to ask again for the butter, which a little slab about the size 1 inch round for two rounds of toast!  The breakfast turned up with two well done eggs again.  I sent them back and then had to wait about 10 minutes for two eggs!!  For this pleasure we were charged £23.50 plus £3.50 for the toast!

The hotel is placed well with an over ground railway at the back of the hotel which seems to go everywhere!! We went to Westfields yesterday and then to Harry Potter World last night 

We used the pool once, which was a bit cold for me but was lovely having the sauna to warm up in.  However they have a sauna and Steam room, one in the men's changing room and one in the woman's changing room, it would have been nice to sit in the sauna with my husband! 

A lovely hotel but some very disappointing aspects.  Obviously nothing can be done about he flights etc but there is no excuse for bad service within the restaurant and reading other reviews I am not the first person to bring this up and I was aware of two other parties also complaining today.  This lets the hotel down and I have noticed feedback from the hotel that this will be addressed but is obviously still a problem.  When visitors are paying top dollar then they expect a service to match this, if you are unable to offer the service then don't charge top dollar prices.",4,2016,04,03
122,Another excellent stay. ,"A little reluctant to provide this review as we'd hate it to get too busy and deteriorate. Just had another lovely stay with husband & our 2 boys (aged 8 & 10). Its location is fab with options for tube & water clipper for travelling about. The area is nice & quiet without feeling isolated. Hotel staff are helpful but not intrusive. Our room had a view of both the river & marina and a lovely little balcony from which to enjoy breakfast. Room service was great. 

Brasserie was excellent. Roberto knows his stuff and made our boys feel very special. Made great food recommendations too - sea bream was devine. Had a really lovely evening. 

Spa area is adequate albeit a little tired, towels are very shabby. Pool was a nice temperature and never full. 

All in all a great few days of easily accessible hustle-and-bustle about town by day and calm sanctuary come evening. 

",5,2016,03,31
122,Amazing Hotel!,"My sister and I had an amazing Easter weekend.

No.1 All if the staff were amazing, from reception to dining. However Luciano the evening manager was amazing and looked after us. He was attentive, and nothing was too much trouble- a gem within the crown of the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.

No.2 The hotels were immaculate and well presented within a great view of the harbour.

No.3 We enjoyed the spa- nothing was too much trouble.

No.4 We enjoyed the restaurant tremendously and the food was delicious. 

I would highly recommend this hotel.

Thank you.",5,2016,03,29
122,FABULOUS HOTEL,"We had a one night stay on Saturday march 12th for my birthday. The staff on arrival were excellent and offered us an upgrade for a small additional fee £40 to a suite overlooking the harbour. My wife told them it was my birthday and on our return from our night out there was a beautiful birthday cake in our suite with happy birthday on the plate . Every member of staff we encountered was polite professional and very helpful. We had fabby cocktails in the bar and a glorious breakfast  I cannot praise this hotel enough .All aspects  of our stay were excellent . PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, YOU MUST STAY AT THIS HOTEL, areal treat .  one downside was that its less than a mille from Chelsea fc ground but then I am an Arsenal fan. Cheers ",5,2016,03,29
122,Amazing Weekend!,"We arrived Saturday afternoon for a spa weekend with my sister. 
No.1 Generally all the staff were amazing. Luciano the night manager looked after us and is a gem within the crown of Chelsea Harbour Hotel.
No.2 The rooms were beautiful and immaculate with amazing views
No.3 The spa experience was also fantastic, with a nothing was too much to accommodate us
No.4 Dinner in the restaurant was delicious and the atmosphere was quiet but relaxed.

122,A London Gem!,"We recently stayed at the Chelsea Harbour hotel as a group of old school friends meeting up in London. On arrival our rooms were upgraded and, from that moment until we left, the staff couldn't do enough for us. And a special thank you to the general manager for making our stay a perfect one. We will return!",5,2016,03,27
122,What's Happening !!!,"This hotel HAD it all been staying there for over 10 years now 
Riverside location, quiet but yet within
minutes of excellent shops, restaurants bars and cafes  
Spacious suites with bedrooms and living rooms like a real home from home 
Excellent harbour side spa with a huge pool and gym 
Brilliant staff polite, friendly and some been there through the hotel management 
changes over the years,  so loyal as well 

BUT it's lost it's sparkle in need of a huge clean, the balconies are dirty the facade needs cleaned, the rooms need refurbished, place needs redecorated 
the menus need refreshed, the staff need motivated, at times they seem understaffed, TVs in the rooms don't work 
room service phones are not answered,
Air con doesn't work it's noisy at times 
It's just stopped ticking those boxes !!!

This hotel could be anything it's got so much potential 
But that's maybe the problem 
It's seems whoever's running don't want that or can't see it 

I did persevere and keep going but ........
As they say all good things come to an end 
And I'll just have to find another home from home in London 😞

",3,2016,03,25
122,"Great views, food ok, service needs improving","Had afternoon tea with a friend yesterday and though we'd booked, they clearly weren't expecting us - no table laid up and we had to choose between the lounge and the restaurant.  We chose the restaurant and had to wait while they laid the table.  Nice, friendly staff and we asked for a table by the window to appreciate the beautiful views over the harbour.  Food took ages to come but was freshly made and good standard, but nothing special.  Waiters disappeared for long periods so when asking for more hot water, etc., we had to wait to catch their eye.  We asked for more sandwiches and these came after another wait and we were charged extra for them, although we weren't warned of that at the time.  However, as the tea was only £18 a head and they charged £5 for the extras, we didn't mind, but as a rule you should be told it will be an extra charge, shouldn't you?  Had to wait again to get the bill and in fact had to ask twice.  Lovely looking hotel, clean loos and nice atmosphere, but really you go for the view and don't expect much else.",3,2016,03,24
122,One of my favourites in London,"I love this place, why you may ask. well I have stayed several times and i do like the rooms which are all big and come with their own sitting room. great views too.
it has a spa hairdressing salon and gym.

lovely tea and coffee making machines including the Nespresso coffee pods, sadly without Clooney to assist in the making.

i always ask for fresh milk and of course I do take my own china cup which readers know from previous reviews, the cup has its own adventures.

bathrooms are big and have correct lighting for make up.

the hotel is centrally located to london, and there are always taxis available. it is right by the Thames and the Marina, on a sunny day you can sit outside on the eateries area and watch the world go by.

the let down and this is no fault of the hotel is the costant take off and landing of the Helicopters that are across the river but very loud at times if you are on the phone or having a meeting.

One of the disappointments though is the breakfast itself, sorry not good really for a hotel that charges a lot of money, I am expecting more.

The bar area where you can have a snack is also sloppy with service, they are polite but it needs to be seriously looked at. the service is very slow. On an occasion a guy took a lunch order went away. 20 mins later someone else came to take the order, we were told he had only started and did not understand english that well so we had to order again. that sort of thing needs to be sorted out.

The check in staff and the Managers are great the flowers are beautifully displayed avery welcoming in the lobby.

I would recommend as I always do and yes I would stay again.",5,2016,03,23
122,Great hotel great service,"Beautiful hotel! Great location, Clean, comfortable and just all round special! The restaurant at the hotel has great food and great service! Simple menu but everything on it is fresh quality food! Thanks Rorbeto my dinner experience was fantastic!",5,2016,03,22
122,Is it really 5 star?,"I walked into the hotel and my first 10mins felt as if I was in a Mum and Pop hotel in 1920’s United States, where a Blackman sets off an alarm bell. Check-in was the most embarrassing event in my 25 years of business travel. The two front desk staff I met, treated me with so much disdain that for a second, I thought I had a very bad odour or something worse. The most heart-breaking fact was that while I was their waiting to be attended to, both front desk staff were busy attending to the same client. Unfortunately, my check-in had challenges & I was advised by the young lady to wait while she consults with her Manager. Luckily, my friend that invited me for the business meeting came downstairs on his way out and almost fainted. There I was, from an overnight flight, cold, hungry etc and the hotel couldn’t get in-touch with him, regarding his guest. All these while, I watched the young lady carried on as if nothing happened. I believe that my dressing and skin color was a determining factor in all of the above. The lovely chaps at concierge especially Mr. Elfeky was so very helpful.",3,2016,03,21
122,Lovely service,"I had a spa afternoon with champagne high tea. Place was very quiet with lovely facilities. Afterwards I had delicious afternoon tea at the hotel restaurant and was served by Roberto - very friendly and attentive. 
Would definitely go back",4,2016,03,18
122,Best bar service in a London hotel !! -,I came to the hotel bar this afternoon to have a cocktail and some dinner. I was very impressed with the service. Waiters Roberto and Lucciano made me feel at home with their attentiveness and their warmth.  I highly recommend this bar. The views over the harbour are impressive too. It is hard to find such outstanding service in London. I suspect I will become a regular here. I absolutely love it!,5,2016,03,16
122,A warm welcome,"I arrived at the hotel approximately 9pm. Maria on reception was welcoming and showed me to my room. As a conference organiser, I wanted to see more of the hotel and Maria was most accommodating and showed me the Penthouse floor, the meeting rooms, bar and public areas telling me what works well in each of the areas, the types of events they hold and information on the bedrooms.  All bedrooms are very spacious, well appointed and well equipped, many with harbour views. I couldn't fault my stay and we'll hopefully be using the hotel soon for some of our clients.",4,2016,03,15
122,Amazing,"This place is amazing. Rooms are so plush with a separate living room. Coffee maker, speakers. Views are amazing too. All the staff are friendly and you can't fault the location. Beds are so comfortable it's hard to leave this place!!! Views of the river and a cocktail... Heaven ",5,2016,03,10
122,Luxurious Property with Large Suites,"One of the most luxurious and spacious hotels in London with beautiful views of Chelsea Harbor, The Chelsea Harbour Hotel provides a five-stars five-diamond experience. Our suite had two bathrooms, umbellas, slippers, bathrobes, newspapers, and even chocolates.  The dining was excellent, and we were treated to an American Thanksgiving dinner during our Thanksgiving stay away from the States.",5,2016,03,09
122,Amazing hotel and superb service,"I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and the service here is the very best of the best, the restaurant Manager Roberto was first class, totally professional, friendly and could not have done more to make our meal more enjoyable. 
Totally awesome hotel and staff

122,Mothers Day Brunch,"Enjoyed an amazing brunch with family and friends at the Chelsea Harbour hotel last Sunday.
The choice of food was incredible. Traditional full breakfast, Sea food in abundance, lobsters, oysters, clams. prawns ,smoked  and fresh.salmon . Roast beef , pork , chicken and lamb. Vegetarian selection plus salads and  amazing desserts..
Diners were going back for second and sometimes third helpings !
Special thank you to Kuljit the chef for his wonderful creations and Adleine for being so bubbly and helpful throughout our time in the restaurant.
Would highly recommend you visit this hotel which is a calm oasis in the heart of Chelsea with the harbour and river Thames on the doorstep.
The attention to detail could not be faulted. There was a very special touch on leaving, by being presented with a beautiful mothers day pot of daffodils. 
The whole team from General Manager to front of house are to be congratulated on arranging such a special and memorable day !",5,2016,03,08
122,Sunday Brunch at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Had a sumptuous feast of a Sunday Brunch (recently reintroduced) at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel with friends. Fabulous range of food for all tastes, and all very good quality. So good that we didn't leave until well after dark. Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,05
122,Great stay...but,"Lovely twin bedded suite with good facilities, bath robes and slippers provided for popping to spa or treatment rooms. All good. I had a facial that was wonderful...my daughter had a relaxing massage that made her glow from head to foot. Breakfast delicious ...full English and selection of other items...yoghurt with selection of fruits and nuts and seeds, juices etc. Wonderful.
The but.... 
The spa days were spoiled by noisy children in the pool, screaming and dive bombing in the three lanes of the lovely 1.5 metre water. Obviously not a children's pool and surrounded by loungers for the spa visitors. Screaming is not conducive to relaxation. It could be heard in the steam room and sauna where we tries to escape the noise. This was Saturday. Sunday worse. If you want a quiet spa weekend and want a swim and to relax by the pool I do not recommend this hotel.
I understand that other guests have use of the pool and it is likely there will be children zooming about. I wonder if the hotel has thought about a special hour or so for children so that spa customers can have some time knowing they can have the peace and quiet they have paid for.",4,2016,03,02
122,Brunch is back!!!,At last the Chelsea Harbour Brunch is back!!  Fabulous choice of food in a great space overlooking the harbour.  Can't wait for the warmer days when we can sit outside. Great seafood for starters amongst many other choices and delicious roasts and vegetables.  Endless Bloody Marys too!  Highly recommended.,5,2016,03,01
122,Our 'Made in Chelsea' weekend away! ,"We have Just got back from a romantic weekend away in Chelsea London where we stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, after my boyfriend being away at sea for a while and missing his birthday and Valentine's Day! 
From the moment we pulled up outside the hotel we had nothing but amazing 5 star service! 
The concierge was extremely helpful with our bags and checking in! 
All hotel staff were extremely helpful and wished my boyfriend a happy birthday as soon as we set foot in the hotel! 
Our room was one of the suites just below the top floor with view looking over the London skyline and river Thames our very own balcony (was too cold to sit outside on the balcony being February but can imagine is beautiful in the summer months) and as soon as we got to our room our bags followed us as well as a birthday treat (small chocolate cake saying happy birthday and a letter from the hotel wishing we had a lovely stay). 
The Friday night we ate dinner in the hotel restaurant where was nothing but amazing services from start to finish! The food was lovely and the setting was beautiful sat right near the window with the harbour lights right outside! The evening was relaxed and stress free. 
Breakfast in the hotel was very lovely and the last morning we had room service where we ate our breakfast in the comfort of our room with the beautiful view! 
The location of the hotel is perfect just outside of kings road and although it's a 40 minute walk to Sloane Square some very nice shops, cafes and bars along the way to keep you occupied. 
I can not fault our stay in The Chelsea harbour hotel and although can be quite pricey to stay there depending on the room you have but in our eyes every penny worth spent and would defiantly go back there. ",5,2016,02,28
122,"Big rooms, quiet, good location","Had a weekend in London with a friend and stayed here - we also had a spa package and had free use of the pool, gym and sauna as well as one free treatment (we had massages which were lovely). The hotel is really quiet and all rooms are suites so there is lots of space to relax and enjoy our free time. It is a short walk to Kings Road, Sloane Square, Chelsea FC and tube stations. Lovely area to sit and have drinks before dinner overlooking the marina/harbour. Nice breakfast buffet.",4,2016,02,28
122,Fantastic Hotel,"Great place to stay. Couldn't fault our stay. Staff were experianced and welcoming.
I also thought the room service was really reasonable. Great location for the design Centre and Earls Court. Only draw back was the links to tube and rail network. Nothing a quick taxi ride couldn't sort.",5,2016,02,27
122,Amazing Restaurant,Thank you the Chelsea Harbor team for creating a magical evening for me and my dear friend. The food was amazing and we were well looked after! Fantastic location and quiet rooms! We will be definitely coming back!,5,2016,02,26
122,Lovely find,"Attractive hotel with good links to Central London. Rooms are all spacious suites with a lounge and bedroom. TV in each. It was good to have enough room to stretch out. Food in bar at lunchtime was good but expensive. Our rate included a good standard breakfast. Hotel s situated on a small wharf/marina off the Thames. There is an attractive outdoor sitting area which would be lovely in the warm weather. Imperial Wharf overground station is 5 minutes walk. Only downside is the area is very modern and sterile. There is a small local supermarket, a few restaurants, cafe and good pub. I would recommend this as an alternative to staying in central London as it is much quieter and not as expensive.",5,2016,02,23
122,Great Hotel in a great location,"This is a very nice hotel - I've organised a couple of large meetings (100 people) here, which have been very successful.
The bedrooms are great - many have fantastic views out across the Thames and central London.
The bar is good - with views over the marina.
The meeting space is well arranged and organised - and the food for the conference facilities is also well done. Relatively easy to get to from Heathrow.
recommended as both a hotel and a conference venue.",4,2016,02,21
122,Room with a view,"We were pleased to be able to book to stay here again, having enjoyed our previous stay a couple of years ago.
I was eager to see how things were having read some other reviews. Well, our experience was as close to perfect as it could be.
Bar service very polite and efficient including a food order.
We are breakfast here both mornings, what a choice ! The buffet with its great array of fresh fruit, juices,yogurts , pastries and so much more! The artisan bread deserves a star all of its own !
I chose an omelette which was most delicious and again very efficiently served, thank you one and all with a special mention to Roberto :-) but all staff were great but I didn't note any other names , sorry.
Our room was supberb, very clean and very comfortable and well appointed, lovely sheets, pillows and towels, thankyou",5,2016,02,20
122,"Beautiful hotel, but...","Things that were great:

* friendly service at check in by Lara
^ welcome shot of blended fruit juice
* beautiful and comfortable suite
* guest services called to check if we liked the room
* housekeeping quick with bringing extra toiletries

Things that weren't so great:

* waited over 30 min for our drinks to be served at the bar
* waited over 10 min for dirty glasses from previous couple to be cleaned off our table
* waitress only took away half the glasses and went to clean another table
* husband had to put the rest of the dirty glasses onto another table
* Bar was half full at the time!
* waited 20 minutes for decaff coffee at breakfast - only 4 couples dining at the time!
* decided to leave breakfast and have coffee in our room and waited 20 minutes for fresh milk to arrive
* guest services start working at 12pm lunchtime - so call reception but expect a long wait!!!!

Staff were very friendly, but not efficient! It was Valentine's weekend and the hotel didn't do anything special for couples - ie. chocolates in the lobby or in the room!!!",3,2016,02,15
122,An enjoyable stay!,"This was my first time staying at this hotel & I was generally impressed. A bit of a hike to the nearest tube station, but it's location on the river is very nice. My room overlooked the marina & was very comfortable.
Would gladly stay here again.",4,2016,02,12
122,Perfect stay again,"I spent one night here before going to a game at Chelsea football club, which was just a 15 minute walk away.
The service was top class, from the valet parking, to checking in and breakfast. Nothing is too much trouble here.
The suites are spacious and I had a view over the harbour. The bed is large and super comfortable with excellent quality linens
Huge bathroom with a separate shower and bath. water pressure in the shower is impressive. Lots of fluffy towels.
Good selection of teas and a coffee machine in the room. I like the separate lounge area in the suites, where you can relax, watch tv or laze on the sofa.
Breakfast is a large interesting cold buffet and hot food to order. Everything arrived swiftly and with a smile.
Can't fault this hotel in any way.",5,2016,02,10
122,Always amazing!,"We have stayed here countless times and it is always top quality. Spectacular view, from the balcony with spacious suites. It is  spotlessly clean, and the most comfortable giant beds that you could find! Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and we were given complimentary extra waters and late check out time. The pool is lovely and warm and hardly any one was in there.The breakfast is delicious and comes with its own little oven. All the food was fantastic and you can sit in the bar with a fab view of the harbour boats whilst sipping your cocktail. Service is fast and all the staff have been professional and personable. Totally recommend!",5,2016,02,06
122,Great Hotel,"This hotel is excellent overall, great friendly staff, excellent food and a terrific view looking at the boats in the harbour, It is a bit pricey but hey isn't everywhere in London? and you do get what you pay for ......Quality",5,2016,02,05
122,Great place to stay but not for dining!,"Smart elegant modern hotel facing onto marina/ small harbour area surrounded by expensive properties (owned by the likes of Robbie Williams & Michael Caine) & close to tube shops attractions. Interior layout spacious retro relaxing with added benefit of spa & indoor pool. Concierge & reception staff are pleasant attentive & efficient. Large sumptous bedrooms with adjoining lounge & some with veranda - beds are nicely comfortable providing quiet undisturbed sleep although some bedrooms will be disturbed by noisy overflying aircraft 6am onwards! Unfortunately experience let down by evening restaurant meal by being served average overdone warm food, breakfast service was disorganised & slow - waited 20 mins for breakfast to arrive.",3,2016,01,31
122,Amazing !!!!!!!,We had the pleasure to stay here for two nights and had a brilliant time! The room was fantastic with its balcony and a huge living room separate to the bedroom. Everything was spotless and the facilities in the room were excellent! All staff were friendly and very helpful. We will definitely recommend this hotel without a doubt and we hope to return as soon as possible!!,5,2016,01,25
122,Top London Hotel,"Chelsea Harbour Hotel's location was the only reason we have never considered a stay here.  Our mistake!  Although it might be a couple of miles 'out of town', getting to, say Knightsbridge, is an interesting walk up Kings Road, or try the route following the Thames.

Our room was large, especially for a London hotel and brilliant value.  Our balcony was a little grubby; not a particular problem in winter but hopefully they will be spruced up ready for the better weather.  As others have mentioned, a special thank you goes out to all the friendly staff who made us feel so welcome.

Chelsea Harbour is an area of London we have never explored - it was amazing.  Saying at this hotel will not disappoint",5,2016,01,23
122,Birthday treat,Booked this hotel through secret escapes. What a treat!!! Boyfriend loved it. So central for kings road area. Busy thriving harbour. Easy walk to embankment . The staff are a delight and breakfast was lovely. The spa is clean and fresh. Will definitely go back. Suites are ample. Ask for a harbour view.,5,2016,01,20
122,Amazing setting,"This hotel is excellent on all levels. The rooms, the comfortable beds and it is quiet! 
Breakfast was served in the lovely dining room overlooking Chelsea Harbour.  The staff are lovely too. Be sure to walk down Lots Road nearby to look at the auction rooms.",5,2016,01,16
122,Staycation Birthday Treat,"We stayed for one night in October '15. I booked via Hotel Tonight so this was bought at a reduced rate. 

The best thing about this hotel is that all of the rooms are suites. They may vary in size and what view is on offer but you can guarantee space for whatever price you pay, so for that I think it is value for money. We stayed in a King Suite, which is their standard double, and were amazed to find that in addition to a generous sized double room (for London) we had our own hallway, sitting room with balcony and large bathroom. I have stayed in 4 & 5 star hotel suites before and this is more like an apartment. The sitting room had a fantastic coffee machine and a minibar.  We overlooked the Imperial Wharf Station side of the building so didn't have much of a view; noise wasn't an issue though. We had some drinks on the Terrace overlooking Chelsea Harbour, which was fantastic for people watching. Oh, how the other half live! Service throughout was seamless. I booked this as a treat for my husbands birthday and let them know that in advance. A bottle of red wine, a slice of birthday cake and card, from the hotel manager, were delivered to our suite in the evening. We didn't stay for dinner as we found The Lots Road Pub & Dining Room, just 2 minutes walk from the hotel, had fabulous food and ales with a less formal feel. Breakfast wasn't included so we made alternative plans. It was a fantastic base for exploring another part of our city, that we don't often have reason to be in. 

There really weren't any negatives but if I was to nit-pick then I would say that a redesign of the spa facilities may be a good idea. Although the pool is a good size and everything seems in reasonable nick the layout of the changing rooms seems very cramped. I think this is due to individual sauna's in each sexes area. Also the gym was only OK, rather than fantastic, which at the cost of the rooms would be safe to expect. 

Thank you Chelsea Harbour for a wonderful stay! ",4,2016,01,15
122,Calm Hotel,"A person who really wants to stay in this hotel or have already experienced it, will go for it. Not because it has some issue but it is away from all things what people normally want around hotel i.e. quick access to tube or jumping straight to shopping area. Despite saying that it has main line train station just few steps away. One side of rooms give you vast but distant view on London and another side calm your eyes with Thames  water. It is very calm place to stay if you are in mood of slow and relaxed holidays. 

There are parking spaces in front and in the basement but need to be paid. The door men, concierge , bar and breakfast, all are very pleasant and friendly. The rooms are vast, clean and bright. I did not find any issue with any odors or any fault with the lifts (which are most complains tags in hotels).

If you are fan of football, you are not far from stadium. There are few pubs around as well and morning or evening walk from this hotel is icing on cake.

Enjoy your stay, as I said, if you are planned for relax stay.",4,2016,01,11
122,Amazing Birthday.!!,"I have stayed in many hotels, but by far, The Chelsea Harbour Hotel and is the best I have stayed in by far.! The staff are so helpful and will go out of there way to make your stay tailor made to your stay...
Do try the cocktails, made by Luciano, Antonio and Lorenzio.. They are amazing cocktail makers and can make you a classic or whatever you would like to try.!
Beatrix on reception will make your stay unforgettable.
My friend and I will be returning very soon.!
Thank you for the most wonderful time.!",5,2016,01,11
122,Great hotel ,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my wife and it did not fail to deliver. Wonderfully located and easy to find. We had a marina view King suite on the first floor. The suite was very big and all rooms were a good size. The balcony was also quite spacious. We had room service and breakfast and the food was great. We also saw the Chelsea FC team in the hotel lobby, if you like them, then I suppose it would be nice to see them. Would definitely revisit ",5,2016,01,10
122,Perfect Xmas Break,"We have stayed here before and once again were delighted with the warm welcome from the staff. We were offered a choice of rooms upon arrival and were soon settled into our comfy suite. We were staying for a week and half way through our break we were joined by our daughter and her family for the day. Again, nothing was too much trouble and we all enjoyed using the pool and spa and later had a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant. Chelsea Harbour is an excellent choice for a stay in London and the number 22 bus took us everywhere we needed to go, Would highly recommend this Hotel and we are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2016,01,09
122,A little bit of luxury... ,"As part of a trip to the west end for Christmas shopping and a theatre visit we stayed here,  for the one night...  
The finishing touches,  furnishings etc were all what you would expect from an establishment of this calibre.  The guest services team had made a point of going that little bit further however - whilst booking I had mentioned that the trip was for my stepdaughter's birthday and so upon arrival there was a card,  a bunch of balloons and an amazing looking chocolate cake.  (I was assured it tasted as good as it looked). 
All in all the staff were very helpful and attentive but without being too ""in your face"".. and it was an amazing stay. The only curious,  slightly odd element was that the main suite bathroom door could not be closed due to the position of the tower ring/hanger... Very odd. ",4,2016,01,09
122,Brilliant ,"I absolutely love this hotel. We stayed for the weekend as an early Christmas celebration...... The room was lovely, plenty of space. 

All the staff were really helpful and polite. A special mention to the wonderful doorman. 

We also ate dinner in the hotel, the food was great, compliments to the chef!

We'll be back!",5,2016,01,09
122,Mums and daughters weekend away,"We have stayed here several times before and always this visit has left us wanting to come back as soon as possible. 

The hotel is in a convenient location to the Kings Road which is a bonus for anyone who loves shopping. The staff are always eager to help make your stay perfect. We had two twin rooms overlooking the harbour and with glimpses of the Thames, which is our favourite view and we never get bored of sitting on the balcony. 

We ate breakfast here both days and the food is always top notch with lots of choice. We also had dinner here one evening which was absolutely superb from the stunning food to the outstanding service. ",5,2016,01,09
122,Fantastic!,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is an excellent hotel whatever the reason for the stay, the staff are all warm and friendly and happy to chat for hours during quiet periods and make you're stay a pleasant one! The service is second to none and they will provide almost anything you could ask for! Two of the staff who stood out during our stay was a duty manager called Matthew and another member of staff called Roberto (please pass on thanks from myself and Nick!). Look out for these two during your stay, they really made us feel welcome and were the highlight of our stay and consequently we shall be coming back frequently in the future. For business and with family to relax! Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making our stay so great!!",5,2016,01,08
122,"Good location, large room size n clean ","Considering it's London, rooms are very large in comparison to other city centre hotels. Just a short taxi ride to Knightsbridge. Very calm quiet area that's unlike the noisy cramp London city yet it's right in the city itself. Trains just outside the hotels just a few stops away from large malls. I would recommend this hotel strongly for travelers especially families n with children. ",5,2016,01,07
122,Beautiful hotel with great staff,"Stayed at this hotel in December for a couple of days and I was amazed of the staff.The facilities are good, I loved the breakfast,everything was fresh.
I am deaf and traveled alone,unfortunately is not easy to communicate,have to write down on paper questions.Not on this occasion.Lara at the reception was so helpful and made everything easier,she knows a bit of sign language. Thank you so much Lara.Will see you soon.",5,2016,01,05
122,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here for a few days from Boxing Day to 28th of December. Everything is first class from the service to the high quality of the suites. The staff are so friendly and welcoming, nothing was to much trouble and everyone with a smile on their face, we were checked in by a lovely Spanish girl called Maria, she was helpful, pleasant and friendly. Can't wait to go back again in March.",5,2016,01,05
122,"Helpful staff, excellent food","There was an issue with our booking, due to incorrect information from 3rd party booking agent, however the receptionist and Manager on duty Boxing Day late afternoon could not have been more helpfull. Food was excellent and room spotless. Would recommend this hotel, especially if you have a family, as the rooms are spacious.",5,2016,01,04
122,Return visit,"We returned to The Chelsea Harbour Hotel on Christmas Eve to mark the anniversary of our engagement there the year before.
We were greeted with the same professional staff who were more than willing to assist to our needs.  We decided to park the car with the hotel again rather than use the NCP car park, however our car was not parked outside the front of the hotel as it didn't really fit the 5* image!
Nevertheless we had a very swift check in and our room (River View Suite) was clean, comfortable, large and it had everything we required including a spectacular view.
We had a drink at the bar and the staff were very attentive. The hotel is in walking distance to Fulham Broadway tube so we left and used that to go to Winter Wonderland.
On return from our day in London we went back to our room and on the table the hotel had left us a 'Happy Anniversary' chocolate cake which was a very nice touch.
We had a fabulous night sleep in a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast was delivered to our room on time and it was again delicious.
We cannot fault this hotel or their staff, it's one of the best we have stayed in and hopefully we will be returning next year to celebrate married life!
Well done Chelsea Harbour.",5,2015,12,30
122,Avoid,"The hotel is certainly NOT 5 star with young inexperienced management and for the most part untrained staff. The food is worse than mediocre and looks as if it is bought in and only reheated.
If you insist on staying get a room with a view and eat at the pub across the road",2,2015,12,21
122,Good hotel for business trips,I booked a normal rate room and I was really surprised to find a room with two rooms and large bathroom. The location is also great. We even used to walk to from city center to the hotel. Definitely recommended if you travel for business. Stayed in October,5,2015,12,20
122,Sunday night stay,"We stayed here last Sunday. The room had 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom with shower & a separate bath & a bidet, 1 living room with tea & coffee facilities, but not enough milk - only 2 sachets; we had a balcony & a lovely view of the Chelsea harbour. We love fresh air, but unfortunately the window was locked, so couldn't open it, so didn't sleep very well. 
In the morning we had a continental breakfast, which was nice. Lovely attention to he detail : sugar in individual packets, mini croissants & stuff, rather than standard size, the toast was just bread from the pack. 
When my husband left me accidentally outside of the lift & I could not go back in the room as I didn't have the key-card on me, I was assisted by a member of staff to the very room. So they do take a great care when it comes to security, I suppose.
Service was pleasant.",4,2015,12,17
122,Unfortunately not 5 star standards for as 5 star hotel,"We booked this hotel for a night out just before christmas, on entering the hotel it has all of the expectations of a 5 star hotel. the Lobby is well manned, the service is fantastic and the hotel lives up to its 5 star reputation...however when you get to your apartments you realise that this is not the case throughout. The rooms are tired and worn with decor that would be more suited to the late 80's.  The plaster on the walls was broken where it had been hit by suitcases over the years and had not been repaired. The handle from the balcony back into the room was also broken. On the tech side - the ipod system in the room was so old it was for an Iphone 4...not much use to the millions of iphone 5, 5s and 6 user, there were no usb charging facilities. Luckily we were only stopping for one evening.",3,2015,12,17
122,Birthday weekend,"My partner and I stayed in the King suite with Marina view for my birthday weekend. It was truly wonderful and the staff were very attentive; even leaving a desert with a happy birthday note in our room. The hotel is beautiful, only a 15 minute walk from the Kings road - it is a nice walk mainly along the Thames. We had breakfast which was delicious, although very expensive. It really made the weekend special for me! If I could afford it I would be staying here as much as possible! ",5,2015,12,15
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Nice modern hotel, nice sized room but areas were grubby and tired looking- could do with a refurb. (Chelsea Suite over looking front of hotel)  No complimentary biscuits / snacks  in the room and mini bar prices one of the most expensive I've ever come across- £2.50 for a twix!  We didn't eat at the hotel because continental breakfast alone is £24 a head.  Had a few drinks in the bar- service pleasant but again silly prices which puts your back up given that you've already paid £260 for a night there in a lower range room. Car park is £40 for a night although there is another carpark closer for less at the back of hotel.",3,2015,12,14
122,My Birthday present ,"Beautiful hotel, elegant entrance lobby. Staff very attentive and informative. Room service for dinner was smooth and food was excellent. Beds comfy and suite was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was amazing, fresh made pastries, juices and eggs just how I ordered. The only issue for me was our room was too hot on arrival, but concierge soon had the temperature to my liking. ",5,2015,12,11
122,Great Hotel,"Me and my friend went on a vacation to London from Toronto and stayed at the Chelsea harbour hotel, this hotel is very beautiful and is close to Mayfair and Kensington; which where upscale areas with the best restaurants. The room was spectacular, it was like one bedroom apartment. The bathroom was big and bright. If I ever go back to London again, I would definitely stay at the Chelsea harbour.",5,2015,12,11
122,Fantastic,"The staff did everything to make my stay perfect from the doorman, concierge, reception & the lovely young lady Lara that showed me several suites. I stayed in the Savile Suite which was one of the Penthouse Suites, lots of room, a lovely view of the harbour and a nice terrace. It was a perfect suite to entertain some of my guests after a party elsewhere. Will most definitely stay at this amazing hotel again. Thank you",5,2015,12,11
122,Gorgeous!,"Absolutely LOVED the apartment, the view, the service, the restaurant, the sea food mmmmm! the chandeliers, the doormen, the harbour, the veranda, the coffee machine, the décor... absolutely first class. let down by a poor, cold, unappealing breakfast in the room, but can't let that tarnish an otherwise 5 star experience. My favourite hotel stay all year. Oh, and we got it for less than the Travel lodge, pays to check on line!",5,2015,12,10
122,"Amazing food, fantastic staff & a relaxed atmosphere ","A friend and I visited here at the weekend for dinner & drinks, first of all the staff couldn't help us enough service was outstanding and the food was just amazing cooked to perfection, Alberto the barman couldn't do enough for us 5* service!",5,2015,12,08
122,Nice staff but spa facilities in need of an upgrade,"Stayed with my sister for her 50th birthday as a spa break. Staff were lovely and we enjoyed our stay overall. The hotel is out of the way so I was expecting 5 star facilities to make up for that. However, the swimming pool and spa area were hard to access, requiring two different lift journeys from our floor and then stairs to a dark and dingy pool area. The first day the towels we were given were old and frayed brown ones, and the swimming pool tiles had quite a few loose and cracked. The water jets were not on either day. Room super hot, no view.",3,2015,12,06
122,A two night treat for my husband,"We have just returned from a two night break and had a lovely time. Breakfast first morning was one of the best that we have ever had in an hotel, however for some reason the standard of the breakfast the second day wasn't so good. We used the pool facilities and were only able to use half the pool due to childrens swimming lessons taking place. There was no jacuzzi which was disappointing and there were separate saunas/steam rooms for men and women as they were situated in the changing rooms.  We used room service which was excellent and the suite we had was very spacious and comfortable.  The doormen were very helpful.  The hotel was situated in a nice part of London and was good for walks along the Thames.",5,2015,12,05
122,Five star in every Way,"Harbour view suite large, comfortable and well appointed. Service excellent throughout our stay and staff most attentive. Health suite very good (just needs a Jacuzzi!). Did not try restaurant. Look forward already to returning.",5,2015,12,04
122,Ok... Over priced for what it is,"Stayed here for 1 night, bit far away from everything. I found it old fashioned in decor, over priced for what it is. I found the hotel staff quite abrupt and cold. Lovely polite door man
I wouldn't stay again, reception area is nice but I felt it didn't match the rooms?! Also very stuffy",3,2015,11,30
122,Great Service,"I stayed in the Chelsea Harbour Hotel a couple of weeks ago and have been back this week for a quick lunch.
Of particular note and worthy of mention, were two members of staff who went beyond the normal hotel courtesies. Both work in the restaurant, John the restaurant manager and Roberto. These guys made our stay an outstanding success. John who was overseeing breakfast at 6.30am greeted us as 'friends' each morning of our stay as we sat for breakfast, and Roberto who provided a generous welcome for dinner, and gave his time generously even to simply recommending a wine which was sublime. Roberto is the waiter you pray for each time you go out for a meal but so rarely find.
Thank you also to the general staff who were always polite and attentive. The hotel feels home from home!!",5,2015,11,26
122,Disapointing return visit to what used to be a great hotel,"Have not visited for some time,and doubt if will return.it was certainly not like it used to be.when was conrad.
Catering was worse aspect.awful club sandwich in bar,and staff there not up to standard.breakfast buffet good but no berries in fruit salad.cooked English breakfast,worse ever had,was cold and fried eggs solid so was sent back.
Bedroom good and clean.best member of staff was concierge.
Hotel seems to have lost its way and was a dissapoinment on our short trip to london",2,2015,11,25
122,Relaxing weekend in the city,"It's a great location for a low key weekend in London.  Has nice views of the river and great walks in the imperial wharf location. Large suites seem quite decadent in london. Staff are quiet helpful. Pool and changing area more like a leisure center a bit dated.
      
      ",3,2015,11,25
122,Fabulous ,"We stayed here when we went to London to watch the KC Chiefs play at wembley stadium. The hotel was nice. The staff was outstanding, helped in every way we needed. The train station is across the street. We never heard the noise of trains. They helped set up tours, and assisted in anyway they could. The food was also good. The bar staff was always attentive and service was good. The surrounding area has many restaurants and bars and is easily with in walking distance. Loved every night we stayed. ",5,2015,11,22
122,"Lovely hotel, a little out of the way...","We stayed here in September for one night.  I'd actually booked a luxury B n B, and then spotted a late offer for this hotel which only worked out a little bit more.

On arrival the service is great, very quick and professional as you'd expect from a 5*.  Our room was huge (more like an apartment than a hotel room), with a separate living area, complete with a bar and coffee machine.  We had two balconies (one off the bedroom and one of the living area), which offered great views of the city. 

The hotel is right near the over ground stop and has a Tesco metro nearby, along with a few boutique shops.  There isn't much in the way of nightlight around the area (we found a nice bar / pub on the water front), but other than it was really quiet.  Covent Garden is a good 30 minute tube ride away (which is where we headed for Breakfast the morning after).  Although the hotel does have a lovely bar that overlooks the harbour (we didn't eat or drink in there during our stay so I can't comment on what that's like).

It's great for a romantic stay, but if you're looking for nightlife etc, I would stay nearer Covent Garden / Westminster.",4,2015,11,20
122,Reservation team are AMAZING,"Eleanor on the reservations team was incredibly helpful and patient - even when I changed the booking several times! She served in a positive, polite manner all the way through, which I can't thank her enough for.",5,2015,11,19
122,Engagement weekend,We have literally just returned from a weekend away in London staying at the Chelsea harbour. The hotel is beautiful throughout. We stayed in a river marina suite with a fabulous view of the harbour and river. The room was huge and plush. Bathroom with separate shower lush and large bath. Lounge area was big and very tastefully decorated. Mini bar was full. Coffee machine was great. Safe included. Balcony was lovely to finish off the view from lounge. Pool area and facilities were very good. Bar area lovely. Hotel staff on entry were very helpful and concierge took bags to room whilst car was parked for us . Parking costs £40 per 24 hours- good service as they unload and re load your car. Location is 5 mins from train/ tube to Covent Garden. Chelsea itself worth a walk round with nice bars. A fantastic stay would definitely stay again.,5,2015,11,09
122,Very nice hotel ,"This is a beautiful hotel, the staff are polite and helpful. The fish and chips from the bar was delicious! Rooms are very spacious and comfortable..best night sleep I've had in a while. great stay, thanks. ",5,2015,11,05
122,Lovely,"I don't even know where to start, this is the most amazing hotel and Spa I have been to, the room and view was amazing and the spa itself was lovely, the staff were extremely nice, polite and helpful,the food was lovely and have had such a nice weekend, I honestly couldn't fault it, I was perfect, would stay here again without a doubt. ",5,2015,11,01
122,Excellent hotel for a family visit,"This review is long overdue, as we stayed there in May 2014, but it was such a great experience I thought it still worth to share my review.
We (2 adults, 2 boys aged 3 and 5 at the time) stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel over a long weekend (Fri-Mon), and it was one of our all-time favourite hotel experiences.
The accommodation is brilliant for families, as it's an all suites hotel. Our suite had a very spacious bedroom and ditto living room with a most comfortable sofabed. There was a full bathroom and additional separate toilet. And - wait for it - two (!) big balconies! The 2 rooms meant we could put the kids to bed and relax in our 'own room' without being cramped or quiet. 
The staff was very friendly and approachable, smiling at the kids and making them feel welcome as well. Nothing of the haughty, snooty attitude you can sometimes experience in luxury hotels.
The breakfast was fantastic, with everything you heart desires. The kids had mango juice the first morning, which they loved - and the staff made them feel like they were getting a special treat each morning.
The swimming pool was a BIG hit with the kids - and a rare find in London - and even the spa staff was extremely helpful and friendly to the kids. 
The transportation to central London is the only down-side to the hotel as it's quite far from any of the sights. However, we took it a part of the experience, catching a doubledecker bus home and allowing us all to see a lot of London streets while resting our feet. 
A very special treat was the fact that the Chelsea football team stays at this hotel before home games, and they had one on the Sunday we were there. My husband spotted Jose Mourinho in the lobby Saturday evening, which made his holiday, if not his year :-)
I can't put a finger on anything in this hotel - it will most certainly be our first pick for future family holidays in London.",5,2015,10,29
122,Well located,"Nicely located place

Friendly and attentive deal team!

Rooms (sorry suites) are nice, if a little on the small side

Overall a nice place, just a shame it's on the helicopter and airplane flight paths (not ideal for those looking for a lay in!)
",4,2015,10,28
122,Amazing hotel with fantastic staff,"Stayed at this hotel on business and the room was amazing.  The rooms are all suites so they have a seperate living area with sofas, and the bathroom was gorgeous.  Every single member of staff I came into contact with was extremely helpful and friendly and genuinely seemed to enjoy what they do.  The pool was a good size for swimming and the gym was well equipped.  

Well positioned hotel if you want to walk the Thames path or take a run to Battersea park in the morning.  Definitely would love to return.",5,2015,10,25
122,Great hotel but not perfect,"Arrived at the hotel (our second visit), and were looking forward to our marina view suite.
Service on arrival was amazing, we were offered valet parking, and our cases taken to our room, and car promptly parked. Check in was so smooth as well.
Our suite was superb....and certainly one of the best we have enjoyed anywhere in the world. We loved it!
BUT...as we were late, we ate in the hotel Brasserie. Oh dear! What a mistake that was..There was no atmopshere, and it only had a few diners. Our initial service was terrible, and had to ask several times for our drinks.
We certainaly couldnt fault the meal itself, but then all we could hear, and see was the staff getting the room ready for breakfast....so we didnt bother with a sweet or coffees, we couldnt wait to exit.
Sadly breakfast wasnt much better, and had to ask several times for our toast.
Such a pity, as the hotel.s location and faciltes are really wonderful.",4,2015,10,23
122,Great for a night cap!,"Didn't stay here but can highly recommend the place for a late night drink if you live in the area (as we do) - service was very friendly. There was a nice atmosphere
Good for football player spotting!",4,2015,10,17
122,wedding anniversary,"stayed for our anniversary, amazing suite overlooking the harbour with an added bonus of a balcony. everything you could have wished for, lovely setting, very close to the kings road and nice and quiet. didn't have time to use the spa, but it looked lovely",5,2015,10,17
122,Style And Comfort In Chelsea,"Lovely hotel in Chelsea. A little out of the way , but great value for money. Wonderful suites (huge) , a wonderful pool and spa and friendly staff. Excellent facilities in the room , and the most gorgeous bar overlooking the Harbour. We will be returning soon.",5,2015,10,15
122,Nice hotel but more like 4 star than 5 star.,"We arrived here for our honeymoon early October 2015. Nice amenities and a nice touch with the free bottled water in our hotel room. It would have been a 5 star if the general manager had been more service minded. When we arrived we wanted to take a shower after a long journey, but the shower only poured out scorching hot water. We tried everything but the water was really,really hot. We went down to the reception and asked if we could change rooms. At first the general manager wouldn't believe us and said that he'd never heard of this problem before. Anyways after some discussion he agreed to change rooms for us. Unfortunately the room he gave us was the neighbour room and it had the exact same problem. When we told the manager this he was very suspicious and thought we were trying to fool him (i dont know what motive we would have). He then wanted to feel for himself the problem. Only then he realised the problem, but he then tried to convince us that it would be nice to take a hot shower. We do like to take hot showers but should it really be like this in a 5 star hotel? At least it should be optional to take a REALLY hot shower or not. The result, however was also very disappointing, instead of checking for other rooms available, he told us we had to wait until the morning for the maintenance team. Unfortunately the problem was not fixed the next day, nor the third day (we had to use the shower in the bathtub which was working fine, albeit a bit unpractical). It worked on our fourth day and we had a good time at this hotel. Nice comfy beds and a huge room. Overall a nice stay but definitely room for improvement on the service side of the hotel (not the piccolos, they did an excellent job).",4,2015,10,07
122,Second Stay and 110% better than ever,"On arrival we were told by the receptionist that the management had upgraded us free of charge to the Kensington pent house suite. The lady then took us to our room and showed us around.

We were very impressed with the high standard of our room, it was spacious with a lovely view over the harbour from our balcony. It was such a pleasant surprise. 

Throughout our short stay we were treated really well by all staff and made to feel very special, with all staff being very friendly, polite and helpful.

The hotel itself is lovely, with high standards of cleanliness and also food. We really enjoyed eating breakfast out on the terrace, overlooking the harbour.",5,2015,10,05
122,Old school class! ,"A beautiful hotel, in a fairly secluded area! On entrance you feel welcome by professional staff. From our room we had a great view of London and the Chelsea harbour! The apartment/rooms are spacious and have an old school charm about them, they also have all modern essentials! At the bar I had a sage and pineapple cocktail, it was delicious!! 
We had an incident when we returned from dinner and the staff sorted the problem in a non judgmental professional manner, so thank you! High flyers stay here and we were made to feel just as welcome! ",5,2015,10,05
122,Mixed Experience,"We arrived on a day that the Chelsea FC team were staying there which completely spoiled the occasion as they were late checking out & caused disruption to the whole hotel. The staff were very accepting of this and implied that it is a regular occurrence.
On a positive the rooms and all areas were exceptionally well presented and rooms were very quiet, but on the negative side the service was slow and/or in all areas (reception, bar & restaurant) and the quality of the food was poor. 5* building but very much 3* service. A disappointing experience!",3,2015,10,04
122,Great Business Venue....,"Held an important business presentation at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel this week and I could not find fault. The staff were extremely attentive and happy to help with all requests, the room had all the facilities we needed and they served very tasty food for lunch, including some new Barrel & Stone pizzas they have on the menu. The meeting went very well and the ambiance and quality of the location definitely helped. Thanks again to the team at the Chelsea Harbour for looking after us.",5,2015,10,01
122,"Lovely rooms, peculiar service","Quiet hotel, lovely suite with living area and two balconies. Great location and views. Two toilets and bathroom. Cannot fault the bedrooms or the cleanliness.   Wifi was hopeless and I gave up trying to use it. Also phone in room never connected with reception or room service, so also gave up and just phoned from my mobile to the front desk (not sorted out during my stay). 

It was the service levels in the ground floor bar and restaurants  that was at odds with the high end brand .  Arrived on a Sunday and long queue to check in with one stressed woman on the desk (vs lots of bored looking other members of staff loitering around),  when I asked one waiter for a diet coke and got the reply 'I'll ask my supervisor'.... asked another for a table in an empty dinner restaurant area and got the reply '' I'll check the availability''....  asked a member of staff standing in the restaurant for some snacks and got the reply '' I'll pass your request onto banqueting'.... as if he was too senior (and like I knew or cared what his job was) ...etc.  None of these things was a major thing in itself, but they added up to an impression of unempowered service staff and a real hierarchy going on in the service teams. 

So - overall - lovely rooms with very average service. If you're just using as a base - it's a lovely place.",3,2015,09,30
122,"Great location, very clean and quiet","Our room was on the top floor and was rather large.  The configuration of the room is not optimal.  This suite is made up of 2 room, a living room and bedroom.  The bathroom is rather small and not very well designed.  However it is very clean.  There are double doors between the room and the corridor which is great for reducing sounds from the corridor.  Overall the room was very nice.
We booked a spa massage at the hotel which was excellent. The massage waiting room is nicely designed.  
The most negative point about the SPA is the pool.  Unfortunately very young children are allowed so it was really not relaxing and was really loud.  The sauna are separate for men and women which is too bad if you want to spend time with your partner. 
Other than that I was very happy with my weekend there and do recommend this hotel and SPA.",4,2015,09,29
122,Great hotel especially if you want some tranquility and peace and quiet!,"I've stayed at this hotel on and off for many years. When it was the Chelsea Harbour View, The Conrad and The Wyndham (not sure if I spelt correctly!).  So my date is not entirely accurate here on my review. Prefer to be honest.
I love this hotel for the fact whenever I stayed in the suites they have a separate lounge to the bedroom with a huge bathroom and separate WC.  It really is spacious and a home from home as most London hotels are similar to boxes not this one! 
Always guaranteed to have a peaceful, restful nights sleep due to its location.  It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the Kings Rd but you really don't mind that in respect to the location.  
The room has tea/coffee/bar facility and the staff were always so lovely they would bring fresh milk complimentary (when requested) if you were making tea in your room.  Entry into the suites was secure by a keycard to the lift so I always felt incredibly safe as a single lady staying there with my work employer.
If your planning on a few days away to London I would recommend this hotel its very luxurious and sitting out on the veranda for breakfast each morning or for a cocktail at night is very relaxing overlooking the river.
Staff very accommodating, discreet and you never felt intruded upon due to the size of the rooms, the hotel and the location.",5,2015,09,27
122,Great suite arrangement,"We have used the Chelsea Harbour over a period of years.  What brings us back is the suite arrangement as it gives space and convenience.
This time we had rooms on the west side, and I found these noisy as they overlook Imperial Wharf station and there was a lot of night life returning in the early hours - definitely better on the east side overlooking the harbour.
Staff are polite, efficient and helpful.
Didn't eat in - prices aren't cheap, but this is south west London!",4,2015,09,26
122,Pleasant stay,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights. Rooms are definitely big, bed is very comfortable, views on the harbour very nice.
The service is really high standard, and quality of sleep very good.
The bathroom as well as the room is very well equipped.",4,2015,09,24
122,Londons best kept secret,"Great hotel, great location, great service, great nights sleep.
I have stayed here several times now and the suites are immaculate, what I love is how quiet the hotel is and you should be guaranteed a good nights sleep.
Now they have an excellent general manager the staff service just gets bettereach visit",5,2015,09,23
122,Great hotel but let down by housekeeping error :/,"We stayed here for two nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary recently. We were thrilled with our room; which was spacious, clean and had a lovely view over the harbour. 

It is only a short walk to the King's Road and tube station, but the location is picturesque and quiet. 

The room was equipped with everything you need including a coffee machine, fresh bottled water, robe and slippers. However, as with most hotels, the mini bar products were extremely expensive. We paid £3.50 for a can of cola! The hotel bar cocktails were also extortionate, yet the heaters on the terrace were not all working.

The hotel spa was very good and we enjoyed a swim in the morning, when it was fairly quiet.

This would have been an almost perfect weekend had the cleaner who made up our room on the Saturday not have removed our complementary chocolates: we hadn't even opened them! We mentioned this upon check-out to the stern desk clerk, but was only offered a curt apology.",3,2015,09,21
122,Extremely Disappointing,I arrived at the hotel to be told that due to a computer glitch they had overbooked and I would be transferred to another nearby hotel. I accepted that these things happen and did not make a fuss but on arrival at the other hotel they had no knowledge of my transfer and it took half an hour and two phone calls back to Chelsea Harbour to sort it out. Chelsea Harbour hotel had then arranged a transfer back for me the following morning for a breakfast meeting and I was very surprised to be given a bill for the transfer which completed a truly shambolic experience. I spoke to the duty manager and gave him my contact details and he promised they would investigate and get in touch. Almost two weeks later I have heard nothing from them.,1,2015,09,19
122,"Stunning Hotel for 21st birthday, shame about the bill afterwards!","The hotel itself is stunning, 2 balconies, 2 toilets, a coffee machine in the room and insanely comfy bed, sofa room perfect for sitting, all right by the Thames in the stunning little Chelsea Harbour. 

However, in our room of 3 the third person had no bed upon arrival, after ringing guest services we realised it was the sofa bed that folded out. After the maid had made it up in the evening we discovered it was dropped in the middle and rock hard, such a shame as we were overwhelmed with the other bed.

Later, we heard a loud bang and realised the shelf had fallen off the wall, no apologies as 2 engineers came in with a loud drill as we were sitting in the same room having a drink to celebrate, working on it for half an hour with saw dust flying everywhere.

Most these minors were overcome by the hotel's stunning set out, however a day or so after leaving we realised that the bank card they asked for on arrival, which most hotels ask for, was used to freeze £200 in case we had anything from the bar or fridge in the rooms, we were disgusted to be told after ringing them today that it would not be returned to my bank for at least a week, which is something which we were never told.

A shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous, we won't be going back or recommending it to friends sadly as there are a lot more 5* hotels around that don't take money without notifying you, as 'it's company policy'.",4,2015,09,17
122,weekend break,"First time staying at the harbour, from the first moment of our arrival we were met by very friendly staff who could not do enough to help, from our luggage being taken to the suite, to the valet car parking, everybody had a smile on their face, the suite was fantastic with a view of the harbour, the hotel was very clean, quite and relaxing, the restaurant and bar were also fantastic, we felt very special from beginning to end, we will definitely return and recommend this hotel",5,2015,09,17
122,Lovely hotel and suites,"I have stayed here 3 times, gorgeous hotel with lovely suites, I've stayed also in the penthouse suite which was huge and had a fabulous balcony and views. The food we ordered here wasnt great but apart from that it's a nice hotel to stay in.",4,2015,09,15
122,Nice bit of Luxury,Stayed for a couple of nights to celebrate wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed in the least.   Lovely suite with view over harbour.  Top class service and a great location for Kings Rd and Chelsea.  Some lovely restaurants and bars within 10 mins also.....Bar snacks and breakfast at hotel good too and reasonable prices for this standard of hotel,5,2015,09,15
122,Fabulous Hotel,"Absolutely beautiful hotel that caters for everything. The suites are spacious and have everything you would require. The staff are first class and will go the extra mile to accommodate you. Very friendly. Excellent food and excellent service. You couldn't ask for more! Although the Hotel I'd a little out of central London it has Imperial Wharf overground train station round the corner and the clipper boats stops at Chelsea Harbour which is on the doorstep! My husband and I have a great time, So thank you for a wounderful stay, we will return.",5,2015,09,13
122,I love this hotel,"I use this hotel so much over the years, the location is brilliant and the hotel itself is also brilliant, in fact early last year we used the hotel so many weekends that we were there more times then most of the staff. i normally book a river view suite which is one of th best rooms in any hotel i have stayed, i have booked the penthouse suite on a couple of occasions and would recommend that if you are going to be spending time at the hotel then this room is a must.
This hotel is so close to the heart of London, but it feels like you are in your own little village.
Every room in this hotel is a suite and as far as i know is the only hotel in London that has this, and i must point out, that they are proper suites, not a room with a couple of extra chairs in it, each suite consists of 2 separate rooms, my personal choice is the open room suite, to me it just feels better, some people i know prefer the closed room .suite
I have stayed in just about all the top hotel in London, but this hotel is always my first choice.",5,2015,09,08
122,Trip ruined.  Prepaid room not available,This place was an absolute nightmare! prepaid room which had been held for two months was not available and we were offered only a very substandard room to account for the chang. do not stay here under any circumstances zero stars maybe -5 stars.  Very ignorant staff and surprise. No one really speaks English here!,1,2015,09,08
122,The best hotel in London - for us (and fantastic food),"We travel a lot and we have stayed in different hotels in London and in other European cities and this hotel is one of the best large hotels we have ever stayed.  We had really perfect rooms (with harbour view and large balconies), the rooms were very spacious and comfortable (each with two bathrooms) but also very nice and cosy, you  feel at home and you are in a hotel!!!! Our rooms (and the whole hotel) were extremely clean, our beds were perfect (we could not sleep better), we appreciated a really good choice in the minibar (especially healthy juices but we missed dried fruits and nuts we had there last year). I must praise the really helpfull staff - restaurant staff, reception staff and  also very helpful, kind and clever porters (they always helped us when we needed), We  also enjoyed  very nice food (big and tasty breakfasts on the terrace and delicious  dinners in the Italian restaurant - and also the staff were perfect - friendly and willing and they made very pleasant atmosphere in the restaurant). We admired the picturesque view from our balconies and we liked plesant walks by the Thames during our stay. We will definitely come back when we are in London again.",5,2015,09,08
122,Fantastic location but ..,Thought this was a great location and a beautiful hotel. Greeted by exceptional door staff and welcomed by reception but the service slipped slightly after. Found the bar staff incredibly slow and prices exorbitant and the waiting staff to be indifferent . Maybe they were too busy  ,3,2015,09,08
122,Absolutely Fantastic!,"It's not very often I go somewhere and cannot fault it. This place is unbelievable, if you want one of the best night sleeps you are ever going to get, come here! They are the comfiest beds you will ever sleep in! 

The rooms are lovely, the restaurant is lovely, the balcony by the harbour is lovely. It's expensive, but so worth it! The hotel in general doesn't have any negatives in my opinion, the perfect example of a well run hotel.",5,2015,09,03
122,Second time round and what a difference!,"After an unsatisfactory stay earlier this year, we was promised upon our next visit we would be well and truly looked after, and we certainly was! Alex was fantastic, our room was gorgeous in the penthouse suites, Saville Suite overlooking the harbour! Can not explain how amazing the room and view is, we certainly couldnt return now without a penthouse room. Breakfast in bed was once again fantastic, maybe expensive but with a room like ours we just didnt want to leave. You have restored faith in staying with you again, hope to see you all again soon.",5,2015,09,03
122,"Great Suite, but Indifferent Service","We were really looking forward to staying at this luxury hotel with a good reputation, but overall were very disappointed in the general experience.
The only good thing was the room itself. Housekeeping let this down, the staff were only interested in being tipped and everything else was hideously expensive, even for London.
Overall our stay was a disappointment.",3,2015,09,02
122,Excellent stay in london,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights to visit my family. The receptionist Albert specks Chinese, very friendly and very helpful! The food in the restaurant is amazing. I ordered the Grilled mixed fish selection with seasonal vegetables. Roberto is the best waiter here very nice and funny. And Pawel in concierge is very helpful as well, he shows me how to get to the place I wanna go. I really enjoy the stay here and will be back soon for sure!",5,2015,09,02
122,Slowly going downhill,"We have been staying at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for many years. Since being bought over by Millennium things have started to decline. We arrived on Thursday to report air-con was not working, eventually got fixed on Saturday after we had to ask again. Room service menu has changed and is extremely poor. I ordered pizza for a quick snack and it was like eating a frozen microwaved pizza. Toiletries were not replaced even when empty, nor was minibar restocked, not great when we were staying for 4 days. Rooms are generally run down and could be done with paint work being redone. Wifi was terrible, ended up using 3G/4G for the weekend to check emails, social media etc.",3,2015,09,02
122,Appalling,"Poor food, poor service, staff that need to be told twice! One of our party had a hair in their food, disgusting place. Glasses were dirty, finger prints on them. Would not eat here again if you paid me",1,2015,09,01
122,Another overnight shopping + friends London trip,"A busy Saturday was lined up, arrive London early doors, drop car off with concierge along with the overnight bag then head down the road to meet friends for lunch.

Check in first though which was painless enough, Chelsea were playing at home so the area and hotel were likely to be busy. After lunch we popped up to Bond St then Covent Garden to meet more friends, after some Champers we grabbed a cab back to the hotel to get ready for dinner. I like the rooms here, they are plenty large enough and good value considering location. Amenities include lovely bath, a fantastic shower, iron and board in the cupboard with slippers and robes. A coffee machine, a big safe in case you have been to Bond St! 

We turned down turn down service as I've never really seen the point and went off to dinner locally. The hotel is very peaceful at night with no background noise to disturb sleep and in the morning we had the full English option for breakfast. I always look at the healthy options however.....

It was soon time to get back home but as Arnie would say if he was with his wife, ""we'll be back""",5,2015,08,31
122,Lovely weekend stay,"We stayed here for two nights in August - Friday and Saturday. Check in was really easy and we were escorted to our 'suite' which overlooked the harbour on floor two by the receptionist who checked us in which was a nice touch. Our suite had a separate lounge area where our daughter's bed was put up and another separate bedroom. Bathroom was large with bath, two sinks, separate shower which was fabulous. Tea/coffee making area was great and we really liked having a balcony to sit out on as we had hot weather The bed was huge and just wonderfully comfortable! Wish we could've brought it home with us. 
We visited the spa which was lovely as was the pool area. We ate in the restaurant one evening managing to eat alfresco. Food was very good. We also had breakfast in the restaurant quite expensive I thought (£17.50 for continental) but good choice of items. 
It was our daughter's birthday while we were there and I had emailed the hotel to let them know. They very kindly delivered a dessert to the room with 'happy birthday ' in chocolate. Nice touch and much appreciated. 
I have only two negatives - I called down to housekeeping three times on the two nights we stayed to get some extra sugar to the room and I was ignored twice. Secondly the hotel is on the flight path to Heathrow and on the Friday evening we were there we had one plane a minute over head (low enough to read their livery!) till around 9pm. This only happened on the Friday night nothing like it on the Saturday night. 
Also be aware the hotel is quite a way from central London sights - a taxi was about £25 one way. Not a problem for us we wanted to stay in Chelsea so we were prepared for this. 
Have to say would stay here again, lovely hotel despite my two niggles. Really enjoyable.",4,2015,08,23
122,The place to conduct your business!,The Chelsea Harbour is the place for your business meetings. The hotel has excellent installations and has all the required infrastructure required to support your event. The rooms are confortable and the restaurant is fantastic.,5,2015,08,23
122,Excellent in every way as usual,"Always when in London this is our choice of hotel.  All suites and we have stayed in quite a lot of them over the years. Front of house staff really friendly and efficient, especially Tobias.  Food in the restaurant very good and wine waiter John advised us on choice of wine to go with the food. The housekeeping staff are spot on with everything in the rooms and the attention to detail is good as I am a really fussy guest. I usually have a massage with Louise but I forgot to forward book and the schedule was full, so will remember nest time.  Overall stay was as we expect perfect.  This 5 star hotel is not at all stuffy and they look after the guests impeccably.  Will certainly be back.",5,2015,08,23
122,Very nice,Had a lovely stay here for one night mid week. Staff are very helpful and friendly. We stayed in the Marina view suite - very spacious with separate living area and a very comfortable bed. The spa has a lovely large pool but we were disappointed that the steam and sauna are located in the changing rooms so you can't go in together as a couple. Breakfast was expensive but delicious! Overall a lovely hotel in a great area. The only downfall was our 'marina view' was very limited and was also spoilt by the paved rooftop that our balcony looked onto. It was littered with rubbish and weeds. Really surprised that such a nice hotel could overlook this. ,4,2015,08,20
122,Loads of room ,"Stayed for one night over the bank holiday weekend, plenty of space in the room with an individual lounge. A large bathroom with a powerful shower and the whole place was clean. The only fault is the room was very warm causing a bit of a restless sleep. ",3,2015,08,16
122,Totally Disgusted,"We made a reservation through Kayak for the night of August 12th
Kayak sent us an email asking us to check in on the morning of the 12th by email which we duly did
They replied saying our reservation was confirmed and we could check in at 3pm
My wife arrived first and was told they did not have a room for us but could accommodate us at another inferior hotel belonging to them
I arrived later and was told by the duty manager the same thing 
When I asked for an explanation he said well the people hadn't moved out of the room
I of course tried to explain that surely when a person makes a reservation they are expected to leave on the day required 
He would not give a satisfactory answer and kept hedging 
When I said the real reason was I had booked the room through Kayak at a big discounted rate and he was able to sell the room at a bigger rate he denied any knowledge of this
I found this impossible to believe 
They hadn't bothered to inform us earlier in the day and waited until we arrived to inform us after we had traveled up from the country 
Totally disgusting never again will I deal with Kayak or Millennium Hotels",1,2015,08,14
122,Beautiful view overlooking the harbour,"We had a lovely weekend break here. The location, our room and room service were very good.
The pool we found to be average but the shower/sauna area was done nicely. The breakfast buffet was good; the restaurant itself very nice.",5,2015,08,13
122,Luxurious hotel with friendly staff,"I took my family to London for 6 days/5 nights this August. This review will be, as is my custom, comprehensive and will include both pros and cons. None of the cons were sufficient to detract from a five-star review. There is also some advice regarding the London experience as a whole and does not reflect upon the hotel, but I will try to be clear on this when applicable. 

The hotel is about a 45 minute cab ride from London Heathrow Airport. One suggestion I may make to the hotel would be to have advice on the website as far as the best way to get there. The Chelsea Harbour Hotel website has information on typical travel times only, but no recommendations for what lines to take, etc. We used the ""minicab"" pre-booked taxi service to get from the airport to the hotel. Not sure if it was a deal, and taxis are not difficult to find in London. The longest we ever waited for one (unless pre-booked) was about 2 minutes. There appeared to be a taxi or two usually waiting outside the hotel, and apparently there is a light the hotel has that acts like a ""bat-signal"" for taxis when a guest needs one. 

If traveling light and feeling adventurous, you can get to the hotel from Heathrow via train for less money. While not close to the central London tourist attractions, an important advantage of the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for tourists is that it is very close to the Imperial Wharf overground train station. Tourists are well-advised to be as prepared as possible to use the London Transportation system (including overground trains, underground subway system ""the tube"" and the famous double-decker buses). Carry a London A to Z guide book to help you plan your journeys. Get an Oyster Card. It's worth it.

Back to my review. The hotel is truly luxurious. The rooms are suites with a living area, a bedroom, and one and a half bathrooms. The bathroom is equipped with a tub, a bidet, and a very cool digital shower (I think I invented this in my head long ago, but never patented it... alas). There are flat-screen televisions in both rooms. Coffee/espresso maker. WiFi is included and was sufficient for our needs. We brought plenty of adapters for electronic devices, but there are a couple of sockets that looked universal or at least compatible with US plugs. 

We splurged and got a room for the parents and another one for the kids. We probably didn't need to do that, because there is a pull-out couch in the living area, but we didn't know that ahead of time. We made a special request in advance for rooms close together. We were on the same floor, but not close, but we arrived to the hotel quite early and the staff were doing their best to accommodate us and get our sorry lot of overnight travelers into our rooms long before the usual check-in time. 

We interacted with numerous staff and found them invariably friendly, professional, and genuinely helpful. Beatrix was the first concierge who worked with us, and she really went out of her way to help us get settled in. 

The room was very comfortable: the bed, the pillows, the room temperature were all very pleasant. There is complementary water (outside the minibar, of course), and the staff made sure we were adequately stocked in this regard. The room was surprisingly quiet, being in a city and being close to a train station (though I could hear the train if I was making an effort). Our room had a balcony, but it did not get much use because we did not have much of a view (I think there are premium rooms with a view of the river).

There is an in-hotel restaurant: the Chelsea Harbor Brasserie. We ate breakfast there three mornings, but did not eat lunch or dinner there. The breakfast is expensive, but this did not surprise me from a luxury hotel. There is a ""tasting table"" for breakfast, which is a buffet continental breakfast. You may order food as an alternative to the buffet. I ordered pancakes one morning. Americans will find this dish well-presented, but disappointingly small. (Heard of ""dollar"" pancakes? Think ""pence"" pancakes.) Don't bother. When we arrived, hot food items (eggs, bacon, sausage, other items) were part of the buffet, but apparently there was a management decision over the weekend to discontinue that, and the hot food was gone when we ate there last on Monday morning. The price of the tasting table was the same. While I enjoyed the remainder of the cold options, be aware that there are many local options for breakfast requiring only a modest inconvenience. I will try to review at least one of these, once I complete this tome. 

It is also my custom, as a triathlete, to review fitness options at and around a hotel. The Chelsea Harbour Hotel has a real, honest-to-goodness lap pool. 17 meters, which is a distance I can actually register on my Garmin Swim. The pool is located in the spa, which has towels, showers, lockers, etc. I was never there when the spa was busy. The pool has three lanes, and during the only chance I had to swim, I was by myself. Family with kids: there is no lifeguard, so plan accordingly. Check with the spa staff regarding pool hours, which are shorter than the spa hours, and it closes early on the weekends. For runners, the Chelsea Harbour Hotel is convenient to the Thames River. That's the good news. The bad news is that there is no continuous running path along the Thames. There are running paths, but these are broken up by construction and other areas without a path. It is not as easy as just following the river. I got lost twice on runs in London, but locals were more than happy to direct me back to Chelsea. My best run was when I headed east from the hotel, crossed the Albert bridge (you kind of have to), went through a park, found my way through the city back to the Riverside walk, then was treated to a stretch of relatively contiguous paths with (starting about five miles from the hotel) great views of well-known London landmarks. Cyclists: you are on your own. Bicycles are everywhere in the city, ridden in heavy traffic by incredibly brave people who don't mind getting buzzed by double-decker buses. I myself got a bit close to one when foot traffic forced me off the sidewalk for a few moments. That said, the hotel spa is equipped with cardio equipment, so you have indoor exercise options if you are so inclined. 

When it comes time to leave, there is a business center on the bottom floor that you may use to check in for your flight and print boarding passes. I saw some nice conference rooms on that floor, though I was not there for business. 

In sum, we had an enjoyable time staying at this hotel. We would recommend it to friends, acquaintances, and you, dear reader. We would stay there again.",5,2015,08,12
122,Gorgeous !!,"Stayed only one night as we had a ball to attend that evening in the hotel, faultless, staff were helpful, hotel was clean, breakfast (as it was the only hotel meal we ate) delicious !!

Will be back at the spa soon fingers crossed !! x",5,2015,08,11
122,Not the place to stay to access Central London,"This hotel offers a high standard of accommodation with excellent en suite facilities. The bedroom/sitting area is spacious with a large and comfortable bed; the whole hotel is pristine clean. Food and drink prices are at a level commensurate with this class of hotel. Reception and front of house staff were friendly and professional, but a hapless waiter in the bar and an erratic waiter in the restaurant spoilt otherwise good service. Despite all the good points, there are no ""nice touches"" about the place. Given the prices, an amuse bouche would have set the tone for the evening meal and whilst there are bedroom tea making facilities, to charge £3 for a two finger KitKat conveys some sort of symbolism!

The small Chelsea Harbour is attractive, but the Hotel is set in a sterile area of endless modern apartment blocks and commercial properties with no shops or restaurants in the vicinity. Unless each journey is taken by taxi, the nearby Imperial Wharf Overground station has to be used to link with the Tube & bus routes into Central London. I would not recommend this hotel for those wishing to visit theatres, museums & the London sights.",4,2015,08,10
122,Excellent,"I haves used this hotel may be a couple if times a month and have my staff stay here occasionally as well haven't stayed myself, it's an excellent hotel all round and perfect for US visitors. Kings road is walking distance and full Chelsea life.",5,2015,08,08
122,Above and Beyond....,"Our stay was great, the rooms are Spacious just what we needed having two teenage kids. Staff went beyond on all levels, Reception, housekeeping and all. Sherry from reservations was amazing, never experienced her level of assistance. Tobias, Front office Manager, truely a gentleman and over helpful. Stephanie the GM met me in the morning as I was going for a run on the river, only possible at such a great location. Thanks to all, we will be back.",5,2015,08,08
122,An experience to remember at a top quality hotel with friendly staff and great views.,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in August 2015.

On arrival we were told by the friendly receptionist that the management had upgraded us free of charge to the Kensington pent house suite. The lady then took us to our room and showed us around.

We were very impressed with the high standard of our room, it was spacious with a lovely view over the harbour from our balcony. It was the best hotel room we have ever stayed in! 

Throughout our short stay we were treated very kindly by all staff and made to feel very special, with all staff being very friendly, polite and helpful.

The hotel itself is lovely, with high standards of cleanliness and also food. We really enjoyed eating breakfast out on the terrace, overlooking the harbour.

I don't usually leave reviews but wanted to say how much we enjoyed our time at the hotel and how much we appreciated the free upgrade to the pent house suit and the amazing level of service that was provided.

I have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone and hope to stay here again when we are in London in future.

122,top quality hotel with lovely view,stay in the savile suite as before. the room is very clean and spacious make us very comfortable. Tv room provided extra entertainment for my son.Breakfast was wonderful and the staff were friendly.  everything was luxurious.,5,2015,08,01
122,"Back again, so that should say something...","We returned to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for a weekend having been there in January.
Hotel remains a great find.  The rooms are really nice (suites) and the staff really couldn't be any more helpful.  It does require a walk, taxi ride or bus trip along the Kings Road to get to more of the touristy areas, but Chelsea itself is a very interesting place.
The only downside was that as we were two couples we booked two rooms, emailed to say could we have adjoining rooms and ended up one on the 3rd and one on the 5th floor.  I never quite understand why hotels don't try and put you together?",4,2015,07,31
122,Unexpectedly Great,"This hotel exceeded my expectations.  Very good staff that were quick to serve and look after you. Hotel was neat and clean . Breakfast was better than some of the more expensive 5 star places I have stayed. Rooms where good with plenty of space,good sized TV and all other amenities are in the room. 

My only downside was the hair salon, which although I thought was part of the hotel , is a sub contractor . My hair cut experience was one of price gouging, I am a male with little hair and was charged £75 for a cut that normally costs me £5. The barber also managed to apply some sort of solution that blistered my skin and caused it to peel.
 I have brought this to the managements attention .

I am still rating this high just be aware of the barber.

122,Wonderful hotel!,I stayed at the Hotel 4 Nights And it was just wonderful! Suite is big and comfortable. The air conditioning worked well (outside was 24 degrees). The surrounding area is quiet pleasant and romantic. Everything in the rooms was high quality. The bed is among the best I've slept on them. Everything was luxurious and made the difference. The staff was very friendly. Transportation from the hotel convenient.,5,2015,07,26
122,Pleasant stay,"We stayed for 4 nights for holiday, and were overall very satisfied with our stay, The suite was spacious and well equipped, and bed was very comfortable. The service was mostly very good and attentive, although a bit slowish at breakfast. The breakfast was average and not quite constant in quality. The location was nice and peaceful, although maybe a bit far away if you only want to explore  central London.",4,2015,07,26
122,"Excellent Stay, Quiet Location",Stayed here for one night and would definitely return.  The suites are spacious and of a high standard. The food in the restaurant is very good and a special thank you goes to Roberto the restaurant manager who went out of his way to make our evening a memorable one.,5,2015,07,26
122,Excellent Hotel.,"We love this Hotel.  Have stayed many times.  Spacious rooms.  The quietest hotel in London. Location is beautiful, walks, coffee shops and restaurants nearby.  Staff and Spa are excellent.  I always book the Spa break.  Well done Chelsea Harbour.",5,2015,07,25
122,"Excellent hotel, service, all around experience","This was my first time staying at this hotel.  I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel last time I was in town and I must say this hotel is on par with that experience.  I had a rough journey flying into London, arrived a day later than I anticipated due to airline issues with the plane and an unruly passenger which caused a force landing due to a security issue.  It made the national news but the result for me was being awake for over 48 hours with no sleep by the time I reached the hotel.  Check in was quick and efficient and they rushed me straight up to my room where I could pass out with exhaustion.  Breakfast the next morning was included with the room and it was fantastic as well.  Loved the view out my window of the Harbour just off the River Thames.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London. ",5,2015,07,25
122,Hidden 5 star gem just off the London beaten track,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel has great views, and a singular advantage
over most hotels in its class - every room is in fact a proper suite. Modern,
clean and a lovely full English breakfast. Not cheap - but worth it !!!",5,2015,07,22
122,Excellent Hotel,"Took my teenage daughter to London for the weekend as a treat, and needed somewhere a bit peaceful to stay... this place turned out to be perfect. Lovely location where you can walk along the river, it's easy to travel into the city (train station is just across the road) and there's a good coffee shop and a Tesco on the other side of the station for your everyday needs.  The staff were extremely helpful, the room was spacious and comfortable, but what made this hotel great for me were the little touches - coming back after a hard day's shopping and finding an ice bucket to put my drinks into, slippers at the side of my bed and the wardrobe door slightly open to remind me that there's a fluffy white towelling robe in there if I need it.  Breakfast was also fantastic, sitting out on the terrace of a gorgeous marina to eat is a good start to any busy day.  I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,21
122,"Lovely Birthday treat, highly recommended","Me and my mother visited for an 18th Birthday present. We were extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and our balcony had a lovely view. The room and living area was spacious and the bathroom was complete with twin sinks. They even left a birthday dessert for me while we were out shopping. New bottled water was replaced throughout the day and it is these touches including the friendly staff who made this visit memorable.
There were two private functions while we stayed but this did not interfere with our night one bit! 
We used the spa facilities and found the pool area great for lounging and the spa and relaxation centre was clean with friendly staff.
Overall I would happily stay again! 
We used the tube during our stay but it does take a few changes to get to the centre of London.",5,2015,07,18
122,Hen weekend - Luxury perfect!,"5 girls on a hen weekend, 2 suites on 5th floor. 

Service - was excellent from the door staff, reception and spa. Barman very slow but friendly. We are a group of girls who smoke, like a drink and are happy to carry their own bags! Door staff in particular were a good laugh - we didn't feel out of place despite it being a very nice place! We didn't eat in the restaurant but had one drink in the bar - usual London prices £10-£14 a drink. 

Room - Our suite had a balcony (room 521 I think), a huge king size bed, lovely bathroom, two toilets, living area and spacious wardrobe. Our friends (room 505 I think) had very similar less the balcony and I think the bed was smaller. The room was extremely clean and tidy and housekeeping came in again in the evening to draw the curtains, top up anything required and turn on the lamps. 

Location - 2 mins walk from Imperial Warf over ground station. Regular taxis at the hotel - staff will signal them for you. Small Tesco round the corner although we didn't use it. 5 mins (£6ish) to Bluebird, Chelsea in a taxi! Worth a look! 

Spa - basic but very nice. Pool, sauna and steam room. Open until 8pm.",5,2015,07,14
122,A nice spot away from the hustle and bustle of London,"I love this hotel due to its quiet location and spacious suites.  It is a short walk to the river taxi, train station or Kings Road.  The only reason why I haven't given it a 5 star this time is because of the very slow service in the bar and restaurant, for the four nights we stayed here.  If you keep an eye out you may spot a celebrity or two ...",4,2015,07,13
122,We always stay here each year for Wimbledon,"Lovely hotel. Lots of players here too.  
Rooms overlooking the river are superb. 
Food excellent.  Easy access to Wimbledon and great Lebanese and Thai Restaurant just around the corner near the river front.
Definitely recommend.",5,2015,07,13
122,Would stay here again,"Lovely hotel within easy travelling distance of Wimbledon. Quiet location but well connected by Tube and overground rail connections. Well appointed suite, staff helpful and friendly. Unfortunately WiFi very slow. Excellent food at the terrace restaurant. Will visit again if we get tickets for the tennis next year.",4,2015,07,11
122,Chelsea Harbour 2015,"Lovely place to stay, on the river, short walk to Stamford Bridge, home of Chelsea FC, and good links to other attractions.

Fulham Broadway and plenty of busses provide the most effective transport, but taxis are abundant too. Don't forget to get a Oyster Card to save cash. 

Parking nearby also easy, but typical London 24 hour cost around £27.  

Quality hotel with great overnight accommodation.

Rooms overlooking the harbour are at a premium, but add the extra special touch.  
",5,2015,07,10
122,Short stay,"Just returned from 2 night stay and once again found the hotel to be excellent. Very clean, comfortable, with luxurious bathroom and fab pillows. Wi fi a little slow but not so bad. Ate at the brassiere staff very helpful, friendly and caring & food good. Swimming pool clean and facilities 5 *. All staff polite helpful and friendly.
Useful little store is just outside hotel sells little snacks drink etc. Highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2015,07,09
122,Visiting my niece who is studying at Imperial College London,Stayed weekend of 12/6/15 seemed out of the way hotel but easy access to tube and local restaurants. River view suite fantastic. Magical family evening on the terrace. Varied food and drink on offer at reasonable prices. Very helpful staff. I look forward to my return in September.,5,2015,07,05
122,When Only the Best Will Do,"When only the very best will do the Chelsea Harbour Hotel won't disappoint, if ever a hotel merits 7 stars this one does, what distinguishes it is the exceptional courtesy and professionalism of the staff without exception, each of them a credit and absolute asset to the Hotel and Millennium brand. 
",5,2015,07,03
122,"Awesome room, Terrible Service","I stayed in a river view suite.  The view was lovely and the room was spacious and well appointed.  No complaints at all about the accommodations.  The problem was the service -- it was simply awful.  The service was bad if this were a Motel 6 and simply unimaginably bad for an expensive 5 start hotel in London. A few examples: 

1.  I called to find out if I could check in a little early.  After being transferred to a number that never answered I called back.  They told me the reception desk was busy and there was no way to know whether they had a room ready unless I showed up.  I did, with family in tow.  The were annoyed that I was there and told me no rooms were available.
2.  I went to the bar to get a beer and do a bit of work. To say the service was bad would be an insult to people who actually try to provide service.  They were rude and unresponsive.  The drinks were outrageously priced -- if you can get someone to give you a menu and take your order.  It took 30 minutes to get a beer -- and that was by trying really hard.  Others in the restaurant were so annoyed they go angry and stormed out.
3.  I needed to get transportation arranged for an early morning trip to the train station.  I called down from my room several times the night before and no one answered the phone.  I finally got in bed and tried to call from bed before I went to sleep -- except the phone in the bedroom didn't work.

I could go on with examples.  This is nowhere near a 5 star hotel.  I paid a lot for it and was very disappointed.  I encourage you to look elsewhere until they get their serious service problems under control.",2,2015,07,02
122,you get what you pay for,"Nice hotel - reasonable room rate, all rooms are suites. location is a bit of a pain for getting into central LDN but ideal for West. 
Good enough pool/gym area.
Food at hotel was good.
Room service excellent
Friendly (obvs) staff",4,2015,07,02
122,Ok but nothing to write home about.,"Stayed here with my husband who was on business. It was ok but it didn't feel 5star. It felt a bit sole less.  The rooms/suite are big but very beige. It didn't have a modern feel to it.The wi-fi didn't work and the refreshments weren't refilled thought our stay. We were out both evenings until late so we couldn't be bothered to chase this up, and really for a 5 star hotel you shouldn't have to. It ment we couldn't  have a drink first thing though.We only had 2 tea bags and no milk or coffee.dont think there was a turn down service in the evening either, or if there was you don't get a chocolate. The rooms are clean though. Breakfast again was average. Not a strawberry in site in June. Didn't get any service after I was sat down at breakfast on the second day. Wasn't asked if I wanted toast or more coffee and my used dishes stayed on the table throughout.  It's also quite a trek into London. Not the worst place I've ever stayed but not the best either.",3,2015,07,01
122,Great choice for family stays!,"I stayed at the Chelsea Harbour hotel with my wife and two daughters for a week. While pricey on a per-room basis, it is an all-suite hotel (bedroom + generously sized living room with room for a double sofa bed).

Location is a bit out of the way, but the Imperial Wharf London Overground station is minutes away. There is also easy bus access to Earl's court, the westfield centre in shepherd's bush, king's road, knightsbridge and piccadilly.

Service is not bad, and the rooms, while not spectacular, are well appointed.

Overall, strongly recommend it to anyone travelling with young children and wanting to avoid getting two small hotel rooms",4,2015,06,30
122,Great place!,"This is my favourite hotel in London. I tried several others five stars hotel in London but still Chealsea Harbour is the best for me. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, facing the amazing harbour, you can enjoy the river view. The brasserie is very good, tasty mediterranean food. Nice spa and pool. 10 minutes walking distance from New King's Road. Great place!",5,2015,06,30
122,Simply Amazing,"i spent a great time in this hotel, the room was very nice and clean, food and room service were nice and tasty, all the staff was very polite and friendly, but between them the star was Roberto, thank you Roberto you gave me a great service during my dinner, you have been very professional and helpful.
I would like meet people like you in every hotel that i will go, cos you make me feel more close to home, I travel a lot for business and most of the people that i have meet are just shadows,  you Roberto are simply amazing, the closest meaning of the word ""hospitality"".

Set up was beautiful, restaurant room confortable and staff was friendly and helpfuly, food was incredible!! Special mention for Roberto, our waiter was funny, polite and professional! We will come back for sure!!",5,2015,06,28
122,Excellent hotel in quiet location ,"We stayed here for 3 nights en route to Vancouver from South Africa. 
The hotel location was perfect. It is in an upmarket area of London away from all the noise and tourists. 
In spite of this, there was a train station just opposite that connected with the underground. 
Taxis were also available. 
Check in was smooth and we were helped by friendly staff. 

We had a junior suite with a sofa bed for the kids. 
Room was very comfortable and neatly decorated. It had 2 separate loos and a separate bath and shower. Very convenient when 4 people are in the room. 

Breakfast was reasonable well catered for and due to an early departure we were offered room service as the breakfast area was not open at the time. 

The only fault was that the breakfast staff seemed very stodgy and unfriendly. Service was good but a smile goes a long way. 

Will stay here again when visiting London. 
",5,2015,06,27
122,Return visitor to this lovely hotel,"On this occasion - celebrated my special milestone birthday with family.  Always a warm welcome here, staff very friendly.  Rooms are immaculate. Paid for breakfast which was plentiful and varied.
The Spa are is pleasant - but some areas could do with an upgrade.   

would recommend.",4,2015,06,26
122,One night stay - Disappointing,"Bad start: A day after booking a 2 room suite for 3 people I received an email telling me I would be charged an extra £48 for making up the sofa bed (not mentioned on the booking page). My reply expressing disappointment was not responded to.

We arrived before the 3pm check in time but were not given the room cards until after 3.30 (when I approached the desk to remind them for the second time). Again, no explanation given. Although the staff were courteous, other 5 star hotels offer refreshments and apologies if check in is delayed.

The suite was spacious though shabby. Liked the espresso machine and powerful shower.

We soon went to the 'relaxing' spa, where 2/3 of the pool were given over to children's swimming lessons until 6pm. The 2 instructors were yelling throughout and one was periodically encouraging a kid to gargle water and spit. Disgusting. The spa receptionist was genuinely apologetic and said she'd pass on my comments to management but I never got any feedback.

Our dinner in the brasserie was of a decent standard and we took advantage of the 20% (I think) guest discount.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the uneven and uncomfortable sofa bed I paid £48 for. Not a good night's sleep.

My overall impression is that this hotel prioritises short term financial gain over strong customer service. Not 5 star standard.",2,2015,06,26
122,Fantastic Stay,"Lovely room with Harbour view. Spacious & clean couldnt fault it. Staff friendly & very helpful. Excellent location. 
If i have to write a negative breakfast is overpriced so the 2nd morning we got a takeaway toasted sandwich from around the corner. 
Overall we had a fantastic stay and would definitley use the hotel again without a doubt.",4,2015,06,25
122,Much better,"Stayed here again. My last stay was six months ago. Much better welcom. All staff very cheerful and pleasant. Good room nice view. 
Ran out of coffee, tea and milk and called down to get more. This took over 20 minutes and I had call again. 10 minutes (30) in all a man arrives at the door, with tea and coffee and no milk! I asked where was the milk and he told me to call room service. This was not acceptable as I would expect it just to be sorted especially in s hotel of this supposed quality. 
Trying to get internet connection was hard. It kept going to BT fon and tried to charge me. On the search the Chelsea harbour connection rally showed. When it did and I was connected trying to keep the connection was hard work this needs sorting out as nowadays a wifi connection is expected to be there send to work. 
Surprised to see a blown bulb in the bathroom room would have hoped at these prices for everything to be working. So... Getting better but not at the standard for the price they charge.",4,2015,06,25
122,10 leisurely days with family in London,"My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Harbor for nine days in May/June.  A fabulous location, quiet and peaceful away from the bustle of London.  Hard to believe one is only a cab or short tube ride away from Hyde Park.  We also walked everywhere from this superb spot.

Great all suite configuration, a little tired in places.  We chose a hotel over a vacation home rental and it worked out very well.  Dining was lovely, in both the dining room and cafe.  Most rooms with a water view. My husband enjoyed the fitness center.

I am hoping they will refurbish a bit in the years to come as it is such a special and unique hotel, but would consider staying again regardless.  Close to Chelsea and Fulham - which we both love - for fabulous Michelin restaurants.  On the Thames too.

Great staff - very accommodating.  A really special hotel.",4,2015,06,24
122,Fantastic Room & Great Service,"Stayed for one night in a suite with a balcony overlooking the harbour and bit of the Thames. Extremely comfortable bed, large rooms inc two televisions, bathroom with bath and separate hi-tech power shower. 

As it was a last minute unexpected stay, toiletries were promptly sent up.

Only minor negative is that they are on the flightpath (as is most of London now - so can't be helped) so if you sleep with the windows/patio doors open be prepared for early morning noise, but apart from that the area was very peaceful.

Lovely hotel, excellent staff and service.",5,2015,06,24
122,"Helpful staff, disappointing restaurant","I'd booked this for me and my wife as we were visiting London for a couple of days.  The reviews were excellent, so I was expecting the best and that is waht we received.  I could have no complaints about the hotel, facilities, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the room was a lovely surprise as we werent expecting it to be so nice.  The restaurant however, was a massive letdown.  After a day at the races we headed back to the hotel to eat.  The service whilst friendly, was almost non-existent.  We were shown a table, then left for 10 minutes before anyone asked if we would like a drink, and our order was taken.  At one point, one of the waiters took our bottle of wine and was about to fill glasses on the table next to us!!",5,2015,06,24
122,Choose Your Room Carefully,"I booked and paid for 2 nights but left after only one and went home due to the noise.  The room was situated overlooking a train station which was very noisy from the early hours.  It also didn't help that the cast of Stomp were staying in the room above, which with the tiled floors proved to be noisy too.  The rooms themselves are well appointed, though I was disappointed to see a dirty toilet seat when I arrived.  The staff were extremely friendly, though I would have appreciated having my second night refunded",3,2015,06,23
122,2 nights on business,"Very nice location coupled with superb staff made up for rather dull rooms and an impersonal bar area.

I was there for business in the neighborhood and appreciated being to central in London without the hustle and bustle.The breakfast was one of the best I have ever had on a hotel in Europe.

I will be back!",4,2015,06,23
122,Phenomenal!!!!,"My husband and I recently stayed here for my birthday and all I can say is WOW! From the moment we arrived we were treated to 5 star treatment without the snobbery! The staff are unbelievably accommodating and we even received a call to our room 2 hours in to check we were happy with everything and whether they could do anything to improve our stay. I mentioned that maybe I would like a couple more coffees for our room and within 1 minute a lovely man was at my door with a handful! 

From the exquisite room to the personal touches including a turn down in the evening we were impressed. This hotel would suit families and couples alike. Whilst the hotel is very well appointed, there was no animosity or disapproving looks when we saw children being children. 

This hotel deserves a visit from anyone wanting to be next to the city but with the peace and quiet! 

We cannot wait to return!!!

Well done chelsea harbour hotel. Don't ever change!!!",5,2015,06,22
122,fantastic,"We stayed at the Chelsea Harbour for 3 nights in June in a marina view suite. The hotel, room and staff were all excellant. I would recommend this hotel if you enjoy comfort in great surroundings. The suites are spacious and the added bonus of the balcony over looking the marina was excellant.
The staff were friendly and very helpful, the location was perfect for us, as it was quiet but only a short distance to restaurants and bars.
We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast and this was pleasant and relaxing.
I would definatly recommend this hotel if you like luxury in pleasant surroundings, we will definately return.",5,2015,06,22
122,Fabulous room,"Stayed for one night in a suite with a balcony, side view of the Eye and Thames.  Extremely comfortable room, two televisions, bathroom with bath and separate shower.  A bit away from a lot of the tourist attractions but this meant that it was also very quiet and we had a very peaceful night. Lovely hotel, excellent breakfast and very welcoming staff. Definitely recommended.",4,2015,06,20
122,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"I have never before stayed in an all suite hotel before in the United Kingdom. I reserved the Chelsea Harbour hotel through a newspaper special offer and having read the reviews here in Tripadvisor, I was hopeful that it would be a good experience.

My stay here has been much better than a good experience. The hotel is modern and my suite, number 408 ( I paid for an upgrade at reception from city view to Marina view)  is very spacious, clean and well equipped with an excellent view across the Marina with a little bit of a River view.  I have found the staff all to be very friendly and very enthusiastic. 

The restaurant is good and whilst not cheap, offers in my opinion good value for money,  especially given the location and the view.  I had dinner in the restaurant the first night that I arrived and enjoyed sitting out on the terrace overlooking the marina. The buffet breakfast which I had this morning included bakeries, cereals, juices, fresh fruits  and the standard selection of cooked hot dishes, including bacon, sausages, beans, hash browns, mushrooms and scrambled eggs. It was an excellent start to the day.
  
Room 408 is very large and comfortable. It features a separate living room and bedroom, the bedroom having its own ensuite.  In addition when you enter Room 408  you come into a very practical entrance hall, with an umbrella already in a stand. With a guest toilet to your left, going straight on brings you into your bright living room  through an entrance  door, whilst taking the door to your right brings you into the dressing area  of the bedroom.  The balcony of the living room is very usable and overlooks the marina.

There are a few small items that I feel could be improved. In the bedroom there is a real shortage of power points, especially near the bed so that you can recharge your  mobile phone and use it as an alarm next to the bed.  Whilst the digital alarm clock does have an iPhone charger built into the top of it, it is the old type of charger and thus not suitable for people who have an iPhone 5 or later model.  Perhaps the hotel should consider replacing the bedside table lamps  with lamps which include powered USB outlets, thus allowing any model of smart phone to be recharged.

The Wi-Fi reception in room 408 is weak and not stable.  Having enquired with reception, they very quickly provided me with a cat 5 cable so that I could connect my computer to the wired Internet point by the desk and that truly delivered a fast and reliable Internet connection. I then created my own Wi-Fi hotspot from my computer which enabled me to provide fast Internet access to my smart phone.

The above points however are quite minor and I would certainly consider using this hotel again.",5,2015,06,18
122,"Fabulous hotel, fantastic staff who did everything to make our stay perfect!","Was a little apprehensive when I decided to try a different London location as I always prefer to opt for the West End but as it was a treat for my Husband I decided to stay out of my comfort zone and I'm so glad I did. From the moment we arrived the door staff greeted as if we had been staying at the hotel forever! A special thanks must be given to Helen on reception who booked us in and checked us out with such professionalism and warmth, making us feel so comfortable and throughout our two night stay was constantly on hand, asking if we were happy with everything. We opted for room service when we arrived on the Friday and the food was excellent, as was the breakfast! The Concierges knowledge was just what you want when you are not sure of the area and after my Husband asked for a good steak restaurant we were directed to Sophie's on the Fulham road, which did not disappoint. The whole ambience of this hotel is wonderful. The Management should be proud of the team they have. We will definitely be staying again and hope to use more of the facilities on our next visit!",5,2015,06,15
122,Wonderful stay at the Chelsea Harbour,"We recently had a lovely two day stay at the hotel for my birthday! The suites were gorgeous and we had a lovely view of the marina in suite 514! The food was excellent as were the staff, they couldn't do enough for you and were all so friendly! Thank you Chelsea Harbour for our fab stay, we will return!  Sue & Gordon (From Dorset)",5,2015,06,13
122,Outstanding experience and friendly staff,"I had the pleasure to stay in the hotel during my trip to London with my wife, location and view were spectacular, amazing view over the Marina clean and spacious suite. Manager ""Stephanie Segoura"" was very hospitable and always readily available  to serve with a nice smile on her lovely face. Will definitely consider this venue for next trips..

122,Suite,"Stayed here, with my friend to celebrate my birthday. Had a wonderful suite, with twin beds ( as requested) and a sitting room. Fantastic bathroom with a shower you could pause! Seperate toilet too- brilliant. 
Was a beautiful room, we had breakfast in our room, which was also wonderful.
The only niggles, with the room was the lack of sockets. One didn't work, and there was only one by the desk, which in today's world of technology, though there would have been more. There was a fantastic looking coffee machine-( another socket behind this if you moved everything)  which, just couldn't fathom how to get large mugs under- so coffee was going everywhere. I do hate it, when, they go to all this trouble and then you still get UHT milk in the fridge; wasn't replenished either :(   . 
The view over the harbour, was glorious, lovely sitting there, for Sunday morning coffee and papers. 
All in all, a beautiful hotel. Thank you .",4,2015,06,09
122,be careful of steep hidden extra bed charges,"we had to travel to a wedding. I booked a stay and was restricted to a suite to allow for family occupancy  - despite clearly stating 2 children and ages in the booking process, whilst we attended wedding our babysitter was asked to agree £40 for each extra bed - she called us and as we couldn't deal with it remotely, we said no. We got no sleep as all 4 then in one bed.  Next morning, check out lady showed little to no interest in complaint.  shame because the hotel otherwise was stunning!",2,2015,06,04
122,A resort downtown London,"This is the kind of Hotel  that will convince your wife that you love her. Take her there and your year is done. The extraordinary breakfast on the sunny terrace facing the kind of yachts you want to own but not to pay. 
The staff is kind and act the way you expect.",5,2015,06,01
122,"Last Wednesday.Travelled for two days to meet a client in London, quiet and relaxed rooms",After a long day at conference room I decided to have few drinks in the bar. I was surprised by the lovely setting on the harbour and loved sitting outside. Good drinks list and great service although they were clearly busy.,5,2015,06,01
122,Lovely hotel for Chelsea Flower Show,"We wanted to try a new hotel and for this trip it needed to be near to Chelsea Flower Show and the Design Center. Perfect choice, esp for the latter. This was a special occasion, a mum and daughter quality time together and the staff at the hotel ( Esp Piotr in Guest services, who went out of his way to ensure a lovely stay) helped to make it so.",5,2015,05,31
122,Lovely hotel,Stayed for one night whilst visiting the design centre. Lovely view of Chelsea harbour from my room. Had breakfast in my room which was very nice. Helpful staff at reception. Would recommend this hotel.,5,2015,05,30
122,"Clean, Comfortable, Chelsea Hotel!","We recently enjoyed a great stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.  Upon arrival, the greeting was warm, check in simple and friendly, and our room was a lovely suite!  It was immaculately clean, with great facilities and a really comfortable stay.  My only criticism is that there was no coffee in the tea and coffee facilities but a very minor point and if we were staying for more than one night i would have asked for some.  We will definitely stay here again. Great location, service and comfort.",4,2015,05,27
122,Needs to up its game,"Stayed two nights.  First, the plus points: great location for all things Chelsea, like King's Road, Chelsea Flower Show, great pubs and restaurants; suite was very pleasant; first day's breakfast (buffet) was good.  Now the minus points: balcony from room very drab, with supporting pillar filthy; balcony overlooks the huge paved area (bar roof) which is covered in weeds and uneven paving slabs - looks awful! second day's breakfast (a la carte) was very poor - dried up bacon, cold poached eggs, incredibly salty black pudding, both mine and my partner's order was incorrect; dinner in the brasserie the previous night was really poor - my (expensive!!)crab pasta with chilli and spring onions had no noticeable chilli or spring onion, and had the smallest piece of crab meat (teaspoonful); partner's chicken breast dry and her rocket salad contained absolutely no rocket, but a lot of very bitter red stalks....  The restaurant manager (John?) was on the ball, however and instantly reduced the bill - he was a shining beacon of efficiency and pleasant attitude ...unlike one of the bar staff who we noticed mouthing what looked suspiciously like an obscenity at the back of a customer who had the temerity to want to be served from the bar rather wait for table service.

This is not a cheap hotel  - the prices are indeed five star - but the services are definitely not.  Needs a lot of work to merit 5 stars.",3,2015,05,27
122,"""Top quality hotel with great views""",True 5 star experience.Stayed in superb marina view suite everything about my stay was excellent.Hotel was buzzing as it was a Chelsea F C home semi-final game night and the team and staff were using the hotel as their base.,5,2015,05,27
122,Fabulous stay again,"Upgraded to the savile suite as before. Very clean and spacious. Tv room provided extra entertainment for teenage daughter. Had room service, cost reasonable and food was very good, hot and fast. Breakfast was a let down and staff we found were confusing in the breakfast room.",4,2015,05,26
122,4 star not 5,We stayed at the Chelsea harbour hotel 10 years ago and it was very good.The rooms are tired now with paper peeling of the walls the bar chairs have Staines  on them and the breakfast chairs have food stuck down the sides.They try and hook you with cheap deals on room rates through people like hotel tonight be careful as when you arrive you realise you have been duped.This hotel is a more like a four star not in the same league as the Dorchester or the savoy so buyer  beware.,2,2015,05,25
122,Nice hotel but,After a nice weekend and the hotel itself was lovely I needed to get a taxi to go to Heathrow when I walked outside and approached a london taxi the concierge came out and told me they were too expensive. I was quoted £70 by the hotel to Heathrow I told them I didn't want there car I got the taxi and it was £58.80. A lot cheaper than the car they tried to put me in ,3,2015,05,25
122,Luxury without elitism.,"A beautifully appointed hotel, with a warm, welcoming atmosphere which is unusual in the more prestigeous areas of London.  The facilities and accommodation are great but the stand out feature is the staff.  From the first point of contact with the door-man to the last, at check out, they were professional, courteous, friendly, amusing, helpful and many more adjectives that I wouldn't normally use in conjunction with experiences of people trying to earn a living in London.
We stayed in room 509, which despite being close to the lift, was very quiet.  We had a separate living area with comfortable chairs and sofas and our own espresso machine.  The shower was very powerful and maintained pressure as well as heat (not always a given in hotels I've stayed in before), however there was also a bath should you want a more relaxed bathing experience.
The beds were very comfortable but I must say, the pillows were the biggest treat out of all - I really didn't want to leave them behind.
As if all of the above wasn't enough; once we'd left our lovely suite, we were free to enjoy a relaxed evening of delicious food and wine on the terrace bar, overlooking the harbour.  I cannot wait to come back.",5,2015,05,23
122,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at the Chelsea Harbour while we were visiting the Chelsea Flower show. Wonderfully helpful staff, great suites, very good size, clean and well kept. very quiet location, just off Lots Road. Our suite was looking out onto the marina, with a great view, Breakfast was very good, Just a great hotel, will be back soon!",5,2015,05,23
122,Hype gives way to disappointment,"My usual hotel (the faultless Pestana) full with Flower Show trade I was forced to move after one blissful  night at the Pestana, to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. Since it carries an additional star and I had obtained a good advance purchase rate I was quite looking forward to it. Check in was excellent and my two separate bookings were easily combined and a room allocated at 11.30am. So far so good. As I was in London on business, myself and a colleague repaired to the bar following a very good lunch with clients at The Ivy, Chelsea. Unfortunately we had quite a lot of work to get through and accompanied it only with two soft drinks but we were repeatedly asked if we would ""like"" anything further. We felt our occupancy to spend ratio was not suiting the staff. On completion I signed the tab and it was only my sharp eyed colleague who noticed that there was a glass of wine on the bill which we clearly had not consumed. No apology was given and grudgingly it was removed, harbinger of things to come. The suites are now rather dated and whilst reception had tried hard to sell me a marina view, my view over the Design Centre was fine. Not so fine however, no opening windows, or to correct, no means of opening windows. This is one of my hotel criteria and I had been assured when I made the booking that the hotel had this feature. Notwithstanding the hotel does have AC but I do like to open a window. I had forgotten my telephone charger so called down where I was told the hotel would charge my phone if I took it down to reception. On collection after a very long time, it was only half charged. When did the guest have to do all the running about? I used room service on two evenings and the food was acceptable but far worse was to come. Whilst checking out reception was unable to print me my invoice and merely gave me the credit card receipt then on arrival home I received a letter for three items from the mini bar which I had not consumed. Already debited from my credit card I called the hotel to have the call re-directed three times to eventually reach an accounts voicemail. I am still awaiting the call back . It would seem necessary to check one's bill very carefully, and to ensure you receive one. Overall the hotel is fine but I agree with previous reviewers it is not customer or guest friendly or focussed. Please don't all rush to the Pestana or I will find it even more difficult to get into.",3,2015,05,23
122,"An excellent hotel, but not quite 5 star","Pros: Good quiet location, pleasant and professional staff, excellent rooms with expresso coffee maker, excellent food.
Cons: The WiFi didn't work in our room, no milk (we had to ask for it twice), the temperature of the hot water is too low for a really hot bath.
Conclusion: The overall feel of this hotel is ""luxury by numbers"" - it ticks the boxes but somehow it lacks the co-ordinated luxury feeling offered by the best hotels in London. Nevertheless it is a very good hotel and few would be disappointed.",4,2015,05,22
122,Excellent stay,"Was an excellent stay. Very large and very clean suite. 
Looking forward to my return visit in 2 weeks. 
All facilities that you could need.
Just a very short walk away from main shopping area. With lots of restaurants near by. 
Main train station just 200 yards away",5,2015,05,21
122,Could be much better,"Fantastic location and great infrastructure but the hotel is not customer oriented.
Stayed in the hotel for 4 full days.

Positives:
- Modern, good finishing taste, room with amazing space, good gym and beautiful location and harbour view

Negatives:
- Room wifi did not work. I made a 
formal complaint on day one and it was not fixed, gym equipment broken, food not compatible with the hotel.",3,2015,05,21
122,Thanks Roberto!,"We have just returned from a night at one of the best hotels I have every stayed at.  The suite at the Chelsea Harbour was stunning with its own lounge and balcony and a view to die for overlooking the Harbour.  We were meeting friends for dinner to celebrate our friend's 60th birthday and Roberto made it a fantastic evening all round.  His service was fun, friendly and yet so professional and the cake with candles at the end was a superb touch and surprise.  We would recommend this hotel to everyone and will return again without question.  Although expensive, it is worth every penny for that special celebration.",5,2015,05,20
122,"Amazing suites, amazing view","I stayed in a River View suite on the 18th of May. From the moment you step into the hotel you receive a warm welcome and second to none service. The suite was amazing, very luxurious, super fast wifi. I ordered room service and ate on my balcony, the food was perfect. I can't think of one negative point about this hotel. Flawless !!!",5,2015,05,19
122,Impressive,"I stayed on a Secret Escapes offer of £180 and paid the £40 supplement to upgrade to a Marina Suite which was totally worth it and made the whole stay far more enjoyable with a superb view of the harbour.
The room was beautifully appointed with a living room, bedroom and 2 bathrooms and excellent value for the price.
Nothing much around the area except the Thames of course but if you have the chance visit the 606 Jazz Club nearby for a really nice evening ( 2 minutes walk)",5,2015,05,18
122,Absolutely faultless ,"Honestly can not fault this hotel, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left the whole experience was extremely pleasant. Checking in was fast and easy, the gentleman was extremely polite and professional. All the staff here greet you and always have a smile on there faces,  The hotel is spotlessly clean the whole hotel is beautiful especially the lobby.  I normally feel let down when I see the rooms but not this time, our suite was huge and again spotless with two toilets , bath, shower, separate living room and bedroom, we also had a balcony from the living room and one from the bedroom, overall this hotel is luxurious with amazing staff",5,2015,05,18
122,Luxury hotel in a great location and at a fantastic price,"I have stayed at this hotel over the years in its various incarnations, Conrad first then Wyndham and now as the Chelsea Harbour - and I can gladly say this has been my favourite.  From the moment we pulled up in the car to the moment we left, the service was excellent, the quality of the hotel and the vast space in the suites was outstanding.  We will be back!!",5,2015,05,18
122,Champions!,Took my daughter to London for her birthday and for both of us to watch Chelsea v Crystal Palace. We had a great meal in the hotel on the Saturday night and the restaurant staff could not have been nicer. Extra special bonus was that the whole of the Chelsea team and staff were also staying at the Hotel! Stamford Bridge is less than a mile away and to top of an amazing weekend Chelsea won the league and we were there to see it. Would definitely recommend this Hotel,5,2015,05,16
122,Great hotel for couples and families and individual travellers,"We stayed here as a family. We were given two massive suites with a lounge each and large bathrooms. 
The pool although small was quiet and you were let's use it as there were only a few people.
Unfortunately my youngest was unwell and we ended up ordering room service which was ok. The Brasserie downstairs where my son and husband ate had a smaller menu than room service and portions were small. 
The next day Chelsea had a football match and the team were staying at the hotel overnight. The nice part was we were all able to stand in the lobby to watch them walk out to the coach.
Afterwards we walked into Chelsea. This is a long walk to the Kings Road but enjoyable with plenty to look at along the way and also to look out for various TV stars.",5,2015,05,11
122,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel and we were really impressed. Our 7th floor suite was very luxurious and the views from the balcony across the Marina to the River Thames made our visit. The front of house was very efficient and most obliging. Roberto in the Brassiere was most attentive and served us a superb dinner on our first night. On the second evening we eat at the nearby Thai restaurant, the Blue Elephant. We were able to get back from Westminster using the River Taxi from Embankment pier to Chelsea Harbour, much more relaxing than travelling by black cab and much cheaper.

Highly recommended",5,2015,05,10
122,Wonderful Hotel,"I travel with a VIP client across the world who performs regularly in London - and we usually stay at the Ritz. This time, we decided however to stay here for the Location. 
We were totally impressed with the hotel and the service. Alex the duty manager looked after us from start to finish and it was perfect. The Concierge are very useful and the Valet parking amazing. 

We really had a wonderful stay and we are back in June and booking to stay here again! 

5 star service, wonderful rooms, only downside the Pool and spa area wasn't amazing - but we didn't go here for that - we went for the service and location.",5,2015,05,09
122,Ideal place for travelling with kids,"Ok, so the hotel and area in general feel a bit tired around the edges - as if they peaked in the late 90's. however, you cannot but like a suite with a separate bedroom when travelling with kids. Great staff too.",4,2015,05,08
122,Food not great ,"I live near this hotel so unlikely to stay but apparently the suites (I was, not sure if this is,  the only hotel in London with all suites). 

Anyway being so close to home the bar and restaurant are great to have a drink and sit and look at the harbour - its a lovely looking hotel with great outside seating I'm summer 

Tonight we went to the bar to have a drink and some food.   Firstly they had run out of sparkling wine - I love champagne but their Moet is £80 a bottle which is expensive even for this venue - I detest prosecco and find it annoying to be offered it (that's just my pet hate) 

So,  waiter opens champagne and some of it sprays all over the ice bucket - for that price I would have liked that to be in my glass - nice touch would have been to offer us a free glass to make up for it 

We filled up our own glasses after that mostly because nobody offered to but we preferred it to save it all 

The problem is,  we wouldn't have cared about these relatively small things if the food has been any good.   Problem is, it was pretty bad - late to arrive and tasteless spinach, average steak, McDonald's chips and a ceasar salad that could have come from any old pub

So my advice.   Stay here, great location,  view and swimming pool - The breakfast is great so have that and then head for any amount of bars and restaurants nearby for your meals and drinks ",4,2015,05,08
122,Great stay-Spacious!!!,Stayed here for one night prior to leaving London. Booked a standard room but had the option to upgrade to a higher floor/better view for $40£ at check-in (which I did.) The staff was very accommodating. Alex from the front desk showed us around and explained everything. The rooms were very spacious for an urban hotel and well appointed! I would definitely stay again!,5,2015,05,05
122,A Great Chill Out Hotel- But No free biscuits!,"We desperately needed a break from work and decided to book a spur of the moment overnight stay in our favourite UK city, (London)  taking in a West End show (Jersey Boys)  at the same time. My husband, as always, likes to surprise me with a great choice of hotel and this was no exception. Wow! A lovely place, bright, airy and modern building sited far enough away from the bustle of central London to give the all essential quiet time we needed, yet only a 'good' taxi ride from the 'action' of central London; quite different from our usual hotel of choice which is one of timeless elegance,with period features and usually set in the heart of the City. The hotel itself is set on the edge of the Thames right in the regenerated harbour area of Chelsea not far past Chelsea and Lambeth Bridges. It took about 35minutes in a Taxi from St. Pancras International Station and cost around £25.00 to get there. This is May Day bank holiday weekend traffic though and the roads were pretty jammed once we got to Trafalger square and along Whitehall etc. Hence, possibly, the time it took to get there. The reception staff were most courteous from the outset with front of house helping us with our overnight bags out of the Taxi and seating us at the check in desk. (No standing or queueing the be checked in, now there's a novelty) At this point I discovered my husband had booked a suite and then as we were told it was at the back of the hotel, he asked for a room with a view and all they had was the Penthouse... so, he booked it! The Kensington is the middle of three penthouse suites and the one which looks centrally over Chelsea Marina!  Woah!! what a view!! The London Eye, The Shard, (from the lounge window only) Battersea Power Station, (complete in re-generation mode) and much more besides. The Kensington Penthouse consists of 'double doors leading into an entrance hall with cloaks cupboard complete with hangers and umbrella to the left, a small room with toilet and wash hand basin to the right. From the hall, to the left is a large elegant lounge with squishy comfy sofa and two chairs, wall mounted TV, marble fireplace, writing desk with phone, marble side area with mirror over, tea/coffee facilities, under counter fridge and cupboard with chargeable snacks in.( NO FREE BISCUITS!  - or fruit in the fruit bowl-  Come on chaps, its those finishing touches we all love that make all the difference)!  The bedroom was off the lounge,  An elegantly dressed, super-king bed, bedside tables and writing desk/dresser, plenty of space to walk around, leading to an inner hallway off which was a bathroom with separate shower with rainforest/drencher style shower head set in the ceiling and hand held shower head attachment. The bath was set with a TV into the wall at its foot, his and hers sinks, a half door with frosted glass into the toilet and bidet area. Back in the inner hallway, there was a neatly appointed dressing room complete with safe and plenty of hanging space/shelves before returning through another door back into the front entrance hall of the penthouse suite. The lounge and bedroom are all fronted by huge patio doors opening (the bedroom one wouldn't open while we occupied the suite) onto the balcony which overlooks the Marina. Lovely! The rest of the Saturday, we took a Taxi (£12.50) and went shopping passing through the Kings Road area en route to Harrods, getting out here and spending a few pleasant hours browsing the shops in Knightsbridge. After this we returned to the hotel for our pre-booked afternoon tea in the bar area -£25 per head- or £35 per head for the Champagne option- Everything was fresh and the sandwiches very tasty but we both felt the cakes were either far too sweet or too tart. I also had to ask for hot water to top up the tea-pot, (A standard at other venues)  as the teapots came way ahead of the sandwiches and cakes, I have to say that although the experience was pleasant enough, we have had a better experiences with afternoon tea at other venues. We had a nightcap in the bar after our visit to the West End show (Taxi was £30.00 into Shaftesbury Avenue) but didn't make use of the hotel's Italian themed menu. However, breakfast was one of the best we have ever had! The hotel was full and the table waiting staff were clearly stretched, never the less, they were very helpful and they seemed to actually care that we had all we needed, so well done to you! (Just one oddity, one of the staff just couldn't wait to take our used cutlery and crockery away, the minute we put it down. This was a tad frustrating with the odd knife going flying as I desperately tried to retrieve it. The result was, I ended up buttering my last piece of toast on a saucer with an oversized knife... a minor detail and I saw the funny side. But if anyone at the hotel is reading this, please would you retrain some of your staff to be a little more patient please. All in all, a fab nights sleep and the desired result of two re-charged guests, ready to face the business world again!  Thanks to Albert on the front desk and all the staff for making us feel so welcome! I sincerely hope we get to see you again very soon.",5,2015,05,03
122,Fantastic family Easter break!,"We stayed at  the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for 2 nights over the Easter bank holiday weekend, the third time we have done this as a family in addition to several stays that my wife and I have had at the hotel on our own.

As before we were not disappointed, our suite was ready when we arrived at the hotel and we received excellent service from all the departments of the hotel we had dealings with. Special mention to Adbu and the team who work on the door who quickly made friends with our children and always give a very warm welcome!

The pool was well used by us over the weekend - a good size and never seemed too busy.

We will be very much looking forward to our next visit!",5,2015,05,01
122,Great bedrooms,"Every room is a suite apparently.
This worked great for us and allowed my wife to work from the hotel room whilst I was in conference.

Restaurant and bar good but expensive (as everything is in London).

Train station just a short stroll away with links into the city.
Which is fortunate as it is a bit away from London centre.

Nice location for a quiet stroll by the river also.",4,2015,04,28
122,Superb service at The Brasserie in The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"Myself and a friend had dinner in The Brasserie at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel on Saturday.  The food was first class but the most outstanding thing about the whole evening was our waiter John Smith. Charming, funny, helpful and so very efficient.  If only every restaurant had a John Smith.  The Brasserie is so fortunate to have him in their employ.

Shirley Frost",5,2015,04,27
122,LOVE IT!,"Everything about this hotel I love!  From the greeting from the incredibly pleasant and helpful doorman, to the rooms, bar, room service, friendliness and efficiency of all the other staff,  I will be visiting London on a regular basis in future and will not even think about staying anywhere else!  Highly recommend!!  Furthermore, depending when you stay the rates can be incredible value for money considering the location and view etc!!!",5,2015,04,26
122,London Hotel,"We spent eight nights in Chelsea Harbour Hotel, on our recent trip from California to England and France. The room was first-class as was the view of central London and the Harbour. The people were the thing we remember most about our stay, from the greeting, concierge, bell captain services, reception, all made us feel welcome and helped with all of our needs. Having traveled all over the world , i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2015,04,23
122,Avoid valet parking,"Definitely won't be visiting again, such a shame. We paid £40 on arrival for valet parking for ensure safety of our car. There was 6 females in our party with 2 suites. Although we booked for 3 people per room they were equipped for 2 people. We called to reception on a few occasions for bedding for the sofa bed and had no response, we gave up! 
When leaving the hotel our car was outside to find all of our change was stolen from the Middle console (min £30 in £1 and £2 coins). We had paid the £40 for the security of the car rather than parking in the ncp car park and had full trust in the hotel. Although yes it was just some coins that had gone missing it was then dealt with incorrectly. The hotel stating we should take it up with the police. 

Minor hiccup with the money stolen but obviously have unworthy staff and management currently working here, such a shame  we was very disappointed this time round!",1,2015,04,20
122,Great Hotel and Great Service!,We really enjoyed staying at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel. We had a suite with a great view of the River. Staff were all courteous and friendly (especially Povel at the front desk) and service was fantastic. Hotel is within walking distance to many nice boutiques and shops and not that far from the center of London. We would definitely stay here next time we travel to London.,5,2015,04,19
122,Great atmosphere,"We went to the hotel for just a one night stay for my boyfriends birthday surprise. Brilliant Christmassy atmosphere, lots of decorations, very tasteful. Spent a lot of time at the bar, champagne cocktails were brilliant if not a little pricey but didn't expect anything less. We had a suite for our stay which was absolutely amazing, included 2 bathrooms, a lounge and a bedroom. The best bed either of us have ever slept in, we had such a good nights sleep we didn't want to leave! Didn't get a chance to use the spa but had a look around it and it looked great. We expected to be able to walk down the road to find somewhere nice to eat but the location wasn't that great, ended up in a bar / restaurant which we didn't really enjoy, in hindsight we should have eaten in the hotel! Breakfast was very nice! Also parking was free under the Chelsea Harbour complex, so all in all a brilliant stay, hoping to go back in the near future :)",5,2015,04,17
122,New sleek atmosphere with the Millennium & Copthorne,"I always loved staying here from the time this hotel was formerly the Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour.

Now that this place has become one of the Millennium & Copthorne hotels, I was worried how much things have been changed due to that acquisition. I was very glad to see that they have not changed the establishment that much, so I could enjoy the nice spacious room layout (a bed room, a separate living room, and a bathroom accessible from both the bedroom and the corridor) and the building facilities (including that 17 meters swimming pool) the same way as before.

I am relieved to see that I can continue to have this pleasant hotel stay under Millennium's operation as well, but I feel the atmosphere has changed into somewhat more suitable for business travellers (and for that aspect, I actually miss the Wyndham's warmhearted hospitality-driven services like what you would imagine to find at a nice family-owned boutique hotel). I now feel that this hotel is turned into a 5 star sleek hotel with a very professional and disciplined service. (Maybe my impression about this new atmosphere is also affected by the fact that I am now in my mid-20s with a professional career so the Millennium staff would treat me as a grown-up lady, whereas back in the time of Wyndham's operation when I last stayed here for a family vacation I was just a girl freshly out of university.)

Millennium's staff are excellent as well and I will definitely come back here as my favourite regular hotel in London, but compared from the Wyndham time, now I would highly recommend this hotel for business travellers and grown-up couples. I should also note that this new sleek upscale atmosphere is reflected on the price, especially on the dining cost (so I now personally feel rather hesitant to bring my whole family here as I have no other choice but to have breakfast in the hotel dining which now became expensive for a less choice of foods… you could probably find a better option at a fancy cafe/restaurant on Kings Road). 

My favourite and recommended activities while staying here:
- exercise in the 17 meters swimming pool
- go for lunch/dinner at Chez Bruce in the Wandsworth Common area (easy access from the hotel on a taxi)
- take a walk on Kings Road (take a local bus so you can easily spot places to go such as charming clothes shops, galleries, Partridge's, and even a morning market)",5,2015,04,11
122,Corporate hotel,"We went for a spa weekend at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel and were left rather disappointed.

The hotel feels very corporate, and although the rooms are very spacious and comfortable they lack any atmosphere.

We had been given £35 each to spend at the restaurant, and when we arrived they informed us the restaurant was totally booked up so we had to spend £140 on room service! We went to the hotel for a special treat so it was very disappointing. The staff handled the situation very badly and were very rude.

I was so looking forward to a special weekend and feel very let down.
I have been involved in working with hotels and would never handle the situation in this way.

I would not recommend the hotel.",2,2015,04,09
122,"Stylish, sleek and top quality service","Stayed in a marina king suite - great attention to detail and you certainly get what you pay for. Lovely location and excellent service, loved the option of the valet service which meant I could simply drive up to the front doors, hand the keys over and start a wonderful stay. 

The only downside to this stay was breakfast - not the quality (which again was great), but the price. I think when you are paying £300+ for a room, you don't expect to have to pay £50 for breakfast for two (one full english and one english muffin with scrambled eggs) - was the only negative in an otherwise fab stay.",4,2015,04,07
122,Fantastic romantic break,"Purchased a voucher from secret escapes, but paid a little extra to upgrade to a balcony room. Lovely view of the marina, double room which was the most spacious hotel room we have ever stayed in, it was really clean & tidy, and had a great view of the shard & the london eye. Although it was a Saturday night & there was a wedding reception at the hotel, it did not feel busy which was perfect. We were made to feel really welcome.Really enjoyed our stay here. Would definately return. Only downside was that there was no free parking.",5,2015,04,07
122,harbour view in central london,"we love this hotel, brilliant location to escape to, but with easy access to all London offers. 
Piotr was very helpful with room arrangements, as were all the staff throughout our stay
it has a calm relaxed feel, 
definitely returning soon.",5,2015,04,07
122,Outstanding service ,"Firstly id like to say that the service at this hotel is fabulous.
Our two girls had a great time with everyone.
I would However say that's it's
More 4 star then a 5.
Little things really we noticed to our normal 5 star haunts.

We ate at the bar Resturant which was fantastic and the children's menu is great.
I can highly recommend
The Thai green curry and the girls mash was the best we had tasted.
We had to chase our orders a few times but nothing major.

We had a large suite with lots of room which was nice, the view
Not so much.
They provided us with a travel
Cot for the baby which like
Some are super hard so I rolled
Up our bed throw and padded the cot out and lucie Slept great.

The air con in the room didn't
Seem to work so we had
To open the balcony doors,
Sadly the scrambler bike tearing it
Up in the NCT car park next door at 3am wasn't very soothing! 

Check out easy.

Tip- NCT had a special rate of £5 for 24hrs parking compared
To the hotel of £40!
NCT car park is right next door 👍",4,2015,04,06
122,Chelsea FC home game,"Penthouse suite with stunning views over London, Superb service as always, many thanks to Alex and Piotr for making it special as always.Easy parking and really efficient concierge service. just a pleasure to stay, see you again soon.",5,2015,04,06
122,very welcoming,Our stay was most pleasant and we found Alex very helpful as was all the staff.  Best breakfast too the choice was great. We had wonderful marina views.  Rooms are beautiful and spacious and it is a great location.,5,2015,04,05
122,Birthday,"This was a birthday treat for hubby.
Never stayed at this hotel before , but what a joy, from the moment you arrived it was pure opulence. Our room the king suite was amazing so big you could have lived in it!
Lovely view over the harbour.
The swimming pool and spa were lovely, the hotel was very quiet had swimming pool and spa area to myself.
The restaurant and bar area were also lovely,unfortunately no atmosphere as there was only myself and hubby eating and drinking.
Lovely touch birthday cake in room for hubby.
Cannot fault at all.",5,2015,04,02
122,"stunning views, huge bedrooms","The Chelsea Harbour Hotel offers you everything. Set right in the heart of Chelsea, London and in the design district. The hotel has it all, attentive staff, stunning views of the Thames, huge bedrooms as standard, parking, luxurious toiletries, great wine list, and heaps of personality too.",5,2015,04,01
122,Excellent hotel,"Nice rooms, free wifi, excellent restaurant, kind personnel, perfect service, good housekeeping.
Expensive prices of rooms. 
Very good 5 star hotel. Very helpful personnel.
nice view to the harbor from the restaurant.",5,2015,04,01
122,"A luxury one night spa break in a relaxing, calm hotel","My partner and I stayed here last weekend for a last minute, surprise mini-spa break.  The hotel is in a fantastic location, is up to date and modern and boasts a small but, functional spa.  We dined in the Brasserie for dinner, which was very nice and the service was attentive with the food to a good standard. For breakfast you have a choice of options to choose from ranging from a Full English to a healthier fruit filled one.
The Chelsea Suite we stayed in was huge for the two of us, but in good condition and boasts nice features like a coffee machine and well stocked mini bar. The walk in shower was also nice. Despite a fairly high price, the hotel met expectations and I would stay here again.",4,2015,03,31
122,Dinner at Chelsea Riverside Brasserie,"Beautiful dining experience. 
Swift, friendly and professional service with a great menu and view over the harbour. 
Really enjoyed ourselves so we revisited with my mother yesterday for tea in the bar, which again was a lovely experience. I feel very welcome every time I step through the door. ",5,2015,03,29
122,Fantastic,"Came to stay here for a mini break away. Having heard great things about the hotel I just had to choose it even though I was spoilt for choice. 10/10 from start to finish! The room was clean, the staff were helpful and all the facilities you'd expect in a hotel were to a very high standard!",5,2015,03,26
122,Swings & Roundabouts!,"I booked this hotel for 4 nights for my wife and I mainly for our anniversary but also as I needed somewhere to work whilst my wife met friends etc. In requesting flowers the hotel knew it was a special event and very kindly placed chocolates and wine in our room as a welcome and celebration. The suite was lovely and the bed one of the largest and most comfortable we have stayed in. The down side was that the thermostat in the bedroom appeared faulty as it was way too warm and the windows cannot be opened. We know it was faulty because the adjacent sitting room was cool. I reported this on the first morning to the front desk and they said they would deal with it immediately. They didn't, nor did the next person I reported it to the following day. No explanation and no repair - NOT 5 Star service I'm afraid. The free Wifi sounds great but is appallingly poor so my work took far longer than I wished. The shower in the bathroom was weak and dated but the drench showers available at the pool were excellent - put them in the rooms please!! The towel holder in the toilet was hanging from the wall - I reported it but no action. Handy for the overland rail service and tube connections so it takes about 30 mins to the centre of town although I walked it in 45! Other reviewers complained re parking cost (again NOT 5 Star service in my book) but I found a NCP car park in Wandsworth which was £20 for 4 days! Would I stay here again? Possibly but only at the discount rate I had this time (50% off) because I do not feel that given the issues highlighted that it is '5 Star' unfortunately.",3,2015,03,25
122,Great Views,"Staye here for the first time since the Millenium Group has taken over fromWyndham, and would say it's been very positive! Stayed in a Marina View room,as they are the same as the RiverView but on a lower floor so harder to see the actual river. As we have stayed here's lot of times over the years this wasn't a problem,and they are approx£20 per night cheaper. It is a must to have the Marina View to see then est of this hotel,as the rooms are large with great balconys to sit and enjoy the view . The rooms are also very well priced,even a bargain, for central London,though they are a it out from some of the a traction so, with Addisn Lee and Uber now,a taxi is much more affordable .
Bar area and outside terrace are lovely, but only had coffee and drinks so cannot comment on the food. Staff friendly and efficient,especially the doormen , who can advise you on local attractions . Nice area and will definitely be back, quiet and relaxing as well so the best of both worlds .",5,2015,03,24
122,Best hotel in London,"Although the hotel changed hands a while ago the quality has been maintained and maybe even bettered.  This is the best hotel in London in my mind and you are always made to feel welcome.  The staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble.  This is a top quality hotel and one I would recommend to anyone, great value for money in central London.",5,2015,03,23
122,Good price for a London hotel,"This is a good hotel - all rooms are comfortable suites and well apportioned.

However, the hotel is slightly off the beaten track so convenience is not great.  I managed to use the pool, which has good facilities, and the gym looked pretty well equipped although there is no personal trainer or structured classes, if that should be on your wish list.
The bed was comfortable although the pillow gave me neck ache.  The bathroom was well laid out, but it might have been easier not to put a separate door into the toilet as it was difficult opening and closing this in the limited space - just a minor observation!
Would definitely go back - the travelling is worth the comfort.",4,2015,03,21
122,Fantastic view and huge rooms !,"Good price, lovely room which was a large front room with balcony and then separate bedroom.  The balcony had a gorgeous view you must book a harbour view!
I was on a girly weekend but would be good for both girly weekends and romantic nights away.",4,2015,03,19
122,Lovely hotel but few issues.,"Hotel is lovely, must upgrade to view over the harbour! Breakfast in bed was good quality, and the room facilities are fantastic. My only withdraw is that the payment scheme needs to be adjusted? We pre-paid before our arrival. My partner booked 7 rooms for 14 people prior to arrival with you direct (no 3rd party) and on arrival was asked for a bank card to hold £100 deposit again, this was fine. We were celebrating my partners birthday and as its his favourite hotel, we brought some extra guests to share this day and night with us. Beautiful stay couldn't fault it!, lovely bar and personal check in was appreciated.

The downfall to our stay was upon check out we settled our minibar bill and breakfast in cash at check out so no extra monies were to be taken from my card. Yet on return, two days later, i had the whole cost of the room taken from my card, plus parking and the breakfast! Couldn't believe it! To add to the grief of wondering were over £300 had gone missing from my account the day I was catching a flight to Egypt was somewhat really distressing! We actually drove and parked our own car because the hotel concierge told us to because there was no space left. Then the same thing happened to my father inlaw and you also billed his card for his stay. 

It's not even the money, its just the running round back at home on a Monday morning ringing the bank and hotel up numerous times to get the money back in my account which was wrongfully taken in the first place. Just the principle I guess. I really hope this doesn't happen again as we stay regularly at the Chelsea harbour hotel!",4,2015,03,16
122,"Great service, room, food and experience","We stayed on Saturday 14th March as a romantic/getaway. We found both the service and staff to be of a quality expected from a 5 star city hotel, nothing was a problem and any query was dealt with immediately. The King suite room was fantastic (we had a city view on level 6, room 613), spacious, well laid out with a separate living area (a TV in each area) a generous sized bathroom, a separate bath and Grohe shower (great pressure and wide shower head!), and partitioned toilet area. The king sized bed, pillows and bedding were extremely comfortable and there was no sound from neighbouring rooms which I believe would mean decent wall construction, not like some hotels I have stayed at in the past. 

The pool, steam and sauna rooms were great, pool was a decent size, and areas were immaculate and well maintained. 

We had dinner and drinks at the hotel with friends who were also staying there and we all found the food, drinks and service to be of a very good quality. The steak was beautiful and the peri peri sauce was delicious! (As were the scallops starter and afagato dessert). The waiter/waitress service again was great and friendly, and the bar area was comfortable with good quality well designed lounge furniture, you really felt that you were in a quality hotel.

The location of the hotel we found to be very good and very easily accessible by public transport (tube) and by car (some of our friends drove and parked at the car park) and we were happy to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the West End and instead take in the character and ambience of the Kings Road/Chelsea which is literally walking distance from the hotel, and if you don't mind a decent walk will take you all the way up to Sloane Square. Kings Road has an abundance of great shops, patisseries, pubs, beautiful residential properties as well as a small food market on a Saturday adjacent to the Saatchi gallery. We stopped at a couple of good pubs to have a quick drink as we wandered up towards Sloane Square and soak up the local atmosphere. We also had a good lunch at Busaba Eat Thai on the Kings Road, recommended (if you like Thai!). You really don't need to venture too far if you are happy to 'take in' Chelsea, there is much to do and see and we only scratched the surface of the locality.

In all, we had a fantastic stay at this hotel, would definitely return and would highly recommend everything from the staff and service, quality of room/s, food, drinks and overall hotel experience.",5,2015,03,16
122,Excellent 5 Star Option in Chelsea,"My wife and I have stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel on two occasions, due to its close proximity to a brand consultancy that we are working with, and we expect to stay here a few more times over the next few months.

We originally chose the hotel due to its convenient location, just 5 minutes on foot from our meetings.  We have very high standards when it comes to hotels, so we were very pleasantly surprised by the exceptionally high level of service that we received.  I really can't fault any aspect of the service, which is professional, courteous and extremely efficient.  The door staff in particular are absolutely fantastic and do a better job than the majority of door staff at 5* hotels in central London, New York and other major cities that we frequent.

My only slight gripe is the air conditioning.  It's not great and the temperature control doesn't seem to work particularly well.  Nothing worse than waking up with throat in the morning because of the air conditioning.  Hopefully that will be fixed in due course, but it wouldn't stop us from staying here again as every other detail is great.",5,2015,03,16
122,Fabulous Room,"Fabulous hotel with great surroundings, near the Imperial Wharf train station. Greeted upon arrival and quickly shown to room. Beautiful room which was huge! We had a double suite, which we booked through Expedia. Lovely little extras, such as complimentary bottles of water every day, tea, coffee and complimentary newspaper every morning.

We used the spa facilities too which were nice, shame there was no Jacuzzi, but to get spa facilities and a swimming pool in a London hotel is a bonus, so you cannot complain. Free use of business centre to print out 2for1 vouchers before heading out on our daily sight seeing trips was great.

We stayed in on the second night and enjoyed the views of the harbour from the bar. Lovely meal and comfy booths to relax in.

Would definitely return to this hotel and will be recommending to friends and family.",5,2015,03,16
122,Relaxing meet up with friends,"A group of friends from all over UK met here for dinner and overnight stay.
Dinner and breakfast were very good quality and very enjoyable, customer service was faultless.
Great cocktails in the bar area, nothing too much trouble.
Room was fabulous, very spacious, great shower and very comfy bed and very quiet.
Would definitely recommend to friends and family and love Kings road just a stones throw away! 😃",5,2015,03,16
122,Fantastic Hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and would recommend it. The staff, facilities and rooms are all excellent the bar and restaurant serve great food and its all in an idea location. We will definitely be returning soon.",5,2015,03,16
122,Fabulous!,"I recently stayed here with my sister to celebrate my birthday and we had the most wonderful time. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Tobias who was very efficient and courteous and remembered my name and details. Check in was swift and our River suite was absolutely fabulous. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal in the restaurant and were made to feel very special by a fantastic staff, especially Roberto who arranged lovely little birthday surprises of champagne and puddings which made my night! We, then, moved through to the bar area and were very impressed with the level of service and attentive staff. I am definitely looking forward to a return visit in the future. Thank you very much.",5,2015,03,12
122,Worth the money for comfort and convenience.,"I used the hotel on a recent business trip to Chelsea. The welcome and check-in process was excellent, helpful and courteous staff all the way through the hotel.
The room was a twin bedded suite, and was very well appointed with a real coffee machine in the lounge.
The waiters seemed a bit rushed however at dinner, but the food was good.
I used the swimming pool during my stay and enjoyed the other facilities which include a sauna and steam room.
Breakfast was excellent and included in the room rate.
Expensive hotel, but worth the money for the quality of rooms, facilities and service, I will be staying again.",5,2015,03,10
122,Pure Class Service Outstanding,Just wanted to say a Massive Thank YOU to Tobias Muny for making our 2 night stay the best we have ever experienced. From the moment we made the booking till the time we sadly shut the suite door to come home the service that we recivied was faultless pure perfection. We stayed 2 nights in a river suite view of the Thames and it was like being at home we wanted for nothing the food and level of service is impeccable we will be back soon. Thanks so much Caroline and Nigel,5,2015,03,07
122,Lovely hotel once we had found it,"Lovely suite with everything you will need for a comfortable stay. Room service meal was excellent and beautifully presented. Beds were lovely and comfortable. Breakfast was also good and service and staff were all very friendly.
My only criticism were the directions to the hotel or lack of it, on the website. I came from imperial wharf station and could not find the hotel. I ended up walking for 20 minutes in the wrong direction. Not good when you have travelled a considerable way dragging a suitcase. So turn left out of the station and follow the road around to the right and then turn right. You will see the hotel in front of you.",5,2015,03,05
122,"Excellent Hotel, but . . .","The hotel is very comfortable, great rooms, great staff.  Nice setting as well.  Very good bathroom amenities (soaps, shampoo, etc.).  Complimentary Espresso and tea service in the room.  Bottled water provided every day.  Each building has a balcony overlooking the marina.  It was winter so I could it use the balcony, but I certainly would sit there and drink my cup of tea during the summer.  Rooms are non-smoking, but I did notice an ashtray on the table in the balcony, so smoker, please note!

The restaurant did not have a conventional breakfast buffet that one would expect in most high end hotels, however there was a cereal, bread and fruit spread that you can partake in when you order eggs a la carte.  Food quality was superb. 

Small negative is the shower stall which was very tight.  Big negative was extremely poor WiFi in my room.  In fact it was so bad, I abandoned it and used my mobile.  My room was at the end of the corridor so its possible that the room had a WiFi blank spot.  WiFi is complimentary.

Don't pay extra for a river view room.  I did and had a view of a sliver of the river.  See photo attached.",4,2015,02,28
122,Great Hotel in Great Location,"Very clean and spacious suite with a balcony looking out on to the Marina. Car parking available but chargeable. Not really close enough to walk to the great attractions nearby, although cabs are available outside and the fare is reasonable. Great facilities and great location make this a fabulous hotel with friendly staff.
Breakfast is good with plenty of choice.",4,2015,02,28
122,Anniversary Weekend,"all in all we had a wonderful break last November - only issues were that it wasn't clear what was complementary within the rooms and I notified reception it was an anniversary visit and kinda hoped for a little surprise for my partner and when I asked if they could do anything the lady said leave it with us, we'll do something nice.  The room was amazing, the spa lovely, the meal delicious but there was no surprise. Other than being billed more than the offer we pre-purchased off their website.  But all in all an amazing stay, just wish we wasn't over charged at dinner and at checkout, but all in all a perfect anniversary stay - with or without the promised treat.",4,2015,02,26
122,Back on track...,"We used to love this hotel when it was the Conrad chain, but after experiencing the ""wyndham"", we vowed we would not return.  However as now under the millennium chain, we were tempted to revisit following assurances from management. A little tired in places, but this hotel and service has definitely improved! Seems to have lost its ""buzz"" , we were the only ones in the bar for 2 hours on one of our evenings, which would have been unthinkable previously! Great location, suites, and service! 
",5,2015,02,25
122,"Fab hotel! Nice pool and bar area, scenic harbour location","Stayed once before when it was the Wyndham. The lobby area, bar and dining area are lovely. We had an evening drink at the bar overlooking marina, very pleasant surroundings. Must be lovely in the summer. Use of pool was good, however, no jacuzzi which is a shame and the sauna and steam rooms are for same sex only so if you are with your husband, you can't go in together to relax. The room made up for the stay, it was a one bedroom, it was the most spacious I've stayed in! Full English Breakfast is expensive at £23.95 each, so we ate elsewhere for that.",4,2015,02,22
122,Lovely Hotel,"A wonderful hotel in the Chelsea neighborhood. The service is very good, the hotel is clean, and breakfast is delicious! You can find a cab right outside the hotel. The hotel is a little far from central London area/attractions, but if you don't mind paying cab fare, these are not too far. I enjoyed my stay with my family here and would pick this hotel again.",5,2015,02,19
122,Lovely Valentine's Day,"My boyfriend booked our stay here for Valentine's Day.  I'll start with the bad but end with the great!  We did have a rocky start: he accidently booked a twin suite and called up the hotel immediately.  They unforunately had no double suites, so offered to upgrade him to the King Suite at no extra cost.  When we arrived however, we discovered (upon entering our room) that the upgrade had not been made.  My boyfriend went back to the front desk only to discover that they had later discovered that the upgrade would not have been possible as the rooms were not available and that there was nothing they could do.  Well they could have phoned and explained the situation (where my boyfriend would have cancelled the room and booked elsewhere) but instead they allowed us to arrive expecting a fantastic upgrade.  The man on reception declared there was nothing they could do, but after much persuasion from my very unimpressed boyfriend, they agreed to knock of half the price of the room and brought us up a bottle of champagne due to their lack of service.  

So bad start.  BUT it's all uphill from here!  The twin suite was very nice, beds super comfortable, lovely balcony view of the harbour.  The shower was incredible, great power and temperature control, I love a good shower!  We enjoyed relaxing in our suite until we went down their Riverside Brasserie and enjoyed a 3 course meal from the Valentine's Menu.  They gave you an oyster as an amuse bouche and it was incredibly tasty, so much so that I requested another round which the chef was happy to provide.  All my courses were incredibly well done, food was fantastic.  My boyfriend and I had a selection of cocktails each, again incredibly well done.

Much alter in the evening we decided to order room service, food came quickly and was a great snack!  We ordered a pizza with 4 toppings but only got 2, but before paying the bill when we were checking out, I explained to the member of staff and he was incredibly apologetic and deducted the cost from the bill.  Again, slight hiccup, but the staff dealt with it perfectly.

In the morning we woke up and used the swimming pool, which was really relaxing, nice water temperature.  A great way to start our morning and finish our trip.

I would definitely recommend staying here, despite our rocky start, we had a great time and I left very happy!",4,2015,02,19
122,Great Weekend Break!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Hotel is a real gem by the river. Room was very spacious with a comfy bed and great night time views across London. Well located in chelsea right by the overground station. Staff were all very helpful but special thanks to Tobias and Piotr for everything! 
",5,2015,02,14
122,"Beautiful rooms, nice location","Very traditional style of room, with separate lounge, bedroom, shower, bath and toilet. Nice views across the water, the bar was vibrant and funky in design, with excellent service, and the catering as part of a corporate do was exceptional... Service impeccable. The rooms were clean and today, nicely presented and with many little touches of real 'Englishness' that make it a superb hotel to come and spend time in the heart of London. ",4,2015,02,12
122,Well what can I say....wow wow wow,"Just returned from an absolutely fabulous weekend from start to finish.  We arrived to be met by a loely member of the concierge team who,promptly took our cases and belongings and parked our car.  We were then shown to a desk to register.  We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a river view which we did but wouldn't say it was worth it so wouldn't bother again as we had already a marina view.  We went to our room and our cases followed about 5 minutes later and were put into our bedroom.  As you walked through the door there was a small lobby which included a second lol which was useful.  A door led,to the bedroom and another door to the large lounge with French doors leading to a balcony with stunning view over the harbour.  There was a side door that went to a dressing area and door into the ensuite with a separate shower and bath with a another separate loo.  The bedroom was a good size with a king size bed and adorable pillows.  The room included free wifi, coffee machine and kettle.  We had breakfast both days English one day and a buffet the next which we both lovely but we tended to eat out.  The staff are all fantastic and can't do enough for you to make your stay enjoyable.  The concceiage seem to work 24 hours a day!!  It is just across the road from the Imperial Wharf over ground which took us straight to Westfield shopping centre within 10 minutes from door to door Thank you to everyone for making my stay so memorable and will definitely be back and definitely recommend.....worth every penny!!",5,2015,02,08
122,"Fabulous views of London skyline, excellent rooms!",We stayed in this hotel over the New Year period. We stayed on the 7th floor and our room overlooked the small harbour and the expensive yachts. If you would like to experience penthouse living then this is the hotel to choose. The decor is lovely and the large living area is very tastefully decorated and welcoming. The breakfast buffet was delicious with a lot of choice. The hotel is close to bus route 22 which takes you along the Kings Road. It is out of the main buzzy area but after a tiring  day in London it is nice to come back to a quiet area and to sit in the bar and admire the view and the twinkling lights on the water.,4,2015,02,06
122,Lovely hotel,"Great place, nice staff and the food was very good.  Rooms are huge (all suites) and well appointed.  It is a little off the beaten London track, but if you want comfort, this is for you.

It is a touch on the high side in terms of cost, but all London hotels, at least the good ones, are up there.  Overall, we had a lovely stay.",4,2015,01,31
122,Excellent afternoon tea,"We came here on the off chance feeling peckish and were not disappointed! 

Nothing was a problem for the excellent staff who found us a table in the bar area promptly without us booking, I think their names were Carla and  Laurentius so if you visit look out for them!

The cappuccino here is to die for, they have been trained properly not to over steam the milk. I do so hate coffee that has the same characteristics of porridge!

One of our party is a [dreaded] veggie and very fussy; the staff ammended the available sandwiches to suit without any complaint or problem.

I do not often give maximum points on this site but here they truly deserve it, please go and enjoy the great cappuccino and atmosphere!!",5,2015,01,30
122,Great hotel great staff,"Great stay here, made by the staff.  It's not centrally located but only takes 20 mins to get to central London. The suite was large and nicely decorated, and the swimming pool is great!  The staff were lovely. Peter at reception really looked after us very well. We will be back!!",5,2015,01,30
122,Excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed for just 1 night before a difficult hospital visit. Everything was perfect and helped make our stay as stress-free as possible. This was due to the fabulous room with everything you could ask for, the view, the peace and quiet, comfortable bed - but, I think it was the attention and friendliness of the staff which was so noticeable.  We also had an early evening meal in the restaurant, again recommended.  We have stayed in good hotels all over the world and would rate this with the best. Special praise to Lara on reception who even remembered our situation and gave me a hug - what a difference this small gesture made! Thanks, we will return.",5,2015,01,27
122,Lovely hotel but not so convenient,"We had a lovely family stay at this hotel close to Christmas.  We couldn't fault the hotel but found the lack of a nearby tube station did affect our stay.  However, the hotel made up for it with a spacious suite where we were able to park the children in an ajoining room with their own TV.  Connections via the overland are fast up to Shepards Bush where you can cross the road to get to the Central line, etc.

Top tip: you can go under the building opposite the hotel to their car park and exit opposite the train station.  Sadly, parking is ludicrously expensive at the hotel; clearly they don't want to encourage it.",4,2015,01,26
122,Great hotel....,"Stayed for work conference...nice meeting facilities,  attentive staff, and great views from balcony.  Breakfast in onsite restaurant was pretty good....and good times at bar in the evening.  Decent pubs in walking distance....

Rooms are all suites, and kept up to date and very comfortable....avoide the ""twin suites"" though as the twin beds appear to be sized for children!",4,2015,01,25
122,Good hotel but lacking in some facilities,"Out of the way location but smart hotel with good spacious room ( I was in a suite though)
As part of a conference food was Disappointing but then again it almost always is at those type of events.
Gym was a big disappointment but otherwise ok . 
Didn't feel it was anything special  ",3,2015,01,25
122,Another lovely stay :o),"Well, we love this hotel  - been there four times now - what's not to like - all suite, massive bathroom, great bed ( amazing pillows! ) and not expensive for this kind of luxury.  Especially love the pool which was empty on Sat morning. Just off the Kings Road, walkable to overground station. A little tip - if you need to bring the car they charge £40 per day at the hotel - just across the road is the Design Centre car park - half the price - wish we'd known before we paid!
We'll be back soon - think we might deserve an upgrade next time :o)",5,2015,01,25
122,top class hotel,"top class hotel, very welcoming, lovely room with balcony overlooking the harbour, excellent food. over all a very nice experience. hope to visit again and would definitely recommend to others. car or taxis is a must.",5,2015,01,24
122,A reason to come back,"This was my first visit before chrismas.. We were 2, me and a friend.
What i've to say: amazing rooms, and the suff was very very helpful and kind. A very quiet area a few minutes to Kings Road, where there are a lot of things to do.
We will come back soon. ;)",5,2015,01,21
122,Great bar service,"Alberto, at the bar, was very kind, helpful, and managed to meet expectations. Highly recommend it.              
Also the fellow staff members were kind enough to engage in making the visit more interesting and for that I am thankful

",4,2015,01,21
122,I love this hotel and now does my husband,"This is my fifth visit but my first with my husband as I normally go with girlfriends. It just ticks all the boxes . Fabulous rooms which are large. Very quiet location but a few minutes walk to The Kings Road with lots of great shopping, bars and restaurants. The staff could not be more helpful and are very pleasant. It's not a cheap hotel but it's worth every penny as you feel relaxed and the hustle and bustle of London is locked away. You actually feel you are on holiday especially when the sun is shining and you can sit and watch the world go by on theThames or around the small marina. Go the night before a Chelsea football match and you maybe lucky enough to bump into Mr Jose Mourinho.. A perfect stay. Will be back soon with or without him.",5,2015,01,20
122,shopping over christmas,stayed in the chelsea harbour hotel 5 star it was spot on great hotel good area near the train station very simple to catch in to the city center all the food was excellent we will be going back it was easy to get to with my mate tom tom,5,2015,01,20
122,"Really lovely hotel, very nice and helpful staff - a bit of a find in London","We got a really good deal on the hotel, but were especially keen as the rooms are all suites.  We expected that we would have a slightly larger bedroom with a sitting area (as generally bedrooms in hotels in London even really good ones tend to be on the small side) what we actually got was a separate living room and a large bedroom and very nice bathroom.  We didn't opt for the upgrade to a marina or river view, but were perfectly happy overlooking the design centre and it was lovely and quiet and peaceful.  I imagine even when full it is still quiet and peaceful.  It's about a 20 min taxi ride from the real touristy bits of London, but if you are feeling energetic you can do the Thames Walk or wander down Lots Road to the Kings Road and get a bus or wander further to Fulham Broadway. This really does feel like it lives up to it's 5 stars for both rooms and service",5,2015,01,19
122,Superb hotel in London,"We booked 2 nights, Saturday & Sunday, to celebrate my birthday and being Chelsea supporters this seemed the perfect choice as they were playing on the Saturday afternoon. The hotel is situated on a lovely marina and our suite had views of this as well as the Thames.  The suite is very spacious. The sitting area had a sofa and arm chair and this was a lovely place to chill out in after 2 busy days!  The bedroom and bathroom were much bigger than other London hotel rooms we have stayed in.  The bar area was very nice and the staff very attentive. You have to remember this is a 5* hotel so the prices weren't cheap but certainly reasonable. If we had one comment this would be the wine list.  The choice was limited and we were surprised that this did not include a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.  They only had Chilean. Anyway this did not spoil our stay. We went for a walk around the marina and along the river on the Sunday morning before catching the train from the nearby overground station to get to Central London.

Forgot to say the bed was so comfortable!  We were sad to check out on Monday but will certainly return again.  For a 5* London hotel this is very good value.",5,2015,01,18
122,Christmas Day lunch 2014,"Christmas Day lunch was a wonderful experience.
From the moment my daughter and I entered the foyer we had smiles on our faces. We were made to feel so welcome; Staff were welcoming and happy. The atmosphere was happy. The live band contributed to a wonderful atmosphere. The restaurant was pleasantly busy with all ages from the very young to the very old and all in between. Couples, families; everyone enjoying themselves. Food was excellent; well presented and delicious. The restaurant had accommodated our  particular menu requests with great success. All in all a wonderfully happy pleasant and deliciouos experience. Best of all no washing up! So much so that we are considering returning in 2015. Thank you to all the staff who made our Christmas Day so enjoyable.",5,2015,01,18
122,Spa day,"Celebrating my daughters birthday. The spa treatments were very good.  Staff friendly and informative. The hotel overlooks a marina with lovely views of the yachts.  We swam in the pool and relaxed in the afternoon with champagne afternoon tea. The hotel is within walking distance of the Kings road chelsea and a long walk to harrods. Ideal for shopping and dining. We had lunch which was very good. 

The hotel is quiet you do not hear any aircraft noise but it is central if you want to get to Heathrow.  Not far from the water and excellent for a stroll.",5,2015,01,18
122,Worlds Best Hotel !!!,"I stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for one night and it was amazing . The staff  are really helpful ,always smiling and that makes your day . Nothing was too much to ask ,I felt like home.
The suite had a stunning view, the restaurant was great and service ... impeccable.
I would like to thank you everyone !!!
Definitely recommended 
Can wait to come back :)",5,2015,01,14
122,Fantastic!  😄,"On our way home back to South Wales as I type this,  we only stayed one night and could have stayed forever (if our children were also with us of course) 
Fantastic service and welcome from the second we entered the hotel.. Special thank you to Lara in reception who rectified a little blip in the reservation that was made the evening before,  also to the manager Alex Moraru who went out of his way to make up for the error by upgrading us to a gorgeous suite overlooking the harbour. What a gorgeous room,  simply magnificent with balcony overlooking the boats. 
Breakfast was amazing and a fellow Welsh man greeted us at the restaurant and again was very friendly and chatty.  So lovely to go to such a high standard hotel and he treated like a friend.  Can't recommend highly enough and look forward to coming back again with our boys to try out the swimming pool. Thanks again from Rob and Michelle ",5,2015,01,12
122,Worst beds known to mankind!!,"Have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions when it was a Hilton hotel and as a Wyndham hotel & always had a great time, we booked again to stay again between Xmas & New Year for a bit of R&R, we discovered that the hotel has again changed hands and is now a Millennium hotel, I do not know from where they obtain there beds but it would not be an exaggeration to say that the floor would have been more comfortable, I advised the reception staff of this but they could not have been less interested or dismissive, we stayed for two nights but could not have suffered a third even if we had wanted to.
On top of this I have to say that breakfast was a complete & utter shambles with a shortage of staff, lack of tables (with lots of people asked if they would prefer to eat in the bar rather than wait). Such a shame as I used to love this hotel but would not wish to go back again, in fact we are travelling to Chelsea again end of January and have already booked an alternative hotel nearby.",1,2015,01,12
122,A change for the worse,"We have stayed at this hotel many times since it first opened as a hilton and then when it switched to wyndham and generally have been very happy with the facilities and service.
Unfortunately our most recent and last visit was in June 2014 after it had been taken over by millenium copthorne.
We had booked one of the penthouse suites the main selling point of which was a home cinema room. Sadly this facility was inoperative throughout our 3-night stay and despite being notified of this no real effort was made to fix it.
On our last night we decided to order a bottle of prosecco from room servie and were tersely told they didn't have any even though it did appear on the bar menu. After this was pointed out to them a bottle was brought to our room.
The night before we checked out I asked to talk to the manager upon departure the next morning. Needless to say when I checked out no one knew about this. The manager did appear and was honestly apologetic and then asked me what I wanted her to do to put this right. I simply told her it was for her to propose a remedy to me not the other way around and this resulted in her agreeing to reduce our bill by an appropriate amount.
We will not be making any further visits whilst this property remains under Millenium Copthorne managment. We have never visited any of their other hotels and on the the basis of this stay will avoid them like the plague.

It is sad to see a hotel which used to give such good service fall by the wayside in this way but I guess that's the hospitality business for you.",2,2015,01,09
122,What can I say,"Upon payment for the booking breakfast was included in the price however upon arrival we were advised that breakfast was not included and it seemed between hotels.com and the hotel booking they renegaded on the reservation yet we had proof that that was what we had in fact paid for. We were given the run around with no resolution to our dilemma and no breakfast.

Chelsea Harbour hotel has a good location to stadium and getting to surrounding areas was good because of the transport infrastructure. You can get a bus, overground, river taxi and tube from Earls court. 

The accommodation was comfortable and felt homely after spending a day out. The overall experience i would say was ok for a 5* hotel. Turn down in most hotels gave a little chocolate for the kids, some hotels even left an afternoon snack, but there is nothing for free in this hotel, not even a welcome drink upon arrival. The specials advertised in the lifts where not on offer for room service which was also disappointing.",3,2015,01,08
122,Wow!,"We were invited to celebrate the New Year with friends in the Kings Suite. 
The Suite was like an apartment and the views over London from our balcony were amazing, especially the fireworks!!
The staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to ensure the evening went smoothly.
The live band were great, they played music that was perfect to dine to and then to get ready to dance to.
All in all a fantastic experience.
",5,2015,01,07
122,Excellent Hotel,"Really liked this hotel, never seem to go to this end of London as much, but really enjoyed it. All the rooms at the hotel are Suites!! We had a bedroom, living room, bathroom, 2 separate toilets and a hallway!! with umbrella stand and umbrella just in case the London weather wasn't too dry.  The service was excellent, from the greeting at the Hotel door, reception, bar staff.  Everyone feels that they are there to make your stay special.  There is a separate lift for the pool, sauna and gym and Spa etc so that you are not in the hotel lobby with robe and slippers on!! We had some bars snacks and drinks when we arrived and they were lovely. The cocktail menu is very LONG too, tried a few!! An evening or morning stroll along the harbour and river Thames is recommended too. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Loved it.",5,2015,01,07
122,Fantastic Chelsea Harbour Hotel!!!,"Well, What can I say. We stayed at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel London for one night on the 30th December. Firstly can I mention what absolutely lovely staff! They all couldnt do more for us. They were all so polite and friendly with always a good evening, good morning or how can I help? Nothing was too much. The reception staff especially Piortyr (i think I may have spelt it wrong)  was really helpful. Also can I thank George and Tobias for their help too. The guys who parked our car were so nice and helpful and gave us some good information.
 Next the room...oh my goodness, really lovely with the most fantastic view over London and the Chelsea Harbour. We could see the London eye which was fantastic lit up at night!  When you enter the room you enter into a small hall, with a small loo to the right. Straight on and through into the sitting room, facing was a balcony overlooking the beautful views I have mentioned. To the left of the sitting room was the bedroom with a huge bed, with lovely sparkling white bedding and huge comfy pillows. Off the bedroom a large walk -in wardrobe with robes and slippers and a little dressing area, complete with small dressing table and mirror. Oh and a really good hairdryer, ladies you wont need to bring one with this! Then the large marbled bathroom with bath and shower over. Also a separate walk-in shower.  Lots of lovely toiletries to use. 
I found the whole suite lovely and clean and the bed really comfy. 
 After we had lounged in the room for a little while we decided to use the swimmming pool and saunas. Again a lovely (smallish) pool with subdued lighting. I also used the steam room and sauna. The next day we had  breakfast over looking the harbour which again was lovely. Breakfast was a very nice buffet style one. So if you are extremely hungry you can go for more. But you can have all the usual English breakfast, cereals, toast, jams etc etc. All in all I would highly recommend the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for some real luxury! 
The Location is excellent too, just around the corner from the train station that takes you to central London and all the tube stations. It is also just down the road from Chelsea football Club and the Chelsea Harbour sister Hotel which is next to the club. We really enjoyed our stay there and would like to thank the Chelsea Harbour Hotel for making it so memorable.",5,2015,01,06
122,A real taste of the west London high life...,"I pulled up at the Chelsea Marina Hotel at about 12:20pm in my Maserati (I wish).... ahem I mean my Corsa feeling distinctly out of place. In front of me was a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud and behind a bright orange Lamborghini. I had no idea where I was going as it was my first time at the hotel and I stopped to ask the concierge what I could do with my car, which he very kindly recommended I put in the NCP carpark just around the corner. He assured me that it would be cheaper than the £40/day valet and storage fee that the Hotel charged, which I thought was extremely nice of him (TIP: Use the NCP carpark, the concierge was right, it cost £22 for underground secure parking for 24 hours and is about 30 seconds walk from the hotel). I appreciated his honesty as he could have robbed me for £18 quid, but he was a nice fellow and genuinely wanted to be helpful. As I was turning my car around, the Chelsea team bus pulled up and the players began to emerge from the front entrance which was quite a surreal experience but sadly we were in a hurry and did not have time to mingle, and they had a match at 3pm. 
After a lovely afternoon enjoying hospitality at the Chelsea vs Hull City match at Stamford Bridge and then doing some shopping on the Kings Road, my girlfriend and I returned to actually get our first look at the room. As soon as we got through the front door of the Hotel we were offered help with our bags and checked in with a brief overview of where the various services were around the hotel, and then we were given our room keys and to the elevators we went. Upon opening the door to the room, we were astonished. I knew before going that every room was a suite, but the sheer size of the room was just mind-blowing. Let me stress to you, we paid for the cheapest room, as we are hardly burdened with huge amounts of cash, and still it was....well.... majestic for want of a better word (and I'm not a big fan of hotels in general, so you can imagine how good it must have been). Two bathrooms, A large lounge area with a 3 piece suite, a bar area with coffee machine and a multitude of other drinks, a large study area and desk and a huge flatscreen TV. There was also a walk-in wardrobe with robes and slippers as you would expect as well as an area specially devoted to doing makeup and whatnot as well as twin sinks in the bathroom, a huge bath and a large shower. The bedroom had another huge TV, an enormous bed and a balcony overlooking the marina. The room was spotlessly clean, spacious and even smelled amazing. It all exuded luxury. That evening we went downstairs for a look round and a lady offered to give us a tour of the hotel and the spa which again was fantastic and was a real shame we weren't staying long enough to use the pool and get spa treatments. It was, however, a nice gesture. 
The next morning after a wonderful sleep in that gigantic bed, we came down for breakfast and were seated at a table overlooking the marina watching the sun rise above the skyscrapers. A photographer's dream, but also quite nice to observe whilst eating your breakfast. The breakfast consisted of the usual cooked full english selection which was pretty good but not amazing (Im being critical now), a whole selection of cold meats and cheeses, as well as a number of breads and yoghurts etc. There were also porridge and pancakes available to order which was a nice touch but we did not take advantage of this service. The overall experience of the hotel was excellent, the room was incredible, the food was good and the staff, whilst a seeming a little cold at times, were in the most part helpful, particularly the concierge and the staff at the pool/spa. I would highly recommend this to anyone who was looking for a really memorable stay in West London, worth every penny of the rather hefty price tag... just make sure you have a go in the pool!",5,2015,01,05
122,sorry to say it's slipping...,"We stay here quite a lot and I've always been impressed in the past, but I'm sorry to say that I think the Chelsea Harbour is slipping since the takeover by Millennium & Copthorne Hotels. yes you still get a suite for your money and the value is still very good (especially at weekends), but during our last visit in December we noticed small things slipping…The door staff had to be found in order to take our car and park it, staff in the bar got our order wrong and breakfast (which had been the highlight of our stay in the past) was decidedly average. the buffet looked uninspired and the various dishes were lukewarm at best. Now, we visited in the slow period between Christmas and New Year, so perhaps the staff levels were below usual, but I might think very carefully before visiting again – it feels like this is now becoming just a pretty ordinary hotel….",3,2015,01,05
122,Good hotel but same old problem..!!,"We have stayed at Chelsea harbour twice with children. One of the preferred hotels to stay in London with family as rooms are suites.We booked the hotel via Expedia for ( 2 adults+ 2 Children) and payed the full amount in advance and got the booking confirmation.

At checkin- they were asking us £40 extra to do the beds for the children. This was no where stated in booking and hotel waived this after much negotiation.

Watch out for this charge as no where in expedia or booking.com..etc websites mention this.

Note: This is only made clear if you make booking by calling the hotel.Not everyone books hotels directly as don't get best rates",3,2015,01,03
122,"Stunning and beautiful suite hotel , Would highly recommend.","I spent new years eve in the hotel , Just fabulous was greeted the moment we arrived by the doorman who took our luggage then Tobias checked us in swiftly and we went up to our suit . Wow ! just amazing , Beautiful room with bedroom , lounge area 2 bathrooms , balcony and received a plate of fruit in the evening our champagne we brought was put on ice for us and towels changed etc just fantastic service throughout and cannot thank you all enough for your attentive amazing service . I would definitely recommend and will certainly return. All staff where lovely from check in to cleaners and the building and surrounding just adds to how special it is .",5,2015,01,02
122,A wonderful New Years Eve venue,"We stayed at Chelsea Harbour hotel for New Years Eve and it was a wonderful experience, The family 3 generations of us all thought it very good value for money. The rooms were inviting and comfortable. We each had a suite with out respective partners and our son and his wife found the rooms to be child friendly and also the hotel provided a childs cot free of charge. We did have to wait an hour for each room but the reception is very nice and comfortable and the hotel provided free drinks for our wait. We could watch the fireworks from the harbour wall which was a bonus. We can recommend this hotel whole heartedly all the family had a fabulous time and we are planning a return when we all get together in London again. A very good hotel.",5,2015,01,02
122,A good nights stay,"Very good check in. 

The doorman was off parking another car so another person stepped in to help us and got us inside and in the warm.  Easy check in, lovely room with a view of the marina.  Later on in the afternoon a very helpful lady turned up and furnished us with water, coffee, tea and milk.  The question i have is why do they, when the know two people are booked into a room only leave 3 little cartons of milk!  Surely time and motion would save them time to leave more as it would mean customers would not have to call down for more to be sent up!  A false economy  I would say.  otherwise  a very good stay, only slightly soiled at the checkout where a very miserable lady who was working on the front desk on the morning of the 29th was very miserable and provided no customer service at all.  She needs to be sorted otherwise, the staff could not be more helpful, even the barman left the bar to show me how to walk into the marina.  Very good stay.",4,2015,01,02
122,Excellence!,I have just returned from a two night stay at the Chelsea harbour hotel and I have to say it couldn't be better!! From the moment I arrived the staff couldn't do enough for me. My marina suite had a lovely view over the harbour and surrounding London with plenty of amenities. Housekeeping kept my room spotless and the hotel itself was immaculate. The breakfast was  bustling but service from the young team was as prompt as you could expect and the views over the harbour were excellent. Great transport links to surrounding London and all in all a fantastic location! Well worth a stay be it for business or leisure! ,5,2014,12,29
122,Fantastic hotel,"I love watching M I C ( hubby not too keen) so when we decided to get married in London there was only one place I wanted to be and so glad we did . On booking we was asked if there was anything we would like and as we had already booked a suite with a view
I said I'm sure it would be fine but to look out for flowers that was to be delivered as I was getting married on the 23rd June .On arrival we was very impressed with the whole team that looked after us from start to Finnish,,and after unpacking and relaxing on  our lovely veranda with lovely views over a small harbour,there was a knock on the door a lovely surprise from the management a bottle of champagne and strawberries wishing us all the best for our forthcoming marriage ( we thought this was s lovely touch ) they just couldn't do enough for the both of us throughout out our stay and making sure my flowers arrived on time  .So if 
like me you like MIC( or even if you don't) you will love this classy hotel and until we return ( we will) Thank you x",5,2014,12,28
122,Wow!,"We stayed at the hotel on Christmas Eve and from the moment we dropped the car off with the conceirge to the moment we left, the 5 star service we received was second to none. 
We had an overloaded Christmas present bag break on arrival and the male receptionist went out of his way to get us a replacement. We were early for our room so we enjoyed a drink in the bar looking out at the marina. Again, the service was exceptional. Our suite was beautiful, had amazing views and had everything that we required was there. Our dinner was delicious and I have to say the breakfast we had was the best hotel breakfast we have ever eaten. 
I have been fortunate to stay in lots of 5* hotels but I would say that the Chelsea Harbour Hotel has been the most impressive yet. We will return (especially as we got engaged here that night!) Thank you for the wonderful experience.",5,2014,12,28
122,fabulous hotel but staff need training,"Stayed in two interconnecting suits as a surprise 18th birthday present for my son. The suits were fantastic beautiful view of the harbour, loads of room and well furnished.  The let down was the service more like 3 star than 5 star, no help with our bags staff chatting instead of checking us in, and at breakfast the next morning the staff didn't have a clue, had to ask for our order to be taken tea served in coffee pots and coffee served in tea pots only hot milk provided and waiter found it strange when I asked for cold milk I had to explain it was for my tea.  I did complain to the supervisor and service was much better on the second breakfast but we were the only guests on the second day.  When we returned to our suite the maid/housekeeper had left a dirty rag and paper on the floor in the toilet this was sorted after a phone call but it is not what you expect from a quality hotel.  Management please take note staff need more training and attention to detail.",3,2014,12,27
122,Excellent stay and great views ,"I stayed here for 1 night for a work team building session and it was lovely. It's directly opposite Imperial Wharf station and has great views overlooking the Thames and you can even see the London Eye and the Shard. Rooms were very spacious and clean. Our rooms came with a coffee machine and 2 TVs - 1 in the living room and 1 in the bedroom. Unfortunately,  my room overlooked the station and it was fairly noisy in the morning. The breakfast menu was extensive and they even had gluten free bread for me! ",4,2014,12,23
122,Good in all areas,"Weekend shopping trip in town for us and staying here made it more comfortable. 
Great area, ideal for kings road. Nearest tube is imperial wharf. Feels a safe upmarket area, comfortable walking about, no issues. Mostly upmarket goats and the Chelsea design school next door. 
Hotel was clean, smart and all staff encountered were friendly. Concierges excellent, not just the standard coin operated tip machines., pleasant change. 
Hotel overlooks the Chelsea marina which is a nautical lock area of the Thames and holds around 40 boats... Some looked very flash and adds to the glamour and romance when sipping your wine on the terrace with the marina and Christmas lights reflected in the water....recommended. 
All rooms in this hotel are suites, so you get plenty of space, plus balcony Ours was 500 for two nights and in my opinion, well worth it nice quality coffee machine, fruit, water etc as expected, but all good. Have paid more for a lot less. 
Had no issues with noise as other contributors have mentioned. Yes the railway is close but it was never a noticeable intrusion on a Friday or Saturday.
There is a nice pool underneath that was never busy and we used everyday. Can't comment on the spa element as we didn't use it. Pool and changing rooms were great, towels all clean, staff friendly and not on commission to sell products and treatments, so none of the usual hassle. 
We steered clear of breakfast following other guests comments but, looked fine when I glanced in to satisfy my curiosity. 
Bar area was elegant and functional. A few at least 3 families with children around in the bar which was really refreshing to see. Not a problem and staff were relaxed about the kids, not hostile as often the case in London, from experience. Cocktails from 12quid. Jd and coke at £8.50, so bang on what we expected. 
All in all, made you feel special and welcome. Nice change.
Taxi in to Waterloo station is was 16quid. 
If you are looking for a smart classy hotel for a romantic break and don't want the intense madness of west end hotels, this is for you.
Will be back.
Thanks",4,2014,12,19
122,a pleasant experience,"I visited this hotel several times for business ad pleasure. Everything is nice, rooms, restaurant and location. You cannot understand to be in a metropolis like  London,  so close to down town, it seems to be in a Marina over the sea! but you are close to Thames. Chelsea is a high level district very quite and well served by train and tubes. My suggestion is also to walk (for our health) in 30 minutes on foot you can reach London down town.",5,2014,12,18
122,Dec mid-week overnight stay,"Staying to attend an awards dinner in London, so travelling to and from the venue in Mayfair alone. This is an excellent hotel, the suites are very very comfortable, they even had the hairdryer  positioned in from of a mirror with a chair, unheard of in most hotels. I couldn't fault the thoughtfulness of the decor and design. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the staff were very professional and helpful. I would definitely stay here again, and bring my husband next time.",5,2014,12,16
122,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here last weekend for a Christmas shopping trip.

Room sizes were the best we have had in London.

Service very good. Room facilities great.

Gym and Pool very very good.

Overall a fantastic stay. Good value and quickly onto Kings Road and beyond.

Lovely views of Harbour and Central London .

Only down side was breakfast on the Sunday. Not very well managed at all, but it was dealt with in the correct manner at check out.

Would definitely stay again :)

Apart from the breakfast 10/10 !",5,2014,12,16
122,Excellent,"This is a fantastic hotel in every way. First class food, cocktails and our suite on the 7th floor had an amazing view and met every expectation. It was a great stay. It's location next to the harbour, the river and Kings Rd was also pleasing.",5,2014,12,13
122,Luxury short break,"I booked two suites for a special occasion, both with riverside views. From the very beginning it was clear that this was going to be a special time. The suites were exquisite with to bathrooms, TVs, lounge rooms and balconies. Attention to detail throughout was first class and the staff were extremely professional, helpful and charming. My friends who came with us were equally impressed.

Prices in the restaurant for breakfast and in the bar the previous evening reflected the status of the venue. If you're going to stay at a hotel like this then you have to understand that it isn't going to be cheap to eat there.

All in all if you're looking for a classy venue for a special occasion then this hotel is well worth considering.",5,2014,12,13
122,nice hotel somewhat over rated though !!,i stayed at this hotel when visiting my daughter who lives in Fulham.I was a little dissapointed on arrival to be told that they did not have a room for me despite having a booking but they can give me a room in central London sister hotel?Well i had just taxied across London from central to get to this hotel with my 80 year old mother and no way was i going back.After a word with someone in management i was told ok we have you a room.I wondered when i saw the arrival of the Chelsea FC  team if that had anything to do with the mix up?Suite was nice but would have preffered a marina view .We ate in the restaurant with my daughter and her boyfriend and we found it good value for money and the food was lovely.The swimming pool and sauna was a pleasant chill time after a hectic day shopping.,4,2014,12,10
122,One night stay,"We had plans to head out in London with a big groups of friends for lunch and a few Christmas drinks with friends so decided the CHH was the place to be located for the overnight stay.

Sure, we could have just got the train home and it would have been cheaper but where is the fun in that? After dropping the car off with the same doorman as my last visit about a year ago we checked in then made a dash for Covent Garden. I say dash but the train/tube system from here takes a bit of time, next time I'll just walk or get a cab to Fulham Broadway underground straight away. 

Anyway after a great day out in London we arrived back early evening and got into our room - I do like the rooms here and I would say for the money they are very good. The marina side view is best unfortunately not this time around. Anyway, after a quick freshen up we need some dinner so went down to the bar which had various tables full. The service was a bit slow but we generally like relaxed anyway, it looked like there wasn't enough staff on to be honest. Anyway the bar food wasn't bad, we only really wanted a snack after being out all day then we retired early.

Breakfast time and I'm sure the buffet arrangement is new, I preferred it to be honest as you can choose exactly what you like. The sausages were good, the view of the marina was good, shame about the drizzle in the air!

Other bits, it's nice to get a welcome from senior staff on arrival. It's not so great to get the wrong room.",4,2014,12,09
122,Excellent stay,"Beautiful suite with a sensible Jack and Jill bathroom. Steaks were cooked to perfection. A bit disappointing service from waiter who did not show (two ladies ) to their table. Shame really as the rest of the staff were so helpful -Pavel amd Thomaz who were so patient sorting out email problems. Our room was near the lift but there was no noise. 
I hope to return with my husband and would highly recomend this hotel for the very high standard all round.",5,2014,12,07
122,Very good overall. ,Thought it a great hotel with very good rooms and reasonable prices for this area of London. Walked to Chelsea and Knightsbridge from the hotel and it was all beautiful. Would definitely stay here again. Few complaints - think breakfast too expensive @ £24 - and the internet is just ok. ,4,2014,12,07
122,Best value Hotel in London,"My first choice when staying over in town. Great rooms though avoid room 109. Good spa and facilities, excellent dining and reasonably priced parking next door. £20 cab fare to Piccadilly Circus. I would recommend this hotel for business and excellent for families when visiting at the weekend. ",4,2014,12,07
122,Luxury river view.,"We stayed here for just one night on visit to London for the theatre.
Having never stayed here before, we thought it worth a try, our usual hotel in Westminster was full.

What a great choice, on arrival the staff had our luggage out of the car, which was then whisked away for parking within minutes.
The hotel is very modern looking, very open plan inside, extremely friendly and efficient staff, check in only took minutes, which is impressive as the hotel was very busy.

Our suite was lovely, one of the best I've ever stayed in, large rooms, very well appointed and decor in excellent condition.
Fantastic views of the harbour and the river beyond, and even further. Views on to Central London.
Bathrooms are large, and fittings etc are of a very good standard, and two toilets.
Very quiet rooms at night, beds are extremely comfortable.
Proberly one of the quietest we've ever stayed in anywhere in the world.

We tried the bars and food, again of a high standard, staff are very attentive.
I do disagree with a compulsory service charge on the bill in bars, this should always be at the customers choice..!!
But a minor complaint, in an otherwise excellent stay.

I'm sure we will stay here again, it is an excellent hotel, better than a lot of 5* London hotels.
The only downside was that it is £20 taxi trip into Trafalgar Square, otherwise its a train then tube...??

Well done to the management and guest staff for running such a pleasant hotel, and we will recommend it to friends and family,",5,2014,12,04
122,Top Hotel for an excellent price,"Top Hotel for an excellent price, the staff attention is second to none the rooms are replete in splendor. 
Only 1 very small gripe that the bar closes @ 1pm
The overground stations are Fast & very close into London main.",5,2014,12,03
122,One night.,"I stayed here on business for one night as a female traveller. It was a shame that I could share it with my husband as the suite was fabulous.
I didn't have a view of the harbour, although it wasn't really necessary as the room was extremely comfortable with lounge, bar area, two WC's, full bathroom and bedroom.
It's a shame I wasn't there longer to take advantage of the facilities.",5,2014,11,29
122,A pleasant view and a pleasant stay,"It's time I give some feedback on a positive hotel experience. I chose to stay at the CHH whilst in town with my family as I wanted to visit both Kew Gardens and Knightsbridge and letting my daughters go for a swim. The Fulham Road and Kings Road are always nice for a stroll as is the riverside. The CHH impressed in many ways. The rooms were large, well kept and really clean. I have to commend the hotel on that and the breakfast which was actually very good along with great service and attentiveness. We had a slight delay with room service one particular evening, it was no big deal other than me being in a rush to celebrate my wife's 40th, but the staff were swift to make amends and in a considerate manner.",5,2014,11,25
122,"Lovely staff, comfortable suite","It is many years since I stayed here, and the décor was definitely needing a little TLC in our suite, although it was very comfortable.
I had requested a double, but as I booked through a booking engine we ended up with a twin - so be warned!

We didn't eat here this time, but the menu is very pricey.

The pool facilities I seem to recall as being excellent - although again I did not have the opportunity of using them this time.

It is a bit off the beaten track, but this does have its advantages.  Handy for Stamford Bridge, and we did see Jose and the coaching team when we returned late on the Friday evening!",4,2014,11,23
122,World-Class Stay,"Stayed here for a couple of days while visiting London, had such a nice time I really do love London. Great hotel to stay and see a little more of the Chelsea area. Great bars and shops that are within walking distance

Very happy with my stay I'll stay again :-D",5,2014,11,23
122,Pleasant london stay,"Great location but well away from shops etc if you want to walk, but everything a short taxi ride away. Very nice open areas and pool complex, room large with seperate lounge in nice condition although hall way very tatty. Staff not so friendly across the board but proffesional at there tasks. Great for a few nights. Try the LotsRoad pub on the approach road really good food and great staff.",4,2014,11,22
122,Would definitely return,"Positives:  Huge rooms, spotless bathroom, lovely shower, very clean throughout, nice mini bar and snacks, very comfy beds and pillows, quiet at night, breakfast very good. Very good staff, polite and helpful especially Benjamin on reception.

Negatives: My only negative was, for us, a little too far from the centre of London had to get a train or cab. Other than that a very good hotel.",4,2014,11,18
122,Such a wonderful experience,"Great staff, so accommodating, Tobias was so friendly and kind and went out of his way to help.  I broke my foot and was on crutches, so everyone on the staff made me feel right at home.  I also had a huge room/ (all the rooms are suites), with a great view and it feels so comfortable to stay in for a long period of time! I would highly reccommend.",5,2014,11,17
122,Lovely hotel,"We've just returned from a fantastic 3 night stay. Everything from the room, service and staff is of 5 star quality. Any issues are resolved quickly showing excellent customer service. Would highly recommend to anybody wanting a lovely hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the city. ",5,2014,11,17
122,"Enormous suites, very professional hotel!","Stayed here for 4 nights in October for a conference- for London, the rooms are huge - separate living and bedrooms. Loved having the espresso machine in room! Really comfortable for two people, with separated bath/toilet areas.

Breakfast in the hotel was nice, but I preferred room service breakfast which was also included in my room. Walked to The Waterside restaurant for dinner one night, down on the Thames path - great food and bar. Convenient access to Imperial Park overground station, quick walk up to Kings Road shops, scenic stroll down the Thames over to Battersea Park ( a real gem in the city!). All in all a great location and nice hotel. Would stay here again if I needed more space than a typical hotel and was willing to pay a bit more for it.",4,2014,11,15
122,Totally amazing,Fantastic views over London. The room was very impressive. We had a seperate living room and  balcony. The bed was very comfortable. There was a huge choice for breakfast which was tasty. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Definately visit again.,5,2014,11,14
122,EXCELLENT ALL ROUND,"From the efficient and friendly greeting of the door staff and reception to the breakfast, the hotel gives a high level of service. Rooms were well equipped and roomy and the location of the hotel whilst being convenient for central London is far enough away from the sometimes claustrophobic  pressure of the West End. Breakfast choice is beyond the normal and the restaurant is run in a calm and efficient way. Food quality is again very good.",5,2014,11,11
122,Fantastic stay!,"Excellent hotel, very close to the King's Road.
Our room was beautiful and had 2 balconies with amazing views across London.
We had a card and a bottle of wine waiting for us in our room as we were celebrating our anniversary - this was a lovely added extra touch.
Can't wait to visit again :-)",5,2014,11,10
122,An average 4 star experience,"Not a 5 star experience. Second bed was a pullout and quite uncomfortable. Simple touches like a chocolate with turndown were missing. Tried to charge for newspapers that weren't asked for. Asked them to order a cab to take me to the station and they instead gave me their own car which cost 3 times as much. Worst of all I asked for an early morning wake up call and they didn't give one. They only realised when they saw me at reception....but no apology just one acusing the other of forgetting to do it.  It's an OK 4 star hotel but our experience was definitely not a 5 star one.

Dermot O'Connor",2,2014,11,07
122,Caring staff,"I have to say that this place is amazing. We arrived at noon and our suite was ready, despite the 3pm check in policy. We were greeted by a friendly door who walked us to the reception desk. The receptionist was so friendly and polite and even showed us to our suite. I felt so special. The spa is amazing and they even have a pool. The suite was amazing and very luxurious. Breakfast the next morning was very good and attentive . This is a real gem and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,05
122,Amazing stay,What an amazing stay. Had a lovely Suite overlooking the Marina. Stayed with my partner. The staff in the hotel is really great and welcoming. We used the pool and loved it. Can't wait to come back. This place is amazing,5,2014,11,05
122,A coffee shower!,"Great friendly staff, lovely room, good breakfast spoiled by incident with coffee machine in room which was badly delt with. 
We used the coffee machine which sprayed coffee all over the carpet. Hotel staff cleared it up well and said the machine was broken. I assumed a couple of days later that the machine had been replaced and used it to make a coffee. I was sprayed with coffee, luckily it did not scald me but my clothes were covered. They were taken to the laundry and cleaned well. The next day the machine was still there. 
I just could not understand why in the first place an out of order sign had not been put on the machine, or why it had not been replaced or just removed. A  known faulty  coffee machine with the ability to spray coffee everywhere should not have been left in the room.
If it not had been for this incident I would have rated this hotel highly.",3,2014,11,04
122,Can't wait to stay again,"Stayed at this hotel many times over the years but this was the first time since it has been taken over and re-named. Stayed for 2 nights in one of the penthouse suites and it was amazing. Terrific views over Chelsea harbour and London and room was one of the best we have stayed in. Only one problem we had with the room was the plasma t.v and telephone had faults but were sorted out very quickly. Reception desk has been moved and is now 2 individual desks - think I preferred it as one large desk but a minor thing to complain about really. Breakfast in the room was lovely, arrived on time and was hot. All staff were very helpful. Bar closed quite early I thought so if you want a late drink it would be room service in your room. Only criticism with the bar staff was that we had to ask for a bowl of peanuts to go with our drinks and as we were spending quite a lot of money in there as was with 3 other couples felt they should have automatically come up with the drinks. Hotel welcomes children, unfortunately same can't be said for some of the guests as over heard one lady refusing to eat in the restaurant at Sunday lunch time as children were in there!!! Great location for the Kings Road in Chelsea and Chelsea football stadium. If you visit this hotel I would highly recommend trying 'The Big Easy crab shack' on the kings road. Great food and great atmosphere - although book to avoid disappointment. This hotel is one of (if only) all suites hotel in London. Highly recommend and can't wait to visit again in the bear future. ",5,2014,11,04
122,What a let down :((((,"As I am pregnant my husband decided we should have a few days away as we won't be able to go on holiday next year as we usually would as baby is due. We decided to really splash out and make it a holiday to remember. Well how wrong could we have got it! The hotel staff, or the ones we met, were rude. My husband and I are not part of the jet set but even so, we should not have been watched as we were. The hotel was full of very rich individuals who assumed that their wealth meant they could be loud, vulgar, obnoxious, rude and treat you like stuff they stood in. Because we didn't wear designer wear from head to toe I can only assume that they thought we were famous from the way they were staring. We have stayed in many 5* hotels and this was no way a 5* hotel. There were stains on the ceiling which looked like a water leak. There were stains on the carpet, the fans in both toilets didn't work, the air con in the living room only blew hot air, the patio door was that heavy/stiff that it took 2 of us to pull it open. We ate in the bar which was quite overpriced and there was a discretional service charge added to our bill which we were not made aware of. If we had of known we would have refused to pay it as the service was below what we expected from a supposed 5* hotel. The breakfast at Premier Inn was better than at this hotel. £23.50 each for bacon as hard as leather, scrambled eggs as runny as mucus, the sausages still oinked. On more than one day I had to ask for a plate and bread for the toaster. The cereal collection was ok but not great. The fresh fruit was pretty good. We did have to wait 10-15 mins for a pot of tea by this time we had almost eaten our breakfast. The evening meals were nice although they always arrived warm as if they had been stood around for a while. My husband and son got good poisoning so 2 days were ruined by pretty constant vomiting. On one night we had room service. The waiter was really friendly but when we rang for the table to be collected the lady on the phone was very rude. Again we were charged a service charge on top of a £4.50 charge for room service. When we made a simple request for more tbags and milk we were told to use the minute carton in the mini bar priced at 80p and the tbag request was totally ignored. Several times our key cards didn't work and you can't even use the lift to go to reception without your key card so again we were treated like children by the person we rang. As we couldn't get to reception we rang them to send someone up and he made out that we must be idiots that don't know how to use a key card. When he realised both cards were faulty he tried to blame the sensor on the door. The bath wasn't very deep at all and it was dirty. The carpet wasn't hoovered the whole time we were there. We really couldn't wait to get home. I think I'd have really lost my temper if we'd have stayed any longer. People found it acceptable to push and shove past a pregnant woman! Not once was my son given a child's menu or offered different breakfast items like other children at the hotel. I expected soft drinks to be expensive but £3.50 for a can of coke and £5 for a small cup of tea..... Nowhere on the web site does it tell you that the hotel is on the flight path! There were planes flying over every few minutes pretty much 24/7 you could wave at the pilot they were that close. If your looking for a quiet luxury hotel this is not the one for you. I don't really have anything good at all to say about this place. Poor location, poor service, extortionate prices, below standard rooms. Even the door attendants didn't open the doors for you!!!! In short this hotel was a massive let down and the holiday was ruined.",1,2014,11,01
122,Fabulous location and great rooms,"This hotel is advertised as a five star and it could easily be there with a fabulous location, the bar and restaurant overlook the marina and the rooms and décor throughout are really nice. However there are still some problems with service and housekeeping,  most are really minor but irritating like, we booked for three adults in the suite but there was only one bottle of water, two dressing gowns and one pair of slippers?! We would just like some consistency on what is provided per guest?  We booked on a laterooms deal so we were really pleased with everything but if I had paid full price have been making a complaint as on our second day the room was not cleaned and when we returned at 5pm,  I rang to ask if there was a reason but no explanation or apology was offered although someone was sent to a a very quick clean around whilst we were in the gym.  Breakfast the first two days was fantastic and spot on but on the third the hotel was really busy and tables were not cleared and the selection was reduced as the kitchen and waiting staff could not keep up.  Overall however we really enjoyed staying here and would definitely look to stay here when visiting London next time.  Hope this is  useful.",4,2014,10,31
122,5 star Hotel staff training needed," Arrival ... Concierge great explained that check in was to the right. Inside there were 2 desks with no ' normal ' reception area ....looked around looking lost until we approached girl behind desk asking if this was reception it was . Surely she could have been proactive and welcomed us... We were only ones in hotel at that time.    Gym.... Gave our room numbers were given towels and instructions ... Girl on desk didn't give special card to get in changing room so looked a t@t for five mins trying to get in changing room. Went back no apology given. Housekeeping ... Sounds daft but I've never been in a hotel where staff blank you in corridor they do here ! Coffee machine didn't work either in room 223. All in all great hotel pricey and the service lets it down ... Staff training needed. ",3,2014,10,29
122,Great views!,"This was my first time staying here and hopefully not my last. A lovely art deco building and interiors, very helpful staff and a ""friendly"" relaxed hotel. The restaurant serves quality delicious food and service is very good. The suite we had was on one of the top floors and had beautiful views over the river and Chelsea harbour. Efficient room service, clean well kept rooms and giant balcony framing stunning views. Felt like a little penthouse and overlooking the harbour rather than a road ensured a good nights sleep. We had a lovely stay there. Unfortunately didn't get to try the spa this time but would love to return.",4,2014,10,28
122,Nice Spa - Views & Breakfast !,"We booked this hotel for our 4 night Honeymoon - we advised the hotel we were on Honeymoon, on getting here, we were welcomed to the check in desk - we were not given any form of congratulations which for any hotel would not take much never mind a 5*..!!! Dissapointed about the lack of welcome considering we were Honeymooners, this however is sepecific to us & should not put you off :-) after checking in we went up to room I'd put room at a top 4* not 5*, very nice rooms though - seperate lounge - powerful shower, more than comfortable... Breakfast is great, lots of choice, you won't be dissapointed - spa is nice, pool is lovely and warm steam & sauna nice, but men&women are seperate for steam/sauna... Location is nice if you want to be out if central London taxi in is about £21-30 - train station is just over the road you can see it from hotel 25min trip into London ... We ate here first night, I had club sandwich which was nice - Husband had t-bone steak - £30 & not impressed more bone than meat - no veg - 3 small vine tomatoes & chips, ordered a side of veg which came when he had finished his meal, waiter didn't even ask how he would like his steak cooked - we had to call him back to tell him, not 5* service !!!!! This hotel is worth stopping at though 5 mins to Kings Road - on Chelsea Harbour - hope this review helps :-)   ",4,2014,10,22
122,Excellent start to the stay that safely fizzled.,"We stayed overnight for a wedding. We were promised a reduction as part of the wedding booking and were pleased to be given a room at early in order to get ready. The staff were all helpful and pleasant. The room was excellent but only 2 small UTH milk left for drinks. No biscuits ! Put this down to the room being given early. Service and food at the reception was excellent.
However the next morning at breakfast was disappointing. The service was shocking ! Staff seemed not too bothered about serving, not many on the floor to see and when there was someone they were very slow to serve and hardly spoke. Tea was Luke warm by the time the milk came and refill tea did not come with additional milk. Breakfast bar not kept stocked . Long waits for refills and cutlery. Cooked food was very good but toast was cold when arrived and too late !
Checking out we were charged vat on top of room which we were led to believe was already included ! At these prices we were disappointed .Sad finish to what had begun so well.",3,2014,10,19
122,Ripped Off,"I was given a room at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel on 9 October after being moved there by their sister hotel the Copthorne which is located next to Chelsea FC (the Copthorne said due to a 'technical error they had over-allocated rooms that night. I suspect they just gave my room to someone else because I checked in late). 

When I arrived at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, I was asked for my credit card details to pay for any room extras which immediately made me suspicious. I was shown to my suite, the Abingdon, and was told I would be given my room key which by the next morning had still not arrived. When I went to reception to get my key, I was asked by the receptionist for my ID, the first time ever this has happened to me at a British hotel.

Anyway, today I checked my credit card bill and I discovered a £756 bill! It goes without saying I am furious and it caps a very bad experience for me with this hotel group. My strong advice is not to stay at the Chelsea Harbour and the Copthorne Stamford Bridge.",1,2014,10,16
122,Lovely hotel but a few problems with service,"I booked this hotel for our family to stay  as part of my husband's 60th birthday celebrations. The hotel is in a lovely position and room was spotless. However, on arriving after 3pm on Saturdaty (check iin is from 2pm) we,were told our room was not ready. The receptionist has to seek approval beofre offering us an alternative room hence there was some delay. With an 11am chck out, I fail to see how the hotel cant make a room available in time for the agreed check in.  The room was comfortable, clean and beautifully spacious.  The service at breakfast was hugely disappointing. Twice we had to remind the staff to bring milk for the tea which then was cold. We asked three times for hot water to heat the tea only for our request to be forgotten each time. In the end we gave up. Disappointing end to our stay!",3,2014,10,12
122,Lots of space in your own little suite,"The space in these rooms is excellent for the price you pay. Get a room on the Marina side and you will enjoy a little entrance hall with storage cupboard, your own little living room with lots of space, and a great size bedroom / bathroom.  Was perfect for a 10 night stay on business and having two rooms meant not being cramped in a small hotel room typical for London. Location is fabulous, right on the river so perfect for jogging. Great spa/pool/gym and great restaurants / shopping nearby, not to mention the Lots Road antique houses. Overall the service was good, friendly and efficient. Improvements could be made in the room service (couple of mistakes) and the housekeeping was inconsistent. (only noticed due to my long stay). Great stay, and I look forward to coming back.",4,2014,10,12
122,Beyond expectation and faultless.,"surpassed all my expectations,large sunny suite.Great decor,huge room size,privacy 
,quality finish, light wood, immaculate attention to detail,beautiful toiletries,warm welcome from George Hunter,Miguel Munoz,staff. I hope to return soon.

122,Incredibly quiet for London,"We stayed for one night in a suite overlooking Chelsea. The bed was really comfortable, room and bathroom both very clean, but best of all there was no traffic or street noise at all. Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the marina was beautiful and a big thank you to the housekeeping staff for the bottle of champagne to celebrate our wedding anniversary. All the staff were very helpful and we loved our stay here.",5,2014,10,06
122,Great view of the Thames and a harbourside bar,"A well managed, well positioned little gem of a hotel which is located on Chelsea Harbour off the beaten trail of most tourists.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  They are reliable.  The restaurant/bar has a view of the harbour with a lovely terrace for drinks or dinner outside which on a lovely London night is magic.  We had a party of about 18 for drinks and dinner.  The staff was helpful and accomodating, the food delicious and the drink fairly priced.  This location will take you a little longer to get to the top attractions but it will enable you to experience the loveliness of the river in a relaxed setting.",4,2014,10,02
122,Very Relaxing,"Stayed here for 2 nights, had a very relaxing stay.  The rooms are very clean as is the hotel main areas, the pool area was spotless and the pool was a lovely temperature.  Would highly recommend this hotel. Did not have a meal in the hotel only because there are loads of good restaurants in the vicinity. Good view over harbour.",5,2014,10,02
122,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is lovely all the rooms are suites and they all look over the harbour, it has a lovely pool , the breakfast is lovely and the staff are so friendly , this hotel is within walking distance to Chelsea football ground stamford bridge, definitely worth a visit",5,2014,10,01
122,Good stay,"Stayed for just one night in connection with my partner's 50th birthday.  We had stayed at the hotel before when it was the Wyndham so had a good idea of what to expext.

I booked the hotel well in advance and requested a nice part of the hotel, ideally with a harbour view due to the special aspect of the stay.  Unfortunately however this had not been taken in to account so we ended up looking in to city and over workmen putting a covered walkway together which was a bit disappointing.

We arrived at 2.50pm and were told that our room was not ready.  On asking how long it would be, the receptionist pointed out that we were early (10 minutes!!) and would have to wait unitl housekeeping had finished.  We went to the bar and ordered two bottles of lager which cost us £12.40 for the priviledge while we waited for the room.  Went back to reception a couple of times and ended up having to be quite insistant that we were allowed in to the room to get ready to go out.

The hotel is all suite so rooms are lovely with no complaint.  We went out to eat so didn't use the bar again or restaurant.

A lovely hotel but on this occasion the 'personal touch' we experienced when it was the Wyndham wasn't there but that wouldn't put us off returning or recommending on the basis that it was a one-off.",4,2014,09,26
122,"Great value, service location NO FLAWS","This is my 3rd visit.
I am pleased to say the change in ownership has only improved a very good hotel to a great venue.
I've been in 408 , marina view room.
Lots of space, great shower, a/c like usa, bright bathroom, restaurant with a view, no faults to list.
Truly 5 star.",5,2014,09,20
122,nice hotel,i stayed for 4 nights during a uk business trip. the hotel is nice and clean. location is relatively good. breakfast was alright - nothing special compared to other 5star hotels. there is not much to complain about except that the housekeeping/ minibar/ laundry staff is in a hurry and doesn't like to wait until one opens the door for them (although I had the 'do not disturb' sign on)....this happened several times and I wasn't very happy with that. other than that...nice hotel to stay!,4,2014,09,19
122,Very classy hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights. Loved every minute of it. Great staff in the lobby. Rooms were very classy. We had a small lounge in our room which was perfect for relaxing in. There was also a TV each room which made it even better.,5,2014,09,08
122,"Loved it, such a treat","We stayed here last night and loved it. 

Suite was beautiful and really spacious, bed was comfy and shower was great. Nice little extra touches like umbrella in the room. We asked for an ice bucket for our champagne and they brought it up
in about two minutes. My step daughter got a beautiful cake in her room to celebrate her birthday which was very thoughtful, thank you. 

We had massages in the spa which were very good indeed. 

Good location within walking distance to Fulham Broadway and the Kings Road, the Imperial Wharf overground station is right around the corner. 

Breakfast was of great quality and we really enjoyed everything we had.

Thank you for making our stay such a memorable one, we would recommend and definitely want to return. ",5,2014,09,07
122,Excessively priced empty restaurant,"
Cavernous restaurant in a scenic location overlooking the harbour. We should have been alerted to what was to come as it was empty except for two other tables on a Saturday night

The service was friendly and enthusiastic. Italian style menu but very indifferent food quality. The Gazpacho was salt and vinegar water with a dash of tomato which we had to send back! The main courses were indifferent with small portions of extra veg coming in at £5 for two table spoons full. I asked for fruit for desert and again got a small portion of dry strawberries of poor quality. The other desserts were good. The bill for all of this for 5 people was £268 which is excessive to say the least as there were only 2 small glasses of wine

Pity the location and service is not matched by the food. Why can't the hotel do a reasonably priced menu of good quality simple Italian dishes?

",2,2014,09,07
122,"Beautiful hotel, very poor breakfast service!","We stayed here for 4 days for business with 4 people. The location is outstanding, the styling very chic. The doormen, the hostess, everyone is very friendly and helpful. We booked a double suite and one 2-persons room which was beautiful, very spacious, nice and quit. The balcony terrace of the hotel is very nice to sit on while having breakfast and a drink at night. Too bad, at 11 pm we had to go inside, policy of the hotel. However breakfast is a complete DiSASTER. Is this the same hotel? The waiters were very unprofessional, not friendly, there was no good management leadership as it seems, no good organisation. Everyone is running around. A lot of food and drinks were finished without being refilled up during the normal breakfast time or it took a very long time, too long for us, we had to visit a tradeshow on time. One of my collegues told one of the waiters the omelet was finished. And the answer was hilarious: 'it will be filled up... soon' ... On weekdays there is apparently no omelet on the buffet, so we ordered it a la carte and it took more then 25 minutes to serve. We ordered 3 cappucino's and 2 of them were lukewarm, the other one was hot (we got new ones). The left over blackberries I could take my hands on... was moldy! It was hard to order anything as the waiters weren't looking at the guests but were arguing with each other... Sorry, but we will not book the breakfast option again.",2,2014,09,03
122,Superb service,"Booked this as spa treat.  Given a fantastically warm welcome and received amazing service from all staff.  Suites lovely, really comfortable and have everything you need.  Lovely pool and had a great massage.  Food in restaurant really good, would happily book here again as a special weekend treat.",5,2014,08,30
122,Fantastic Hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel for a night and it was amazing! The room was so spacious. The hotel is perfect for children. It has a giant swimming pool which is fantastic. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We arrived early and the room wasn't ready but they took all our bags to our room when it was ready. The breakfast if gorgeous, it had a selection of everything!!!
Overall it is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone and I would come here again.",5,2014,08,25
122,Weekend Break,"We stayed here for 3 nights (Aug 14th-17th 2014). This hotel was amazing. We arrived early and as expected our room wasn't ready but the hotel took our bags and we made the short walk to Imperial Wharf station and headed back into London. This hotel has great transport links into the city as Imperial Wharf is right next to the hotel. We were initially worried about how far out we were but we needn't have worried.

When we returned back from London on our first night our room was all ready and our bags were already in our room which was great service. The room itself was a marina view suite and was lovely with a lovely view over the harbour. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom had everything you could possibly need.

We would have given this hotel 5 stars but there was just a couple of things which in our opinion dropped it down to 4 star, We felt that the hotel staff come round to the rooms too much to ask if you want 'turn down' service etc. Reception rang our room a few times by mistake and also the alarm went off at a silly time for no reason.Breakfast itself was lovely but again we had a little gripe with the breakfast as the brochure in the room states 12pm finish on a Sunday but it actually finishes at 11am, this wasn't ideal for us a we arrived at breakfast at 11.10 to be told we couldn't eat, the staff did finally sort us some food but it was just a couple of leftover pieces of bacon and sausages which we found slightly disappointing for 5 star.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would stay here again over and over as everything else was perfect about this hotel but we would just ask that they change the brochure times to be correct as this can be misleading when you pay quite a lot extra for breakfast.",4,2014,08,24
122,Great Hotel !,"We stayed here last weekend, as an anniversary treat. Loved the Hotel, great setting, overlooking the Harbour. The whole surrounding area is top notch. Great Bars, and restaurants. All within a few hundred metres.
We had a double room, two bathrooms, and a balcony, with the kids sleeping in a large sofa bed, that they loved.
We did Email ahead trying to get a free upgrade, if available, but as it was busy, they could not manage it.They did however, give us a signed Anniversary card, fresh strawberries, and a Complimentary bottle of Taittinger Champagne !! Went down really well !!
Staff all seemed nice, The elderly guy out front, always able to get a Taxi for us, within seconds ! 
Swimming Pool was a good size, the Gym, although I did not use it looked well equipped.
Did not eat there, as my Daughter loves Costa Coffee, and Starbucks, we had breakfast out in the morning, and went to eat at Roxies in the evening (also very Good)
So overall a great stay in Busy London, a thoroughly good break. Would stay here again, when next in the capital. Thanks once again Chelsea Harbour x",5,2014,08,20
122,Fantastic location and superb service,"The rooms are very well equipped, and the service is first class and the pool is much bigger than the average hotel. The food was very good too so I can highly recommend this hotel with superb views over the marina.",5,2014,08,17
122,"Great hotel, location not central","This is a really good hotel. We had travelled with a group of 8 so wanted a good priced hotel, it didn't disappoint for the price.Rooms are spacious, luxurious linens and toiletries, with verandas and a view of the marina.
It has a large bar with terrace, lovely to sit out if weather is good, but as there are residents near by it closes around 11pm.
We only had breakfast, food was good and good choices, but the staff were a little confused, didn't seem to be much direction, but we eventually got what we wanted.
The only drawback of this hotel,is it's location , too far from Central London , Knightsbridge, Mayfair etc, so taxi fares did mount up over the couple of days we were there. All in all though a nice hotel.",4,2014,08,16
122,Excellent,"Came here for lunch and the food and Service was superb, we asked to view the rooms (thinking of checking in for a future visit) and they were luxurious and spacious. There will definatly be a return visit. We were very impressed with everything.",5,2014,08,15
122,Family visit to London,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand Harbour Hotel a few months ago on a family trip to London.  A fantastic time was had by all of the family thanks to the fantastic staff and facilities of the hotel.

We are returning again this summer and hope to have an equally good time.",5,2014,08,12
122,"A very nice hotel with spacious rooms, harbour and Thames views, great for a treat or business or both!","This is a very nice hotel, fabulous location. The rooms and the views are the real high points perfect for a treat either business or pleasure! The suite style rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet, feeling indulgent and luxurious. There were plenty of staff around, happy to be of assistance. 

We were very well looked after with the conference facilities being in the penthouse. More lovely views with inside and outside facilities. The team were very attentive serving drinks with our excellent buffet lunches. Terrific service with a smile! Thank you.",5,2014,08,12
122,Fabulous hotel,"We looked for a hotel which would accommodate 2 adults & teenage daughter this was ideal as all rooms are suites. Lovely experience wishing we had stayed longer. Rooms were modern tasteful and very clean, bathroom state of the art, great finishing touches ice in ice bucket, great toiletries,helpful friendly staff .Used the pool which was big clean and staff very helpful. Sloane square tube a lot longer than 10 min walk, as suggested on website but lots of alternatives, would definitely revisit this lovely hotel thank you",5,2014,08,11
122,Great london hotel with spacious rooms and a pool :-),"Fabulous nights stay in London.  Great service and nice to have a bit more space without paying over the odds.

Really enjoyed the use of the pool as well as the riverside view.  Nice to have a half-decent coffee in room to wake up to too.

The staff were fabulous and we shall be back!",4,2014,08,11
122,"Beautiful hotel, large perfect and comfortable rooms, friendly staff, fantastic restaurant","We had booked a room with a balcony and the view of The Thames and we were really happy with it. The view was perfect, the room clean, modern, large and very comfortable. We appreciated a wide choice of snacks and drinks in the minibar, especially very nice juices of a high quality. We really enjoyed our dinner in the hotel restaurant - perfect chef, perfect staff, perfect cuisine, a perfect experience. If you are in London, this hotel is a good choice and if you are staying there do not miss the chance to dine in their restaurant. Breakfast was perfect as well, tasty and fresh food and very kind and helpful staff (all of them and especially Miro). When we are in London again, we will definitely come back to Chelsea harbour hotel (it was just a bit cold in the whole building for us, despite being hot outside, we switched the air conditioning off in ou room but we could do not anything with the rest of the hotel.",5,2014,08,03
122,Great but not cheap,"This hotel has great views from the top and the suits on the upper levels.  Excellent food, albeit not cheap.  Which is the worst thing about this hotel, it may be in London, but the prices are over the top.

Breakfast was lovely and was in the price of the room.  The staff were polite and smart.",4,2014,08,03
122,Outstanding,"Readers
This is a great hotel. Stayed many years ago when it was Hilton Conrad and it's still as good now.
Rooms well appointed, clean and very modern.
Staff attentive.
Food and drink menu excellent if not a little expensive but, this is in the heat of Chelsea!
Highly recommend it.

122,Absolutely amazing!!,"3 night break in London with 2 kids.....beautiful hotel set in a haven! Granted we had hot weather so it felt like we were in the med overlooking the harbour for meals. However, the room (1 bedroom, 1 living room, 1 hallway, 1 luxury bathroom & 2 toilets...more of an apartment really) was so comfortable, it was difficult to leave! 15 mins into central london on tube, 5 min walk to the amazing Kings Road. The breakfast was to die for...we paid £30 for all breakfasts when we booked on Trivago (it was £25 a head each day in hotel). Hotel staff were amazing...completely going the extra mile at all times. Clean bed linen, towels & new toiletries every day. Pure luxury!",5,2014,07,26
122,Keeping up the great standard,"This was my first time back this year and once again I was impressed with the staff, the room and the restaurant. As usual Abdul, George and Frank were there at the door with a warm welcome. I was booked in by a great lady (not sure if it was Helen) and the room was a very nice suite (all the rooms are here). For London the rooms are quite spacious and if you have a balcony it makes it even better. The price has gone up but for London I still think this is great value. From Heathrow the drive is only 25mins. To get right across London to the theatre district is only 20 mins. The weather was warm so we dined out at the hotel restaurant, which is really excellent. I notice the Internet is now free which is a good move for the better. My advice is get a room with a balcony because you'll love it. If its your first time get the harbour view but otherwise the Chelsea side is fine.",5,2014,07,23
122,Lovely hotel ,We stayed over Christmas for a few days the checking was very efficient the rooms are suites with balconys they are a nice and spacious Which makes a difference for london the dinner on Christmas Day was excellent we had a fantastic stay and will be returning ,5,2014,07,23
122,"Beautiful setting, becoming tired","We have stayed at this hotel so many times over past 12 years, and especially loved the quality and branding of previous owner, Conrad. First slippery slope began when the wyndham chain bought the hotel, trying to encourage families and paying less attention to detail.The service started to deterioate and decor began to look tired.

This hotel is in a beautiful setting, with easy access now to the railway. All rooms are suites with balconies, but suites now looking dated. Service in bar slow.

I believe the hotel has just been sold again and do hope the new owners will return this hotel to its previous glory. 

If it had been my first stay my review may have been different. Saddened to see the slippery slope of this hotel.",4,2014,07,22
122,Very nice stay,"Stayed here recently with my girlfriend! Excellent rooms and a beautiful hotel, we had a suite which was well decorated and had all the necessary items, robes, coffee machine and mini bar. The receptionist seemed to be a little arrogant, the one down part about the stay, he was very patronising, but we both arrived from travelling so we were probably not dressed well enough to be considered wealthy enough for the luxury hotel! The food in the restaurant was excellent, well seasoned and presented splendidly! Overall a excellent stay! Would definitely go back again  ",4,2014,07,21
122,Everything was Perfect,"To treat my Sister for her 60th Birthday we went to this hotel for 1 night.  I can honestly say it was the best hotel we have ever stayed in London.  The room was superb.  There was 3 of us staying and we had plenty of room with 2 toilets and a nice terrace where we sat and enjoyed looking at the boats. The staff  were extremely helpful and friendly and could not do enough for you.  We had lovely cocktails on the terrace before we went out to eat and also spent a few hours in the pool which was very clean and not very full. Breakfast was also  very good 
Although the hotel was busy it did not seem so and remained calm and peaceful.

Will definitely return later in the year",5,2014,07,21
122,fabulous stay!!!!!,"Amazing hotel...excellent location if you are ok with being a little bit outside the heart of London, stunning rooms, fabulous views, brilliant staff and service....excellent value!!!...one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in!!!",5,2014,07,13
122,2nd visit much better than the first! ,"I am writing this after our second visit to the chelsea harbour hotel, the first visit was bad and therefore received a bad review, this visit was the complete opposite, we felt welcomed, the room was lovely, the staff were attentive and the stay was everything 5 star!!! ",4,2014,07,13
122,Very pleasant hotel with lovely views of the marina,"The Chelsea Harbour hotel is a very pleasant hotel.  I stayed for four nights and my suite was overlooking the marina and had a terrace with table and chairs. It comprised a sitting room, bedroom, bathroom and two toilets. There was also free wifi in the room which worked very well.

The bedroom was a nice size and the bed was very comfortable.  There were ample wardrobes, iron and ironing board and a little dressing table.  The bathroom was en suite with a bath, a separate shower, and toilet.

The sitting room was large with a comfortable sofa and two armchairs, and a desk. It also had a guest toilet.

The suite was divided by a wall and no doors and no door to the entrance hall.  Whilst it was very quiet, later in the morning one could hear all the doors closing.  My friend who had a different suite had dividing walls with doors and a door to the entrance hall.

The mini bar was well stocked and there was a coffee machine.  I made coffee for my two guests but had no way of heating the milk, so the coffee was a little cold to drink! 

There was no iPod player in the sitting room which was a shame (or any music). A friend of mine also staying in the hotel had one in her room, so why not me?  Surely it should be standard in all rooms?

I had paid for a suite including full English breakfast.  Unlike most hotels that have a buffet breakfast, one had to order from a choice of set menus, apart from fruit, cereals, yoghurts etc which were on a long bar.  Personally I prefer to have the choice of a buffet breakfast and didn’t like having to choose set platters.  One morning I chose the smoked fish platter, which was not overly large, and another day had just an omelette with bacon and tomato.

Since I am someone who likes to have a room service breakfast, I was pleased to find out that one only had to pay a delivery charge of £4.50 to have breakfast in one’s room!  Much nicer!

The Harbour Bar has theme nights and my friends and I very much enjoyed the 2 for 1 champagne cocktails on the Wednesday night, and the 2 for 1 wine on the Thursday!

I had dinner once in the restaurant which was delicious and not overly expensive. I had the filet steak with Béarnaise Sauce, followed by the Wild Berry Summer Pudding with Elderflower sorbet, and a couple of glasses of the very nice Chilean cabernet Sauvignon.

One day I decided to go for a swim in the nice pool.  I found it hard to find and ended up having to walk around the outside of the hotel to get back in.  There were stairs, lifts, and so many doors and not many sign posts.  Finding the hairdresser was marginally easier. There should be better access from the hotel.

Whilst the hotel has a lovely position on the marina and enjoyable walks along its banks, I found it a bit of a pain trying to get anywhere and often had to get taxis.

When I arrived at the hotel on the first day with one big and fairly heavy suitcase and a smaller one, I had travelled from Gatwick airport via Clapham Junction to Imperial Wharf (no problems and lifts on each platform), but when I arrived at Imperial Wharf station, there were no directions to the hotel at all.  I asked several passers-by which way I should go but nobody knew.  Unfortunately I had to pull my two cases and went the wrong way but eventually found the hotel. It would be good if there was a sign on the wall outside the station with an arrow pointing the way to the hotel!

All in all, I had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel.",4,2014,07,13
122,"Fantastic Hotel, Amazing service. Nice and quiet location, brilliant price.","Writing this review even though I still have one night left. Staying here for 3 nights and I couldn't speak highly enough about it. The location is fantastic, the guests are nice and friendly and the staff are excellent. They really welcome you and provide great services. This is by far the best hotel I've stayed at and my stay has been peaceful. The room or suite shall I call it (no rooms just suites) is big and got upgraded to a balcony room. The foods nice, although I do think they need to add more for vegetarians. All in all I'd recommend it to anyone. Felt like real loyalty that i'm actually looking at my family tree to see if i'm related to the Royal family! Can see why the Chelsea players stay here before matchdays! 

See you soon. Thank you, Huzefa. (Arithmetic Accountants)",5,2014,07,09
122,"Beautiful Hotel, Fab Style, Staff &Location.","Have stayed in several hotels in London but for the decent rates when booked I have to honestly say apart from great purchase.....upon arriving......and I have stayed at hundreds of hotels all over the World (some fantastic too) this one of the best hotels I ever stayed in. Fantastic rooms, staff, style, area location and views.  Only issue is do not eat or drink there as these prices are a bit extortionate.....£5.50 for a beer out of the room fridge ?   Great place tho, 5 min walk to Kings Rd.",5,2014,07,08
122,Seems to be improving with age.,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel last night.

Whilst compared to some of its West End peers the the furniture and decor look a little dated, the location overlooking the marina or river,and the quality of service are very good.

The suites are fairly small (but it is London) and a lot of the equipment is showing signs of age  but the views and balconies are lovely and all the public amenities fall into the same category.

As the price had fallen since we booked and at check in the very efficient Olivier arranged a fee £24 per head breakfast for us both a small gesture on a £400 per night suite but much appreciated none the less.",4,2014,07,04
122,Great luxury hotel,We spent 2 nights here last week. Perfection. We had an amazing meal in the restaurant. The suite was immaculate. Lovely bathroom. Will defintely be back again to use the spa etc which we didn't have time for on this visit sadly.,5,2014,07,03
122,An Oasis in London,"I decided to stay at the Chelsea Harbour hotel for a long weekend with my bf. I am honestly very picky which most of the time leaves me disappointed but there is honestly not a bad thing I can say, to me this hotel was perfect and will now be my first, and only choice. It is abit out of the way but honestly any traveling is worth it and the hotel Is cheap for what they offer in my opinion, especially as you can get a great breakfast included! 
I was checked in and out quickly, no fuss. I stayed in room 423 which was down the hall but conveniently right next to the separate lift that goes to the spa (which is pretty much the main reason I chose this hotel so that was a massive plus)
I have stayed in the executive suit of top hotels and this King suite - being their most basic room, was so much better. It was huge, a separate living area complete with sofa(bed) and tv, then the 2nd area with extra king size bed, also with another tv. The bathroom was big, a nice rainfall shower, and good sized bath. Both easy to use and no problems atall. 
I ordered room service pretty much for every meal and was never disappointed. The food was lovely especially the afternoon tea, and the staff so kind and helpful. Our room was made up everyday. 
The swimming pool is another big plus and I even witnessed staff checking the water twice while I was there. The sauna and steam rooms are located in the changing rooms which I loved as it offers even more privacy. 
Drinks on the terrace at sunset, lovely cocktails, lovely people. 
There is honestly not a bad word that can be said, I was devastated to have to leave and I can not wait to stay again soon. Thank you so much to the staff for being so attentive & welcoming and I look forward to seeing you again soon.",5,2014,07,03
122,Run down,"I stayed at this Hotel when it was a Conrad Hotel and was amazed as to how this once haven outside of the hustle and bustle of the city had deteriorated.
Our room was not cleaned properly, the AC did not work and the Maintenance team had to come up on many occasions to get the heating working.
From a safety perspective, the room door did not self latch which left the room insecure, if you did not check it. 
The bathroom looked dirty as the marble on the walls had black stains.
Come on Windham, improve this once beautiful hotel
",2,2014,06,27
122,The Hotel was really nice,"Stayed at The Chelsea Harbour Hotel for my birthday. The Hotel was lovely and clean and our room was excellent. The staff were also very good. The only downside was the spa. Really disappointed as the water was absolutely freezing, my local swimming pool was probably warmer.",3,2014,06,25
122,The name changes but quality remains excellent,"We have stayed here a few times over the years. The name has changed - formerly Wyndhams, previously the Conrad. (It also featured a couple of times in the TV series, ""The Bill"", as ""The London Dock Hotel"".)  Last time there were a couple of concerns over communication errors but this time everything was fine again - well up to the standard were are used to.  

Good location, not too far from Central London but notably more affordable than hotels of similar standard in the heart of London.  Parking is easy; use the underground car park off Chelsea Harbour Ave, take the first right and you can usually park close to the stairs up to hotel. (Leaving the car park is more of an underground excursion!)  Disabled parking area, near lifts, also available. 

The bar areas have a fantastic view of the marina. Full meal and drinks service at all reasonable times.  Rooms are suite-style, with TV in both bedroom and lounge.  Separate air condition for each area.  Exceptionally well appointed bathroom. My wife is slightly disabled and we liked the walk-in shower - easy to make a small step in, better than a wet room where water can go all over the place.  Separate bath, with its own shower, for those that prefer.  

It is very difficult to find a fault with this hotel. One tiny niggle - the instructions for the coffee-making machine did not match the controls.  I sussed it on the second attempt. 

My understanding is that this hotel has an official five-star rating, and I would happily endorse that.",5,2014,06,23
122,Restaurant,"Had lunch there today. A perfect place to go. Looking over the harbour/marina. Lunch was excellent and dessert was amazing.  Staff are fantastic and so tentative.  Nothing is too much trouble and they truly want to please their diners.
",5,2014,06,22
122,Perfect,"Fabulous place!. Room was so cozy, clean and spacious. Staff were all friendly and kind. Breakfast was superb! Spa and massage were the best! Highly recommended for everyone. We will surely go back soon. ;)",5,2014,06,21
122,Small Paradise in London,"Ideal location to enjoy London from a Peaceful, quiet and joyful view of Thames. Great suites and perfect service and food. Breakfast is exceptional good. Complimentary sauna, gym and swimming pool. Just few meters from Subway station, connecting to center London.
Free high speed wireless connection.. Everything exceptional good!!!",5,2014,06,21
122,"Excellent stay, rooms VFM for the family","Courteous and attentive staff, excellent Bistro and Bar overlooking the small harbour. Very good gym and swimming pool. Excellent value for money for the family, suites have a great double bedroom and a sofa bed ideal for the kids. 

Thanks to all.",5,2014,06,20
122,A lovely stay,"Three of us stayed for one night. The room was a Chelsea  suite with an upgrade to a marina view, clean, spacious lots of modern touches. Staff very welcoming and friendly.we did find our room to be very hot, air conditioning not sufficient and even with balcony doors open it never got cool.
Breakfast was really nice we also enjoyed the pool area.",5,2014,06,19
122,What a great hotel,"First time here and very surprised at everything - no faults at all -the staff, cleanliness, location and price were all very good.

Breakfast was excellent and freshly prepared, unlike some many other hotels, this was a great surprise.

Very close to central London and overall I can not praise this hotel enough",5,2014,06,16
122,The name has changed but excellent standards maintained,"This was our first visit since the change of ownership and name.  Thankfully, nothing else has changed.  Wonderful hotel.  Excellent rooms.  Quiet location so a good sleep guaranteed.  I do warn people who are not familiar with the geography of London that this hotel is not ideally situated for the main landmarks.  Yes, as others have stated, it is adjacent to the Overground station, but that does involve a convoluted way to reach the main tourist areas. Personally, if I could get this hotel at a good price I would feel free to spend some money on taxis to get to and fro with maximum convenience.  Make no mistake, this hotel is so good that people should not be put off by the location, but people do need to be aware that it does involve some time and expense for London's excellent public transport.",5,2014,06,16
122,Fabulous!,"Have always wanted to stay here and certainly not disappointed now I have. Fabulous all suite hotel. Spacious room, spotlessly clean and lovely views over the harbour, especially at dusk on a summers evening when the harbour and the hotel look stunning. Bathroom was beautiful and lounge area comfortable. Breakfast was very good with wide choice of hot and cold and sitting in the restaurant overlooking the harbour is simply lovely. 
Thought it might be a way out of centre but only 5 mins from Kings Road with plenty of buses if you don't want to catch train from overground station.
Bit pricey in the bar for drinks but paying for where you are. 
If there during World Cup go over to Fever Pitch at Fulham Broadway to watch the matches.
Lovely hotel, thoroughly recommend",5,2014,06,15
122,Excellent.,"Spotlessly clean, spacious well appointed suites. Really friendly and helpful staff. This is a great hotel to stay at whether visiting London for business or pleasure. Two minutes walk from Imperial Wharf overground which connects with the underground at West Brompton just one stop away. Kings Road with all it's shops and restaurant is just a short walk away. Both the food and service in the hotel are excellent.",5,2014,06,15
122,WHAT AN AMAZING HOTEL IN A FAB LOCATION!!,"In London last weekend and spent three nights in the Chelsea Harbour Hotel (formerly the Wyndham Chelsea).  All I can say is WOW, what a location.  We stayed in a Chelsea Harbour Balcony Suite (it is an all suite hotel) and were glad we paid the extra for the balcony as the weather was fab and I spent many hours on the balcony drinking my morning coffee, or evening drink with a view of some lovely yachts.  As a frequent 'sailor' on luxury cruises I felt like I was back in Monaco looking over the harbour there.  The whole of the experience makes you forget you are in London, only minutes from the hustle and bustle of a big city.  My husband and I walked along the embankment to Westminster - which was lovely, and another day walked back from Harrods and along the King's Road - I believe Jose Mourinho frequents this area, but I was not lucky enough to bump into him - although I know for a fact that when my husband and I checked out he came in with lots of other celebs/VIP's - what a shame, could have been a laugh :).  There was an International football team staying there for a couple of nights, but they didn't bother us, and we didn't bother them (not bad on the eyes in their shorts mind you ;)
Anyway, what a true gem of a hotel.  We have stayed in many five star hotels in London in the city and just fancied a change - well we are truly converted, and cannot wait to visit it again.  The staff were lovely, could not have been more helpful, and the food and drink we had was excellent.  The Chelsea Harbour Hotel is an exceptional property, in a fabulous location, and has a wonderful team - there if you need them, but not fussing over you when you don't need them - which is perfect.
The only disadvantage is getting taxi's into the city  - it was around £35.00 one way, so a bit expensive if you have a few trips into the centre.  However, Harrods is only two miles away, and there is a fabulous shopping centre only 8 minutes away from the hotel on the train (Imperial Wharf next to hotel) with some amazing shops (J Choo, Louis Vuitton, etc).  Also a lovely small boutique in the hotel (ladies and gents garments) with some lovely items - bought a small item for my husband.  
I can't wait to go back to this fabulous hotel.  
Well done to all at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel - you certainly made our weekend special :)

122,Would definitely come back!,"The hotel is located near to    Imperial Wharf overground station,so great access to transport. Rooms are spacious and very clean! Hotel staff were generally helpful and friendly.  Special mention must be made of Executive Head Chef Imthiaz Kader...food was delicious and the service was tremendous! He made our stay all that much more memorable! Great stay overall...will definitely come back to stay when I (hopefully) return to London..",4,2014,06,09
122,Chelsea Harbour Hotel...brilliant!!,"Absolutely brilliant hotel!! From arrival to departure, the staff AND the manager himself were courteous, professional and extremely friendly. travelling as a family, we were made to feel very welcome. The rooms are spacious and very clean and really very smart. lots of nice features and very comfortable. the hotel is 15-20 mins in a cab from the city centre (expect to pay £20-£25) and the nearest tube station is 5 minutes walk. There is a spa in the hotel which looks excellent but sadly, we didn't have time to drop in. The food is excellent and the service is very very good, if you can - grab a table overlooking the marina. I have nothing negative to say about the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, really good value - lovely setting and well run. I will definitely be staying again and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. Well done guys, you should be proud of yourselves.",5,2014,06,09
122,Excellent hotel for staying with children.,"Stayed for three nights with our two children. We had a room on the fifth floor overlooking the harbour. Marvellous views and a lovely quiet hotel. Great nights sleep. The fact that all the rooms here are suites meant we could all stay in the same room with the children sleeping on a very large double sofa bed in the lounge. This meant we all had our privacy and at the same time we didn't have to worry about booking adjoining rooms etc. the rooms are very nicely equipped with lovely toiletries in the bathrooms. Perfectly situated just a two minute walk from kings road. Breakfast was a pleasure with a huge choice to suit everyone. Only one small complaint is the service charge added on every time we bought a drink at the bar. Which resulted in every round of drinks being rather pricey. This seems to be 'normal' in 5 star hotels in the city but still annoys me. I am a northerner after all! But overall i old highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and especially those travelling with children.",4,2014,06,08
122,"Wonderful Service, great hotel!","We arrived from an early flight very early for our checkin (8:30am as opposed to 2pm), and had to wait around a really long time for our room to be ready (only ready at 3pm) which was a bit of a bad start, BUT after that initial bump in the road we had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. 

Our room was very spacious and well laid out, although it was right next to the elevator so we had a bit of noise coming in during the evenings and nights (especially on the weekend). It was well maintained, clean and great that the toilet is separate to the rest of the bathroom (though the air filter for the toilet wasn't working in our room!). 

Being Halaal only, the hotel really catered very well to our needs - they were aware of the requirements and also catered for it. Head chef (Imthiaz Kader) catered to all our needs, ensuring that our food was served separately and it was always DELICIOUS!!! He was a stellar representative for the hotel, and both as a person who helped us in any way he could. I would recommend his food anytime and to anyone!! The hotel breakfast is a must - waffles, pancakes, poached eggs, anything we tried was actually scrumptious! 

Hotel location is also very central to bus routes, Chelsea High Street as well as the underground which is very important when traveling with a 2 year old on vacation. 

Overall, a great stay and a highly recommended hotel (and chef!).",4,2014,06,05
122,Fantastic hotel. Stunning hotel location..... Shame about the pricey drinks,"Stayed for one night away. Choose the hotel from the fantastic reviews. We were not disappointed. The room was exceedingly spacious with a separate lounge, bedroom, 2 separate toilets, waterfall shower, separate bath and twin sinks. The hotel is very clean and welcoming. We were able sit outside on the balcony overlooking the marina to have our breakfast. Only one negative... When I ordered 2 glasses of sparkling Rose for my husband and I, I did not expect to be charged £34!!!! We later checked the drinks menu and realised that the only sparkling rose that the hotel offers is the rose champagne. Probably my fault for not checking the menu but it would have been nice for the waiter to mention this when I ordered so that I could have ordered another wine. However, like I said, beautiful hotel and lovely staff but still feel a little cheated with the drinks as I have never paid £34 for 2 small alcoholic drinks before but I will be wiser next time!!!!! ",5,2014,06,01
122,Luxury ,"We stayed here on our wedding night as a wedding present from my sister. We stayed in the penthouse kings sweet (which I haven't seen advertised online- therefore I don't know the price- assuming it's £1200+ per night)
Was absolutely stunning- beautiful view, lovely furnishings and huge space- the master bathroom included a jacuzzi for two and a sauna as well as twin sink basins and a rainfall shower. The room also included two further bathrooms and another bedroom and A very large living room area- the masters uuet was incredibly comfortable with a gorgeous view and a walk in wardrobe! All the technology and fittings were top of the range and we were sad to have only had the pleasure of staying just the one night! Would defiantly return- and recommend for a special occasion!! ",5,2014,05,28
122,A lovely place to stay but don't be tempted by the chocolate in your suite!,"We got a really good deal here on Late rooms.  Don't know what the average charges really are but we paid 220 for a suite that was listed at over £lk.  Now I wouldn't have paid a grand but for a night away with three boys who wanted to shop in the city, swim, hang out and watch some movies when they were in the room, it was a success.  The living room has a bed settee which they make up at turn down time. The pool wasn't particularly busy and we got a deal on the movies which at 15 quid for one were a bit over the top.  By buying a package for 25 they could watch a number of movies meaning late nights and early mornings they were kept occupied.  Staff are very nice and helpful.  It is as another reviewer mentioned, over the top when buying drinks or stuff from the mini bar, but if you limit your use of those things, then all in all it's a nice place to stay.",5,2014,05,28
122,It harbours a secret it's v expensive for a drink,"3 drinks £40 12.5% svce charge .£4.50 for nuts you think are free great location great view great service great balcony with heaters but mein gott!! Das est mucho looto  for a simple drinks mein peoples !!!
puts you in a different place than by the muddy Thames in not so muddy Chelsea  so top tip buy your drinks at the bar avoid the nuts have  two straws make it last and enjoy the boats spot the people on them messing about two good days on a boat day you buy it day you sell it but there you have my landlubbers made in Chelsea style ",2,2014,05,27
122,Wonderful experience at this hotel! Enhanced our vacation experience in London.,"Spent five nights at this hotel. The suite was lovely and had a balcony overlooking the harbor. Location worked well for bus, tube and overground train. The real gem of this hotel is the staff. From check in to check out we were well cared for. After long days of touring we were welcomed at the bar by Albert and Andre. They not only offered fabulous service but were interesting to talk with. Have traveled around the world and stayed at hundreds of hotels. On the last evening at Chelsea Harbour had the pleasure to meet Exec. Chef Kader. He prepared a once in a lifetime dinner for us. He was also a delight to spend time with. A memory we will always cherish.  Our room was kept crisp and clean. The doormen did a great job arranging for transportation when needed. Wish we could go back tomorrow!",5,2014,05,26
122,Exceptional! Already planning our next holiday!,"Upon entering the hotel it is everything you'd expect from a 5 star property, beautiful fresh flowers, gracious concierge and a well designed interior. The hotel rooms were generous in size (all suites) and well appointed with a beautiful views of the harbour from the balcony. Internet access is complimentary allowing for up to five devices. The location itself is within walking distance to the train/bus and walkable to King's Road. 

Where the hotel really stood out  and ""wowed"" me was the exceptional staff. After spending four days in Paris we arrived at the hotel. We were quickly checked in and escorted to our beautiful suite. After a day of travel we were too exhausted to venture very far and visited the Lobby Bar. I had the pleasure of meeting Andrei Orange one of the supervisors for the bar. He was very accommodating and friendly. He provided us with information regarding the surrounding area and must see locations while we were in London. We had such a nice time we decided to visit the lobby bar again the second night and again had the pleasure of speaking with  Andrei. 

On the third night... we again were looking for that same great experience and learn that Andrei was off for the next two days. We then meet Albert Nimanaj the manager of the bar. WOW is all I can say. Andrei had already shared our information with Albert and our experience just kept getting better. Albert not only provided expectational service to us but I watched as he made certain to give each guest there a personal touch. You could clearly see that both Albert and Andrei truly enjoy their positions and are passionate about what they do. 
I also can not leave out Nora who was also a pleasure to meet! I feel as if I have not only had a great experience but made new friends. Such polished and personable staff! I wish every property I stayed at delivered this kind of experience!

On our last night (stayed five nights) we had the honor to meet the executive chef Imthiaz Kader. My mother wanted soup but was not able to have any off of the menu due to allergies. Not a problem! Albert asked the executive chef to come and speak with us! He then discussed with my mother what she would like and what she was able to eat. Less than 15 minutes later we were dining on the best three course meal I have ever had! 

If you are looking for a true five star experience with priceless service, this is the hotel I would recommend. I know I will be back!",5,2014,05,26
122,Would of given 5 stars but .............,"Breakfast was chaos !!! Fab hotel , rooms lovely and roomy with all the usual bits and pieces , toiletries , robes , slippers and drinks . Beds very comfy .Room with a great view overlooking Chelsea Harbour , peaceful location good for Kings Road shopping etc . However breakfast really was chaotic the second day, had a 30 -40 minute wait for hot food and the restaurant was NOT busy !!! Also we all got our breakfast at different times so it really was disappointing!!!! ",4,2014,05,23
122,Fabulous!,"Enjoyed a spa break here with two special friends. Beautiful hotel,greeted by concierge and checked in quickly and efficiently.We were then escorted to our fab suite with plenty of room for all of three of us to spread out and relax with comfort.Room was spotless and well appointed in every way. We went to have a treatment each at the Spa which was most enjoyable and relaxing.The only downside for the whole trip was that the pool was far from relaxing as I would expect for a spa.Unfortunately there were many children splashing about noisily in the pool giving it the feel of a public swimming baths albeit a small one.Needless to say we did not stay long in the pool area and decided to go back to the room.The staff in the spa were as pleasant and helpful as the staff in the hotel itself.
During the evening we had a delicious meal in the restaurant and again were treated impeccably and made to feel very special.
The breakfast the next morning was amazing..Never have I seen such choices at any other hotel and the quality was second to none.We were lucky enough to have a glorious sunny,warm morning and were able to enjoy a leisurely breakfast outside in the sunshine overlooking the harbour.
All in all,a most pleasant stay and we hope to visit again in the future.",5,2014,05,21
122,Paradise in London,"After staying at The Chelsea Harbour last week and enjoying a fantastic two night stay, I have to say a massive thank you to the staff who were very helpful. 
The suite was beautiful and views of the harbour and London skyline just made it perfect. 

The service you recieve is worth the price, King's Road is just round the corner with great shopping and close by is the Saatchi Gallery and other great places to visit. 

We'll be making regular returns and look forward to enjoying this piece of paradise in London.
Once again, thank you to the staff who were so helpful, especially at 2am when our room card didn't work in the lift.",5,2014,05,21
122,Great location,"The hotel is well managed and services are good, the view of the harbour make the room prices worthy , what can I say. ? ....we love it. It's not easy access to the downtown area and you save time using the train but the people at the hotel will give you good assistance for your options, taking the bus from Kings Road is a nice tour to see your options for bar's and restaurants in that area.",5,2014,05,20
122,really enjoyed my stay,stayed here with my wife and 3 year old everyone was really friendly and helpful espeicially milton my sons new pal. rooms are a great size ours overlooked the train station which was a bonus as my son is train mad. kings road is a 5 minute stroll. spa was great couple of loose tiles on pool but not an issue sauna and steam room were great. ,4,2014,05,18
122,Weekend escape,"My friend and I escape for one weekend every year away from the kids and husbands. We spent a considerable amount of money on this trip. I agree with one of the previous reviews in that this hotel does not feel like a 5 star hotel. It charges 5 star prices and crazy charges ie £4.50 tray charge for room service, but you can only get away with those prices if you back them up with the appropriate level of service. For example, when we asked for ""proper"" milk (not UHT) for our complimentary tea & coffee in our room we were told that we either had to pay for the tray charge or we had to go and ask the restaurant for it! We weren't warned that there was a wedding on otherwise we would have requested a room well away from the lifts.  Having said that we were given a 10% discount to compensate. I think that they should be realistic about the level they provide and adjust their costs accordingly.",3,2014,05,11
122,Good but perhaps not quite good enough?,"We booked the night at the Chelsea Harbour to cheer us up on a London visit as my wife is attending hospital appointments at the Royal Brompton and it was her birthday the following day. The booking for a Thursday night was for a Marina View suite together with parking (an extra £40 for 24 hours). The room was lovely with great views and comfort; a 5 star London experience. 

For the money, there was nothing to disappoint and a lot to like about the hotel ambience and decor. Service from the front desk and the doormen was good and as expected for a 5 star hotel. Where it fell down was in the bar and the restaurant. 

The spacious bar with good views of the harbour was moderately busy but not so busy that it explained the ""reluctant"" service. Everything took so long, not helped by the fact that the manager seemed more intent on entertaining specific guests rather than attending guests generally and the waitress did everything other than bring drinks to the table. This meant for example that a simple request for a ginger beer took 10 minutes from being opened on the bar to arrive at our table 15 feet away. It was simply inattentive by comparison to say the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental standards. 

Service was better in the near empty restaurant and it was the food that tended to disappoint. Whilst smartly presented, the food was bland (the bouillebaise in particular). We did get a 20% discount from a voucher in the room which helped albeit it transpired to be more than a little difficult to actually get it off the bill in the morning as a signed receipt had gone missing. 

The breakfast which was included in the cost was a much more enjoyable, generous and tasty affair. 

Overall, a well located and very smart hotel where our experience was of some sub 5 star service. We might go again but not in a hurry. A marginal ""Average"" despite some strengths when compared to other 5 star hotels we have stayed in.",3,2014,05,11
122,Oasis in Hectic London,"Overall this hotel is great value for the quality. I believe all the rooms are suites. Ours was very spacious with a balcony, double sink bathroom and 2 toilets. Service was excellent and breakfast very pleasant overlooking the harbor. But the biggest benefit of this place that it is in a very quiet area (except for planes going to LHR) yet so near to Kensington, Chelsea, kings Road etc. There are many good hotels in Central London but moving a little further out for a bit of peace and quiet will be well rewarded.",4,2014,05,11
122,Great hotel worth of its 5 star rating,"Very comfortable, elegant and centrally located hotel. Staff are extremely courteous and very responsive to your needs.

Kings Road with its great shops and restaurants is very close by. This is a five star establishment that really deserves this rating.",5,2014,05,11
122,Great hotel for family stay,"Stayed here with my husband and 2 year old son in early February for 3 nights. The harbour view suite was lovely, perfect for our family, and we made use of the wonderful pool every day! We ordered room service breakfasts and dinner and we're very happy with the quality of food overall. One small negative, we ordered warm milk for our toddler at bedtime every day, for which we were charged a considerable amount of money. I think it would be a nice touch to follow the example of other family friendly hotels and offer complementary bedtime milk to families with small children.  That being said I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again for our regular trios to London.",4,2014,05,04
122,Exceptional!,"Stayed here on the Saturday of the Easter weekend and was overwhelmed by the service, style and elegance of the hotel. Was upgraded to a penthouse suite as our room wasn't ready by the stated time, the concierge was so apologetic even though they gave us a really stunning room. 
We ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food and service was second to none. When we got back to the room it had been cleaned and tidied and the ice bucket filled! 
The views are stunning and the harbour area is very peaceful. 
This is a 5* hotel in every respect and is easily one of my favourite hotels in London. ",5,2014,04,22
122,Great experience,"I chose this hotel because it offered a suite and we were taking our teenage daughter to London.  We booked it through British Airways and were offered 1 free night out of 4 nights and included breakfast.  We saved over $1,400 by staying here and spent no more than $200 on taxis, so it was still a good value.  The hotel was lovely, our beds were comfortable, the food was great, and the service was excellent.  Breakfast included both a continental breakfast buffet and a hot made to order English breakfast which was very generous so we saved a lot of money by eating only 1 other meal each day.  The hotel was quiet and we ate on an outside balcony overlooking yachts, which really beats the noise of the city.  We did take the train to the City one time and it was easy.  A five minute walk to the overland Imperial Wharf stop, taken to either West Bromfeld or Earls Court and change for the tube, which goes everywhere. But with 3 people it was easier and less costly to cab it.",5,2014,04,21
122,Highly recommended!!,"We ( myself, my husband and 2 children, 5 & 8 ) are currently midway through a 3 night break at this hotel and are very pleased with all aspects of our stay. We arrived in the morning and were greeted enthusiastically by all members of staff. The staff took our bags so we could go off into London to commence our sightseeing. We took a bus from kings rd, it was very easy. When we returned our bags had already been placed in our room. The room was very spacious with lots of nice touches such as plenty of bottled water, a coffee machine and a kettle. There was 2 bathrooms which made life easier and 2 balconys. Not long after arriving in our room, housekeeping arrived and made the sofa bed up in the lounge area. A good nights sleep was had by all. Breakfast was delicious. Enough choice to suit us all. I would highly recommend staying in this hotel and we will be returning. Thank you to all staff who made it a pleasurable stay. ",5,2014,04,19
122,Good quality accomodation,"Booked the hotel for a couple of days for a weekend break
The hotel is modern rooms are spacious , we had a harbour view suite which was very good
My only surprise was that for a Hotel of this quality the bed was poor and uncomfortable , I would expect a bed with a mattress toper for a Hotel of this value.
Staff were very helpful 
Breakfast very good

122,"Not a 5 star hotel, more like a 3","Family vacation to London from USA.  The reviews of this 5 star hotel were good, so we booked and were guaranteed a harbour view suite with a large balcony.  We got neither.  Hotel staff and customer service was extremely poor resolving issue. We were told room type was not guaranteed, even though it was right there on our reservation. Room was not ready on time and my family had to wait in the lobby with our luggage till after check in time.  Staff was not concerned and could have cared less.  We had to keep asking if our room was ready.  We stay at 5 star hotels every year on holiday, and the extra cost is  always worth it, but the Chelsea Harbour Hotel is far from 5 stars.  Poor customer service, poor concierge service, the room was OK but needs updating, location a bit off and entrance odd.  We booked The Wyndam Grand Hotel and on day 2 the hotel switched names to the Chelsea Harbour Hotel, which may have caused the negative issues we experienced, but a true 5 star would have resolved our issues and work hard to ensure we were satisfied, don't waste your time or money at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel.",2,2014,04,14
122,Kiddy friendly stay in a 5 star hotel,"We stayed here with our two kids (3, 2) for 1 night. The suite was perfect for us-2 large rooms with a great bathroom. We were delighted. The view weren't amazing but as we have loved in central london for many years and this was more of a kids break it did not matter. We had a couple of issues which the hotel sought to resolve ASAP. Exactly what you would expect.  The hotel is very kiddy friendly and the staff were all lovely to our children. The pool was quiet and the kids loved it. My husband also enjoyed a spa treatment-which he said was great. We would defo go back if in that part of london and would be happy to recommend.",4,2014,04,12
122,"Superb hotel in excellent location, just loved it!","We stayed here one night recently in a Marina View suite.  It is easy enough to get to the hotel by the Thames Clipper, although it is not well signed from either the pier or the train station, and to get to it you have to go through a rather bizarre office complex.  But once there it is a superb hotel.  All staff were friendly, particularly the bar manager.  Our suite was lovely, a separate lounge and bedroom, large bathroom and two toilets.  We had a balcony overlooking the marina, a perfect little spot to sit in robes the next morning having a coffee.  We also had views of the Thames and could see the Shard and the London Eye.

Cocktails in the bar were gorgeous, we ended up having too many!  We also had breakfast the next morning, which was of a very high standard too.  The restaurant and bar both have terraced areas where you can sit out overlooking the marina.

On the whole, I thought this hotel was superb, one of the better ones we have stayed in in London (and we have stayed in lots), and it is also considerably cheaper than some others as it is not in the centre of London.  I would stay here again in a second.",5,2014,04,10
122,Gets Better on Every Visit,"I can walk here from my home and use the bar from time to time. Always excellent service, great cocktails, good wait staff/ I have only dined here a few times and its good but varies, and was excellent on last lunch visit.

Its always busy yet good a quiet feeling and calm feeling which makes a change from central city rabble.  A good choice for tourists that was to be near all the great places but still enjoy some peace and quiet.",5,2014,04,10
122,Says 5 star but not treated like 5 star,"We arrived at the hotel and first impressions of the lobby were good, there were 3 of us, myself, my hubby and 6 year old daughter. We checked in to be looked down on by the receptionist, once we arrived at our room first impressions were good but there was no bed for my daughter despite being ordered, also through email we had been promised something extra for my husbands birthday - this never materialised! We went out for a meal and on the way out informed reception of the bed situation, we were told house keeping would be contacted and the bed would be in the room for 7pm. We returned to the hotel at 9pm to find still no bed, I phoned Reception who said one would be sent up, 15 mins later and one finally arrived! Due to being up early the following day we settled down for the night to have two staff enter the room without knocking at 11pm asking to check the bathroom for a leak (there was none) I was shocked that they thought it acceptable to just barge in without knocking! The following morning I mentioned all this to reception who were not helpful and did not seem interested, will my be staying again! Big let down! ",3,2014,04,06
122,More than expected,"Room and hotel overall was way more than I'd expected. Room was huge, separate working area / living room and bedroom and two balconies. Room was clean, service was excellent, starting from the doorman. Breakfast was good, food was prepared during the breakfast, not beforehand. Only negative comment is the price...",5,2014,03,29
122,"All-suite hotel, very sweet!","We had a massive room with a large bedroom, large bathroom with the most powerful shower ever! The lounge was fantastic with a lovely coffee machine, dining table, comfortable sofa. The hotel had set up a bed in the corner of the lounge for our daughter. As you enter the room there is your own long formal hallway with umbrella stand etc. 
Very close to a Tesco express, right on Chelsea Harbour. Very convenient for Chelsea, Fulham and Kensington. Taxi from Royal Albert Hall cost £8 but if we hadn't got our daughter with us we'd have walked. 
Lovely pool which was fairly busy on Sunday morning but still plenty of space, easily accessible from the room with its' own lift. 
Breakfast is probably the best I've had in central London, huge buffet more like what you'd expect from a cruise. (The complimentary lemonade served from the concierge desk is also fantastic)
Staff were really friendly. 
Hotel is 2-3 minute walk from overground train station and 7-8 minute walk from Fulham Broadway. 
We will definitely stay here again. If you're looking for complete luxury I'd say this is more of a business/family trip hotel than intimate couples weekend but the price is an absolute bargain considering you're essentially staying in a one bed apartment with fantastic views!
Parking is really convenient as you're right next to Chelsea Harbour complex (The home of Laura Ashly HQ and The Design Centre) and underground there is masses of 'tight' parking spaces and the stairwell exit from this is right next to the entrance for the hotel!",5,2014,03,27
122,CIO at large corporation,"I have stayed several times at the Wyndham hotel, mostly when Chelsea soccer team had a match at Stanford. The hotel ""crew"" was ALWAYS exceeding my expectations, from Check-In (Sonja) to SPA, even the room service and the restaurant... But the reason I have decided to write now, as in THE bar I met today exceptional outstanding ""crew"" (Elisabeth P. and Dora S.): they were very professional and very customer centric (I had a special cocktail request and they created the best I ever had), so the bottom line is: if you want an ""issueless"" stay in hotel with the best service: Wyndham Chelsea Harbour is your choice!!! Thank you very much again all crew. gabor.olah@outlook.com",5,2014,03,22
122,WOW,"We booked this hotel as we saw a deal on Secret Escapes. We paid £200 for the Chelsea Suite. Upon arrival we was greeted and sat down to check in. We was shown our room and was very impressed. Some of the room could of done with updating but we was overall very impressed. We even got a free cake as it was my birthday :-) 

Location of hotel is good too, a 2min walk to imperial wharf tube station so very easy access into London. We had planned to eat in central london however after visiting the london eye we decided to call the hotel and book a table. We arrived back at hotel by taxi from the eye and it cost us £15 so very reasonable. The meal we had was amazing, we both orderd fillet steak and it was very yummy. Upon leaving resturant we saw Jose mareneho sat in the lobby. So if he stays at the hotel it must be worth it :-) 
Check out was very simple an overal we had an amazing stay. 
Will deffiantly be looking out for more deals for this hotel so we can return.",5,2014,03,10
122,Finally - A decent-sized family room in London,"Stayed here in Feb mid-term break. Great hotel accommodation: double bedroom with tv & balcony, sitting room with another tv & balcony, double sofa bed in sitting room which the staff turned into a double bed each night for 2 children. 2 bathrooms, big cloakroom & hallway. Loads of room in the suite. For older children who are fed up with small camp beds in hotels, this was a great choice. Breakfast was good, but service very slow on the Saturday, hence 4 stars not 5. Not on the tube, but don't let that put you off. It's on the national rail line - Imperial Wharf station, which connects to the tube and the bus service from the King's Road is excellent. Would definitely stay here again. The Chelsea team stayed here the weekend we were here, so if its good enough for them......",4,2014,03,09
122,Fantastic!,"I stayed here only for a night with my mother as we were visiting London and out the next day. 
From the moment we stepped into the place everything was beautiful.
We were helped by (and i hope the name is right!) Roberto, who was lovely and very helpful. He even showed us to our room.

The room was spotless and so lovely. The bathroom was gorgeous and we could have stayed in the suite forever!

We went to the bar for a drink, and ended up staying for a meal, fantastic meal and very friendly and highly trained staff. 

My only comment for improvement would be to look into dietary requirements as my mother cannot eat gluten so had a job to chose a meal. She in the end had vegetables and potatoes, said it was lovely. However, a little more option would be lovely. 

We would definitely stay here again and i have already recommended it. 

Great place, well worth the money!",5,2014,03,06
122,Breathtaking views of harbour.,"Wonderful hotel, views over chelsea harbour. The room was an amazing suite with plenty of room, toiletries supplied & of good quality. Breakfast was well presented & a vast choice, would definetly stay again.",5,2014,03,05
122,Amazing weekend,"Took my better half away for the weekend to my hometown of London and decided on the Wyndham Grand, the suite we had overlooking the harbour was superb, and we couldnt ask for more, the spa was great, although we would have liked to have shared a sauna, it was only a minor detail, the food in the restuarant was amazing as were the cocktails at the bar, a thoroughly enjoyable experience, thank you to all the staff at the hotel, we hope to see you again.",5,2014,03,03
122,Amazing hotel,"This is a great hotel and the service is 2nd to none. The staff made is feel like we was individual and special and the room was stunning and perfectly laid out with everything you would need for a comfortable stay. Granted the stay cost is high with a room cost starting from 190 per night, the hotel is all suite and you certainly won't regret it for that special occasion    ",5,2014,03,03
122,Fine weekend,I stayed at The Wyndham last weekend for 2 nights. Absolutely fabulous from start to finish. Staff very attentive and the rooms are the most comfortable I've stayed in for a long time. Would definitely recommend this for a wonderful night in London. I will stay again without a doubt.,5,2014,02,27
122,beautiful and relaxing,"perfect  weekend at a perfect hotel.  Suite was lovely, bed comfortable and service was wonderful. 
Overall Excellent.  Thank you. Have eaten here before but never stayed, will always come back.  The best hotel I have stayed in by far.",5,2014,02,24
122,Memorable in all the right ways!,"When the only bad thing I can find to say about this hotel is that the route to the main entrance from the nearby railway station is unclear (we arrived via the delivery bay and underground car park), then readers will now that the Wyndham Grand at Chelsea Harbour has managed to impress.  We booked a suite for the Saturday at a discounted rate, then decided to extend it to the Friday (Valentines day) because circumstances had changed.  We were offered the same discount rate, which was a very good start.

Having found the entrance, check-in was painless.  Our rooms were spacious, thoughtfully designed, generously equipped, immaculately clean and had a very comfortable bed.  It had two TVs, two toilets, three washbasins, a fridge, and, well, just about everything we could have wanted.

We did not use the gym, or eat there, but the swimming pool, sauna and steam room were first rate.  I quickly learned how to get there (using the lift in the corner!) and that it gets busy at 10.00 on a Saturday morning!

Room service was thoughtful, the staff friendly and attentive.  All in all, momorable in all the right ways!",5,2014,02,22
122,Christmas Day at the Wyndham Grand!,"We had the most excellent Christmas lunch this year at the Wyndham Grand in Chelsea Harbour. I needed somewhere elegant for Christmas lunch that I could take my family - my wife, my son and his girlfriend plus my mother (94) and my Aunt (99), oh and including one vegetarian. Quite a mix of people to please but they did it soooo well! There was a three piece jazz band, beautiful surroundings, a superb 5 course lunch, impeccable but understated service. The place looked terrific and everyone had a truly memorable day made all the more special for my wife as there was nothing to wash up afterwards! Somehow this made her day all the more special. Our £100 lunch included a couple of amuse-bouche courses and our champagne as we arrived - the nonagenarians paid the children's rate but were served everything we had but had a half main course - wines were very reasonably priced, well served and well kept. All in all a very special day that I would repeat without hesitation. Thank you Wyndham- sorry I tool so long to review.",5,2014,02,17
122,"Second visit, just as good as first! Well done!","We have just returned from a three day half term break with our two daughters, age 5 and 8. This is our second stay and we will be back. Very spacious suites, perfect for a family. Breakfast is excellent. All staff very polite and professional. Took us just over half an hour from Kings Cross on tube and overground. Two minutes from Imperial Wharf station. For dinner we opted not to eat in hotel, although food is fab. Instead we ate at Lots Road pub, which was very nice, has a good kids menu. And another night we had Indian from Exoticca, see my other review. Would definatley recommend Wyndham Grand for a London break. The McManus family.",5,2014,02,17
122,"Modern, pleasant but not five star outstanding","This is a modern hotel and therefore lacks any real charm. The lobby is smart and door staff attentive. Our room was very nice. It was spacious with a separate lounge area and a television in both the bedroom and lounge. The bathroom was certainly luxurious. We found the bed very comfortable. The room was clean. It would have been nice to have a room with a view of the Harbour but there were none available as this was a very last minute booking.

The only bit we were less than impressed with was the restaurant. For the five star prices we paid we felt the meal was far from five star. The waiter struggled to understand with a poor level of English. I am more than happy to see foreign workers in our leisure industry but they need to be able to communicate properly. The food was ok but a meal we had in a pub the week before at a quarter of the price was much better. They offer a kids menu. Our son had sausages and mash which were extremely salty.

After our experience in the restaurant the night before we decide not to give any more of our cash to the hotel so we went to Jury's Inn for breakfast where they have an eat as much as you like buffet breakfast for half the price and kids under five eat free.

The hotel pool was good and we enjoyed the steam room and sauna. The showers were also good. The lift down to the pool rather oddly resembles a service lift and you wonder if you are in the right place.

The hotel is located very close to a rail link which is one stop from the tube and is within zone 2. A day travel card taking us into zone 1 was £17 for two adults. Kids under 5 travel free. The hotel does not have its own parking instead using the local underground car park which cost £27 for 24 hours.",4,2014,02,17
122,Great hotel but....,"This is a great hotel.  The suites are excellent and, in the main, the staff are quite good, even if some of them are not that fluent in English! The restaurant food is outstanding and it is a great shame many more guests do not eat there.",5,2014,02,16
122,Lovely experience,"Fabulous hotel, polite and courteous, professional staff, fabulous food. Could not fault it. Great location would highly recommend the experience. Spa not so good, which is a shame... Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2014,02,16
122,Fantastic,"Stayed hear with my family early January and we were delighted with this hotel. Excellent staff and a very modern/well equipped hotel.  It is a taxi drive to most places, but very good! The bar and restaurant area is also very nice and this hotel is suitable for family, couples or for business. ",5,2014,02,16
122,A little disappointing,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, which I booked through Secret Escapes. As I was unable to select a room type through this site I emailed the hotel to request a harbour view room as it was for a birthday. They said that the room booked was not a harbour view, but they would put in a request and put on file about my boyfriends birthday. When we got there we did not have a harbour view room and nothing had been done for his birthday, which was a bit disappointing. I felt some kind of gesture would have been nice from a 5 star hotel. 

I booked this hotel partly because of the spa area, which was a real letdown. The pool was nowhere near as nice as it looked in the photos, and there were children's swimming lessons going on so it was not very relaxing, especially as they did it the side of the pool with the loungers so we were repeatedly splashed!

The lobby area and room were nice, but there were bits like the lift to the spa which looked like some kind of goods in entrance which I wouldn't expect from a good hotel.

Overall we did enjoy our stay but I felt it lacked the luxury feel that I expected.",3,2014,02,11
122,First class service with a smile,"i have just returned from a stay at the Chelsea Harbour hotel. The suites are extremely comfortable, the beds super comfy and the breakfast splendid.
however the best thing about this fabulous hotel is the staff - nothing is too much trouble and everyone goes out of their way to ensure the guest has the best experience.
Can't wait to go back.",5,2014,02,10
122,Perfect weekend stay,"Was in London to watch football at Stamford Bridge so booked mainly for location but was very pleasantly surprised by the whole experience . Got an exceptionally large room/suite for a great price , maybe weekends are not that busy? From reception to the reataurant , bar , health club & check out , everyone we met who worked there seemed genuinely friendly & interested in our well being . Really lovely service from everyone . We ate lunch & breakfast at the restaurant which were both good , espescially the hot breakfast . Dinner room service was pretty good & not eye wateringly expensive as in some hotels. Th ppol was big enoug to enjoy , nice to have a steam room as well as sauna . Gym looked well kitted out. If I had to moan about anything , the cost of a movie at Gbp 15 doesnt really hold up against itunes.
Will defintely recommend this hotel & hope to stay again.",5,2014,02,10
122,Tranquil Oasis in the centre of London,"This hotel is in a fantastic location right on the marina and rivers edge and provides an oasis of calm just a 10 minute walk from the hustle and bustle of the Kings Road. If you want to get away from it all but be within spitting distance of all that London offers, this is the hotel to book. The suites are of a good size and are very comfortable to spend a few hours relaxing as well as sleeping. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well appointed. Lovely bed linen and good supplies in the bathroom. The bar overlooks the marina and offers a great selection of cocktails. The check in and bar staff were very friendly and professional. We did not eat in the hotel but could see the food taken to other tables looked good and the prices seemed very reasonable for a five star hotel. If you are worried that there is not much to do around the hotel, there are some very good pubs serving excellent food within a short walk of the hotel which are The Chelsea Ram and Lots Road Pub and Dining Room. The walk along the river offers a very romantic setting and another bar to recommend is the Waterside, which overlooks the river and can be found by going to the back of the hotel and following the river around to the right. You also have all of the delights of the Kings Road which offers a wide range of restaurants, bars and shops should you want more choice. We booked the hotel on a very good deal and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our stay, so much so that we have booked to visit again.",5,2014,02,04
122,Fabulous hotel,"Just returned from a two night stay at the Wyndham Grand in Chelsea harbour and what a fabulous hotel it is.The Marina suite we stayed in was beautifully appointed and had a lovely view of the harbour. Very spacious suite with a bathroom and a second cloakroom.
Well stocked mini bar,very pricey though considering the room rates,would be nice if this was included in the price !! 
Bed was huge and very comfortable with a turn down service in the evening.
Unfortunately we didn't have opportunity to use the pool and spa facilities so can't comment on these nor did we eat in the hotel,although the menu looked quite appealing and expensive.
The only downside to the hotel is that it is quite a way from London's attractions other than that no complaints at all.",5,2014,02,03
122,Superb value,"We stayed in the wyndham ,January 2nd for three nights ,second visit.   Helpful charming staff,check in easy and quick. We had a suite for the first two nights that was very noisy due to the room facing the new overground railway, the patio window did not help as it did not seal properly. However we mentioned this and were moved for our final night .Apart from that we like the position of the hotel and the suite was great for my wife and I and our son who had a sofa bed and his own TV loo. Plenty of towels and bathrooms well thought out. The pool was a bonus ,my son and i having a dip before breakfast. Overall a great deal for London !",5,2014,02,02
122,good value for money,"If you need not stay in the city centre, the Wyndham in Chelsea is your place. It offers spacious rooms and excellent service at affordable rates. The hotel as a bit aged but it offers a 17m indoor pool and a private Espresso-Machine in the room as well as free WiFi.",4,2014,01,28
122,Great suites and value for money,"As always, this hotel does not disappoint. The service and facilities are excellent and it is an ideal place to base yourself for a visit to London.",4,2014,01,27
122,Perfect service,The Wyndham hotel at Chelsea Harbour is a beautiful hotel with wonderful suites. We were very pleased with the service we received of all employees.,5,2014,01,26
122,A 5 star hotel off the beaten track.,"This was our first, worldwide, experience of a Wyndham Group hotel, it turned out to be an excellent choice. We stayed for 2 nights. Although off the beaten track, rail and road links made access to central London relatively easy. It took me 35 mins to walk (amble) along the road (King's Road mainly) from Harrods to the hotel.The Chelsea Harbour is a haven of peace and quiet. Some people may find the lack of restaurants around the hotel a drawback but we didn't. The area around Chelsea Harbour/Imperial Wharf is work in progress. When we arrived the check-in process was quickly negotiated and although we arrived 2 hours early our room was made available to us very quickly. The rooms are ""all suites"", ours was best described as a junior suite. The linen and towels were of excellent quality and the room was spotlessly clean. Coffee making facilities were good and the toiletries were of a reasonable standard. The bed was very comfortable. The only irritating thing about the room was the taps on the twin sinks. It was difficult to see which setting was hot and which was cold. On two occasions very hot water issued from the taps irrespective of the position the tap had been placed in, a real health and safety issue! Service in the bar was variable, on occasions the staff just stood around chatting and failed to come over to attend to our needs, making us feel as though we were bothering them. The staff in the bar were not of 5-star standard! The food in the bar area was reasonable, although fairly expensive for what it was, it was what I would expect in a 5-star London hotel. However our overall experience was a good one. We were told that the Wyndham group was disposing of the hotel and the property was passing over to another chain. Will it be as good under them?.....we shall see! I would recommend this hotel to others and return in due course.",5,2014,01,25
122,Lovely,"We love staying here, our daughter and son in law live near by so we stay here and always have good time and feel very at home. ",5,2014,01,25
122,excellent,"Excellent facilities, room was very clean , shower was very good, taxi driver that took us to theatre from hotel was very friendly and treated us to a tour on our way there brilliant!. Will use this hotel again.",5,2014,01,24
122,Great Rooms & Views,"A very well presented and well ran hotel.  Rooms are lovely, highly recommend river view or Marina view.
      ",4,2014,01,24
122,Great intimate anniversary hotel,"A great hotel for an intimate celebration, as the space to spread out, a lovely huge comfortable bed, a relaxing swim & spa area. All my extra requests such as champs, late check out etc were met in a discreet yet relaxed manner. Highly recommend room staff for an intimate dinner, lovely food & all arrived on your own personal dinner table. Will definitely be back for special occasions & highly recommend. Beautiful quiet location in Chelsea harbour, so quiet you wouldn't even know you were in Central London. ",5,2014,01,24
122,Lovely hotel,Service was excellent and the whole experience was very pleasant. Food was fantastic will definitely stay there again,5,2014,01,24
122,Mixed Feelings,"Mixed feelings. Nice hotel. Food was very good. bar staff excellent. But the restaurant manager was useless, even spilling our wine, nevermind forgetting our food! we always hoped one of the waiters would serve us instead! also room was kept clean, but on one day, presumably our normal chambermaids day off? we left out shoes to be polished and nothing happened and our complimentary paper was not delivered. Also we were supplied with one tube of shower gel for two people for a two night stay, but two tubes of shampoo?!",4,2014,01,23
122,Pure Pleasure - Tremendous Staff,"I've been coming back to the Wyndham again and again. The staff are just the best, including Abdul, George and Paul who greet you to Helen who checks you in. The rooms are a pleasure to be in. I have to work ""on the road"" and its my office away from home. Can't say enough good things.",5,2014,01,22
122,Nice suite over looking Marina & good service,"This is our 4th stay at Wyndham Chelsea harbour, all rooms are Suite with luxury bedding & toiletries - we like the atmosphere of the hotel with a nice bar overlooking the Marina.  The check-in staff are really helpful and accomodating - Our Suite was overlooking the marina with a balconey and whilst it was cold - still a lovely view.  The room has nespresso machine, good stocked bar.  it is fairly quiet around by the hotel but within walking distance you have bars, restaurants and nice walks along the river.   I have not eaten there we always go out to the local restaurants.  I would recommend this hotel if you want little bit of luxury in london just outside the main heart of london but near enough for a cab ride or train.  YOu really dont need to travel into the centre though, there are plenty of really nice brassiers/resturants and Bars all local.   you gotta try it  - We will go back time and time again  _ Our London pad especially if you get a good deal with room prices!!",4,2014,01,20
122,"Gorgeous hotel, great staff. Perfect","Just back from a weekend in this lovely hotel. The staff were polite, funny, informative and ever present to answer our questions.
The swimming pool was great too, excellent facilities. Breakfast was a tasty and filling affair. Loved the honeycomb. Lovely touch Wyndham. 
Would love to stay here again. ",5,2014,01,19
122,Lovely hotel,"Spent the weekend here for my 50th birthday. We had three suites between the family, each one was lovely! The service was excellent, from check in to checkout! Friendly and very accommodating staff. Food in the brasserie for Sunday lunch was tasty. ",5,2014,01,19
122,service with a smile,"often with big hotels there is a limied effort , we enjoyed our stay and staff members made a effort to ensure we were confortsble.  excellent size roms for london where space is at a premium, decor bit bland but , imaculate bathroom  and nice products. 
      
      ",5,2014,01,14
122,A jewel,"Fantastic location 
Fantastic service
Fantastic rooms
Great harbour view room
Stayed with my two boys pre Xmas had a wonderful time in the hotel and can only give it a high recommendation bar area great 
Just a wonderful location
Car parking not free £27 a night
Will return
Book it!",5,2014,01,14
122,Christmas at the Wyndham,"This is about the seventh time we have have stayed at this hotel and have now made a habit of doing Christmas and birthdays there.I have reviewed it before and it has always been good, but this is our latest experience.  The service is first rate and the staff are great. The hotel is spotless, the lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas, the suites enormous, and the breakfast in the room is not to be missed. It is kept hot in a little oven. The breakfast fruit salad is huge, ( way enough for two) and totally heavenly. All the food we had was amazing. The view is great and try to get a marina or river view room for the view. although all the rooms are suites and all are brilliant. The train station is very near by as is a pretty river walk with bars cafes etc. The connections are good so no need to book a tiny overpriced room in central London when you can stay here instead.We have stayed in a lot of hotels and this one is always the best!",5,2014,01,12
122,Can't wait to visit again,"We had a lovely couple of nights at the Wyndham and were really impressed. We booked a Harbour View suite and asked for a high floor - we had great views across towards Central London. Even though it was January we still sat on the balcony watching the sun rise over London on a beautiful crisp winter morning. The suite itself was large with a separate sitting room, and an additional toilet off the entry vestibule. All modcons including free wifi. Super powerful shower. The Kings Road is only a short stroll away with its vast range of eateries and shops. We definitely recommend the Wyndham.",4,2014,01,12
122,Nice treat!,"My husband was staying here for a week due to work and I was lucky enough to tag along! The suite we had was like a small flat - everything had been well thought out and was perfect! I have never seen such a big bed or slept in one more comfortable! The breakfast is cooked to order - I worked my way through the menu during the week - I couldn't eat until the evening! The staff were very pleasant and attentive. There are lots of lovely shops and resturants in Chelsea, along the Kings Road but if you want to travel into London it's a 20 minute walk to the nearest Tube station. I didn't use the Spa facilities but they looked very good.",5,2014,01,08
122,Fab Hotel,"We stayed on a Saturday evening for theatre trip to see Book of Mormon, which, BTW, was superb.  This hotel was great.  Each room is a suite, beautifully decorated and finished and in our room we had 2 toilets!  Coffee making is Nespresso like and we were so pleased to note that breakfast at the weekend is until 12.  So welcome for a lie in.

Staff very friendly and helpful and couldn't fault the service.

The hotel is on the Thames so morning stroll can be along the river or Kings Road or Fulham Road, so plenty of shops and cafes.",5,2014,01,08
122,New Years Eve,"We went to the rooftop bar on New Years Eve to see the fireworks. The hotel did not really make any effort they opened up a meeting room on the top floor gave us a glass of champagne but made no attempt to make it festive, not a party popper in sight. No countdown to midnight it was purely a viewing point for the fireworks.",2,2014,01,08
122,Shame about the view,"Booked a suite with marina view for two nights as a special treat, this was a hotel we have used for nearly twenty years albeit. to as frequently in recent years.  The suite was booked for over two months and the hotel charges a higher tariff for marina view so.....

Very disappointed to be allocated a first floor room with a view of the restaurant roof NOT THE MARINA.  Upon complaining to the duty manager we were reallocated for the second night but 50% of our special treat was over .  Such a let down.",3,2014,01,07
122,Great Family break in a smart hotel,"Knowing how expensive London can be we opted for one of the secret hotels you can get and ended up here. A little way out of the tourist area, but if you don't mind a few tube stops, its great. 5 star hotel. Extremely attentive staff through out. Great pool for all of us to enjoy. Spacious suite. We ate at the restaurant both nights and received beautiful food and great service. Expensive food but its London what do you expect.",5,2014,01,07
122,good but needs to be better,"Enjoyed our stay of 7nights. 
The hotel feels homely & inviting, however it is obvious that some money needs to be spent on bedrooms asap because your rates are high & your bedrooms are looking & feeling tired, e.g. poor internet quality, furnishings broken, bathroom/showers needing updated etc..
Also although your staff were pleasant, they didn't  have a 'will do' attitude , it was more 'why we can't do'. Shame!",4,2014,01,06
122,FABULOUS!,This was a birthday treat and I was absolutely delighted!  We were upgraded to a Marina view suite and the staff couldn't have been more helpful!  We will definitely be back - THANK YOU!,5,2014,01,06
122,"Great, but staff issues!?!","Great hotel in a prime location; really accessible whatever the reason is to be in London (ours was a family trip, Winter Wonderland & Sightseeing).  Interconnecting rooms are immaculate, stylish and well laid-out.  However, the debacle at breakfast was monumental; not enough staff so we waited for 25mins just to be seated & then a catalogue of mishaps thereafter!!!",2,2014,01,06
122,New Year's Eve,"We traveled as a family of four and decided to stay overnight for New Year's Eve.

It was the best NYE we have had - everything laid on, beautiful suite (kids were very impressed), great tasting menu. The Spa was also great - and much appreciated was the 2pm check out on NY Day!!!

The only slight let down was the Champagne Party on the penthouse level at midnight, which we felt lacked a bit of atmosphere - - the pouring rain certainly didn't help, so perhaps that was the reason.

But in a heartbeat we would repeat the experience again. A quality hotel, where all the staff went above and beyond.  ",5,2014,01,06
122,My stay at Wyndham Chelsea harbour,"Lovely staff quick helpfully lovely smelling that was new year eve 
Morning breakfast staff wander full  room service at 3 in the morning as good love it loved it make any exercise to go back

122,Superb Night,"We stayed here for NYE and it was faultless. The room, the staff, the restaurant were all first class",5,2014,01,05
122,Nice but Too Far from Sights,"Positives 
1 - Nice large clean and comfortable rooms/suites perfect for US tourists
2 - Excellent pool
3 - Quiet and scenic location
4 - Easy to catch a taxi
5 - Courteous staff

Negatives:
1 - Had to wait 2 hours for our room and this appears to be a common trait for this hotel - there were several other families waiting in the lobby - after a long flight its the last thing you need.
2 - Too far from main London attractions will cost $50-60 taxi ride
3 - Private car service is expensive and a waste
4 - Restaurant and Bar - attractive but very pricey ($150/couple without drinks)
5 - No close by restaurants and pubs (only 1 and they don't open until 6pm) - you have to taxi to Fulham or Kings Road ($15-20)

122,Football holiday,We had a nice time during our stay during x-mas. The hotel was nice decorated. My son was over the moon with joy when he met his favorite footballteam in the lobby. We will return for our next trip to London.,4,2014,01,03
122,"great hotel , the children really enjoyed the swimming pool...","great hotel , the children really enjoyed the swimming pool and really enjoyed the breakfast . 
would recommend the hotel to all our friends and family

      ",5,2014,01,03
122,Fantastic hotel with amazing service,"I stayed at this hotel for New Year and it could not have been better. The suites are spacious (especially for London), modern and very comfortable. The facilities in the room are well thought through and include a coffee maker with complimentary fresh milk in the fridge, high speed wifi and an umbrella just in case it rains. There was always a taxi waiting outside and so getting around was no trouble at all. The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. This is really an excellent hotel.",5,2014,01,02
122,Tea,This hotel is normally perfect but on this visit we were offered tea from a communal jug at breakfast even the most basic B&B would give you your tea in an individual pot. To be fair when we said the tea was pretty rubbish we got out own pot. So back to perfection!,5,2014,01,02
122,Wow!,"Stayed at the Wyndham Grand on 28th December as a good way to unwind after Christmas. Booked the Spa break which included a spa treatment, dinner and a suite overlooking the harbour.  Have to say the whole place is stunning, runs like clockwork, room was wonderful, food was excellent, spent the evening tripping over various members of Chelsea FC (can't be too bad if they use it!) and left with a big smile on my face.  Drinks are very expensive but the service and quality makes it difficult to begrudge the price.  Would recommend to anyone.",5,2014,01,02
122,our favourite place to stay,"We have been visiting this hotel for nearly 10 years now and it always is a real treat . This Christmas visit was no exception and the level of service and detail by the staff makes it very special . Love the new changes to the bar area , lots more seating and beautiful Christmas decorations. After a drink in the bar [ it was Chelsea football so rather busy and a few famous faces around ! ] had a lovely meal in restaurant ; excellent fries !: Great to sit and look at all the boats , such a unique place in London . But what really makes this place special are the rooms , being all suites you can really pretend that you have your own Chelsea pad! Pop out to the local Tesco [ avoiding mini bar prices] near the design centre and hide yourself away for a night of fun.",5,2014,01,02
122,Sweet Suites,"The Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour is a wonderful, upmarket, all suites hotel.   I had some Wydham points that were going use it or lose it so my other half and I decided that a weekend at the Chelsea Harbour was in order.

When London Overground works this wonderful hotel is easy to get to.  When Lonodn Overground isn't working it is a bit of a nightmare.  It took two hours from SE London to get there.  Ah well it was worth the trip.

The lobby is very light and airy.  Reception were very helpful and welcoming.  They offered us a cold drink followed by a coffee while we waited for our room to be ready.  We were early so were not expecting the room.

The room or should I say rooms were fantastic.  The living room was large with lots of plush comfortable seating.  The view of Chelsea harbour was lovely - full of yachts and the river.  

There were large flat screen televisions in both the living room and the bedroom.  The bedroom had a top notch bed with great linens and heaps of pillows.  ~There was also an iron and ironing board as well as a laptop size safe.  Pity that they charge for wifi.

The bathroom was the real gem - huge with both a walk in shower and a large bathtub.  The shower was the first hotel shower that I had seen that had duel controls.  This meant that I could take my super hot showers and leave the setting for the next time.  The other half who showers at a more moderate temperature was able to set him controls to a temperature that you can't make tea with.  

Tons of towels and fabulous toiletries completed the bathroom.

We made good use of the gym and indoor pool.  All done to a super up to date standard and spotlessly clean.

Our room rate didn't include breakfast so we didn't eat in the hotel.  There were plenty of options for breakfast in the neighborhood.",5,2014,01,02
122,Couldn't fault it,"Service fantastic, suite fantastic.  We travelled with two young children age 6 and 18 months, the hotel welcome them with open arms.  The only downside was that we didn't get to use all of the facilities!  Will definitely return :-)",5,2013,12,31
122,Just perfect!,"Booked a three night stay here through Secret Escapes and had a simply wonderful time. The warmth and attention to detail offered at the hotel is fabulous. The pool is ample and Staff in the health club are friendly, polite and helpful.  The bar was lovely to eat in and not too fussy, informal yet still delicious food and attentive service.  The nearest station is Imperial Wharf overground which has excellent links to Shepherds Bush/central areas.  I would stay here again without question. If it is on your list of possibles do not hesitate.",5,2013,12,30
122,Pre-Christmas trip,"My one night stay in the Wyndham Grand was very good. The rooms was excellent with a supremely comfortable bed and noticeably top class bed linen. It's actually a very good hotel and if it was more in the Mayfair end of town it would be a lot more expensive. This is a top class establishment with completely smooth check in and check out by incredibly polite staff.

122,Pre Christmas family trip to London,"Our annual family trip to London for a pre Christmas show and to visit Father Christmas at Harrods. We have stayed at this property on several occasions and it has clearly benefited from some major refurbishment and investment under Wyndham ownership.

+ve
Hotel beautifully decorated for Christmas.
Large suites, well appointed, very comfortable bedding
Very attentive staff in all areas - great service attitude
Fruit and welcome letter in room on arrival as token of appreciation of repeat business.
Complimentary bottled water in room.
Excellent breakfast offering.
Value for money with pre-booked rate on hotel website.
Wednesday Champagne Event 5.30 - 7.00pm (2 for 1) - enjoy!
Great location on Chelsea Harbour, we took the Thames Clipper riverboat service from the harbour at the rear of the hotel to Embankment and onwards to the Tower of London - beats the London traffic and great river views.

-ve
Room far too hot; turn down staff increased the heating to 25C while we were out. Unbearably hot upon return. Windows do not open and the air con did not work - smoky smell. Informed reception but night 2 was just the same.
Website parking information needs updating - there is no NCP car park attached to the hotel (but there is a 1,000 space undercover Design Centre car park 3 minutes walk away - £22 7.00 am - 7.00pm and £5 7.00pm - 7.00am.... Hotel offers valet at £40 per night.)

122,Unsnobby luxory,"Stayed one full week on business. The rooms were actually not rooms, but suites. Very comfortable bathrooms. 
The first room I had didn't have wireless coverage (because it was behind/next to the elevator shafts), but the second room was ok. 
Breakfast was very good. Fruits, yoghurt etc. in addition to full English cooked breakfast.
I also had dinner in the restaurant one evening - also very good. And fairly priced.
There are several restaurants within walking distance in the area. Not all that many shops. 
I think this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. If you can afford the room-rate, it's a fantastic place.",4,2013,12,26
122,Fabulous hotel and wonderful staff,Just returned home from a wonderful stay at the Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour.  Thank you so much to all the staff who made our stay so memorable.  We had a smashing time and will definitely be staying again in the future.,5,2013,12,23
122,A lovely stay,"Had a really good time. The suit was amassing as was the hole hotel. The swing pool was at the perfect tempter. The only problem was that the previous people that has stayed in the room had filled the mini bar up with water, when telling the front desk they where very sorry and refilled it straight away. I would go back again.  ",4,2013,12,18
122,Also slightly underwhelmed.,"The hotel was very quiet according to the receptionist, but we were still put in a room right next to the lift, with a faulty air conditioner. Despite two calls to reception and two promises of an engineer, nothing happened. 
Not very impressed with the service, certainly not what I would expect from a five star hotel. We recently stayed at Al Husn in Oman and there is no way the issues mentioned above would have been allowed to happen.",3,2013,12,17
122,Fantastic Stay,"I recently attended a business course and stayed overnight at this hotel which the hotel provided excellent resources for.  The hotel is in a superb location in London and from the moment I walked up to the entrance, the service was impeccable, I couldn't have asked for any more.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was amazing.  As an all suite hotel, for a hotel in London, having a room of this size is definitely a luxury.  The room had all the amenities and more that you would expect and the breakfast was quick and delicious. Overall a fantastic hotel and I hope that I am fortunate enough to stay again one day.",5,2013,12,17
122,fantastic hotel,"Myself, my wife and our two daughters (7 & 4) spent two nights over the weekend. We had a long trip to london arriving late friday night and were given one of the warmest welcomes i have ever received at any hotel. All the staff were extremely polite and helpful, particularly at reception and at breakfast. The suites are huge and perfect for a family of four. We will definitely be staying here the next time we come to london!",5,2013,12,16
122,A little underwhelmed,"I booked a river view suite for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. We got there at 3pm but our room wasn't ready because apparently the Chelsea footballers had been staying - I was not impressed!! We went to wait in the lounge and had a coffee. Managed to get a free afternoon tea that someone else had not turned up for which was nice. Finally got into our room at about 4pm. View was impressive and room pretty good. Decor a bit naff. Nothing in the room for my boyfriend's birthday, or any mention of his birthday, even though I notified them of the occasion. The spa is in dire need of refurbishment and the sauna and shower areas look like public swimming baths. Pool area ok, but not as nice as other five star hotels in London. 
Overall, I don't think I would stay here again - there are much better five star hotels in London for the same or less money.

",3,2013,12,16
122,"Understated high class, beautiful designs","One night is simply not enough in this gracious all-suite hotel. Service is exceptional. Staff friendly and charming. Wonderful location. Breakfast with sun-light is stunning.
Access is complicated. Do not enter from the west. The security guard at the barrier could have been so helpful as we could even see the Car Park within 50 m from the barrier. But he chose to force us to reverse unsafely and make a 2 mile extra journey via Lots Road. So sad.
Other Hotel Guests can be of the worst type. One of our two suites had the lounge made unavailable due to the loud and vulgar language of the neighbouring suite which spoilt our night's sleep. Hotel security were called.",5,2013,12,14
122,special treatment,"I stayed at the Wyndham Chelsea Harbour for my wedding last month. We were married at the Old Town Hall in Chelsea and had our reception nearby so the location was ideal, and it was the only hotel nearby which was an all suite hotel, which in London is a huge bonus. I needed lots of space to get ready for my wedding, and to stay in a decent hotel in central London was going to cost a lot of money (even in November!) so I was pleased that I was at least guaranteed a good sized room for me, my bridal party and my hair and make up people. The hotel upgraded us and gave us a lovely bottle of bubbles as congrats. Nothing was too much trouble and the room was perfect. I work in the travel industry so have high standards and this hotel exceeded them! Thanks to all the staff there for making everything so seamless.",5,2013,12,12
122,Love!,"From the second you arrive to when you leave you are treated like royalty, all the staff are so helpful and friendly, they really go the extra mile. 
The suites are huge, there's nothing you could want for. We didn't get a balcony suite as it's so cold but we intend to go back in the summer and make the most of it. 
The pool was lovely, and you could get there direct from your room so you don't have to walk through the lobby or go in the main lifts etc in your robe.  It was nice and warm down there too so you could relax on the loungers. 
I liked the location, that it wasn't central, as we wanted a change of scenery this time and check out the Kings Road area.  But to get into town was easy, it's 2 stops on the overground to Shepherd's Bush (great shopping centre here if you like a mix of high street and designer) and then you can get on the Central line, so we were into central London in 25 mins.  On the way home we got a taxi and it was £20 inc tip from Covent Garden.
Check out wasn't until midday which is great.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and we will be going back.",5,2013,12,11
122,Wow! What a great stay!,"We stayed here for 1 night and found the place fantastic. The Suites are superb, spacious and luxurious!  The bar overlooking the harbour is stunning at night and so romantic.  I loved the fact we were about 20 minutes walk from Kings Road! We would definately stay here again as 1 night wasn't enough!",5,2013,12,10
122,wonderful hotel,"Stayed for one night in Chelsea suite.  Suite was warm and spacious well furnished and comfortable.   Location was ideal next to Imperial Wharf station, one stop to west Brompton then district line to central London.  We had breakfast which was great.  Staff were friendly and welcoming.  All in all a five star experience, thankyou",5,2013,12,08
122,Great Hotel Great Team,"Was in London for a conference and stayed at the Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour. Wonderful rooms  and excellent food. The staff at the restaurant deserves a special mention. Would love to be back. Yes, is a little pricey but then you cannot expect anything lesser in London for a 5 star all suites hotel. Connectivity to central London is also very good with the Imperial Wharf overground station only a minutes walk from the hotel.",5,2013,12,07

Were not disappointed as hotel was excellent, staff very helpful, bar and dinning room service of the highest quality. Would certainly recommend the hotel and will look to stay again sometime next year",5,2013,12,02
122,relaxing,"We spent four days touring London, using all forms of public transport, up and down stairs/escalators, fighting the crowds, traffic, and noise.  It was great to return to the Grand every night to clean up, put bathrobes on, and rejuvenate for the next day.  The bed and linens were very comfortable and super clean...difficult to get up in the a.m.   The suite was incredibly spacious.  The hotel is now decorated in holiday purple, with purple orchids and ornaments everywhere.  Classy.  The staff are all very helpful and polite.  The area is very quiet and residential.  Nearby are restaurants, cafes and pubs should one wish to eat elsewhere.  We chose the Wyndham because it is closer to Heathrow than hotels we've stayed in near London Bridge yet still manageable for us to move about in the city center.  Thanks to Wyndham staff for our chocolate mousse b'day cake!",5,2013,12,01
122,Needs Character,The hotel is a bit difficult to get to and not convenient for the main London attractions.  It is expensive but so are all the other five star establishments except they are closer to the centre of town.  We had lunch and it was an excellent meal served by polite and efficient staff.  We felt that the hotel lacked the warm character one often experiences in the more established five star hotels in London.  The hotel's modern architecture does it few favours and at first glance it could pass as a new tourist class hotel in Benidorm. The excellent food and good staff are the key to its future. ,3,2013,11,29
122,Nice night aaway from home,"Very nice hotel, welcome to be expected with perfect private check in, valet parking (£40 per night) although car was outside reception when requested next morning although valet personal never left key and left car running for 20 minutes and left us late for prior engagement.
Rooms comfortable with robes and slippers, coffee in room 10 minutes to figure out and only luke warm.

Taxi-service is excellent, there are always taxis available within a few minutes - no precious time is waisted. After having slept in one of the very comfortable beds you get pampered with a most delicate breakfast including hot meals. So for us everything was perfect.",5,2013,11,27

122,Excellent hotel for a wedding in London,"After one visit to this hotel I was so impressed and felt that it was worth sharing the experience. I like this hotel. My steel drum band covered an amazing Indian wedding at this hotel and we enjoyed the experience. As a supplier I appreciate assistance from the hotel and it is great when they treat you as if you are a guest. The Wyndham Grand looks after all visitors. The concierge service was efficient and helpful and we also enjoyed a club sandwich and drinks at the bar before the event started. At the event everything seemed well organised by a team which was well drilled before the guests arrived as we observed some of their briefing session. Everywhere in the hotel looks like it was just cleaned, all the mirrors and surfaces looked like someone has just polished them and the service areas are well presented. The hotel also has an excellent terrace and I would recommend it to anyone. 
One point to note is that the only option for parking is in the hotel car park, subject to availability, you will struggle to find any other spaces within 10 minutes walk after you have parked.",5,2013,11,24

122,Trip to London Wyndham,"This is a great hotel and the service was fine.
The location is not the best for seeing the London  sites most tourists come to see- it required an overground train trip to a subway station  and sometimes another subway change to get most places.  The overground train station  was very close to the hotel. (Cab fare is extreme.) The prices for the breakfast bar was extreme. I had specifically told the Wyndham fellow who booked the room that I needed two beds ina room. When we got to the hotel, falling over exhaustion exhaustion, there were no rooms  available with two beds- we were told we could wait for about five hours and then a two bed bedroom might be available or we could check in to a king bed bedroom. My daughter and chose the latter but trying to sleep in the same bed was not good at all. ",5,2013,11,20

Did not find the restaurant good value for money and after one experience we ate elsewhere.",5,2013,11,14
122,Taking service to another level!,"We had the good fortune to stay in this hotel last night. 
I was rather skeptical about what we were going to find at this hotel due to the reasonable cost. I need not have worried, the lobby is hugely impressive and has a real sense of grandeur. The service at reception was excellent and we were allowed entry to our suite almost 2 hours early.
The suite was huge, and very well furnished. 5 minutes in to our stay we received a courtesy call to make sure we were happy with our room and offering assistance if required, a very nice touch.
Upon return in the evening, we found a turn down service had been in, the coffee we'd used had been replaced, attention to detail was fantastic, even down to the toilet roll being refolded!
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, from the customer service all the way through to the lovely toiletries and complimentary newspaper in the morning.
A wonderful stay altogether!",5,2013,11,13

122,Always a fab comfortable stay,"Have stayed here many times and love it. Comfortable, spacious, clean suites with very comfy beds and lovely spacious bathrooms.  Coffee machine is hopeless and you NEVER get a hot one. Room service breakfast was excellent and all arrived hot and on time. Mini bar drinks are extortionately expensive but no different to other 5* establishments.  Drinks at bar are also very expensive.",5,2013,11,12
122,My favourite place to stay in London,"I love the Wyndham Grand and it is by far my hotel of choice whenever I stay in London. It is great value for money when compared to nearby 5 star hotels and worth every penny. 

Concierge are friendly and polite and always quick to help with my luggage. During my last stay I wanted tickets for the Lion King which was sold out online. One phone call to concierge and 2 tickets were found for me which I could collect straight from the concierge desk so no messing around at the box office when I got to the theatre.

All of the staff here are helpful and polite without it feeling forced or intrusive. Check-in is quick without feeling rushed and once checked in you are escorted to your room where you are showed around and made sure everything is to your liking, a nice touch.

The suites are beautiful, tasteful and comfortable furnishings with everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in, it's a struggle to get out of them in the morning. The shower is hot and powerful and the toiletries provided are good quality. There is also complimentary wifi for all guests.

I can't say anything about the restaurant unfortunately as I travel alone so prefer to opt for room service which is always delivered promptly and beautifully presented. The portions are quite large and everything I have tried has been excellent.

I always stay in a Chelsea King Suite which although it is the most affordable room available I have never felt like the quality is compromised. I have found myself in other hotels when after booking a standard room end up paying the extra to upgrade after checking in, I have never felt like this at the Wyndham. Although with the standard rooms you do not get a harbour view the view of Chelsea you do get is nice enough. There is nothing standard about these rooms, everything is luxurious and beautiful.

I look forward to staying here again soon.",5,2013,11,11
122,Just beautiful!,"Stayed for my friends 30th birthday in a suite overlooking the harbour. Fantastic view, room was so spacious and clean, room facilities are all there, coffee/tea etc. Staff can't do enough to make you feel special.

Used the pool briefly on arrival, even though it was quite busy, it's a nice small leisure club. 

Food was fantastic as were the cocktails!

Stay here for a special occasion, you won't be disappointed!",5,2013,11,11

122,Exquisite in places,"The hotel is beautiful, at least, the views it presents are beautiful, especially if you are looking out over the harbour itself. The decor is generally good, well appointed and fairly discreet. It's also well positioned with regards to Chelsea and West London in general. The room was very nice indeed, although when I sat on the bed, I fell straight through as the slats had fallen out. Once fixed, this was no longer a problem. Other issues were the slightly rubbish digital TV menu and operative functions, although I think that the shower may be one of the best in London. It was fabulous! Following BedGate, room service then took over as the biggest niggle. I had to call three times - wi ever increasing levels of irritation - to have them deliver shampoo to the room and twice to get milk (at which point they delivered cheap creamer, and the poor room service chap had to go and raid the kitchen). They are a little disorganised, and reception called housekeeping calls room service calls catering, at which point the Chinese whisper went dead, then I had to call again...this could probably be tightened up. It is for this reason that the hotel receives four rather than five stars, as it was otherwise an excellent place to stay. If the service issues can be tightened up, a fifth star would be merited.",4,2013,11,10
122,Great stay,"Lovely two night stay, great service and a marvellous room! The location was ideal for us and overall the stay was a great success.",4,2013,11,09
122,Still love the location but don't be complacent!,"My wife and I stayed with our two daughters and once agin had a lovely room which as always was well maintained and clean, offering great value versus other comparable West End hotels but service at dinner was unusually slow this time. Service is always friendly and the staff very welcoming. Well will definitely be back and won't hesitate to recommend the Wyndham to friends and relations - just a word of advice to the dinning room staff: keep your standards up and don't take the gloss of an otherwise brilliant experience!",4,2013,11,09
122,Memorable 20th Wedding Anniversary!,"My wife and I decided to spend our 20th Wedding Anniversary at the Wyndham Hotel. Firstly, the staff were absolutely fantastic. Upon our arrival they delivered a bottle of Champagne to the room, and laid out rose petals around the room. None of this was added to the bill! Our room was superb, we couldn't fault the hotel and will definitely return next time we visit London. We took our children and wont forget the stay, we visited back in March. Superb!",5,2013,11,08
122,A little bit of luxury,"We spent last weekend at the Wyndham Grand whilst in London for our granddaughter's birthday. We cannot fault the hotel - food, wines, beautiful Marina view suite and above all the standard of service from every member of staff we encountered. We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend of luxury and would certainly stay again. 
      ",5,2013,11,08
122,great rooms,"I have stayed here twice now and and have enjoyed both occasions. As a smoker it is great to have a balcony (marina view and better rooms)
The rooms are great with this being an all suite hotel. Probably the best value for money for a suite in London.
My 1 niggle was that on check-in, I was asked ""Can we offer you a newspaper in the morning?"" I asked for a daily mail.
Next day I had a complimentary Times and a Daily Mail which I was charged £3 for. Come on management: let people have their newspaper of choice with your compliments. Making a 500% profit is just greedy and annoying and is the only reason I am moaning about my stay there. Short-sighted I would suggest.

      ",4,2013,11,07
122,Family Half-Term Break,"Stayed at the hotel with family, sharing a Chelsea View room on the third floor. The hotel is close to the Imperial Wharf London Overground station which takes trains into London about every 20 minutes. There is also a Thames Clipper boat service to Blackfriars in the peak hours - a great way to get into London!

Overall the hotel is excellent and my next comments are only really for the hotel to really improve their performance.

The breakfast area does get quite busy and on two occasions we had to remind the waiters to take our order. On one occasion the breakfast order was missed although the management did apologise for this.

On our second morning there was no running water to our room. Apparently the main tank had to be drained and refilled overnight. This meant that none of us could take a shower or have a wash. I did report this at 8 am to the front desk but no-one phoned me back. I then complained to the management but received no compensation - at least a drink would have been nice!

So whilst the hotel is probably one of the best I have stayed in there is still quite a lot to do from the staff to make the experience really 5 star.",4,2013,11,07
122,Great experience and we were upgraded to the penthouse suit...,Great experience and we were upgraded to the penthouse suit due to our room  not being ready on arrival. The shower caused a problem and flooded the bathroom but this was dealt with very quickly and back up and running within 30mins. All in all a great night away.,5,2013,11,06
122,Superb Luxury Hotel,"Everything in this hotel was perfect. The suite was large - sitting room with a balcony, separate bedroom with an enormous very comfortable bed, dressing area and a large bathroom with great power shower. The hotel service was very efficient and friendly. This hotel isn't cheap but if you want a luxurious stay in London try this one I don't think you'll be disappointed.",5,2013,11,06
122,Excellent hotel,Found a new place to stay when in London! Great location too as it in minutes walk from the overground railway station. Staff were very good in particular the gentlemen on the door who gave us good advice. Just stayed the one night. Rooms spacious and clean. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel had a friendly relaxed feel to it. We will come again ( maybe without the children next time),5,2013,11,05
122,Great Stay,"Stayed for 1 night on October 26th for our 1st anniversary, as this is our hotel of choice for special occasions. We initially had some trouble with our reservation but this was resolved through the care of the reservations agent I spoke to. He took the time to rectify the issues and made sure we had everything right for our stay.

On arrival to our room we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and a platter of strawberries with a lovely note wishing us a happy anniversary from the hotel.  

This was greatly appreciated, made up for the reservation issues and made our stay even more special.

A big thank you to the reservations agent and the hotel for their great service.",5,2013,11,05
122,Lovely birthday stay,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand for two nights on 30th and  31st of October. We were celebrating my birthday and our wedding anniversary, my husband had secretly emailed ahead and we were surprised with strawberries and a bottle of bubbly on arrival in our room (which I thought was a lovely touch). The hotel was in a great position for us as its within easy reach of Imperial  Warf train station which links to the underground and gives easy access to the Heart of the city. The rooms are spotless and comfortably took us and our 11 year old son. We had a drink in the bar, priced as you'd expect in London, we didn't eat in the hotel or have time to use the spa (will save that for another visit).
We used our tesco vouchers to visit the tower and take a tour on the original tour bus, we were very lucky to have missed the hurricane weather and managed to stay dry.  The hotel is within reach of the Kings Road, we found a lovely little cafe for breakfast on route (on Lots Road). Although a long walk we decided to walk straight up through to Slone Square and then onto Harrods. We caught the number 22 bus back (the lovely bus driver and passengers made sure we got off at the correct stop and pointed us the right way back to Lots Road, who says Londeners aren't friendly!). We thought all the staff were efficient and friendly, without being over the top. We would definitely stay again.
      ",5,2013,11,05
122,Half term,"Stayed recently here with family in river/marina suite. The hotel is excellent and one of the best I have stayed in. The location is perfect and on Saturday we also had a free view of the firework display at Battersea from our balcony and in the morning the thames and Central London to the left.... The rooms are very spacious, spotless and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. Spa and pool also very good. Drinks and food not cheap but we expected this and no different to top class city hotels. We will definitely be coming back next year",5,2013,11,05
122,"Beautiful hotel, great service but slightly off the beaten track","We had a family suite, lots of space, very comfortable and excellent customer service throughout our stay.  Would definitely recommend.  Although imperial wharf station is a 2 minute walk away it's a long trek to the main attractions with at least one if not two changes on the train / tube.",5,2013,11,04
122,Excellent Stay,"Wyndham became one of my preferred hotels. I enjoyed 7 days I stayed in October. Everything was perfect. The building, the facilities and the surroundings. The staff were very friendly. I enjoyed breakfast everyday. The staff in the restaurant tried to please everybody. The hotel is perfect if you're travelling with your family.",5,2013,11,02
122,We'll come again!,"Very pleasant and helpful staff, suite very comfortable and well equipped, breakfast excellent and location of hotel quiet and scenic.  Only minor criticism that decor in room is slightly dated.",4,2013,11,01
122,"Good, could be even better","Overall, good experience. Suite was great, and perfect with 2 children. Pool good. Service good.
But check in / check out, let's the hotel down. The informality of the desks and the opportunity to sit down is good, but it all took too long.
Our food experience was ok, but nothing more - It was convenient to eat in the hotel with the children, but food quality vs price? £30 for prawns - they should be exceptional,. not just ok.

122,Magical wedding experience.,"Me and my fiance stayed at the Wyndham as it had received excellent reviews and was the perfect location for getting married at Chelsea town hall.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel every aspect of the stay was 5 star quality.  The suite was spacious with a beautiful view overlooking the Thames, the spa treatments were done by professional staff that made us feel taken care of and fully relaxed and both the bar and restaurant staff were attentive and made us feel pampered and treated.  The Brasserie staff in particular provided top quality service and really enhanced our wedding experience. The day of our wedding when we returned from getting married in the morning the staff were so warm and congratulated us. We felt as though we were already regular guests.  This was an unforgettable beautiful stay and we will definitely be returning for any future special occasion and know that we will be in good hands.

Mr. and Mrs. Nagle",5,2013,10,28
122,Living the high life :),"Plus points - We stayed here for 3 nights with 2 small children under 3 years old and we're booked into a suite which had 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms. Hotel room itself was fantastic as was housekeeping which we couldn't fault. Pool and changing rooms were also fantastic although no 'shallow end' as such which made it hard with children. Porter was very helpful. Coming home to find bed turned down, curtains drawn, slippers put out and ice bucket filled up were plus points.

Minus points - We telephoned the hotel to book the room and asked for a room to accommodate all of us and we're told we would have a sofa bed for our 3 year old however on arrival we were told they had only put a cot in the room hence we ended up with a 'put up bed' which if honest was a shame as not what was promised and the bed got in the way. Door staff were poor and most of the time failed to open doors for us which with the children would of been appreciated. We weren't offered the 'breakfast upgrade' that other people have posted about and at £24 (plus vat, £4.50 plate charge & 12.5% tip if room service) was too steep even for London! If we were offered the upgrade we would of taken it. 

Overall a great trip spent in a first class hotel.",4,2013,10,28
122,Our first night in the Wyndham Hotel at Chelsea Harbour in...,"Our first night in the Wyndham Hotel at Chelsea Harbour in London was very disappointing, the room was great even though I paid for the room to be upgraded to have a thames and harbour view, the view was more of an harbour view.  As we were relaxing in our bed to me and my wife's surprise we could hear somebody behind us urinating in the toilet in the next room,  we had the T.V on quite loud we could clearly hear the toilet seat been lifted and then someone using the toilet, it felt as though somebody was pissing on top of us.  We had to insist on being moved the next morning as my wife was still shocked and upset, we have never experience any thing like it in our lives and we are frequent travellers. I booked this weekend break as a special treat for her 50th birthday.  When they moved us to another room we actually got what we paid for, a view of the thames and the harbour.  one morning we waited so long for our cup of tea the breakfast came before the tea, the staff were very apologetic.  overall the staff in hotel was friendly, the location was excellent.",4,2013,10,27
122,Excellent 5 Star Hotel accomodation with dinner,"“Excellent hotel, superb staff” 5 of 5 stars
 thoroughly enjoyed all elements of the hotel especially its location, close to  proximity to numerous restaurants, cafes etc...the food in their restaurant was excellent we enjoyed breakfast outside under enormous heated umbrellas on the riverside brasserie, lunch on their courtyard deck after a good workout in the gym and a swim, dinner was amazing, cocktails beautiful,good choice and quality with exceptional pastries and deserts. From the moment we arrived to the time we reluctantly checked out the staff could have not been more attentive or keen to ensure we had the best time we possibly could have. The staff at this hotel are superb and a great credit to this hotel.""  I booked Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour for my return to London as a treat for my sister's birthday after experiencing terrible service for my 40th birthday at Plaza on the river club and residence London by front of house manager of Plaza on the river club and residence Gabriella Kolber",5,2013,10,26
122,A very good hotel but some room for improvement,"I stayed at the Wyndham for a week for work and pleasure. This is a large and well run hotel, that managed a work conference well. My room was a suite and comfortable. It does however let itself down on food quality/consistency and the location is not ideal. 

Pros:
Well trained and courteous staff
Good conference facilities
Large and well maintained bedrooms

Cons:
Food is average to bad. We had Phad Thai in their restaurant which was one of the worst I have tasted, totally non authentic and resulted in a stomach upset. However, buffet during conference was OK. Breakfast could be better
Location is in Chelsea but a good 15 minute walk from the heart of Kings Road and 25 mins to Sloane Square tube station so not ideal if on foot",3,2013,10,26

122,Quality hotel with quality service,"I stayed in this hotel last week with my wife and young son for four nights, in a suite ( they only have suites, which I was not aware of at the time of booking) and I cannot praise the hotel and the staff in particular. I stay in many hotels around the world while travelling on business, and this is one of the best and very good value. From the footman, concierge and the reception staff all gave a superb impression on arrival, friendly, helpful and professional. The room itself was extremely well fitted out with it's own lobby and very comfortable alround and a stunning view over the harbour and down the Thames. Travelling to London next week on business and I'll be booking rooms for myself and my colleagues. Great job by everyone at the hotel. Thank you.",5,2013,10,22

122,Wonderful Place to stay in London,"We just got back from a lovely visit to London where we stayed at the Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour.  This was a great location and much different than other places we had stayed in London.  It was also more affordable.  The hotel is all suites which gave us a delightful amount of room and a comfortable king size bed.  The balcony and the view were a pleasant surprise.  The area was quiet and right off the Thames river overlooking a peaceful quay.  Breakfast was included in our price and was delicious every morning. The hotel restaurant had well prepared  food served most graciously with a gourmet twist. Romantic tables overlooked the water.   Kareem, our concierge was more than helpful in making arrangements for us and suggesting great places to eat.  I feel like we made a new friend.  He patiently answered so many questions and gave some great advice.  We were close to everything.  Taxi's are right out front of the hotel and the overground train is just steps from the hotel.  The overground connects to the tube in any direction and we went everywhere with our travel card.  Harrods is actually within walking distance if you like strolling and seeing the sights on a pretty day (2 miles).  The shops in Chelsea off Kings Road were really fun, especially the little antique shops.  If you enjoy design, the design center is right next to the hotel.  In summary, great hotel, fabulous staff and the place I would stay when next in London.",5,2013,10,21
122,suite for chelsea/west london,"Great suite-style hotel - large double bed-rooms with en-suite lounges which work really well. Definitely a modern, well-equipped four/five star hotel (good gym) though service, while friendly, not on the same level as the main five-star London hotels. Superb location if you need to be in Chelsea or West London, though not recommended if you want to be the in the West End - 30 mins by taxi or extended train journey from Imperial Wharf.",4,2013,10,21
122,"Beautiful hotel, very good welcome service","Beautiful hotel, stunning in fact. The service on arrival, such as fresh iced cordial, concierge and the check in process being personal and welcoming - actually sitting you down to check in and taking you to the room in person. Kinga in reservations also kindly offered an upgrade if there was space, which there was, in exchange for a minimum spend on the bar which I honoured.

The restaurant food was lovely, but as a Brassiere was too relaxed for the 5* hotel - diners could come in, in flip flops and shorts should they wish and the menus were all on cheap matt plastic cards rather than nice menus as you would expect. I also enquired about the Star Set Menu, but was told if I wanted this I would have to pointlessly go on my phone and book... which I spent 2 minutes standing outside doing, only not to want anything on that menu anyway. Booking that menu certainly wasn't necessary as the place was dead and they were eager for custom. The food was stunning however and the decorations suited to the type of restaurant it was - although again, in itself was out of place compared to the 5* hotel that you step out from! I had dolphin for mains and it was stunning. They allowed me to taste a few wines before I proceeded. The waitress spoke broken English well.

The room was utterly stunning. I was upgraded and was on the 5th floor with a partial view of the Thames and the port, along with a balcony and the most amazing Suite. There was no sound in the bathroom though from the TV/Radio which 4* Doubletree by Hilton hotels have. The power shower was great and the room had everything I possible wanted.

The reason they have 3.5 out of 5 from me is for the need to ask for the most basic things in the room twice. I needed extra coffee for the espresso machine in the afternoon, access to movies later on in the evening and for a turn down service late evening. I needed to telephone reception TWICE after asking and waiting an hour or so. They said it had been done, but I reminded them it hadn't.

It did impress me though that when I went to get a G&T... ice was magically waiting on top of the mini-bar area when I came back from dinner and had a turn-down service!

We are a same sex couple and was treated as an ordinary couple. I add this in as, as a LGBT traveller, I know *some* high class establishments can look down their noses. There was none of this hear and with a touch of class, all staff seemed down to earth.

The spa lacked a jacuzzi but the rest was grand.",4,2013,10,19

122,Only average,"The hotel has a beautiful setting and it's great to sit in the bar at night looking over the water.  However, this is not matched by the standard of service in the restaurant which was lacking in co-ordination and efficiency.  Also, although the menu sounded interesting, the food presented at breakfast was of a very mediocre standard.  The waiters seemed unable to cope with any request which deviated from the norm and was certainly not of the level one would expect of a 5 star hotel.  Disappointingly the room was not serviced on the second evening which again should not happen in an hotel such as this.  Definitely not tip-top. ",3,2013,10,11

122,Excellent stay!!,"When we first arrived there had been a booking issue and the hotel had to put us in a different hotel for one night of our stay. What we thought would have been a hassle ended up working out for us, as the staff at Chelsea Harbour were excellent.  They took us to the other hotel and picked us up the next morning. When we checked in, we ended up with an upgraded room and were credited for the inconvenience of having to stay one night someplace else.  We loved the rooms, beds very comfortable, everything was clean and in excellent working order. The view of the river was really nice! The room service was very good also. We wanted to tour around every day we were there, it was easy to walk out and pick up the overground to get in and around London. We would leave each morning and after touring around all day, looked forward to returning to the hotel each night. We especially want to thank Elodie Van Beveren and Milton for making our stay and first trip to the UK a really good experience. Elodie was very helpful, if we needed anything or had any questions she made sure we were taken care of. Milton was awesome! He was extremely helpful in either showing or giving us information on getting around or suggesting different places of interest to see in London.

From the Doorman at the Entrance to the personal check-in and out all was excellent. The Suites are outstanding, we really didn't want to leave. The Cocktails in the Bar are pricey but you get what you pay for, this is a very high-end Hotel. The only small gripe was that we were misled regarding the Parking situation, we were told by the Security within the Car Park that the Hotel would issue us with  ""An Exit Ticket"" for the Car Park, which is labelled as the Wyndham Grand Car Park, this was not the case. The Hotel would not give us a Ticket and we were charged £26 to leave the Car Park. The Hotel told us it would be £5, this is not the case so please be aware. All in all The Wyndham Grand is a Superb Hotel, the best at which we have stayed, we would love to go back but will research Parking Options before we return.",5,2013,10,01
122,Luxury Stay,"Stayed here as a gift from family for 60th birthday. The room, sorry suite, was nothing less than superb. Service great and had a really great nights sleep. If I had one comment it would be that the drinks were somewhat overpriced which I had expected, but not to the extent charged. The food was priced well I thought though.",5,2013,09,30
122,Just average for the price,"Corporate event and overnight stay.
Very average / below par food offering for both dinner and breakfast. Probably largely due to the selection made on our behalf, however, still fairly bland and unappetising. Perhaps linked to other reports of the kitchen standards.
Room - small suite, very comfortable facing to Imperial Wharf overgound tube but no problems at all with noise from outside or inside corridors. One of two tvs with flakey digital signal but again no great problem.
Checkin /checkout at seperate sit down desks is a sign of some class - though not the best system when there is a queue forming behind. 
I'd judge the location to be reasonably convenient - certainly not as big an issue as other reviews.",3,2013,09,30

122,Perfect Weekend Break,"After a hectic week, we eventually got to the hotel at 12.30am, where the staff and concierge were more than happy to help with all of our needs. 

Our luggage was brought to our rooms, the car was parked for us, champagne on chill on arrival (although saved that until the 2nd night), the room was perfect, room 418, overlooking the harbour, but maybe a room on 6th floor or higher would give better views of the river. 
Very clean, tidy and excellent room service. Beds are superb, so much so we missed breakfast on both mornings even if it is served until 12noon.

122,almost perfect honeymoon,"The suite was very quiet, the quality of the bed perfect, the view beautiful, especially in the evening, the staff friendly but not overfriendly, the food ordered by room service delicious.

122,Gorgeous hotel,Lucky enough to have stayed here for one night - wished it had been for longer. The bed was so comfy. The suite was large and spotlessly clean with a nice sized balcony over looking the harbour - very peaceful. The staff were friendly and highly efficient. The afternoon tea was to die for. The room service was speedy and delicious. Pricey yes but you get what you pay for.,5,2013,09,28
122,luxury off-site,"Very nice hotel, great breakfast (although no buffet) big spacious rooms with separate living and sleeping areas & 2 TVs, complimentary water etc. Location is a bit off but train station is right across the street.

We had some issues with the showers which took a while to resolve, however, the hotel went out of their way to compensate us for the inconvenience. If this hotel is in the area of the city that you want to be in then I would highly recommend it. ",4,2013,09,26

122,A wonderful stay in a (rare) suite in London," We stayed in a suite as a family, meaning we could all stay together, our four year old got his own sofa bed in the sitting room. Great location, on the river but walkable from NHM and the Science Museum. The room service breakfast was a bit small but never mind. A very comfortable stay. ",5,2013,09,25

122,A special occasion,"I had dinner in this hotel in December 2012 which was pretty good, large group dinners are normally quite average in my experience. 

Anyway, the review, we pulled up outside this quite swanky hotel in an upmarket setting of Chelsea Harbour. The doorman was a friendly chap and took the keys whilst we went in, booking in was easy and then to the lefts where the keys only allow access to your floor and other amenities. This is an all suite hotel and the rooms did not disappoint, a great view of the marina and a waiting bottle of Champagne from the manager with a card for our celebration - nice.

A big safe, a big 'mini bar', iron, couple of WCs, a great bathroom, huge bed and air con, the room was good. We were booked in for dinner that evening and I expected the place to be busy however there was only six tables in the restaurant in use. Our table directly overlooked the lit up marina, very nice view! 

Now I have to say this isnt a cheap place, but then again its a five star hotel in Central London so what do you expect? The restaurant is the same, the food was good quality but expensive - you pays your money and take your choice..

As a celebration and as a lover of Champagne we had a very good bottle which was with us almost straight away and ready chilled, perhaps they get through a lot of the stuff eh? What did I have, a melon starter with prosicutto - v-good. Then a t-bone steak med-rare with a cheese plate to follow, all great stuff. 

A wonderful bed, wife said she had never slept so well in a hotel bed! Breakfast came soon enough and I decided to be moderately healthy and have a smoked fish bagel breakfast consisting of three types of fish - I'm not sure how I stopped myself from having the full English.

Anyway, a fab place, all the staff were very good I just wish the restaurant had been a little busier for a 'buzz'. To recap, quite pricey but worth it for a blow out, a celebration or for many just somewhere to stay after watching Chelsea at home.",5,2013,09,22
122,Excellent service & rooms. I've stayed here several times ...,"Excellent service & rooms. I've stayed here several times & on the last visit was upgraded to a penthouse suite.......that was icing on the cake but this place has style, service & easily rates it's 5 star rating !!",5,2013,09,19
122,An excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Wyndham Saturday 14th September.  This is truly a fabulous hotel.
We upgraded on arrival to a harbour view room and were pleasantly surprised to
find it was a beautiful suite. The Spa and pool area are well worth a visit - we spent an hour in the pool before dinner in the bar.  Breakfast in the Brazzerie was truly sumptuous.   Yes it is a tad expensive but well worth it for a special occasion and the service from every member of staff we encountered was second to none.  This has got to be one of the best hotels we have stayed in - on a par with Claridges.   The only negative thing I would say is that is a bit awkward to get to but this is no fault of this great hotel.  ",5,2013,09,19
122,Touch of Class,"Stayed for my birthday & the hotel staff really made an effort. The hotel itself made us feel very special, and our suite was just sumptuous! We will definitely return, thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2013,09,19

122,40th Birthday Weekend,"The staff at the Wyndham hotel were excellent they managed to upgrade two of our rooms with a balcony and harbour view.  There was a birthday cake in our room and one for the evening meal this was a kind gesture by the staff.  At the evening meal they put out an extra large wine class to celebrate my birthday.  Excellent weekend!
",5,2013,09,15
122,Room service,This hotel has got to have the best room attendants ever! They came in twice a day just to refresh the room. Safe location right by the rail station so you can take the trains and underground to all the great places to visit while in London.,5,2013,09,14
122,SIMPLY THE BEST,"Fantastic Hotel in a Fantastic Location. Taxi ride required if you want Central London, great for the Kings Road Area. The rooms, sorry suites, are superb, better still if you are overlooking the Harbour or river, or both. Very small problem the first time we stayed here, not enough to put us off. The management went far beyond the norm to put things right, which made our second stay a dream. Many thanks to you and all your superb staff. Will see you again.",5,2013,09,12
122,"Delightful Hotel, Staff and Setting...","I only spent a single night in the hotel but it was a brilliant experience. The room was truly remarkable. From the moment I stepped into the hotel the service was second to none, the staff were polite, well informed and helpful, there was never a moment where I did not get the answer I needed to any query. The hotel is of pure luxury and the views give an excellent representation of London's stunning night line. I had meetings the following morning in the City and took the Clipper boat down to Monument which topped off a perfect stay. I would highly recommend staying as the accommodation food and links to London are of the highest quality.",5,2013,09,11

122,"Nice, but way too expensive","Nice hotel, but awkward location for the tube (from major rail stations/airports) and the fixtures and fittings were just too dated (even tatty in some cases) to justify the ludicrously high room rate.  Gym was small, but adequate.  Pool area nice.  Free wifi a nice touch.",3,2013,09,10
122,Highly recommended hotel,"My friend and I wanted a relaxing few days away in London and we couldn't have a chosen a nicer hotel. Our suite was of a very high standard, exceptionally comfortable and kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay. The location is superb with fantastic views of the harbour and river from our suite. Breakfast very good, even more so when able to sit on the terrace in the sunshine overlooking the harbour. Staff attentive, polite and friendly. The spa facilities where we enjoyed a couple of treatments were excellent as was the pool.
We would highly recommend this hotel and can't wait for a return visit.",5,2013,09,10
122,Great experience - roomy suite,"I stayed for a business conference for one night recently. The suite was clean and spacious (although some joker had set the a/c to 10 deg Celsius and therefore, on my arrival, it was rather like a fridge). The conference facilities were good and the buffet lunches were quite reasonable. Being ultra-picky, there are some details which could do with attention. The lock on the suite door, for example, was loose and needed a little jiggling in order to close the door. But such things aside, my stay was a pleasant one. Undeniably, it's in a great setting.",4,2013,09,10
122,Great weekend away,"I booked this hotel for my fiancees 30th birthday and I'm so glad I did. I had let them know before our stay that it was her birthday and when we were shown to our room the concierge wished her a happy birthday. We also got a free glass of champagne for lunch and upon returning to the room there was a decorative birthday cake waiting for her.
The suite was amazing as was the balcony view. The food is delicious, the staff are extremely friendly and the location is great. We will definitely be back! Thank you for making it a birthday to remember.

Trains close at hand and also Tesco, a food and convience store very close for pop, fruit, muffins etc. Lots of local restaurants that were very good and handy. Front desk staff helped out to send and receive faxes and went up and beyond their job discription to help us accomplish what was needed. I would stay there again if i return to London.

There was a lot of people near the hotel waiting around with cameras etc and I assumed someone famous was staying there, while checking in the entire chelsea football team was just leaving the hotel which was very nice being a big football fan :) so I obv got some pictures and said hello to frank lampard and he waved back and said hello :)
 we walked in to the hotel and started to check In with a very very nice man named galin! He made our stay even more enjoyable by how helpful and polite he was! He made us feel very important and stated ""if there is ANYTHING at all you need please do not hesitate to call on reception and we will make sure your wishes are granted!
He was a big part of our stay as we don't rate a hotel just on how nice it is but how the staff treat us and he was nothing but polite, courteous and very helpful.
We booked a king suite with a balcony with a view of Chelsea harbour and all of London which was amazing! 
 The rooms were very clean and the bed was one of the comfiest beds iv ever slept in!

After a day sightseeing in London it was a lovely to go back to such an elegant, luxurious oasis of calm... The rooms (suites) were spacious, comfortable and chic & it was lovely to have a balcony.

It is a little out of the way which I like because it is quiet, but if you want to go to the center of London it is just a short taxi ride away!

Our visit was for a birthday so we didnt get to fully experience everything the hotel had to offer, nevertheless we found a moment to enjoy the pool/spa- certainly worth a visit!  

Only complaint: the view- we overlooked a train station...This however really didnt affect our stay as everything else was so lovely.

The rooms are huge, and the description of all the rooms as suites is definitely true.
Very comfortable bed, with good linens, coffee machine, separate seating area. Beautiful bathroom with a large separate shower and bath and fluffy towels.
Although, the hotel isn't in central London, that is part of its appeal for me. Away from the hustle and bustle but quick and frequent train service. 10 minutes and you are in central London.
Plenty of good restaurants and pubs/bars within walking distance.
Price was very reasonable for the standard.",5,2013,07,28

My room was a large suite with a lot of nice amenities including a good coffee maker (normally the in-room stuff is yuck!)  Large bathroom with both tub and shower - nice bathrobes and comfy beds with lovely duvets.  Housekeeping also did a wonderful job and refused my tip each and every day but left the room spotless.  Food and drink was very expensive in the bar and restaurant so I would suggest venturing out into London (which as a tourist you likely will!)  Chelsea is a lovely neighborhood with lots to offer.  There is also a small cafe just down the stairs from the hotel with quick bites.  Tube stop is also just out the door.

122,Could have been so much better.....,"Fantastic location, impressive hotel.
The first issue was when my young lady arrived to join me, to be told that  was not there and also there was no reservation for me. 
Thank goodness for mobile phones.
Next it was that the final night of our 3-night stay needed to be paid for. The hotel, when I checked later had taken £100 more than they should have. Reason:To allow for incidentals as I was paying by debit card. Good idea, if they had explained that at the time.
In our suite we had 2 patio type sliding doors. Opening either was so difficult, my young lady hurt her back.
The shower leaked through to the carpet outside the bathroom.
When replacing the towels they kept replacing them with single towels for two people!
And lastly, even on the email to complete this, the spelling of my name was incorrect.
Apart from that the room was lovely, the bed very comfortable and the bed linen fantastic.The tv had to be seen to, as everyone was green.
In the summer heat having breakfast outside was great. Although, asking for anything seemed to take an age. It took around 20 minutes for some butter.",3,2013,07,22

Going to the bar for some cold drinks these were brought over to us  after a considerable wait. We kept waiting for our Tea which eventually  arrived.   Unfortunately the special diet teas  were well below expectations and only after a series of complaints was the situation settled not to everyone's  liking . We had almost finished the food when Tea/coffee was served !!!! had to ask for milk ???.

122,One Fabulous Night,"My husband and I booked this suite on Priceline on our last night in London.  This hotel was an excellent choice for our last night.  Staff were professional and helpful. The room was excellent.  I think we had a basic suite and we had a living room with bar separate from the bedroom.  There were lots of big windows to let in natural light.  We had lunch at the  Harbour Bar and, as others have reported, the service was quite slow.  When it arrived, the meal was good.  We used the pool and steam room and both were good.

122,Our 20th wedding anniversary,On our wedding night 20 years ago we stayed in one of the Penthouse suites. I decided that returning to the scene of the crime was a great way of celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary. The river view suite wasn't quite the penthouse but was perfect for the weekend. My only comment would be that the carpets looked a little tired. Other than that the room was very comfortable and clean and the service was exceptional. Wish we could do it more often.,4,2013,07,19

122,Incredible Hotel,"The Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour is a great 5 star hotel.  The accommodations are second to none, and the restaurant and bar are terrific.",5,2013,07,09
122,Slightly off track for rest of London,"First off its best to point out that as this is in Chelsea it is quite a trek for other sights of London. It is though very convenient for the Museum district.

We got a great deal for this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed out stay. The room was a suite with a fold down bed for our son in the lounge and a separate bedroom for ourselves.

Reception was clean, smart and manned by efficient staff. The location is really nice and cute to walk around. We walked to the museums each day. Lovely view down by the harbour.

No real tube stop nearby but the buses on the main road are regular and probably the recommended way of getting around. Up on the main road is a choice of really nice restaurants plus a couple of Tesco and Sainsbury express places if anyone wants to get some cheaper drinks or snacks to take back to the room. We typically ate out for lunch and then bought wine, bread and salami/cheese to enjoy at our leisure in our room.

The onsite brasserie looks nice, and was actually in the last series of Masterchef, but can be a bit pricey.",5,2013,07,09

Friendly , helpful staff. Milton was so helpful , it just makes your stay so much more pleasant.
The rooms are the most spacious rooms we have stayed in at a reasonable price.
The gym was the biggest and had the most equipment i have seen in a hotel gym in a long time.
Train station is a stone throw away.
Great restaurants are within walking distance.
We basically enjoyed all aspects of this hotel.",5,2013,06,24

122,3 days in London,"Generally an excellent hotel, very well run with excellent staff.
It is a little way from the center of London, which is both good and bad.

",5,2013,06,20
122,"Nice hotel, possibly for a family","We have stayed at a number of 5-star hotels and we are comparing the Wyndham to those so we may seem harsh only giving a 4 out of 5.  

The rooms are spacious with a separate sitting room & extra toilet and balcony.  The king-size bed is very comfortable, and the sofa bed is acceptably uncomfortable (are there comfortable ones ??!!) and suitable for two children or one adult.  The bathrooms are large with a separate shower and there was always good water pressure and hot water.  We could hear some noise from our neighbor, but not too bad, and because of the double door entry there is absolutely no corridor noise - nice.

The check-in is done at a table followed by a personal escort to the room, which we have enjoyed at other hotels.  Only problem we had was that Wyndham only had two staff on duty which is not enough to handle such a personalized service.  Add that to a long turnaround to two requests we had to housekeeping makes us think that staffing levels may be too low for a full house.  Having said that, we found the staff friendly and apologetic when things did not go quite right.

There have been lots of comments about the location of the Wyndham.  We booked through Hotwire and got a very good price so we did not expect to be in the thick of things.  We did wish that there were some small shops, pubs and restaurants in the immediate area, but it really is a new part of London, so I assume trade will improve as the UK economy improves.  It is a good location for business in West London and with a connection via the Overground at Imperial Wharf it is easy to reach Wimbledon, Kew Gardens and Hampton Court.  Instead of going through the Underground, we took the Overground direct to Kentish Town West and walked 10 minutes to Camden market - a very convenient journey.  However, for sightseeing in the city, we left the hotel in the morning and did not come back until after dinner.  It was a long day!

The Wyndham could be a great hotel for a family visit - with the nice big rooms, swimming pool, and safe location.  However, the breakfast is extremely expensive and we ended up popping out to the Tesco Express to buy breakfast pastries.  The Wyndham has a captive audience with a lack of breakfast alternatives - just bite the bullet and include breakfast in the tariff so then families will not think twice about the little extra commute into town.

In conclusion, if you are on vacation and you can find a hotel for the same price closer to the tourist destinations, take it.  If not, then The Wyndham is a very nice alternative - do not hesitate to book it.",4,2013,06,17
122,PERFECT London hotel!,"Having just returned for the second time from this hotel, I won't be looking any further for hotels when staying in London. It has everything, friendly attentive staff, modern comfortable suites, spa and fitness facilities. I had a lovely relaxing sleep followed by breakfast on the balcony reading the paper watching locals do their early morning jog/dog walking around Chelsea harbour. I can't stress enough how impressed I was by this hotel, most definitely the best I have stayed in, in the capital.
For those who enjoy shopping the shepherds bush Westfield is a couple of overground train stops away (the station is a 5 min walk away).",5,2013,06,16
122,really five-star suites!,"We decided to start our annual convention trip to Britain in a luxurious way and splurged by spending our first night in England here. As a Wyndam Rewards member we plundered our points account - but our short one-night stay at Chelsea Harbour was more than worth it!

This hotel deserves its five-star rating with no rooms, only suites. And we were given a real suite with a separate sitting room with balcony, and lots of neat extras: two doors to the bathroom/toilet tract, fresh fruit and water, an expresso machine,one flat screen television for each room, even plugs for German electric devices in addition to the normal UK plugs! The mattress was wonderful, the service attentive. 

Although the buffet was a bit hectic as buffets can be, we were especially pleased by the staff filling the platters only upon demand and enjoyed delicious fresh salmon while looking out onto Chelsea Harbour.

I don't understand other reviews here with complaints about the location: it's obvious Chelsea ain't Picadilly Circus, but there's the very convenient railway station Imperial Wharf just minutes by foot from the hotel - with excellent connections via London Overground to West Hamstead and a change then to St Pancras for example.

We would've loved to spend some time exploring the Chelsea area - the museum at the Royal Hospital, for example -  and did manage to have an exotic Thai dinner at the Blue Elephant near the hotel but had to leave the next day to continue our trip. 

Compared to other hotels we've stayed at in London, this was by far the best in all aspects and for the size and luxury of the suites actually reasonable even if we had to pay in pounds instead of in points. But as the charming Spanish reception manager told my husband, it's best to book in advance since the hotel is often full. So we'll be planning and booking early for our next trip.",5,2013,06,16

122,Spring Break,"Comfortable, modern hotel, a little off the beaten track in Chelsea Harbour, but handy for reasonably regular London Overground trains that connect to the underground.

We stayed in a Chelsea King Suite; this overlooked a garden, some flats and the London Overground station; some train noise, but basically not a problem. The suite was comfortable, well maintained and clean, with a substantial bathroom and separate toilet, spacious sitting room with sofa and desk, and comfortable bedroom with plenty storage. The espresso machine is a nice touch.

We breakfasted in the hotel; there was a small but good quality buffet (around £18), and a collection of cooked options, including a child's menu. We had dinner twice in the hotel, where the restaurant overlooks the harbour (alas, a bit chilly sitting out in May).  We enjoyed several fish dishes; in general the quality was good. The restaurant staff were friendly and attentive.

We used the pool once; it is a good size, and it is part of what seems like a pleasant spa area.  

Overall we enjoyed our stay (two adults and one child).  We eventually managed to stop the staff from changing the towels every day, but had one account issue where we were immediately chased for a payment of £6.50 we charged to the room because we had exceed our ""credit limit"" when we had paid for a five night stay on arrival not especially sensitive.",4,2013,06,13

122,Lovely room disappointing restaraunt,"I booked a River view room for one night as a special treat for my girlfriend. I opted to include dinner in the package. The room was fantastic, great view over the Thames, pretty much everything  I had hoped it would be. Unfortunately the dining experience was a disappointment. The food was alright but nothing special and the atmosphere was very informal. I commented at the time  that it felt like breakfast. A man sat next to us was in jeans and a scruffy t shirt, the lighting was too bright and I had to explain to the waiter that dinner was already catered for. The whole experience was not special in any way and the restaurant lacked atmosphere. A young couple opposite us spent the entire evening pawing at each other with no intervention from the staff. 
I don't expect everyone to have to wear DJ's and ball gowns, quite the opposite. I rarely wear a suit. But if they want to allow pretty much anything to be worn they should make this clear because we would have had dinner elsewhere. It was meant to be a special night...it wasn't.",3,2013,06,10

You can always ask for the other bar menu if you are sitting outside. 
The room was fantastic. Very spacious and had a seperate living room. Both rooms had a TV. The bedroom had a docking station and the living room had a cd/dvd player.
Great coffee and tea making facilities in the room and plenty of complimentary water.
The bathroom was lovely and clean and spacious with a seperate toilet. Lots of complimentary toiletries and a big pile of fresh towels not just one or two per person. There was also a great rain shower.
Room service came into our room while we are out to close our black out blinds and turn down the beds which was nice.
Check in is a good time - midday. Lovely breakfast downstairs. Everything you wanted they had and was a great quality.
I would love to go back with my partner as the hotel is in a lovely location looking over the marina and a short walk from the Kings Road.

122,"Boring, dull and lazy","As a hard working royal marine returning from Afghanistan I felt I was entitled to a small amount of luxury. From within the first hour of being there I soon realised this wasn't going to be the case. The concierge failed to bring the bags up to the room for over an hour, not allowing me to shower and change. I don't know if this was due to the lack of a tip upon walking through the hotel main entrance but I'm not about to tip someone who's doing absolutely nothing for our country or economy. The room was fairly clean with only the one large dead insect on the window sill in the living room, must of just been a busy day and regrettably missed it due to being so over worked.

122,"Great, but...","One’s opinion about a hotel is very subjective and biased by her opinions, life style, budget, reason for travel, etc. I’ll try to be as fair as possible and make this review helpful for my fellow travelers. 

Pros:
-	I bought this through Hotwire. Unbeatable price, incredible value for $$.
-	It is a real 5*. It is not in the league of Lanesborough, Savoy and Four Seasons, but it’s much better than Le Meridien, Hiltons, Sheratons, Intercontinental and Marriott’s. It means that it’s very clean, you get 2 services per day, there is a complementary  espresso machine in the room.  Great Service
-	All-suite hotel.no need to request an upgrade, you will get a suite anyways. Te decoration is fairly simple, and the bathroom is not of expensive marble (who cares really? You’re not taking the marble with you!), but very functional. 
-	 Nice products in the bathroom. Shower control was electronic (never seen that before!)
-	Didn’t use the Spa, but the menu was very appealing and it looked affordable.
-	Free internet, if you become a member to their loyalty program, which is free. They just want your name. 

Cons:
-	It’s really out of the way. There is no tube station nearby, and you have to take a bus to get there. It took me 45 minutes to go to Mayfair. If you need to go places, or come back to the hotel in between meetings, it’s not for you. If you just need to sleep and not go out, it’s perfect. 
-	Very disappointed with the restaurant, but it might have been an isolated incident. They advertise their sushi bar, and on paper it looked really good. It turned out to be fastfood taken out from a store, and presented in a nice plate for 3x the $$. The waiter actually admitted to that. It’s like ordering a burger and they would run to the McDonald’s and serve you a Big Mac on a nice plate! To their credit, I complained and they took it off my bill. So if you eat at the restaurant (your only option if you don’t want to go far), don’t order sushi. 
-	The place is remote, so no hanging out at the bar or anything like that. It might be pretty dead. 

Altogether, it was unbeatable value for money, and it worked out very well for me. 
I usually need to go places and be back to my hotel between meetings. So I don’t think this will become my favorite hotel in London. My favorite hotel is the Lanesborough, but it also costs more.",5,2013,05,30
122,"Nearly a fantastic hotel, but just falls short on service.","Spent the bank holiday weekend at the Wyndham Grand and the hotel itself is fantastic, lovely rooms, great food, excellent pool and spa, but it just lacked a little first class service that would give it the excellent rating.

On a couple of occasions service wasn't up to par, in the first place we popped into the bar for some lunch, and the service was slow, in fact whilst it was meant to be table service we had to go to the bar to order, and then follow up to chase the drinks.  The staff where serving people walking up to the bar, as opposed to clearing orders as well, not great.  Food itself was first class however.

Finally checking out was an issue, we had pre paid for breakfasts which is recommended, however the gent checking us out, had to call assistance to sort this out, as he was charging us for breakfast, and then when instructed still had to refund the difference as he managed to put the full amount on the card somehow???

On arrival however we were told that we just about had time to unload our luggage otherwise we would get a ticket and and ushered to a local NCP car park were parking was far cheaper.When you go to 5 star complex in Chelsea Harbour these Doorman should be told you are not seeking Cheap you are looking for 5 Star Service.The outside of the Hotel was spoilt by cigarette smoking Chauffeurs engulfing the entrance .
Everything else once you were inside was superb .

The nearest over ground was Imperial Wharf which took us to West Brompton tube (one stop).  We parked from Saturday approx. 10 to Sunday approx. mid day at the car park closest to the hotel.  There are stairs from the car park to just outside the hotel main doors.  The price was £25.  Very good we thought for safe and secure parking.  We had drinks in the bar early evening which was very pleasant over looking that harbour although very expensive.  Our room was a suite which was made up on our return in the evening to be a sofa bed for the kids and in the adjoining room a huge bed for us.  Both rooms had TV.  2 x WC, and bath and separate shower.  Very clean and very comfortable.  We had views through the building cranes to the London Eye.  Breakfast was superb and afterwards we went to the spa for a swim.  Literally only take your swimmers as you are provided robes/slippers and towels.  The Spa was hosted by a lovely lady called Danielle who was a pleasure to deal with.  The pool and changing rooms were spotless.  A lovely hotel, exciting for the kids to travel the network in and out of London for our museum visit and supper in Covent Garden in the evening.  We got a taxi back to the hotel from The Strand to Chelsea Harbour and that was £24.",5,2013,05,22
122,Birthday treat,"My husband treated me for my birthday, we are great chelsea fans and came up to see the last game of the season, the suite was fantastic over looking the harbour, a cake was put in the suite which was a lovely touch, the only gripe I have is there was no coffee machine I did ask twice and was told it would be put there but never arrived, however that never spoilt our stay, to make our stay even more perfect we saw  Victor Moses and Nathan Aki at the hotel (both Chelsea players) so that made the stay even more special, would we return definitely yes, we will be back as soon as we can. Stella Ryan Chichester West Sussex.",5,2013,05,20
122,Pleasant stay but not really family friendly,"We enjoyed our stay and the service was excellent however the use of the hotel facilities was not children friendly which they found very frustrating!!!
Nevertheless we would stay there again especially if the pool was more accessible to the children.",4,2013,05,20
122,luxury suites with nice marina view,"our suite was end corner on the 2nd floor. nice view from the bedroom and living room. room fixtures are luxurious. standing shower as well as a tub. thick towels, slippers were provided and changed every other day. free shoe shine/newspaper delivered to ur room. very spacious. i could have given them 5 star but, the wifi is not free (25 pounds for 24hours) and the service in the restaurant (breakfast area) is kinda slow and food is ok.  if u want to have a drink, sit by the bar and you'll get a quicker service. there's no front desk to check-in and out. which is great! u have to sit with one of the staff by the lobby and same staff will bring you to ur room. nice touch! there's also a free delicious juice by the concierge area that's different everyday. we stayed in this area because we're visiting some relatives at Benham house which is 5 mins slow walk. great location! the bed mattress is soft for me but, my husband likes it.  free mineral water everyday and espresso coffee machine with free mineral water. they have turn down service and towels are being replenish every evening too. i would stay here again!",4,2013,05,19
122,Great for weekend,"Really enjoyed this hotel. The location is great for the Kings Road and some nice areas to walk around.  The best feature of the Wyndham are the rooms (actually suites) which are spacious and quite luxurious. Great facilities in-room and out - good quality and quantity of coffee, tea and toiletries.The gym and pool are excellent by hotel standards and the lobby and bar very comfortable for lounging around. I found the staff very professional and helpful, i thought they struck the right balance - always available and friendly, but never in your face. Can't really comment on the restaurants as I only sampled a dessert in the hotel as we wanted to dine out, but what we had (a pear cheescake) was rather good, so I'd definately try a lunch or dinner next time. Breakfast can be booked in advance at discounted rate which is a good option, although we visited the legendary Mona Lisa cafe nearby which does a great full English!",5,2013,05,18

122,This is now our favourite hotel in London after having...,This is now our favourite hotel in London after having stayed in other 5* establishments.  Lovely surprise was the welcoming bottle of champagne and strawberries which certainly got our celebratory weekend off to a good start.,5,2013,05,17
122,Fantastic Rooms- True suites,"The rooms in this hotel are true suites. A separate living room and a large bedroom. Both rooms have TVs. There is a little iPod dock in the bedroom that allows you to listen to your music but it would not charge my phone. Bathroom has a Bathtub and a separate shower closet. The only thing was that that the shower in the shower closet would give warm water at all. The restaurant serves a very nice breakfast (expensive though @ 23 pounds for an English Breakfast). The location does seem a bit in the middle of nowhere but actually it has fantastic connection to the Westfield Mall at Shepherd's Bush. The Imperial Wharf station is barely 100 meters away (you have to go through the car park).

A nice touch is a simple to operate espesso machine in the room that make a very good cup of coffee.",4,2013,05,16
122,a nice plase to stay,"FAB  ROOMS , NICE STAFF. TOP DOORMAN ,good food,  the only thing they could work on is the price in the bar

122,London overnight Break,"Just one stop from Clapham Junction to Imperial Wharf and a 5 minute walk to the Chelsea Harbour and the Hotel.    As soon as you arrived at the Hotel the staff were taking control of your bags and booking you in and you felt very looked after.   We had booked a suite for one night of luxury and it was beautiful with every amenity and a balcony overlooking the marina.  We swam in the beautiful pool and had previously booked massages which were wonderful.  We ate in the Brasserie and the food was amazing.  The breakfast was expensive but there was a wonderful
menu to choose from and it was worth every penny.   We would deffinitely go back to this Hotel.",5,2013,05,16
122,Weekend Away,"Lovely hotel but didn't quite feel 5*, stayed here in April as we always wanted to go along the Kings Road, Chelsea, on more than occasion, although there were more than one doorman to open doors it was quicker to open it ourselves as they were either texting or wandering about outside (that sounds abit harsh as they were very pleasant), the other thing that let it down was although all en-suite rooms, the lounge area of our room looked abit tired plus no teaspoons to stir your tea. The hotel as a whole is in an excellent position and checking in and out was very good, a member of staff escorted us to our room explaining how everything worked so as a whole the hotel just needs a few more improvements.",4,2013,05,15
122,nothing wrong but..,Great hotel with great staff but it was just all a bit bland...the hotel is also quite a long way out of central London so the taxi bills mount up!,3,2013,05,15
122,not as described,"I booked a balcony room looking over the harbour and we did not get that it was supposed to be bed and breakfast this was not right as we got charged for it this was our engagement night and was nit as special as I was kead to believe by your booking staff when I complained I was fobbed off with excuses
      ",1,2013,05,14
122,Wifi would have been nice...,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights (Fr/Sat). Chosen really for it's location (near to Battersea for the Moonwalk).  
The Hotel is very luxurious, clean and welcoming,  Bar prices are high, but what you'd expect for a hotel of this standard and location.  The food we had was delicious and reasonably priced.  The room (suite) was lovely, very spacious even with the sofa bed in use in the lounge, 2 toilets, amazing rainforest shower and separate tub, double sink in the bathroom and lovely toiletries.  The king bed was extremely comfortable and the high thread count sheets felt amazing. The only disappointment was that having signed up to the Wyndham Rewards programme to get free wifi - there was no signal in our room!
Would recommend but not stay again unless needed to be in the Chelsea area as a little too far out from Central London.",4,2013,05,13
122,Our One year wedding Anniversary not worth the money.,"My husband and myself spent our one year wedding anniversary at the hotel Saturday 11th may-12th spent a lot more money than usual for a nights stay in the hotel however I feel it was not worth the money. I work in a 5* hotel myself and I would say the hotel was lovely but there are improvements to be made. Firstly the reason for booking this hotel was we live in west London we didn't want to travel to far and wanted to stay where there was a spa. We booked a spabreak which included dinner, breakfast and a spa treatment..... Me and my husband both had a 30minute back Neck and shoulder massage in the couples Room which was nice to be together my husband had never had a treatment and it was a surprise for him so it was special however the room was very small and lighting throughout the treatment was to bright and not dimmed at any time. The treatment its self was lovely and my therapist done a very good treatment using her elbows and helping to remove any tension with a firm pressure my husbands therapist seemed to do less treatment time by only a couple of small seconds but she did take her hands off him to get more oil which should have been 30 minutes hands on treatment  time.When we went to the Spa on the Sunday we got in the spa area at 11.05 and left by 11.55 as when we went into the spa there was ample children no chairs available to sit as all seating was covered with towels although no one was actually sitting on them. We went into the water for about 20minutes but shortly after left as the children were jumping into the pool, sliding off the water jets so you couldn't even stand under them after we left me and my husband went in the separate sauna which was in the Changing rooms so we were still not spending alone time together. I asked a Lady Daniella Letini if there were children's swim times and she said unfortunately not but the children are in the pool with their dads as the women had all the fine a cancer charity run and should be checking out shortly, I then asked if any treatments were available to try and rekindle the romantic atmosphere however she said they were fully booked so we showered and met back at reception. Daniella was on reception and was very helpful when I asked for the managers details however when I stated that I also worked in a hotel and children's times usually work she said we a have swimming lesson during the week but at weekends we cater more for families which is no good to us as we left our 4 year old daughter at home to celebrate. We spent more time in the bar than anywhere else in the hotel costing us more money for drinks plus the service charge they continently added on. At know time during the stay did anyone show us around the hotel or tells us that service charge is optional however it is but you feel obliged to have to pay. We paid service charge of £6.00 to bar staff on a £50.00 food bill when we had lunch in the bar which was just a club sandwhich and a burger. The staff in the bar though we're extremely helpful Anohea Bonsos and Ivett Kelmen they made a bubblegum cocktail for me costing £14.00 however when it arrived and it was not to my liking they took it away and removed it from my bill with no prompting which was very nice of them. I liked the way how one member of staff in the restaurant brought us a cake with happy 1st anniversary written on the plate with chocolate to us  with our dinner on the saturday I didn't get her name but she was also very nice and served us well. I feel that our stay at the Wyndham Hotel was not special and we were just a number to them as we were not greeted as mr and mrs Loveridge and always needed to promote to staff to our existence. We asked for a late check out on the Sunday as we wanted to make the most of the Sunday as well however when leaving our room to go for breakfast we had a checkout letter under our door and a invoice although we had paid for everything we had during our stay cash when presented with our bill. I wouldn't return unless contacted with a solution from the DM of the hotel as I feel for what I paid the customer service was just not there apart from the few staff mentioned. We arrived, we paid and we left feeling very unspecial and unnoticed. In the way in and out the doorman although present didn't open the door for us once during our stay people looked at us as so we shouldn't be there and as so we don't fit in as the clientele is for the older generation and not 25-30 year olds. I brought an umbrella for £10.00 cash as a souvenir for remembrance of our first anniversary however this is all I'm taking away with me from this experience.  :-(",3,2013,05,12

122,Our wedding anniversary stay,"We always stay at the Chelsea Harbour Wyndham every year for our wedding anniversary and have been staying there for over 15 years, as always the staff were really helpful and made our stay special. 
A special thank you to Piotr Rychlicki who made our stay even more memorable this year.",5,2013,05,11
122,"Fantastic, you will not be dissaponted...","Myself and my husband and children aged 11 and 7 have just returned from the hotel.
We have stayed in many hotels in London and this is by far the best we have stayed in.

Rooms immaculate, porters and front door staff very friendly and helpful they could not do enough to help you especially porter called Paul who was lovely with the children too.  It was my husband's birthday and  I emailed the hotel ahead of our stay and they left out a cake personalised alacarte style with happy birthday handwritten which was lovely suprise for him when we arrived.   

All the complimentary bathroom toiletries were of very high quality and the complimentary tea and coffee in room. 

The only downside were the staff in the spa area were not very welcoming and were a little bit rude and didn't really explain what we needed to do as you have to access a lift and get signed in  at the beauty spa/gymn area and then they escort you in a lift to the pool. 

The pool was lovely they have spa and steam rooms, didn't use the beauty salon.
They do leave you a £10 of treatments voucher in the room on arrival.

The only area for improvement would be they should offer a restaurant discount to those staying in the hotels,  and other reviews are correct that prices are very steep for any extras £3.50 for a can of coke in the mini bar when there is a Tesco express 3 mins walk away is  bit much.   So we were careful not to incurr extra charges, and this put us off eating at the hotel restaurant too.   

We brought our own champagne gin etc and would advise  others without unlimited pockets to do the same as the mini bar prices were steep.

Again perhaps some vouchers for some cocktail deals in the bar would encourage more hotel patronige at the Bar/Restaurant as these areas and the menus looked lovely but were not very busy for a bank holiday weekend and considering the amount of guests at the hotel. 

Although I didn't really understand previous comments that you need mortgage for a coffee as there are very good coffee machines in the room and fresh tea in silk bags that are included in the price of the stay.

We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as we felt £25 a head for breakfast was steep so we had brunch at Pret for £25 for the whole family instead.

The kids brought DVD's to watch in the evening and the staff brought one in and set one up free of charge. 

We visited the Thai Blue Elephant near by fwalking distance for dinner not cheap but the best Thai we have had in a long time.   We also had a good lunch at Marco Pierre White Steak house in Chelsea , and ordered brick cooked pizza in to the room one of the evening's from a company we found online locally called Fireazza which was reasonable and very delicious. 

Overall as long as I could get a decent room rate we paid £210 a night booked on laterooms I would not stay anywhere else when visiting London again, there really was nothing to complain about and I would say I am very fussy. 

Would go as far as to say this is the best UK hotel I have stayed in. 

As with the parking if you time it right you can get free off road parking over the weekend as long you leave before 7am on the Monday (if not a bank holiday) we paid £5 to park from Saturday afternoon to Bank Holiday Monday you just need to be savvy about the parking and do your research. 

The area is very scenic you don't feel you are in London but you are a short  overground train and then a tube ride away from all the attractions.",5,2013,05,09

All the staff I interacted with were excellent and very helpful.   it started from check in, to the housekeeping staff to check out.  Everyone was extremely professional and polite.   The restaurant on site was yummy.    I was also not disappointed with room service.  The bed was heavenly.  It was so comfortable that I missed it when I returned home.  Bathroom was modern and wonderful water pressure.  I was surprised by how big the room and bathroom was.  Everything was immaculate.  I enjoyed the fruit in the room as well.  

Its a great location as well.  Easy to get to all the major sites in London.",5,2013,04,26

I shared a room with 2 friends and there was enough space for all 3 of us. The rooms were kept tidy, the bath room was massive you could live in it.
We were there for 2 nights and i will recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2013,04,26
122,Lovely Hotel - Great staff,"We took our 10 year old grand-daughter to London for the week-end for a birthday treat and are very pleased we stayed here. The welcoming, check-in and reception staff were really friendly and professional and the lovely concierge gave us very good advice on getting around to the the things we had planned for the week-end. 

Our Chelsea suite on the 6th floor felt really spacious, with a little hallway leading into all of the rooms. Ours also had a balcony (they don't all, so it's worth asking for one that does) and as the weather was warm for our week-end it was good to be able to sit outside and enjoy a drink. 

The suite had everything we needed, our grand-daughter had a large comfortable sofa-bed in the lounge which was made up for her at 'turn-down' time and her own toilet if she needed it. The kettle and espresso machine were welcome, the toiletries very nice and the robes useful.

We didn't eat in the hotel - we wanted to be out and about as much as possible - the close proximity of the King's Road and easy transport links made getting about very straightforward. We didn't use the spa either, but would plan to include doing that if (I'd like to think ""when"") we can go back to stay there again.

There are deals to be found to stay here, and we felt it was well worth the price we paid.",5,2013,04,25
122,Fabulous hotel in great location,"We booked multiple rooms for a family gathering recently - age range of guests was 4-80 years and i can safely say that EVERYONE loved it.  The rooms are beautiful, spacious and well appointed and we cannot speak highly enough of the staff who were, at all times, friendly, courteous and very attentive to detail.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and they went out of their way to comfortably accommodate our large group in the bar and over breakfast each morning.  Breakfast itself was also beautifully presented with a wide selection of continental and cooked and tasted delicious.  Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for any reason and we will certainly be booking again.",5,2013,04,25
122,WYNDHAM GRAND,"My daughter and I have stayed here twice in the past 4 months.  Fantastic Hotel.  Very friendly and accommodating staff.  Big Rooms, very comfortable rooms, fantastic amenities.  Close to  shops, public transport, parks, restaurants. Great views, afternoon walks on the river walkway, with a glass of wine overlooking the harbour to finish the day.  I would highly recommend .",5,2013,04,25
122,Spacious suites,"We stayed 5 nights in a 4th floor suite with a Chelsea view. The hotel is convenient to the overground Imperial Wharf station. It's walking distance to Kings Road restaurants, Fulham Broadway tube station and the Thames Path. We really enjoyed our stay. The suite was a little over-heated but that was solved by leaving the windows open. The espresso machine in our room and the personalised check-in were touches we appreciated. It's unusual to find exceptionally spacious, quiet and comfortable rooms at a reasonable price in London. Facilities are 5-star but we dined out for all meals. The downstairs pool area looked excellent. I was concerned about the location initially however once we arrived it wasn't a problem to navigate London from Chelsea Harbour.",5,2013,04,23
122,Brilliant hotel in a good location in London,"Stayed at the hotel for a boys weekend away. As soon as you walk in you can see that you are in a classy hotel. We were taken to the room and were pleasantly surprised to find that all the rooms are suites. Huge bathroom with superb shower, excellent living room and bedroom. In general a huge room for the price that we paid. We thought we had won the lottery. It also seems that the hotel is no stranger to several of the pro footballers. Plenty of supercars floating about outside for us to gawk at! 
The spa facilities are also pretty good. A steam room and sauna in the changing room and a nice warm pool available.
The restaurant serves up some good food but at a price. I wouldn't want to spend the weekend here dining etc as I am sure you could rack up a bill. Breakfast was extremely expensive also.
In general this was an excellent base to visit London as it was only a short taxi journey to most places and the tube station is right next door. Superb weekend here and would come back again in a second!",4,2013,04,22
122,Fantastic stay!!,"The suites at this hotel are amazing. Everything you can ask for and more. Stayed on a few occasions now & all staff are so friendly & nothing is too much trouble. The cocktails here are also to die for.. But expect london hotel prices!

122,Best kept secret,We stayed for our honeymoon. The room was superb and the staff were very polite. Service at breakfast was a bit slow but overall hard to fault the hotel.

122,Excellent Hotel on Family trip,"Stayed here with wife and 2 kids (5 & 6 years).
The staff were all very friendly and happy. 
Hotel room and bathroom were very clean. Kids loved the swimming pool, again the pool and changing rooms were impeccably clean. 
Family room was perfect for our stay as kids were in the separate living room on sofa bed and they had their own toilet facilities. 
The whole place had the look and feel of a 5 star hotel. 
Would definitely stay here again :-)",5,2013,04,17
122,Splendid stay,"The hotel was all I hoped it will be. Highly professional and warm staff. Clean and modern ambience. There is absolutely nothing bad to say.

Pls do keep service standard up. Thanks for a wonderful experience at your Hotel. We will definately come to stay again!",5,2013,04,16
122,A great experience,"Overall we really enjoyed our overnight stay at the Wyndham Chelsea Harbour. Check-in was efficient, our room clean and lovely and the dinner in the restaurant very romantic.  If I have a minor comment, it would be that you have to be clear what happens at breakfast - they offer an ""at table"" service but seem to assume (without telling you) that you will also get your own toast and other things from the buffet.  We were left without food etc because of this.  BAD!!  Otherwise (but the little things do matter), a lovely time.",4,2013,04,16
122,5 star treatment in a fabulous hotel,"I booked this 'all-suite' hotel for a special Birthday treat and I was not disappointed.  I never experienced such attention in a hotel from the personal check-in (brought to your room and facilities pointed out) to staff checking that everything was allright.  The suite was beautiful and so comfortable.  I paid extra for a room with a view of the marina and it was well worth it - so quiet you wouldn't think you were in London at all.  If you like peace and quiet, this is the place for you (this was really brought home to me when we went into the centre of London to see a show - the noise and crowds of people really hit you then).

The breakfasts were lovely - ordered, freshly made, beautifully presented and served to you at your table.

Room service was like no other I have ever experienced with a beautifully dressed table wheeled into our suite with a heated compartment underneath to keep the food hot.  The extra touches of the white linen table cloth and a flower in the centre of the table showed the extent of the detail, which made it all the more special.

The turn-down service at night also replenished water and anything else you needed, so you never ran out of anything.

The hotel's chauffeur service was always available and we used it when we were in a hurry and a taxi wasn't outside, with the price difference only being a few pounds.  The concierge were very friendly and helpful - a special thank you to Milton who couldn't have been nicer.  One day we were going somewhere, which was in walking distance of the hotel, but as my Mother is in her eighties and wouldn't have been able for the walk, he insisted on dropping us in the hotel car.  All of these little touches made the difference.

As it is a 5 star hotel, it's not cheap, but I really wouldn't like to stay anywhere else now so thank you everyone for making our stay and my big Birthday year so special!",5,2013,04,15
122,Overall experience,"Upon arrival at the Wyndham Grand we found the staff very helpful and our room was lovely, which was a small suite, the bed was very large and extremely comfortable. There was a slight problem with the air conditioning as it didn't work properly in the bedroom. I had to call reception for a choice of tea, as there was only English breakfast in the room. 
Bar staff were very attentive, however the drinks are very expensive and they do charge you extra for serving your drinks. The restaurant is what lets this hotel down, its very average, and i had to send my main course back as it was cold, and the potatoes looked like they had been frozen or from a tin,. Having said that breakfast was served until 12.00 noon and it was lovely. 
We used the spa and had a treatment, the pool is good, there isnt a jacuzzi unless you're staying in the penthouse and they forgot our treatments even though we had checked in at the spa area. The relaxation area for the treatments is lovely. 
When it came to checking out they tried to charge an extra £12.00 as I bought an item from their shop and charged it to my room, no one made me aware that there was a charge for adding items purchased from the shop to your room. When i queried it they removed it from the bill. Would i stay here again... possibly, I wouldn't bother with the restaurant.",3,2013,04,15

122,16th birthday celebration,"For my son's 16th birthday he chose the Wyndham Grand Hotel as he had been there before.  I was pleasantly surprised during my stay.  It was an expensive stay for a family of four but it was lovely to taste the finer things. We could have had a holiday abroad for a week compared to what we paid for a two night stay at the Wyndham Grand!! The staff are very friendly and polite, the chambermaids were excellent and overall a very enjoyable stay but rather pricey.  I will return but no plans at present. I'm aware that any accommodation in London is pricey and this is the going rate  you wont be disappointed.",5,2013,04,14

122,Perfect London Getaway,"My family and I booked two suites for a 10 day London stay at the Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbor the first part of April.  The service was excellent, the staff friendly and attentive to all of our needs, and after just a few days were calling us all by name.  Very professional and courteous.  All of the rooms are suites so you get a great price/value for your London hotel rooms.   It was exceptionally clean, turndown service a delight, and the nightly shoe shine was wonderful.  Oh and the view is spectacular with Chelsea Harbor and the Thames right next to it.   it was a very calming stay in a city of hustle and bustle.   We cannot wait to go back to London and stay here again.

Tip:  get your currency exchange at the hotel for the best rates with no commissions.",5,2013,04,11

122,Lovely Easter at the Wyndham 2013,"Stayed at the Wyndham over easter with my husband and two young children. We had a fabulous time .ALL The staff are amazing and they are so attentive.they are also great fun with children. Thank-you to all the staff for giving us a great holiday at the Wyndham.

We booked room only, as trip advisor reviews on the breakfasts were not good. This is so untrue. The breakfasts are out of this world! We have stayed in numerous hotels, and breakfast at the Wyndham were definitely the best. Fabulous exotic fruits, real honeycomb honey, amazing home baked breads and a wide and delicious range of hot food breakfasts, served to your table. The coffee was perfect. My husband loved his choice of American style breakfast with sirloin steak! A big big thank-you to all the breakfast staff for your great service for the week of our stay
.
Also the rooms are so comfortable and spacious-great for families.we stayed for 6 nights and the rooms were kept so clean and lovely to come back to after a busy day sightseeing.Thank-you to housekeeping.
 Great swimming pool too.
We look forward to going back soon.",5,2013,04,10

122,Excellent Hotel,"The Wyndham Chelsea Harbour is an excellent hotel with very friendly staff and great facilities. The children loved the pool. We had a fancy coffee machine in our apartments.
All apartments consist of two room with a nice sofa and desk.
It is a bit off the centre but there Imperial Wharf Stn is very nearby and there are busses to the West End and Green Park with stops at several tube stations. In general it should be possible to reach most destinations in Central London within 30 mins. Have a look at the TfL homepage before you leave. Parking is a bit of a problem though and not particularly cheap in this area. You can have a look at en.parkopedia.co.uk (or http://www.findfreeparking.co.uk if parking in Wandsworth is an option for you).
We had two apartments with a connecting door. Ask for it if you need it.",5,2013,04,08
122,Nice hotel :) customer service:(,"Stayed for 3 nights 4/4/13 with the grandkids, we looked the reviews for London hotels and opted for the Wyndham,called prior to arrival for a room in a quieter area of the hotel which was met, on arrival on Thursday we were taken by surprise as the Chelsea football team were leaving for their match,outside was very cold ,on return on the Friday my wife fancied a soak in a hot bath as we had a long day and it was cold, but no hot water! called to report it at about 9.00pm,told them room 305, no one showed , up at 8am on Saturday morning heard dripping coming from the toilet and water was dripping from the ceiling above the bath ! we had breakfast and went out ,on returning later that day the leak had been fixed but still no hot water for a bath ? all other sources had hot water shower etc, did,nt bother calling again as i thought they know they have a problem ? ( as 2 previous reviews in March state)on check out i was asked if we had enjoyed our stay and i answered yes, but told them about the water problem and it came across as they did not know anything about it !! As i said to the concierge a sign of good customer service is keeping the customer up to date,even a call back to explain the situation is better than nothing , some times feels like you have paid your cash hard lines !! the concierge did remove a kids movie at a cost of £10.00 from our bill , but does it really need to get to that stage? yes nice hotel ,would we stay again YES do they need to improve the quality of customer service you would expect in a 5 star establishment YES.",4,2013,04,08
122,Lovely stay in Chelsea,"We stayed one night at the Wyndham Grand and really enjoyed our short time at the hotel.  The suite was large (good sized bedroom and sitting room, large bathroom and two WC's) comfortable, very quiet and spotlessly clean. There was a lovely balcony overlooking the harbour - it was a shame it was too cold to really enjoy it!  We both slept really well in the comfortable bed.

On arrival, the door staff and check in were very helpful indeed.

In the evening we visited the bar, which is a great area to relax and the prices are not too bad compared to other hotels in the area.

Breakfast was excellent with a good choice on the tasting table and then English Breakfast and Omelette cooked to order.

We will definitely stay at the Wyndham Grand again.",5,2013,04,08

122,Stunning as always,"GREAT STAY, fab room the best yet. Just wish the room maids were as good. We stayed for three nights this time, no body wash - had to call down for it. No slippers put out after the first night, no glasses that were used removed just left in the room for the three days!!  We asked for a late check out as were were off to an early kick off football game and was told it would cost me an extra £20.00 per hour - not impressed, it would of been so nice as a regular customer to have had this option without a charge.  I opted to leave the bags with the concierge instead. No bathroom floor mats left on one night so had to take great care on the marble floor.",5,2013,04,05
122,Fabulous hotel for a family trip.,"We have just returned home from a 4 night Easter stay at this hotel. We had a suite for our family (2 adults and 12 yr d twins) which consisted of a large bedroom and fantastic bathroom plus a small hall and separate toilet and a living area with sofa bed. TV's in both rooms. We have stayed in many hotels in central London with our children, usually in Kensington area. This was definitely the best so far and far exceeded our expectations. Rooms cleaned daily. Turndown service if required. Fresh water delivered daily to room. Free Times newspaper. Coffee sachets for great coffee machine in the room refilled daily. 
The hotel is situated next to Imperial Wharf station which was great for links into city centre. Lots of others seemed to take taxis from the hotel but we were trying to save budget for eating out!

We walked to the King's road to eat every evening. Had lovely meals at Bluebird, Byron burger restaurant ( bit of celeb spotting in both), My old Dutch pancake restaurant and a nice Italian called Made in Italy.

Great swimming pool and sauna/steam at the hotel. Had drink in bar which very nice. Didn't eat in the restaurant during our visit as keen to try other places.
Bumped into the Chelsea football team there Sun evening which quite funny as my other half is a Manchester United fan!

Would definitely recommend this hotel and all the staff.",5,2013,04,02
122,PERFECT HOTEL,"We stayed at this hotel for my son's 11th birthday as it was close to Stamford Bridge (we were taking him to watch his first football match).  We have stayed in many hotels and this one is amongst the best we have stayed in.  We were greeted by Frank on arrival who arranged to valet park our car, such a friendly welcoming gentlemen, when we entered the hotel we met Milton who my son took an instant shine too due to his friendly welcome (and the fact that he loved Chelsea FC too lol), Milton organised for a birthday cake to be in our room when we checked in, little gestures like this mean a lot to us and we were so impressed. The room was fabulous, very clean, spacious and comfortable, the kids loved it. The hotel bar make excellent cocktails!!
I couldn't fault the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff, we will definately be returning soon, thank you to every one who made my son's birthday his best ever for all of us!!",5,2013,04,02

122,Romantic weekend,"My husband and I chose the Wyndham Grand because it was close to a friend's 50th party venue.  Coincidently we were also celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and we were surprised and delighted to find a bottle of champagne in our room on arrival - thank you again!
We had a very relaxing two night stay in a river view king suite.  The room was very comfortable but it was rather noisy because of poor sealing of the sliding patio doors and a strong East wind making it squeak during the first night.  We partially fixed the problem by pushing a paper/magazines into the gap and slept well the second night.  ",5,2013,03,30
122,Very Good but could be better!,"My husband and I recently went to the Wyndham Grand for a works award night. We had a fab time at the ""do"" but was a little disappointed considering it was a 5*. When we arrived we wanted valet parking we pulled up alongside the other cars (Mercedes and BMW's) and asked for valet parking and the first thing the man at the door said to us ""do you know how much it costs?"" we managed to laugh it off but it felt quite insulting. Inside, the hotel was beautiful, view great from our balcony and our room was very good. Around 5.00pm  I decided to have a nice long bath but unfortunately there was no hot water! It seemed non of my colleagues had hot water also, my husband had to plug in the kettle to boil up water to have a shave - not good. Drinks were very pricey but I suppose that was to be expected and breakfast was cold.

Other than those minor things, overall we had a very good stay, just a shame it wasn't a brilliant stay and that those little things spoilt the overall pleasure of the stay at the Wyndham.",4,2013,03,26

122,Not 5 star Family Hotel but 5 star prices !,"On Arrival the doorman was very welcoming as was the porter, parked the car dealt with luggage etc, the checking in was non descript, this was our second time and unfortunately very disappointing. The check in was half hearted and was more concerned about charging the card, the rooms were overlooking the railway and as noisy upto 11pm and at 5am when the first train comes in, and this was 7 floors up. The rooms looked tired and dated and the curtains were stained photo will be attached. I would strongly recommend you avoid rooms 715 & 717 just too noisy. The breakfast is basic and again 5 star prices but 3 star quality, ordered porridge as a starter and full English as main, and after 15 minutes they both arrived together, not 5 star service ! With American Express Centurion nearly all the top hotels welcome you with open arms as you are likely to return if the service, quality of hotel is as good as they advertise. One of the other benefits is that where possible the hotel allow you late check out, the reception agreed upto 4pm but at a cost of £40 per hour, when questioned by myself they said its £20 per hour per room and that's it. When I called Amex they spoke to the duty manager (Mark) who agreed upto 1pm because they were fully booked, funny how the reception were happy for my family and I to stay until 4pm as originally asked for at £40 per hour. I personally will not be staying here again and if you are thinking of staying here make sure you don't get a room overlooking railway and have breakfast on the Kings Road.",2,2013,03,26
122,Nice hotel but poor after sales service,"excellent hotel spoilt by a noisy toilet which disturbed our sleep - biggest problem was the after sales as I left my phone charger in the room and when I called to try and retrieve it I got the runaround trying to establish if it was there - finally discovered it and offered to post it at a charge but not yet received it.
I did receive an invoice for items we supposedly consumed from the fridge that we hadn't consumed so I rang to complain and again got messed around being transferred to various numbers - in the end hotel called me and said they would investigate and get back to me - 2 days later and I am still waiting for them to call me.

Food assortment gives no choice - three plates of ""literally nothing"" to choose from. Anything warm - on demand a'la carte, with limited quantity and extra charge (over 23 pounds allowance). Hot drinks - on demand, again paid. To get something at least 10 minutes of waiting is needed.

On arrival we were looked after very well and checked in, I requested an upgrade to a Marina suite to really indulge ourselves, we had a lovely stay and the in room service was fantastic.  I was however massively disappointed when we went for lunch as my partners sandwich had a clump of 5/6 long black hairs in it.  When I returned to the bar staff I was advised they they had no idea how it could have happned as all the kitchen staff had short hair, she then came back and said that the manager was looking in to it and my partmer re-ordered the same sandwich not wanting to make a huge issue.  I was deeply disappointed when the manager never appeared to explain the issue and we received and unconfortable/half hearted apology from our waitress who comped us a glass of wine and a beer.  As I have said I enjoyed my stay and would visit again but I think an issue like that could have been resolved better and not left a negative impact on my view of the usually fantastic Wyndham

122,Relaxing break with stunning views,"Fantastic hotel, service, & food. Weare currently having extensive work carried out in our home & needed a relaxing break. 

We were really sure about choosing London as a location as its hustle & bustle rarely bring relaxation! 
However, this fantastic hotel is far enough away from the the usual humdrum of central London, but close enough to get to the centre if you need to... However after already seeing all the London sights in the past, we didn't find this appealing & decided to enjoy our relaxed surroundings & the spectacular views. 

We had 2 nights in a 'Riverview' suite on the 7th floor, with views of the harbour & the Thames.... It's a little more expensive than a marina view room, but in our opinion well worth it, amazing views of London by night all lit up, the London eye is in your direct view aswell as the shard & the gherkin. 

The room was great clean, warm & comfortable. Bed is quite firm, but we were happy with this. All in all it was everything we wanted & more. However we were a little perplexed by one thing? We are both smokers & were very aware this was a smoke free hotel, but thought we would be able to smoke on our balcony, on immediate arrival we looked out on to our balcony & saw an ashtray on the table, all of the tables had them on the balconies. It was a really good job I sat an read the little leather in room information binder as it clearly says :

NO SMOKING IS PERMITTED EVEN ON THE BALCONY &YOU WILL BE CHARGED. 

Now of course, I understand why this is & I'm not at all complaining about that, but it was the ashtray that was confusing. As a smoker, & the new regulations in this country, we see an ashtray as a green light. As areas you MUST NOT smoke in, do not have ash trays. If I hadn't read this booklet,  I & I'm sure many other smokers would make this mistake. So other smoking patrons of this hotel need to be aware of this. 

We ate in the hotel all over our weekend & the food was superb, if we had to grumble about anything it would be difficult, however my husband had a lot of gristle in his breakfast sausage on both mornings so maybe a change of sausage to compliment the lovely breakfast. 

Service was great, polite friendly staff all around the hotel. In addition we used the Underground NCP car park at the design centre that it opposite the hotel & stayed in there from Friday @ 5pm until 12pm Sunday lunch time & it was £37 for the whole stay which we thought was a great for secure parking in London. 

All in all an exquisite hotel, great amenities & service & we will definitely return. Thank you Wyndham Grand. ",5,2013,03,18

All staff members were very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel definately deserves 5 stars.  Our room was spotless, and very large, a suite more than a room, with everything in the room you would need. We ate in the resturant where the food and choice was good, prices as you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The swimming pool facilities are also fab,and the spa staff very friendly.

No need for cabs unless you have an aversion to using public transport.  All of the staff were friendly and professional, the food in the bar was excellent and not over the top price wise for London.  The suite was really spacious and tastefully decorated with first class amenties, the location is superb, quiet and yet close enough to stroll to the hustle and bustle of the Kings Roadt.

Breakfast was good although I have experienced more luxurious continental breakfast products in other hotels; English Breakfast and service was excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and family. I will be back!.",5,2013,03,07
122,Excellent Hotel,"This is an excellent hotel that I have stayed at more than 20X.
The breakfast buffet needs to be refreshed more frequently especially when there are a lot of guests. Also, when I hire a car and driver at the hotel, which I do frequently, I would appreciate not being put into a van as it is uncomfortable when I have a long day of many meetings to attend. The drivers are excellent and knowledgeable. 

When Wyndham executives arrive they should not be given the better vehicles than preferred guests in my opinion. Overall a great hotel that I would use again. 

The on-line reservation service is particularly slow and makes it difficult to use accumulated points without having to be handed off to a seperate person. Typicaly, it takes 45 minutes to secure a reservation using the Wyndham reservation system, which is far too long. Otherwise well done.",5,2013,03,07

Trust me, on the Underground, take the Wimbledon route of the District line, get off at West Brompton.  Then go up the stairs and switch to the Clapham Junction train on the Overground and get off at the first stop which is Imperial Wharf.  The hotel is right across the street.",5,2013,02,28

122,Lovely stay at beautiful hotel,"We treated ourselves to a night here using our Avios points.
We had a suite on the 6th floor which was lovely- 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms. The only downside was the view was not over the harbour but over the rooftops of Chelsea. I asked how much it would be to change to a better view and was told £25 supplement. We decided not to change as it was only for one night.
The spa is fabulous but quite small and there were not many chairs to sit on when the pool area busy.
We had a lovely dinner in the restaurant and our daughter was very pleased with her children's meal.
The only slight downside for us was that the staff at breakfast put us very close to another family when the rest of the restaurant was quite empty. We saw no reason for this and it resulted in us having to apologise pushing passed them every time we got up to the buffet. If it had bothered us overly we would have moved but perhaps one for the staff to be aware of?
All in all a great stay in a beautiful hotel with lovely staff.",5,2013,02,25

122,Always good,"We occasionally stay here when we need to be in this part of London, and the experience is always very pleasant. This is an all-suite hotel, so even the “basic” rooms are well proportioned and include a separate sitting area. The staff are very helpful and pleasant, the rooms are well appointed, there is on-site parking and the breakfast is one of the best in London – which makes this an ideal choice for visitors to this part of London. You can get a very good martini in the bar and a there is nice view over the harbour – all in all it’s a very good place to stay.
We always drive here, but I’m aware that public transport in the area is limited to the Imperial Wharf Station which is an over ground station with a direct connection to Clapham Junction.",5,2013,02,22
122,Well worth every one of its 5 stars,"We stayed for a Saturday night in a junior suite which suited our family well, our 2 boys (7&4 had their own bedroom, bathroom and TV! We had an impeccable room and the staff were very good, we got a late rooms special offer and so for the price it was amazing.  Tube station 2 mins away and Stamford Bridge Stadium and The Kings Road were both within easy walking distance. Hotel food and drinks were a bit pricey but in Chelsea what else do you expect? Definitely Recommended, would stay again in a flash well worth every one of its 5 stars.",5,2013,02,21
122,"Great stay 2nd time around, thank you very much.",After a dissapointing stay just before Christmas we were welcombed into the hotel and had a very enjoyable time in the interconecting suites.  Excellent service.,5,2013,02,21
122,Another great stay,"We stayed at the Wyndham for Valentines day, but on the Friday/Sat. It was superb as usual. We were upgraded on arrival to a huge room with a river view, and brought an enormous platter fruit and a bottle of very good white wine as complimentary gifts. We had room service dinner which was delicious and then cocktails with excellent nibbles renewed to order in the bar, with a lovely view of twinkly lights of the marina and boats. The beds were very comfy and really big. We skipped breakfast but ordered room service coffee and ate some of our fruit instead, but I would recommend the Wyndham breakfasts as I have had them many times before and they are the best anywhere - coming up to your room with their own little ovens and toasters.The showers are spectacular too. I had a swim in the pool which is beautiful, clean and warm and pretty big for a hotel pool. I was alone for most of the 45 minutes I spent in there with only ever one other guest at the same time. The staff are helpful polite and friendly and we could not ask for more. We will be going back for the next big occasion and yipeee I think that one will be my birthday!",5,2013,02,20
122,Resort in London,"What a great hotel! The room was a 1 1/2 bath apartment with a sitting room and a seperate bedroom. Well appointed with plenty of romm. A rarity for a hotel in Europe. Not kitchenette so all your meal will be at a restaurant.

122,TOP HAT TRIP,"As my Mother and I enjoy the Chelsea area this hotel was very convenient for us. We travel to London frequently and the Wyndham Grand Hotel definitely outshines any hotel we have stayed in London. All the staff were friendly, helpful and professional but may I extend our gratitude to Sonia on the check in desk who was extremely kind when she noticed my Mother was feeling unwell.  We will definitely return to the Wyndham Grand

122,The best hotel outside of Central London?,I had always wondered what Chelsea Harbour was like and this hotel does not disappoint. The suite I was given was outstanding. Easily the best hotel outside of Central London (although the valet parking charge of £40 was a rip-off and left a sour taste in the mouth),5,2013,02,18
122,Unfortunately not the 5 star experience billed,"I find myself in the unusual situation of penning this review mid stay.  I feel I have already seen enough to rate this establishment even though we still have one night to stay.  I have been up since 5 am thanks to incessant screeching and whining noises from the overground railway station visible from or window (room 221).   You would think that this would render the hotel accessible at least but it is to all intents in the middle of nowhere, as noted by previous travellers.  To get to the overground station requires a 10 to 15 minute walk around the hotel, and the only practical means of accessing city attractions is to cab it, which soon mounts up.  Having stayed in many 5 stat establishments, the inescapable conclusion is that the basics simply aren't right here.  The receptionist Joan who checked us in was at least polite and civil, but I am yet to experience their attitude to complaints.....so watch this space.",3,2013,02,18
122,Great suite hotel,I highly recommend this hotel.  The accomodations are very nicely appointed suites complete with espresso makers.  The hotel is located steps of The Thames and within walking distance of many restuarants and shopping.  ,5,2013,02,17
122,Relaxed base for London,"I stayed at this hotel with my 13 year old son. The accommodation was excellent as we had a separate sitting room and a comfortable twin bedded bedroom. The hotel is situated a few minutes walk from the overground station with one stop taking you to join underground. I bought day transport passes £8 adult and £3+ for my son.

The hotel has a lovely pool.
I would highly recommend.",5,2013,02,17
122,Recent stay 10-14 Feb. 2013,"Spent a very pleasant 4 days at this hotel.  The facility us very top notch and the staff very professional and accommodating.
The only downside is that it's location is not convenient to Central London (W1).  It does have good conference facilities.",4,2013,02,15
122,A lovely weekend,"We came up to see mama Mia and shopping we had our usual relaxing pleasant time at the Wyndham grand.  If I had to make a suggestion it would be to lay on some transport into town as taxis vary from around £20 a trip making it rather expensive . We indulged in room service which was of a high standard, quickly delivered with a smiling friendly steward.  ",5,2013,02,14
122,Great place even when ill,"Stayed here back in November for a week and thought it was a great hotel.  Unfortuanately I became ill with a virus for 3 days and was able to just hang out in the room and rest.  The only bad point was as I was feeling better ordered french onion soup and a club sandwich were not very tasty, but it could have been from the illness.  The location in Chelsea Harbor did make it a little difficult to explore the city, so that's the only real drawback.  We did figure out the overground to the tube, but closer in to the city itself would be easier.

Would definitely stay again with our Wyndham points.

122,Wonderful stay at the Wyndham Chelsea Harbour,"Had a fantastic overnight stay with my family , to celebrate my sisters 40th birthday. We had 3 suites between the 9 of us and I can honestly say was the most impressive accommodation I have stayed in",5,2013,02,11
122,Second family visit to this hotel,"We absolutely lovoe this hotel and now use it when we visit London as a family, the fact that three adults can share a suite is fantastic.  However, the supplement for a third person sharing the room is an bit stiff.",5,2013,02,08
122,Just perfect!,"Glorious location, just a taxi ride away from the West End and Theatre Land.  All staff very helpful, Mojitos at the bar are the best ever. We had booked a night out at the cinema and got back late to the hotel where fab food was served to us by great staff in the bar area.  Rooms spacious and comfy with really lovely views over the Thames and the harbour as we were lucky enough to of been upgraded to a room with a better view. We struggled with the coffee machine in the room and could not get it to produce hot coffee. We will back again with friends at the end of March for an elongated stay and cant wait.

122,Very nice hotel with good pool,"My wife booked this hotel as a surprise for my 40th.  Good location as it is right next to the overground station.   View wise you could have the harbour or Chelsea.  It is a shame that the hotel does not overlook the river (I know it is called Chelsea Harbour!)  but the harbour is nice enough.  Very nice rooms made up of a separate room with sofa, desk, coffee machine and TV, bedroom and bathroom.   There is a spa in the hotel with a nice 17m pool which residents can use.  The breakfast was extra and for £25 a head full English was nothing special.  We did not eat in the evenings but the bar was spacious with attentive staff.  For a quality hotel in a good location to access the centre of London this is a good choice.  If you need the location but do not want to spend the money then there is a Jurys Inn about 200m down the road.",4,2013,02,06
122,A first class experience in every way!,"Our first stay 3 weeks ago to attend ChelseavArsenal game. Our suite was top quality with every small detail installed for complete comfort! Room service offered a good selection and preparation of food perfect. Restaurant - breakfast - great service & best ingredients and menu ideas! Were most impressed with display of a real honeycombe display. Asked to see the Chef to ask some questions & compliment him on our experience. We spoke to Imi Kader, the Executive Chef, who was both professional, charming and ambitious with ideas in this beautifully located restaurant overlooking Chelsea Harbour. Peter and I wish him every success and will be visiting on many occasions especially in the football season, even though it would be good to stay nearer the Emirates Stadium. We have decided it is worth travelling across London so we can enjoy that extra comfort and quality when we travel so often from Cornwall for football, shopping & entertainment ..... perfect location! We will recommend. Jacqui Fair",5,2013,02,04
122,"Great value for a large suite in London, but beware internet pricing strategy","I booked a room on the Wyndham website for £270, then phoned to add a second night about a week later. On the phone I was quoted £230 which was hastily corrected to £270. Deeply suspicious that I could have got a better rate for both nights and will be booking by phone next time to get the best deal. There was a bit of mucking about charging my card with way too much on check-in but they sorted it out eventually. Having said that I use this hotel a lot as I am in that neck of the woods for work, and the spacious rooms are very comfortable for a couple of nights away from home. Hoping they have plans for updating the rooms in the next year or so, given their location in design central!",4,2013,01,31
122,Complaint to M.D. from Mr Robert Bailey room 405  25th Jan 2013,"it took me three attempts to  get to the point where someone took my booking on the telephone. I was connected to an ansa phone and pipped music and Club details, so frustrating when busy and trying to book a room, this was quite apart from the number of rings before phone was answered 22 times is not 5 star, i have frequented Claridges and the Dorchester over the years and expect better. The personel were polite and charming.

The night Bar staff did not run the tap for a glass of cold water (no ice) and it was warm and showed a dont care attitide. The Breakfast staff ran the tap til cold ! Why two standards. 

Finally once in my room I discovered my bag was sent to another persons room,I was offered toiletries but my medication was in that bag, I had to insist (11.30pm) they retrieve this.

Finally having left the bathroom half naked a strange couple entered my room saying they were so sorry but were given the key card by Hotel, how embarrasing for do you think this was, your survey has arrived with me just prior to my complaint letter, this has been a terrible experience and i am looking for a full refund !!

122,Excellent hotel,"Stayed there for two nights. I really enjoyed my time there. The gym and the pool are good and the service is friendly. Although in general very nice location, the connection from the hotel to the airport is not ideal. ",5,2013,01,29
122,Super New Year's Treat,"We stayed at the Wyndham from 30th December until the 1st January 2013. 
From the moment we walked through the door we felt very welcome, the attentive concierge, the wonderful manager on check in to the staff at the bar and restaurant.
The concierge arranged for us on New Years eve to join a small gathering of guests in the penthouse suite to watch the fireworks over the river Thames. With spectacular views and ample space to watch the 'show', we were very happy to have seen it all from the comfort of our own hotel.
I have stayed in many 'high-end' hotels where not only are guests pretentious but the staff can also be just as condescending, however, this is far from the truth at this hotel in a very refreshing way. 
The staff were friendly and helpful, wanting to give you the best service possible.
Our suite was fantastic, the living room and balcony with coffee/tea making facilities, a very well stocked mini bar, TV in both rooms, large bathroom with bath, shower and separate toilet. Furnished to a high standard, modern and clean.
Everything you need for a comfortable stay was provided for us.
The room service was excellent, good selection, generous amount and high quality...most importantly it was delicious!
We will definately be staying at the Wyndham again!!",5,2013,01,26
122,Fantastic stay,"Booked for one Saturday night only as going out in London, wished it was for longer, Hotel is fantastic set alongside Chelsea Harbour, our  7th floor apartment had brilliant views across London, room was amazing, lots of amenities, and ultra clean, staff extremely friendly and helpful.  Had lunch there which was very nice.  Will definitely book again.",5,2013,01,26
122,great with kids,"Pretty location but a taxi ride to the main attractions. Still we loved our stay at Wyndham because of this lovely hotel. Very spacious and clean rooms with the view of the Harbour. Mainly large families with kids prefer it, i can say... It was a little bit difficult to reach the spa area from your room but still We had a great time at the indoor pool. We were there to spend the New Years Eve in London so the hotel was pretty full but this did not interfere with their service. One bonus was to see the Chelsea Football team at the lobby since this is the hotel they choose to stay. And i can strongly recommend the hairdresser down at the hotel. They were such talented hairdressers. 
Overall a firm ""yes, we would love to go back to The Wyndham soon... """,4,2013,01,24
122,A little bit of luxury,"Lovely hotel, great service and friendly staff and the beds are so comfy with crisp white linen.

122,Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbor,"At first impressions the hotel is wonderful, family friendly and is the perfect place to stay for your London visit. We stayed there a few years ago and they have completely redone the inside! It is now very spacious and luxurious. A fast lift took us up to our floor. Very good security considering you need your room card to get up to the accommodation when using the lift. The room was very spacious and had a big living area with comfortable sofa bed. Moving through to a bedroom with ensuite bedroom and bathroom. Also another toilet, kitchen area and hall. All the rooms are like this so you'll get all of this. The location was excelent with a newly built train station 2 minutes walk taking you to places like West Bromwhich, Green Park and so on. Also because it is by the harbour, great views and no congestion charge! The only disappointing thing was breakfast. The children's breakfast was so called ""free"" and you were only allowed one thing off the menu so if your children like a shrivelled up piece of bacon a hash brown and a small sausage with no sauce then you'll like it. The other thing was that the breakfast was very complicated and for £12.99 you could have this but not this etc. The Eggs Benedict was completely dry and even if you cracked the egg, there was no moistness. The pool/spa facilities very excellent! The pool had great views onto the boats in the harbour and it's the best way to end your day of walking/sightseeing! We were also very happy when we say three Range Rovers, 2 Bentley Continentals, 1 Mercedes SLS AMG and 1 Rolls Royce Phantom park outside. The Phantom had 57UNT which looked like 'STUNT'! Plus a couple of Ferraris went past! Overall a great stay, all the staff are friendly and we enjoyed it!",4,2013,01,18

122,Break after Christmas,"A lovely hotel situated in the heart of London
We were greeted by the 'guys' at the door with superb professionalism.  Travelling with 2 small children they started our short break with an adventure of their own and made the transfer from car to hotel room effortless.
Great staff that catered for every need that a family could ask for.
Thoroughly recomended hotel and hope to visit again soon",5,2013,01,10

The view for startes was amazing could see the London eye. Only downfall was the building opposite being rebuilt or fixed :/ the inside was lovely, decor great. Loved having the different room for lounging and the 2 restrooms were a good idea for if someone was in the shower/bath that they wouldn't be disturbed!  The location was excellent close to local amenities but out the way and quiet. Loved the fact this is a hotel for Chelsea fc! And that they were there when we stayed was just fantastic!! The best thing about this hotel well there isn't one really it was all fabulous living and service. The thing I liked least was the overall price of food and the cost of items in the mini bar. It was too expensive for us.",5,2013,01,09
122,Pre NYE family getaway,"This is the sixth time my family have stayed at the hotel. Great location, the staff are helpful, pool/facilities are great for our children who really enjoy staying here. The quality of the breakfast was a let down once again.",4,2013,01,08

122,Delightful Hotel,"This was my second stay at the Wyndham and first over the Christmas period.  We stayed on the 6th floor (river view suite) with brilliant views of the Thames, London Eye and the Shard - stunning at night.  The room was immaculate and spacious.

I joined my family who were also staying at the Wyndham for Christmas dinner.  The table was full of Christmas loveliness and the live jazz band were just simply brilliant - please book the same band again this year!! The Christmas dinner was delicious, although I felt a tad sorry for my vegetarian relative who also wanted a Christmas themed meal - no criticism to the food at all, but I would suggest a more festive vegetarian option to be available - perhaps all the trimmings with fish, a nut roast or just additional vegetables. 

The room service staff were pleasant and efficient, on both the phone and in person.  The room service meals were presented perfectly, not an item missed from the table. 
We telephoned for additional champagne glasses and champagne buckets which were delivered to our room within minutes. 

What a beautiful hotel.  I look forward to my next visit.",5,2013,01,05
122,Wow very nice,"My husband and i Arrived new years eve early 1.30pm for check in at 3pm ,the room was ready great  valet parking was £40 thought this was worth it as it was a treat quick check in room 120 over looked 
the quay the suite was excellent couldnt fault it ,
Did eat in the hotel my husband had the burger and chips he said best ever ,i had fish and chips and although nicely presented it was disapointting at £15 wasnt worth it ,drinks where qiute expensive shorts £7 but hey this is a 5 * and in chelsea it was expected ,didnt bother with 
the viewing area for firework display at midnight as thought price of £30 to go to penthouse suite on new years eve with glass of champagne was pricey and it was 3.5 miles away from big ben so we had a pleasant  walk to view the fireworks at 10 pm ,well worth it 
definately recommend this hotel and would go back again and again ,didnt use the pool although wish we had of done ,fast efficient check out ,couldnt fault our stay here just wish weather would have been better so we could have had a stroll down kings road which was a 10 min walk away .See you soon wyndham chelsea harbour dont hessitate book it",5,2013,01,05
122,Good hotel in à nice location,"Everything was fine, with good rooms, friendly and serviceminded staff. The only think that not give top score, was that one evening it leaked from our bathroom ceiling and no excuse or compensation when checking out",4,2013,01,04
122,2 night break!,"First time at the Wyndham Grand and it won't be the last! Comfortable suite with all facilities catered. The main bedroom has patio doors and balcony which is a plus but outside noise is heard due to fit.
Great customer service.

122,Great hotel but not without hiccup,"Our hiccup in booking occured when the central reservation team in canada told us that a 3 person room only had 1 bed and we would be expected to share it. Serously. Three people. 1 king bed. He was ADAMENT. It was only by ringing back and asking to be put straight through to the reservations desk that we received clarifiication that the room had 1 king and 1 sleeper sofa. We got a good deal on a last minute website so the price was very reasonable for what is a very lovely hotel. It's not central london in transportation terms and the closest tube station was closed so that's definitely a minus, but there's a close overground train. Staff fantastic with one weak link in the bar but we fed this back to the hotel and they were extremely responsive. Overall, a fantastic hotel that I would recommend.",4,2013,01,03
122,The Wyndham Grand,"we enjoyed our stay very much,the staff in the hotel itself were very accomodating as we have a 4 month old baby girl and a 4 year old and they were excellent with the children,the only complaint we have is that i took my 4 year old daughter swimming in the pool and while in the pool i had to rescue another guest who was drowning in the pool!i pulled the lady out and other guests and myself stayed with her until the staff turned up,thankfully the lady was ok but very shaken up,she thanked me which there was no need as anyone would have done the same thing,but none of the staff bothered to thank me,i had a quick chat with the staff on reception to make sure the lady was ok but that was it,so except for this we would come back and stay again as the hotel was superb(and no traffic noise from our appartment!",5,2013,01,03
122,Wyndham Xmas,"Another great stay at the Wyndham Chelsea Harbour. Clean spacious rooms, great service, fab showers and a lovely warm pool, The only small point being the Xmas dinner for the veg member of  our party was very everyday, Although the turkey and venison were really great, the goats cheese course was dry, the lemon sole very basic and everyday, could present a better more christmasy veg/fish option for the price. The dinner table was beautiful and a great jazz band. Loved everything else and hope to spend another occasion very soon.

122,5 star disaster!,"My wife and I booked a 3 day break over New Year to celebrate a very special Birthday and Anniversary. We thought that booking into a 5 star hotel in Chelsea was a dead cert for a good time. How wrong we were! When we arrived our room was not ready and when we were allowed in we were informed we could not use the bath. Indeed we may have to move to another room the next day. The coffeee machine in the room then blew up scalding my wife's hand and we were interrupted 5 times over a 2 hour period by maintenance staff trying to repair it. We were then left one sachet of coffee for one cup of coffee between two of us over a 24 hour period. When my wife attempted to use the shower cubicle we discovered that it stank of human waste and had clearly been used as a lavatory and not properly cleaned. The Duty Manager was called who profusely apologised and arranged to have us moved. Not a relaxing break so far! The room we were moved to was the only one available and was far inferior in terms of view and furnishings. A tiny little thing but again there was hardly any coffee, glasses had been removed and we had to call room service to have them replaced. Also, we spent 5 minutes cleaning cigarette butts up from our balcony. We were offered a bottle of wine as compensation but in our 3 day stay this did not arrive. We were also offered a complimentary breakfast which began later than published and after 25 minutes sitting at our table and not being attended to we left without any food or drink. The hotel is also noisy as it is on the main London airports' flight path and getting anywhere significant by public transport is almost impossible as it is in the middle of nowhere. Our special break was completely ruined. Thankfully after making a scene at Reception the huge amount of money we had already paid was refunded to us. That cannot make up for such soured memories of what should have been such a wonderful occasion. I advise travellers to avoid this hotel and spend their hard earned cash at the many other much finer hotels that are available in London. One slight positive. A Junior Manager called Roberto was at all times polite, professional and helpful and somewhat embarrassed as to what had happened.",1,2013,01,02
122,Splendid New Year Location,I needed somewhere to enjoy the London New Year but away from the crowds as I have been in poor health. Travelling with husband and 2 teenagers. Hotel was super. Room very comfortable and service excellent. Some issues with noise but it was New Year. The Penthouse Viewing Lounge was very special and the champagne reception was just a perfect way to watch the fireworks in a comfortable setting. Breakfast rather pricey but gather others had booked a 'package' so will look out for offers in the future.,4,2013,01,01
122,Not 5 star service,"Having just returned from spending NY at CH Hotel we are very dissappointed with our stay.  The hotel itself is beautiful but unfortunately it is let down by its service.  For a 5 star hotel it certainly does not provide 5 star customer service - if you are going to charge 99 GBP per person set menu, automatically put on service charge to every bill, charge 40 GBP for 2 coffee's a croissant and a boiled egg - then ensure you deliver to that standard - and you didn't by a mile.

Another frustration was our 1 year old son was given just a towel as a duvet - after a few requests that were ignored we gave up.  After such shoddy service, the front desk then had the audacity to re-charge my card another 100 GBP as I had already used up a safety deposit from day 1 - this to me suggested that they don't even trust their guests! - especially as I had already paid in full the room expense for 2 nights - this was very much the principle and was not greeted well at all.

I have had the pleasure in staying in many hotels 5 stars globally through to Premier Inn's and this was a huge let down and i would not recommend or return - which is a real shame as I had high hopes for my family NY to be spent at CH Hotel.",2,2013,01,01
122,Christmas at Chelsea Harbour,"The rooms are nearly perfect and clean, but I found the bed not as comfortable as I would expect at a 5* hotel.

The restaurant staff are nowhere near the standard I expected and the Christmas lunch was a complete ripoff at £99 per person, I would rate it at £7-50 at most. The turkey was described on the menu as special Bronze Turkey but it turned out to be a stuffed turkey roll.

My overall experience at the hotel would have been good if the food had come up to the standard I was expecting, but it did not and to tell the truth it ruined my Family Christmas. We feel realy let down.",3,2012,12,30
122,Friendly and welcoming,"We spent a pleasant weekend, the rooms was clean , room service prompt, only down side we later received a bill for the minibar because the housekeeper had not alerted accounts as to our usage.

 But despite this we will defo stay again .Thank you ",5,2012,12,27
122,A good hotel in a nice spot,"Stayed for one night only, I had a small suite that was very comfortable with everything I needed. My main issue is that you cannot open the windows in your room, for me I like the fresh air and prefer not use air con, however the hotel was very warm ( as you would expect in Dec) so I had use it. Breakfast was very good, the views of the marina mean you can almost forget you are in a busy part of west London, the area has good links for public transport and there is an NCP car park next to the hotel £25 for 24 hrs, which is reasonable for the area. All staff I met were polite and professional, overall a good hotel but I would expect it to be at the price. I would stay again. ",4,2012,12,26
122,Very pleasing on lots of levels. Very good stay.,"The benefits of staying here include good rooms, comfortable beds, swimming pool, good rail connection and very good staff. The location might be an issue for some as you are very slightly isolated in what some might regard as a sterile, new built environment.

However, there is some fun to be had in the immediate vicinity if you are prepared to look and we, in fact, enjoyed a very pleasant Lebanese meal at Imperial wharf which is only five minutes away.
We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, preferring the cheaper option of the Tesco express which is next door. We would have no hesitation recommending the hotel because overall the facilities were really very good indeed and gave us a touch of luxury start of our Christmas long weekend. A particular favourite of ours was the pool which was lovely. This would be improved by the addition of a Jacuzzi. The sauna,  steam room and changing rooms were very pleasant also. The gym was well-equipped though I didn't use this myself.",4,2012,12,25
122,Not 5 star,"Excellent staff, location slightly remote. Lots of plane noise. Good views, spacious suites, breakfast in room very average! In my humble opinion a very good four star hotel. Spa staff very helpful and friendly. ",3,2012,12,23
122,Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour,"The Wyndham Grand Hotel at London Chelsea Harbour has a good location near to the River Thames at Imperial Wharf on the Overground Line and is convenient for the 606 Jazz Club in Lots Road as well as King's Road, Chelsea. The staff are friendly, the rooms are comfortable with a high standard of finish and the restaurant and bar offer a good selection of food and drinks. I recommend this hotel for those who are happy to pay £200 - £250 per night for a hotel room with breakfast included in good London location. ",5,2012,12,22
122,40th Birthday Treat,"Great stay on 14th & 15th Dec for my 40th Birthday.  Amazing hotel and great attentive staff.  Lovely food (dinner, lunch & breakfast).  Lovely relaxing spa, wonderful massage and great pool.  Would definitle recommend and would most definitley return.",5,2012,12,21
122,The staff were professional and courteous at all times...,The staff were professional and courteous at all times.  The hotel room was fantastic.  My stay was effortless and I would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for style and comfort with a touch of grandeur.,5,2012,12,19
122,Just as we expected bar one thing,"We stayed again at the Wyndham, it was the usual high standard, but we have a problem, where once  they welcomed dogs,(well behaved of course)now we were informed that they have changed policy, and only handbag dogs can stay there.
Our dogs have always behaved impeccably, and we are quite upset to think that we will not be able to go back, what a shame.",4,2012,12,18
122,Excellent Hotel with quality services,"We stayed three nights and very comfortable stay, very easy to come to Central London via over ground linked with under ground from next station either District line or central line. Nice location, idea for the relaxing holidays. ",5,2012,12,18
122,What a disappointment,"Went here with family who had raved about it, but boy was I disappointed. The only good thing was the cheeky doorman who made us smile. They messed up our booking, we wanted interconnecting rooms, the only reason for booking with them, and we did not get them.  In fact we were a long way from each other.  Be careful when you book, my family have been coming here for years and in the past everything has gone smoothly but it seemed standards are slipping. try the Mandarin Oriental instead, we had a fantastic time there.",2,2012,12,14
122,Disappointed our loyalty meant so little,We book adjoining rooms here as we have done for the last 5 years. We always stay here this year we have stayed 4/5 times alone. Last Christmas we had roasted chestnuts as we arrived and the place was decked out fabulously this year no warm welcome just a decrepit tiny tree in the corner. We tried to book in at midday but told unable to. When we return our adjoining rooms had been allocated to others as they failed to check our request on both bookings properly when we complained and said this is not good enough we were offered a 10% discount. Not good enough!!!!!!! we didnt just accept this we complained alot but were not getting anywhere. Are financial troubles to blame for their lack of care and commitment to loyal customers that return year on year? Please do not expect to get what you book here as they just dont care. Service has fallen along with their standards so far I have to say i doubt we will return! This makes me sad but its just not welcoming any more and has lost its magic!,2,2012,12,13
122,I asked my 8 year old daughter to help with this. Her views...,"I asked my 8 year old daughter to help with this. Her views were that the hotel staff were great, they helped her with everything and her meals were far better than anything, even Mummy's cooking. She says the beds were very comfortable and the mini bar had the best chocolate ever at 9pm.
I have to say the staff were very good at all times, food was excellent and the suites were perfect. The only thing I disagree with my daughters comments are the chocolate in the mini bar, very expensive.

122,Annual girlie shopping weekend,"In October I telephoned the hotel and booked interconnecting suites for my two daughters, my sister and my neice.  On arriving at the hotel at 11.00 am I was told we were too early to book in but could leave our suitcases and come back later, which was fine with us.  When we returned to the hotel we were told sorry but we could not have the interconnecting suites we had booked but they have managed to sort us rooms on the same floor!!  We felt as this was our 4th year of staying here with interconnecting suites they could have informed us at the time of booking it was not possible, we will not book again.  Very disappointed with the service.",4,2012,12,13
122,Lovely spacious hotel well maintained and clean,"For a special occasion this hotel is excellent. The suite is very special and feels quite luxurious
The hotel was very clean and well maintained, our concern that our room heating was broken was dealt with quickly and efficiently
Bar and restaurant prices quite acceptable
Door staff could have been friendlier !",5,2012,12,11

I was told by a member of staff that this is NOT an unusual occurrence..",5,2012,12,10
122,100% perfect,"We returned to this hotel at the invitation of Wyndham Grand London Chelsea harbour on 5th December for one night following a less than perfect stay last time.We were contacted prior to the date of arrival to check if we required a table reservation in the restaurant which was a nice touch.On the day we we greeted by a receptionist who clearly knew we were expected and shown up to an amazing suite on the 7th floor with 180 degree views across London taking in the gherkin ,London eye and the shard.The suite had a large lounge area with coffee pod machine desk and sofa ..leading onto a large king sized bedroom with a fabulously comfy bed and then into a two roomed marbled  bathroom with shower,bath,toilet and bidet.all areas were squeaky clean with ample lit hanging space.The dining experience was exceptional with a harbour/river view and our own waiter who served up the biggest prawn cocktail ,duck confit , steaks and sweets to die for (literally as we are both diabetic !)the breakfast was served in the room and had enough food to serve a family of four -although we did try not to waste any !The last time we were there the hotel was heaving with sports aid celebs but this time we felt like the only ones there and loved every minute....we will be making it our hotel of choice when we stay on our future trips to London...excellent 5* experiance",5,2012,12,08
122,Great place to stay,Booked a suite at a good price and was not disappointed. The staff were 5 star but not in your face. Any requests were dealt with immediately . Would go back without a doubt. Could not locate a tube close by so you may have use a taxi to get around. ,5,2012,12,08
122,Sunday at Wyndham Chelsea Harbour,"Excellent service from all staff, very friendly and attentive. Room was spacious,clean and well maintained. Bed very comfortable and good sized bathroom. Restaurant quite reasonably priced for this class of hotel with very comfortable bar for pre and after meal drinks. Good breakfast. Location is a bit far from main shopping area but we enjoyed the walk along the river and Kings Rd to Sloane Sq and shops. Good value on a Sunday evening.",5,2012,12,07
122,Coming home to Wyndham,"When I walk into the Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour it’s like coming home.
The service is of the highest quality and there is calmness in the air that hints at the professionalism of the ""Team"". It takes a lot of effort and commitment to achieve that ambience.
I leave feeling very special and relaxed.
I will return frequently. This not a place where you just stay, it’s a place where you can simply be yourself.
Thank you for the experience

122,Excent hotel,Hotel was excellent. Staff from doormen to reception were all excellent.Lovely room which i paid extra for. Only problem we had in 2 nights was on the first night. 04.20am room service knocked on my door and startled my wife and me . we did not order any room service and he had the wrong room !! could not get back to sleep so lost a nights sleep and ended being very tired the next evening.,5,2012,12,07
122,An Oasis of Calm in london,"A beautiful suite hotel set in a small harbour just off the Thames close to Fulham and the Kings Road. The hotel is a top class 5 star and it shows from the moment you arrive.  Excellent reception from the doorman with cases whisked away leaving you to check in, in comfort. You sit and complete the formalities in and are then escorted to you room where all the controls are explained. The luggage arrives within minutes. The rooms are a nice size with a lounge and seperate bedroom. The wardrobe is in the entrance hall and both rooms can be accessed from here with seperate doors. Large well stocked bathroom with a bath and nice walk in shower. A good spa and pool complete the package. It has an American feel about it which for me is good, I love piano's playing in the background in a bar. A very enjoyable hotel with good walks down the Thames moments away.",5,2012,12,06
122,Disappointed,"Having stayed at this hotel when it was the Conrad & enjoyed a fabulous couple of days, the Wyndham Grand did not live up to the Conrad's fine reputation.  The Doormen & Bellhops were friendly & efficient.  Concierge/checking in staff seemed a little aloof & not at all interested in being personable.  Bar staff however were friendly & personable, if a little slow.  Promised shoe shine service did not materialise.  We were approached by a couple of drunken guests who made inappropriate comments.  Had I not had my husband with me, I would have been quite concerned.

I feel that the staff could be trained better to make guests.feel more at ease.  When I leave a hotel, I want to feel a tinge of sadness that my stay has come to an end & to plan my next trip there.  What I don't want to feel is how & where I plan to stay the next time.

I believe that charging guests for everything is also a negative issue.  At the rates charged here, perhaps breakfast or a complimentary bottle of wine would have been very welcome.",3,2012,12,06
122,"Great stay, but little sleep","Great hotel, service and very modern and comfortable rooms. Awesome spa. My only critical comment would be the neighbours that kept us up till the early hours of the morning. walls are thin and hotel did not seem to care to keep them quiet. unfortunate for such a nice hotel

122,As good a hotel as I've stayed in - faultless !,"This place is quite exceptional. Stayed here a few times now and have found it superb in every sense, from check in to check out. The rooms are actually suites; large, beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. Lovely beds, pills and bedlinen. The food is also very good and the service the best I've had in London. For the price of £250.00, it's cheap. In a different location (Chelsea is a bit far out of town for most people) a price tag of £500-600+ wouldn't seem expensive. It's that good. I have stayed in some of the world's great hotels and when I say this is right up there I'm not kidding!",5,2012,12,02
122,Wonderful staff make this hotel,"The hotel is wonderful, but what really made our stay was the staff.  Zita couldn't do enough for us, and always had a smile on her face.  This is our second stay at the Wyndham. One of the main reasons for us returning was due to how well we were treated in our last visit, again Zita looked after us so well.  Hotel and facilities are first class, very comfortable beds, clean and well equipped with spacious bathrooms. Great transport links and shops within walking distance.",5,2012,12,01
122,Noisy !,"Nice hotel, but not value for money at all, the rooms are dated to say the least. The worst thing for us was the noise of the train station next to our room and also the heathrow flight path roaring overhead ... Impossible to sleep... Frim the 5th floor we could hear the announcments from the train platform !",3,2012,12,01

122,overnight stay to  go the theatre,"I have stayed at the Wydham on a number of occasions . Overall the hotel is good value ( for London)  I have stayed in other good hotels and paid twice as much for pretty much the same . However , I hope over the next year or two that the suites are slowly upgraded as they are showing the test of time - however they are still in an acceptable condition and are comfortable.

122,London visit,"We stayed just one night at the Chelsea Wyndham as we toured London. The hotel is nicely located about 2  blocks from the train & tube lines. Hotel room was superb! It was one of the best ights of sleep we had during our 10-day stay. The hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us navigate the tube lines, recommending restaurants and arranging site tours. They even let us borrow an umbrella for the entire day after we checked out!
      
      ",5,2012,11,24
122,Brilliant hotel but a few errors have put me off returning,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand on November 16th for 1 night, it was mine and my boyfriends 4 year anniversary so we decided to splash out.

The location is in Chelsea harbour, the view was really pretty and the hotel is very private as it is set back in a private residential zone. This meant it was very peaceful and easy to relax.

We paid £350 for a harbour suite and celebration package.

When we arrived the staff couldnt have been more helpful or friendly, once we were checked in we were shown around our suite. When we went out for dinner the staff organised a taxi for us and we didnt have to wait long. At breakfast the waiters were very attentive but not over bearing, they achieved a good balance of service. 

Our suite was really nice, the decor was easy to relax in (no garish colours) both toilets were clean and light. The bathroom was very modern, the shower was lovely. Our bed was really comfortable. 

Unfortunately as we were on level 1, our balcony overlooked the roof of the hotel resturant so we couldnt actually see much of the harbour, if I was to return I would ask for a room on a higher level.

There were a few hiccups with our stay, they didnt ruin our night away but I was surprised to have errors considering the price we paid for a single night. 

They did not tell me when booking the hotel that if you are paying by debit card they would require an extra £100 deposit, it was very embarrasing for me at check in to have to ask my partner to garuntee the room on his card as I had been saving for the hotel but not an extra £100 for a deposit.

Also at check in I was embarrassed again by having to clarify the paperwork, on my booking confirmation it clearly stated the cost of the room was including VAT but on check in it clearly stated that it was excluding VAT. The hotel staff were quick to rectify this but it was embarrasing to have to question the amount especially after the incident with the deposit.

When we were shown around our room we discovered that the celebration package that we had ordered had not been brought up so we had to ask for them to bring it. It would have been nice to have everything ready on arrival.

We were also confused about having an ash tray on a none smoking balcony.

When we came to check out there was another issue where they had a mistake on our bill of a £92 room service lunch. I again had to question the bill amount and ask the staff to rectify this.",4,2012,11,23
122,the only problems I have with the hotel are that the...,"the only problems I have with the hotel are that the bathrooms are rather small and old fashioned, but the main problem is the quality of the room service food which whilst the costs are five star, the food certainly is not.
also paying £40 plus VAT every night for parking is excessive. ",5,2012,11,21
122,Very happy,"I was very happy with the hotel this trip. 
Everything was in order. Staff friendly, polite and willing to help.
I certainly will continue to stay here in the future.",5,2012,11,18
122,Terrific hotel,"We enjoyed our stay immensely. The beautiful setting, the services offered (phone, pool etc), the courteous and attentive staff all deserve very highest commendation. The apartment was clean, nicely set out and comfortable. The only difficulty we had was that the location was difficult to get out of because it was far from mainstream London. ",5,2012,11,18
122,Great hotel,Excellent. Hotel very we'll run staff  superb all meals very good  room was very clean any requests  that were made for any extra items required  in room were met instantly pool and fitness centre  were good standard,5,2012,11,18
122,"very good,loved it.","Very good experience,will love to stay there again.the room was spaceous,clean,location excellent,walking distance to shops.",5,2012,11,18
122,Shower Like A Fire Hose,"Lovely hotel, service was excellent, room was immaculate and spacious, harbour view suite with a lovely view (for London) and peaceful, breakfast was good, but to expensive, and parking for this far out of central London was crazy at £40 over night.... I can get a good hotel room for that in Hampshire!, but best shower I have had anywhere in the world, and all the staff were very helpful.",5,2012,11,17
122,24 hours at Wyndhams,"Some aspects were excellent, others less so. rooms a bit bleak and corporate, but beds and bedding excellent. Staff friendly and helpful, but not always very competent eg - not one hot cup of coffee. Waited in bar for over half an hour for our cocktails before giving up. Dinner menu for the spa offer - dreadful. carrot soup followed by pea rissotto or fish. No meat, not even sausages. We were prepared to pay the supplement but commented our opinion that not many people would think the first menu acceptable, but we were very charmingly and generously recompensed, Spa facililities very good. We enjoyed our break very much, but a little tweaking on  some matters would improve the experience ",3,2012,11,16
122,"Great staff, great hotel- paying extra for breakfast just annoying",This was a great hotel and the staff I thought managed to be very professional and friendly without being aloof. The hotel is in a fantastic location (though a trip away from some of the main attractions)  and has the big American style luxury feel. My only bugbear was that breakfast wasn't included- when you are paying these kind of prices is even a decent continental too much to ask?,5,2012,11,15
122,Boy's Weekend,"I took my 2 sons to London for the weekend and found this hotel online. Service was excellent, the rooms (suites) were very large by London standards and were well equipped. Room service was delivered promptly and they were very happy to accommodate our special requests. We used the indoor pool which was again large for a London hotel and the location sitting right on Chelsea harbour was a great spot. The highlight was the staff all of whom were friendly, helpful and efficient.",5,2012,11,15

122,A Magical Experience,"Booking a hotel is not just always simple.. Especially when you are coming during the  WTM time in London. 

The best way I can think of conveying our experience at Wyndham Grand Chelsea harbour is to draw a parallel to Alice in wonderland. At Wyndham Grand Chelsea harbour even it is 10 minute taxi ride from Victoria station and not to mention other landmarks like  Buckingham Palace, marble arch you are transported away from the busy streets of London into your very own Wonderland.

We had evening flight to London and as we arrived at the hotel at around 7:00 P.M, we simply planned to check-in and relax in the lounge before heading out to Dinner. We were not expecting the complimentary champagne, Bot of top-end Shiraz and fruits. Out of all that what made us feel very important was the personal welcome greet from the very charming and very professional General manager( I noticed that it was not only to me but he was doing that again and again during my 4 days in this lovely hotel). The all suit overlooking the amazing London through the Chelsea harbour was simply magical. My girlfriend was speechless. And breakfast ..service and its got better and better every day.. I must recommend all !! stay in this place and feel the deference.  

Other highlights:
Relaxing in the lounge bar.
Enjoying delicious breakfast; we had the, Tasting table and omelet.
Well knowledgeable Chauffeur driver and concierge team. 
Housekeeping service
The friendly and accommodating staff. 
Very professional Management team.  

I had great expectations when booking our stay at Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour  and they delivered a memory that we both will cherish. 

We will for sure return to our London Wonderland, on a future when we both travel to London. 

Thank you every one at WG Chelsea Harbour

When we arrived with our luggage I had to struggle through the door with my daughter  while a doorman stood there, strange I thought, then he jumped to attention to open it for another customer, great start to our stay! I could go on about our experience at The Wyndam but I don't want to write War and Peace. In a nutshell the service was not great, not 5 star anyway. our coffee machine didn't work(water just say warm). 
I was very disappointed because I wanted it to be special for my daughter.",3,2012,11,11

Beds comfortable lovely suite very clean.

122,Perfect place for a proposal,"I booked a suite in the Wyndham, with the intention of proposing to my girlfriend. I got upgrade to the Penthouse for the same cost, which was very nice (obviously!). Staff were lovely, room was superb and the view was fantastic too. Definitely a perfect place to propose, and I would definitely recommend for a short break in the heart of the city.",5,2012,11,09
122,Disappointing,"Was extremely disappointed with this visit.
Food was very average.
No fresh fruit at breakfast (was canned), and fried eggs were cooked with other food!
Bar was clearly frequented with randoms and was blatantly for the purpose of businessmen!
I do understand that this happens in other hotels, but it is in my opinion that it should be handled much more discretely.
Will think twice about a further visit.

122,An Oasis in the City,"A lovely hotel. We only stayed one night. The room (a harbour view suite with a balcony) was really comfortable and spacious. Very quiet for London, we had a good nights sleep. Lovely view from the windows and balcony. Breakfast is a bit costly so we strolled to the Kings Road to eat.
Nice products in the bathroom. Complimentary water and a kettle and cofee maker, they've thought of everything. We will return.",5,2012,11,07
122,"Very good, but not ""wow""","We stayed here with our two small children, having treated ourselves by using airmiles.  The hotel is very smart and clean and the room of a great standard.  The children slept on the sofa bed in the lounge and it was a facility that worked well for us.  Unfortunately, even though we were assured that it would happen by 7pm, the bed for the kids wasn't put out until after 8pm and they were stood there in their pyjamas, shattered and waiting for the maid to sort the bed out.  It took several phone calls before anyone came.  Also, the tv wasn't working in the lounge, but they did fix it.  All in all, we found the staff friendly and helpful with lovely clean facilities and a nice breakfast and evening meal.  If any criticism could be made, it would just be that the hotel lacks a bit of character and if we had paid cash for it, I would feel rather disappointed.  It's in a pretty good location though, just a short walk from the Kings Road.  We would probably look for somewhere even more central next time.",4,2012,11,07
122,A different class altogether,"We decided to take our two children down to London to do a spot of Christmas shopping and visit the Natural History Museum.  Choosing a hotel is never easy because most of the time the rooms tend to be just a touch cramped.
Grand London is different - the suite (as mentioned by other reviewers) was excellent - well laid out, spacious, clean and comfortable.
I should also mention the service received from the moment we arrived, porter ready and waiting, having checked in we were personally shown to the room, full run down of everything, an extra pillow was requested (and the response was to ask if any preference as to what sort of pillow!) and the aforementioned arrived within five minutes of asking.
An exceptional gem, ideally located and with staff that certainly make this a cut above!",5,2012,11,07
122,Perfect,Absolutely love this hotel. Rooms are amazing and great value for money suites with impeccable facilities. Great coffee machines. Lovely beds and bathroom five star +++. Service at the front desk is superb - extremely professional. Food very good - including room service - but not amazing. Have stayed here several times and it is always a pleasure.,5,2012,11,05
122,Disappointing stay at Wyndham Grand Cheslea Harbour,"Having stayed at the Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour on a number of occassions we recommended it to friends as a good base for our joint trip to London.

On arirval we decided to lunch at the hotel as our rooms weren't quite ready

Service during th lunch was a shambles - constantly having to ask where the food was / long wait for water - when the food did arive after 50 minutes there was no cutlery - cue another wait

Having 5 children in the party a lunch that took over 2 hours to complete with a 40 minute wait for 4 scoops of childrens ice cream was not the best of starts for us or other diners in the bar.

The waiter was crtainly quick to follow us out of the restraunt to demand that we sign for the bill though.  This we refused and the hotel to their credit did waive the bill on checkout.

With this episode fresh in our minds we were horrified when our friends called us from their room to say ""take a look at our bathroom"" on looking we discovered that the WC was Soiled from a previous guest and had plainly not been cleaned.

Having recommended this hotel in spite of iyt non central location this was now causing me an embarrassment.

Went to see Duty Manager all he could say was ""Sorry"" i'm fuly supportive of a multi national work force but there seems to be a definite lack of core English Management at this hotel.

We didnt use the bar again -

My wife also reported t me that the receptionist in the SPA was particulary unpleasant and met her request for help not with a smile but a scowl.

Whilst swimming my son asked the instructor who was giving a lesson to another girl if he could borrow some goggles - the helpful answer was ""No""

Positive -Breakfat staff were attentive and helpful

The rest of the stay went without incident but overal our experience with the staff spoilt this trip",2,2012,11,05
122,Part of stay in England,"The hotel was wonderful. The check in experience was easy and efficient. Our room was excellent and the service we received was great.
The location appeared to be out of the way, it was on an overground but their was no signage as to how to get from train to hotel. If not for the doorman the ""secret"" route through the garages would not have been known.
The most disappointing part of the stay was the arrangement for wi-fi. The cost was excessive. We found a small restaurant that had access for FREE. It is a small issue but for a hotel that everything else was first class I found this last class.
we enjoyed our stay immensely except for the above issue and thought London was wonderful.  ",5,2012,11,04
122,Beautiful hotel,We enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbor. Our accomadations were absolutely beautifu! The only bad part was that it was so far from the sightseeing aspects that we thought were within walking distance.,5,2012,11,04
122,Fantastic Stay for a family of four,"We stayed at the Wyndham for 2 nights during the kids half term holiday in October.  This is a all suite hotel so the room was perfect for a family of four, the rooms each have a master bedroom with ensuite bathroom with shower.  The lounge also doubles as a separate bedroom when the sofa bed is opened. The maid service turn down the beds each evening.  We pre-booked breakfast as you get a better rate, kids eat free also.  The hotel is a minutes walk from imperial wharf station and a couple of train changes later you are in heart of London.  

The swimming pool was great for the kids although depth is 1.5M, it was quiet and very private so they could enjoy a good splash around.  All the staff were very friendly and offered good advice of how to get around.  We also managed to meet the Chelsea FC team as they use the hotel before home games.  All in all a good stay",5,2012,11,03
122,London Trip,"Stayed at the Wyndham on my last trip to London with my daughter, hotel was fantastic great rooms and great service, was a little let down in the restaurant not with the service but with the choice of menu and the quality of the food but other than that it was great. Will be staying there again on our next visit",5,2012,11,03
122,Grand but not too grand.,"Limited access for a car driver makes it a little out if you have driven yourself there. We had booked a 2x twin room and the room was actually a double and a twin, and this was fine for our party but could cause confusion and disappointment for others. The rooms had the usual facilities plus a dinky coffee machine that uses pods. The coffee machine did not have instructions again this was frustrating. Downsides - one of the toilet cisterns was very noisy. The coffee and tea selection was just that no hot chocolate, we asked for some which never arrived. We were also recommended a restaurant outside of the hotel which was refreshing, unfortunately the promised name and address did not make it. The spa got a good review from our daughter and the staff were friendly enough. 

All in all we left feeling underwhelmed and were happy to choose other options on our next trip.",4,2012,11,02
122,Very Smart,"Stayed for 2 nights while visiting London with the grandchildren, everything top class with very polite professional staff.Easy links to central London, very manageable even with young children.
Suite very spacious and perfect for families.",5,2012,11,01
122,A Hiddem Gem,"I have used this hotel several times ! Without a doubt the suite concept provides the Largest pound per square foot in London !
Generous sized rooms with great views if you take a marina view room.
The bar and reception all recently renovated which has  improved the ambience substantially.
Very convenient for Chelsea and Fulham and peaceful which makes a change from more central hotels.
Service always good and refreshing to see the same faces each time I return.
Whilst the rooms are more than acceptable certain elements could do with being updated. 
Otherwise I would recommend the hotel highly

122,Wonderful hotel,We stayed at the Wyndham Grand as a family treat and can't recommend it highly enough.  The staff were very polite and helpful and very engaging with our children aged 6 and 10.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and the room worked perfectly as it had a double bedroom and separate lounge room with a large sofabed which was made up early evening for the children to sleep on.  Super powerful shower in bathroom.  The swimming pool is wonderfully warm and surrounded by extremely comfortable loungers so we were able to relax reading the papers whilst keeping an eye on our children in the pool.  Breakfast was delicious and worth every penny - lovely looking out at the boats in Chelsea Harbour.  We hope to return before long!,5,2012,10,31
122,Wyndham Chelsea Harbour,"I have stayed at the hotel many times, adore Chelsea and shopping on King's Road so location is perfect. Upon arrival being greeted by Paul every time who valet parks our car he is a delight and makes the moment I arrive at the hotel a pleasurable one. The suites are well equipped and I find the staff all very helpful. I stay in many hotels around London but the Wyndham is My firm favourite. ",5,2012,10,30
122,Yet again a lovely stay,"When you arrive your hotel and the door staff remember you it is a special experience.  I love staying here.  It is the best location and running along the embankment is special.  My stays are often short but always a pleasure.  I have yet to get the time to use the spa and gym facilities but maybe on my next stay I will do just that.  Thanks to the great staff for a lovely stay.

",5,2012,10,30
122,Cannot fault it,"We stayed in one of the penthouse suites during the Focus exhibition at the Chelsea Harbour design centre, directly next door. It is about 20 minutes in a taxi from e.g. Euston station (i.e. very central London). The view from the suite was awesome, looking over Chelsea Harbour (boats, yachts etc), and then over the Thames to the South Bank, Battersea Power Station, and to the left as far as Canary Wharf and the London Eye. The balcony is large and private with nice furniture. The suite was just stunning. Entrance hall with wardrobe. Separate toilet. Master bedroom with ensuite bathroom lovely. The lounge area was fully wood panelled with parquet floor, like a gentleman's drawing room. The balcony extended over the bedroom and living room. The hotel itself is very nice, good bar with good bar menu. We did not eat in the restaurant. For 2 of us, starter, 2 bottles of wine, main course was £100. They add on 12.5% service charge. The service is slick and you can hardly start complaining about service charges in this sort of establishment. The staff are helpful, all foreign but speaking clipped Queen's English, very impressive. Internet connection in the room was fine too. We did not use the spa. Breakfast excellent with wide choice. All in all I would love to stay again, it is the sort of place to go on a real treat, as a couple maybe. For us on business it suited our needs as the location was perfect. It is expensive for the average person e.g. Chelsea FC were in there when we checked out, and I feel the prices are geared for this kind of clientele, and why not. The area of London is one of the richest in Britain so the hotel are only providing what their market demands.",5,2012,10,30
122,As always the hotel and staff were cutious and professional at all times. Food and service impeccable.,"This is a special hotel full of proffesional caring people. The hospitality is exceptional.

We were married there on the 15/09/12 . We could not have had or asked for a better time. a memory to last a life time. i have been using this hotel for years and will contiue to do so. Thanks you so much.",5,2012,10,26
122,Weekend stay,"Staying at Wyndham Grand was a pleasant experience. All staff made us feel at home and always helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Pleasant atmosphere throughout. The room was welcoming, spacious and comfortable. We had to wait a little longer than expected for breakfast on our last day, but this was a rather busy morning and the staff were apologetic and they did their best. The food was well worth waiting for though. I would definitely recommend it. My only disappointment is the parking difficulty in the area, if one has to spend more than one night, the parking cost could be steep. 
Thanks to ALL staff for making our stay so memorable. ",5,2012,10,25
122,WYNDHAM GRAND LONDO SHELSEA HARBOUR,"Superb facility.  Hotel is expensive as is the food.   Really enjoyed the non-smoking floor.  Hotel is in a beautiful area, just a bit of the beaten path",5,2012,10,25
122,Second Stay,"My stay last July was probably one of the least enjoyable experiences I had at a hotel from the management to the cleanliness of the room. I wrote to management and and they offered me a lower discounted rate as well as a complimentary night to make up for the mishaps. 

We came to London and had booked a flat that turned out to be a nightmare and last minute had to book a hotel so we did so through the Wyndham. We were treated with smiles and the manager who treated us poorly last July didn't remember us but treated us very kindly upon our arrival. They honored the one night free and made every effort to ensure that our stay was pleasant. 

I have to say that after this experience, I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. If you like to walk, it's a good brisk walk to Hyde Park, and there are great cafes on Kings Road. Overall this was a superb experience and I highly recommend this hotel for your trip to London. It's definitely worth the extra dollars and I will make sure that this is my hotel for both business trips and pleasure. 

Thank you Wyndham Grand London for a remarkable stay.",5,2012,10,22
122,Business stay,"Summarising everything I am pretty much satisfied with the hotel, although the location was a bit too far from the center, the surrounding was beautiful.",5,2012,10,22
122,Great for a Weekend!!!,"All the rooms are suites so you certainly get plenty of space for your money, and the lounge area means you don't have to use the bed as a sofa if you want to relax in your room. 
There are several reviews that comment on the location being 'at the wrong end' of Kings Road, and in 'the middle of nowhere'. We found plenty of great places to eat and drink within easy walking distance, and if you want to travel further afield the overground station is just over the road, as is the bus stop. Gym and spa/pool great too, with a dedicated lift from within the hotel which means you can whizz back to your room in a robe & slippers straight out of the pool rather than carting clothes and bags to and fro!!!! 
Mini bar horrifically expensive, but then it's a mini bar in a 5 star hotel, what do you expect?! Slightly dissapointed to find the 'free' wifi is limited to the reception area, if you want it in your room you'll be charged £15 for the privelidge. There's good 3g coverage though, so not a problem.
As has been mentioned, checking in/out can be a slightly drawn out affair if it's busy because of the whole 'siting you down at a desk' routine, but really didn't bother us overly, especially as we managed to check in before 1 pm with no problems.
Overall a great weekend!!!",4,2012,10,22
122,Birthday weekend,"We booked four nights for my wife's birthday weekend. The room was very clean and tidy and the staff friendly. We booked a room with a marina view, disappointingly we were put on the first floor and could see nothing except the buildings opposite!! We didn't realise the hotel was under the landing flight path of Heathrow and close to a Helicopter landing pad!! The food was very good and room service excellent but wouldn't go back - not worth the money we paid for a London hotel.",3,2012,10,22
122,"Still great, but starting to slip","It's probably 9-10 years since i've first visited the Wyndham, or as it was back then the Conrad. Was visiting London for a friends birthday and they had a great offer on a certain booking website so I bucked my current trend of little places in Shoreditch and ventured to Chelsea once more. 

The hotel has undergone some light refurbishment, the reception area is now much more relaxed and lounge-ish, however certainly less efficient than the days of the Conrad, The rooms are actually still the same. They are still very good, the space is unbeatable, however the carpet is starting to look tired and the walls/furnishings are starting to show their age, the bathrooms are looking positively vintage for 2012. 

I was staying in the same rooms back in 2002-3, They've updated to LCD TV's since my last visit in I guess 2009-10 and they have an espresso machine in the room, but i fear these are small efforts to gloss over the reality that the hotel has fallen behind the times and is in need of a complete refurbishment. 

We paid £160, had I paid the rack rate i'd be pretty upset, don't forget breakfast is £25 a head on top (which for the record is just outrageous unless Gordon Ramsey is going to hand it to you himself) I actually ventured to Starbucks for my breakfast on Kings Road and returned to a few jealous glares, a couple in reception stopped me and said ""thank god, someone knows where to get a coffee without a mortgage, where do we go"" add to that parking is £20+ a night, it all creeps up and I just think the polish is starting to dull a little. 

This hotel has so many special memories for me I will always want to go back and will always root for it to be great, I hope the corporation who owns it will invest what's required.",4,2012,10,21
122,Fab weekend!,"After getting a great deal on Hotwire we had a lovely stay here. Although slightly out of the centre, the are bus and train links plus pubs and the Kings Road in easy walking distance so ideal for a mix of relaxation and sight seeing.

The pool area is also lovely with space to relax as well as working out!",4,2012,10,21
122,Nice stay,"Nice rooms for a great price. Enjoyed the ambiance and the quietness of the hotel. Pretty cool and environment friendly. Staff were nice and service, cool.",4,2012,10,20
122,Very nice place,Hotel and staff where great. Rooms are a good size considering other hotels dont offer king size beds. Free Wifi would have been nice,4,2012,10,19
122,poor start but Hotel really redeemed itself to make stay excellent and recommended,"Arrived at hotel and greeting was good.  We were early and room wasn't ready which was fine.  We were told we'd be called when room was ready... but we weren't.  And room, when we did get in wasn't of the quality we'd expect nor did it match its description.  After having to call back reception 3 times we were eventually moved and from thereon in the service was better than 1st class.  The suite rooms (all rooms are suites) are of high quality and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Would (and have) highly recommend despite the early hiccups!  ",5,2012,10,19
122,Birthday Trip,"Great hotel - excellent location for Westfield & Kings Rd. Great shower good sized rooms, need  bigger TVs",5,2012,10,19
122,great,Great hotel!  Enjoyed the stay.  Very Clean & Comfortable.  Nice suite accommodations.  Had an issue with the wireless internet but an IT guy came and fixed it for me.  He had to call the internet provider.,5,2012,10,19
122,Peter and Marie barrett,"An ideal location to experience London by walking along Kings Road to Harrods, or along The Thames to Covent Garden, we will be back soon. All the Hotel facilities are first class, the swimming pool is ideal.
The planes flying over in the morning were interesting ! though not a problem.
TV system could be improved.
Cost of drinks from mini bar a bit high.
Shower cubicle could have been larger.
We had full breakfast included but were asked to pay an extra £16.00p each for scrambelled egg and smoked salmon ! so instead we had just scrambelled egg and then received the smoked salmon from the self service area ? surely if a full breakfast is included then",5,2012,10,19
122,"Space, luxury,  great location","This hotel lives up to the 5 star rating in every aspect.  The location on Chelsea Harbour is stunning with a terrific outlook.  Walks/jogs along Thames footpath are a welcome change from the bustle of Central London. Check out Imperial Wharf Park.  These are accessed right beside the hotel.  A two  minute walk reaches Imperial Wharf overground station which connects with district and other lines for the city centre. The Westfield Centre at Shepherd's Bush is a 12 minute train ride away.  The line also goes direct to Stratford. The Kings Road and Sloane Square a 30 minute walk from the hotel. The room was wonderful, spacious - sitting room and bedroom with super kingsize bed. Facilities in the room are excellent and the staff are welcoming and helpful.  Great breakfast and good dinner and bar menu.  Afternoon tea rates highly also. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - it would be my first choice for any future London visits.",5,2012,10,18
122,Extra special,"We chose to stay at the Wyndham as we were getting married down the road at Chelsea Old Town hall. Right from check in the staff were faultless and nothing was too much trouble. The suite was perfect and great for all the wedding preparations, including friends being able  to come up and say hello on the morning of the wedding. When we returned after our reception their was a complimentary bottle of champagne and strawberries in the room which was a lovely touch. We got a chance to use the swimming pool which was fabulous so overall it really added to our happy occasion.",5,2012,10,18
122,Excellent stay,"Excellent from both domestic and business aspects. Great room, exceptional meeting facilities on top floor, friendly & efficient staff, good catering.",5,2012,10,16
122,London,"In general it's a great hotel and I've been a loyal customer for many, many years. That said, the usual loyalty awards, such as a bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine are no longer offered !!! I still like the location, away from the hustle and bustle of central London.",4,2012,10,10
122,"Great hotel, but a few simple mistakes which let it down","This is a great hotel and we really enjoyed our stay. It is a proper five star hotel in a fantastic location. The room was great, very spacious and well equipped. The staff were fantastic, the breakfast was first class and we will go back again. My feedback may seem petty but I will try and make it constructive, to help you make the hotel perfect.

1.) Housekeeping knocked on the door at 09.30am. There is no need for this. The front desk know when people have checked out. If they haven't checked out then they are still probably in the room. This is just a lazy housekeeping department not checking with the front desk. We were here for a break and were having a lie-in. 

2.) Why charge a ridiculous fee for in-room internet access? Most people will not pay it but it makes them feel annoyed. So everyone looses. Hotel gets no revenue but the guest feels aggrieved. 

3.) You supply a fantastic in-room espresso machine..............with no instructions. There are three unlabeled buttons on the front. I'm good with technology and I have an espresso machine, but I couldn't work it. If I can't work it then I doubt many people will be able to.

I hope you take this information on board - especially sorting out the housekeeping process.",4,2012,10,08
122,Elegant hotel with professional staff,"Our original hotel was overbooked and we were sent to the Wyndham. I had never heard of the Wyndham Grand before, but I am extremely glad we were sent there! A very elegant hotel with super efficient and professional staff, who were also very helpful and friendly. Our room was immaculate with a very comfortable bed and amazing big squishy pillows. Complimentary water dotted everywhere and a great coffee machine in the sitting room. Had a great night's sleep and a lovely breakfast overlooking the harbour in a stylish breakfast room. I fell in love with the huge round chandelier that hangs in the lobby! The overground train is a short walk from the hotel and gets you into town quite quickly. All in all, a pleasure from start to finish. Highly recommended.",5,2012,10,08
122,Just fantastic,"We have stayed at the Wyndham Grand quite a few times and just love coming back every time.  Staff are attentive, friendly and helpful.  Food in the restaurant is really good and the rooms probably cannot be bettered withtheir size, facilities and their views over Chelsea harbour.  I also have to say that we once enquired as to who supplied the pillows in the room as they were so lovely.  The person on reception said he would pass on the enquiry to the Head of Housekeeping when they were next in and get back to us.  Absolutely true to their word the information came back on the very day we were told that the Head of Housekeeping was back at work.  Well done Whyndham Grand! ",5,2012,10,05
122,The worst experience ever,"I leave been staying at this hotel for yrs and sad to have to report what happened during my last stay 

After having a nice family outing to see the a fulham football match we went back to the hotel and caught the lift to the floor our room was only to be followed by a male that was high on drugs follow us to our room and tried to force his way into our room.

After some pushing and shoving we managed close our rom door and rang reception to report the issue.

They were very surprised and said they would have security up on the floor straight away.

10 min latter the dept manager rang and said the person has been removed from our floor and being interviewed by security.

So at this stage we felt comfortable to leave our room and go to the Lots road pud for a stiff drink and dinner a local pub 100m from the hotel 

So you would think all should be good right, well no as the same person who tried to enter our room now entered the pub, we were worried he would recognize us and who knows what a male on drugs could do to us.

Luckily he didn't recoginze us 

After leaving the pub we walked back to the hotel and went to our room only to find the maids that arranged our beds didn't close our room and anyone could have entered our room and stolen passports etc 

Its so sad that this hotel has such poor management and it's being run as well as it should 

They have said that procedures have been reviewed and trust this wont happen again

I am surprised this even happend 

They also could even get the bill right, being charged for Internet usage that should be free being a rewards member and not even a personal note from the manager saying sorry 

Sorry for the sad note but I felt I had to outline my weekend experience ",1,2012,10,04
122,Simply Amazing,"This hotel is just outstanding, staff are friendly and cannot do enough for you. Its in a easy to reach location by undergound and overground connections and we will certainly be going back again (when we've saved some pennies!!). Certainly a treat we will never forget.",5,2012,10,04
122,Holiday,"Good service received, clean room and atmospher. I fealt relaxed during my state at the guest room. But the rates are quite expensive.",5,2012,10,04
122,A haven of peace and space,"Stayed Saturday night.  Have stayed in many london hotels and loved this one more than any.  What did I like?  I loved having a balcony and sitting out overlooking the marina.  I loved the view ofthe eye, the gherkin and the shard.  We had breakfast delivered to our room, something my dh hates as he likes to sit up to a table but it came on a proper table, beautifully cooked, eggs still runny and even  with a toaster so we could have hot fresh toast.  Hubby  even thought that was great.

The cocktails are exquisite.  Yes they cost us an arm and a leg but the rhubarb martini was a work of art, sieved and strained by the bar man.   We sat outside on the terrace under a beautifully heated umbrella land weren't cold even with no jackets on.

 The food in the restaurant was good, I thought the menu was a bit safe but everything was perfectly cooked, steaks and tuna all rare as requested and was the sort of menu the rest of our party like.  The restaurant is a little large for my liking and wasn't full (but not many people eat in their hotel restaurants in London)the selection of freshly baked breads were delicious.

The pool was nice and big and warm and the under water foot massages were nice.

Yes it's not in central central London but the imperial wharf station is adjacent to the hotel and an easy change to get on to the underground.  The concierge said that Fulham broadway is only a fifteen minute walk.

We liked this hotel a lot and would return especially if we intended doing something over this side of London.

Any drawbacks?  One small one.  If you sit on your balcony the flight path is directly overhead but if you enjoy plane spotting then that could be considered a bonus!",5,2012,10,02
122,Still as good as the Conrad,"This is still an excellent hotel, probably my favorite in the UK for type of rooms and service we have stayed here about 10 times. Breakfast was excellent freshly made and to a high quality. There are only 2 things that i am not over keen on. The location is a little to bit far out of London for a city break due to traffic and cab was £40 from St Pancras and quite often you bump in to Chelsea footballers who are an arrogant bunch of children. Also seen The Murray brothers there, Tim Henman, Leona, Ray Quin, Brian McFadden, Jose and Sven so always quite interesting. Great stay if your out in West London, Chelsea and Kensington and we will return again. ",4,2012,09,28
122,Need free internet,"I loved this Hotel, beautiful rooms. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was that they charged for internet. They do have free internet access in the lobby just not in the rooms.",5,2012,09,25
122,Nice stay at the Wyndham,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour for one night on the 18th of September. There was a big disappointment as the room we had booked was not the room allocated to us. We booked a King Riverview room and were instead given a Twin Harbourview room. Not really sure if it was the fault of the hotels’ central reservation team or Expedia through which we had made the booking. However, despite this mistake which at the time I was very upset about, the hotel itself is extremely pleasant.
The rooms are all suites and are nicely furnished and spacey.  The bedroom has a very decent sized dressing area and there is an extra toilet by the lounge. The shower although not very large, is absolutely brilliant. It has a rain showerhead and operates by simply pressing a button. The water comes straight out at the correct temperature and the pressure is very good. The rooms do come with both a CD player and an Ipod dock which is very handy and of course there is tea and coffee making facilities.
The gym is of a very decent size with good equipment and the swimming pool is lovely, with actual daylight which is nice.
Breakfast was ok but the service at breakfast was really terrible.
I had read in past reviews problems with drinking water. We did not see any signs that the water at the hotel is not drinkable and normal tap water in England is always safe to drink but if there is a problem, there is bottled water in the rooms and more is supplied at turndown.
I was very much impressed by the quality of the accommodation and facilities at this hotel. We have stayed in a number of hotels in London, all of which of a high standard, but we did particularly like this hotel. Maybe because of the balcony or the swimming pool or simply the comfort…I’m not sure. Of course it could be that because the hotel is slightly out of the way, it can afford to have the little extras that many London hotels can’t at a much better price.
P.S Valet carparking is £40 a day, so beware.",4,2012,09,25
122,Last minute success,We booked this hotel at the last minute for a one night stay on a Saturday. Once you get past the slightly pompous front of house staff it's fabulous. The suite was great with all the little luxuries you'd expect and the concierge very helpful in arranging taxis for us.Any extras not included in your rate were of course pricey though. Sadly I didn't have time to try the pool or the spa but I am looking forward to finding an excuse to stay again!,4,2012,09,25
122,weekend stay,Generally excellent hotel with superb service and friendly staff.toilet ventilation could be improved.transport connections are average--it  is a pity tube does not go near this hotel,5,2012,09,23
122,Elegant location but a bit off the beaten path,"The Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour is a 5-Star rated hotel. It is accessible via Club Wyndham points, but it will take a lot of them!  The surroundings are quiet and not at all touristy. It is in the design district of Chelsea. Antique shops abound as do interior design studios. Lovely and spacious accommodations- all suites. Best for adults. Not much for children. Cozy bar and nice restaurant. Pricey!  A nice little Italian restaurant is nearby. It's friendly and affordable. Getting into the city takes two station changes to connect from the overground to the underground. The Imperial Wharf overground stop is steps away. Get an Oyster or season pass to use the excellent London Transport system. It takes about 30 minutes to get to Picadilly during rush hour. if you want quiet and elegant, go for it. If you want convenient and bustling, don't. The staff is personable and attentive- that gets you 5 stars!",4,2012,09,23
122,Great Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a function and suite ,service and location excellent. I have stayed at this hotel before and service has stayed at a high standard. Breakfast excellent and the food at the ball was exceptional for such a large function. Also despite suite facing railway very quiet and very comfortable bed.
 ",5,2012,09,20
122,A little piece of Heaven!,"As soon as you step into the forecourt of this wonderful hotel, you know that the service is going to be first class.  The speed with which the so polite Concierge and his staff attend to you is second to none.  The young Spanish Receptionist, with his perfect English, makes checking in a real pleasure.  The suite is as you would expect, beautifully furnished and very spacious, both lounge and bedroom being a very good size.  The room service was excellent as was the food.  After a long business day, a delicious Club Sandwich was perfect.

My room was at the back of the hotel and if I had a criticism, the one thing I would have changed - and this is with my architectural designer hat on - was the noise from the freight trains that followed their long journey across the bridge.  In the lounge it was certainly noisy and had I designed the room I would have added extra sound proofing but this does not detract in any way from the wonderful stay I enjoyed.",5,2012,09,19
122,Very Good,"I really enjoyed staying at your hotel. It was a business trip I stayed with my colleagues and we had great time having breakfast , drinks at the terrace. Rooms are very nice and balcony is one of the greatest things in my room. It was one of the most comfortable stays I had.  Will come back again!",4,2012,09,19
122,Child friendly,"I had stayed at this hotel before, but thought it too far away from the center of the city.  We were traveling with our 11 year old granddaughter and had a rather nasty experience in another 5 star hotel that thought dogs ranked well above children.  The fact that this hotel had a children's menu and specifically catered to children made our stay a very pleasent experience.  I travel to London on business quite often and will stay here more often.  I will also make a point of recommending this hotel to many of my business colleagues.  ",5,2012,09,18
122,Great hotel in a strange location,"When we booked the Wyndham we knew what we were doing, at first the location sounds strange but eventually found the near Overground works nicely, even very good on the way to Twickenham for the venue of Lady Gaga.  no thing to say on the hotel, whose rooms are over any expectations. service and staff of level. Not fit for first timers. Definitely not cheap but worth. Unique problem, not minor, the pay wi-fi, it's offered free also in 3-stars hotels. 15 pounds a day is nonsense. ",4,2012,09,16
122,AWESOME HOTEL,"i HAVE STAYED AT THIS HOTELMULTIPLE TIMES AND THE SERVICE IS IMPECCABLE,Huge rooms, clean and luxurious and reasonable I would recommend this hotel to anyand everyone",5,2012,09,14
122,Best experience so far!,"I had the most fantastic stay at this hotel and would recommend it to everybody!It was a stunning hotel with lovely staff and clean spacious rooms.
The views from marina view were so spectacular!A dream!",5,2012,09,14
122,Great hotel but high wifi prices let it down,"Probably one of the best rooms in London you can get. Bar and restaurant  serve good quality food and drink and the pool / gym excellent. If you need to stay connected via wifi for a long time, the costs are ridiculous for a 400 quid a night hotel. The location has a pleasant view over Chelsea harbour. The area around it is a little sole less, but you are never too far away from all the attractions of London. Only other slight downside is that if you are a light sleeper, it's on the heathrow flight path and the planes start going overhead from about 6am.",4,2012,09,13
122,HIDDEN GEM,"PERFECT AS ALWAYS, and thats why we return time and time again, year after year. A great hotel for both pleasure and business. Long serving staff make the hotel a delight; including Abdu, and George at the Reception area, and Elizabeth in the bar. Great staff who go the extra mile to make you very welcome.",5,2012,09,12
122,Family trip to London for the paralympics,"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for families with young children. The rooms are spacious and well furnished and children eat for free at breakfast . We paid £10 each for a full English breakfast, which we thought was good value for money .It is a little further out from central London than other hotels, but it is well connected by buses and an overland train which also connects to the underground, so we did not find this to be a problem. The hotel is on the flight path for Heathrow as most areas are, but we did not find this to be problem providing the windows were kept closed at night. It is much quieter than most other hotels I have stayed in before. If you can, ask for a Marina suite since some of the Chelsea Suites may experience noise form the nearby railway. Overall a great place to stay and we would certainly return.",4,2012,09,12
122,Absolutely Terrific,"At last I have found my perfect London hotel.

Superb location
Spacious and well appointed room
Excellent staff, so polite and well trained
Spotlessly clean
Excellent value for money
Very good food, both dinner and breakfast.

I had a family occasion to celebrate and I would like to thank Alan for organising our table on the terrace.

The GM should be very proud of what he is doing there.

Simply cannot wait to return.

A massive well done.

122,Great friendly and helpful doormen,"The doormen make this hotel, they are friendly and helpful and can't do enough. The luggage porter is also extremely efficient and welcoming.",4,2012,09,11
122,once again disappointed with this hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel for many years...when it was a Conrad Hilton..it was great. When it became a Wyndham...i tried it and would always be disappointed....The price point is very good and the rooms are very spacious...so i always hope, year after year, that the service would improve....and it hasnt. They have not figured out how to get people checked in timely. I wrote in advance and asked for an early check in but did not get into my room until 330..despite being told evey half an hour it was going to be a half hour more. The attitude at the check in desk was not helpful.Each day in the afternoon there were peopel waiting for rooms..all after 2pm. My favorite hotel in London is the Churchill (Hyatt) having stayed there approximately 90 times...there check in policy is 2pm, not 3pm at the Wyndham. ALso...door slams throughout, a mediocre at best maid service. Again, one step forward and two steos back. I soend aprox 100 nights a year in hotels and never again at this place...i deserve better.",3,2012,09,11
122,Great Hotel,"It was excellent in every thing 
it is a family hotel
Very frindly staff
clean and quite
location is good but far from central",5,2012,09,10
122,Ask for Balcony,"Joined friends here for a weekend stay before some traveling throughout Spain. Did not have a balcony suite and found the view to be disappointing. The hotel is very close to an overground station (less than 5 mins walking), making it about 20 min commute by tube to central london. Beds are comfortable (if you ask for two, you will get 2 twins, not 2 queens) and the suite was a nice home base for touristy visits. The overground stopped at around midnight during our stay (Olympics?) and we ended up taking a cab back to the hotel (~8 pounds) at night. Amenities are nice, internet is pricey, but overall the hotel was as expected and I would return if ever in the area.",4,2012,09,10
122,lovely venue for romantic weekend,"A lovely hotel for a quiet break.  Room with balcony overlooking marina was worth it as it was very beautiful especially at night.  

Best bits include huge comfy bed, breakfast and the lovely little touches e.g. shower products!

Faults include the separate male/female sauna & steam room in the spa (felt a bit functional rather than luxury, a wedding disco rather ruined dinner as their dance music could be heard loudly in the restaurant which didn't work with the live pianist, also there was confusion with the bill.

Overall it was a lovely stay and very comfortable hotel.",4,2012,09,08
122,Smoking,My Balcony room was fab...alas the balcony is used for 'SMOKING' The Hotel provides and ashtray on the outside table!! Crazy. The wind blows cigarette smoke straight into the room contaminating the lounge....such a shame for me as very sensitive to cigarette smoke.I shall stay again but request a room with no balcony and hopefully that will do the trick,4,2012,09,08
122,Dinner in the restaurant,"We took a table out on the terrace, the view was superb, it was like being many miles away from London. The outlook was the small Harbour that was illuminated and made it feel very European. The terrace has a chef cooking fresh food on a BBQ grill as well as more hearty dishes coming from within the building. 

We had a great dish of lamb and sweetbreads.Very enjoyable!

I will make a point of staying here in the future!",4,2012,09,07
122,Another great stay,"We are Chelsea season ticket holders so this hotel is ideally located for us, it's also a bonus that alot of our players live there for a period after signing for us and the team often meet before games.",5,2012,09,07
122,Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour,A lovely hotel friendly staff. Although a quite location it is adjacent to the overland rail and was noisier then I thought during the night. Having said that it is very convenient to get to central London in 20 minutes. The suite was great for a family of 4. The mattresses were Ok but the bed was creaky ! The parking was £27 per 24 hours in the adjacent multistorey,4,2012,09,05
122,Space in Chelsea,"Our second trip to The Wyndham Grand, which attracts because of its good size rooms and ease of access.  Parking charges had doubled however, from twenty pounds a night to forty pounds a night since our last stay. Very efficient check-in and also great help from the concierge team who were able to source top tickets for both Wicked and Matilda. There is a five per cent charge for this, which whilst very reasonable, was not mentioned at the time we booked the tickets. A good buffet breakfast with hot food from a menu, and perfectly reasonable food for lunch and dinner,though only really one restaurant to choose from within the hotel. For a good, but pricey Indian Meal, Chutney Mary's restaurant is only five minutes walk from the hotel. You pay for internet access, though this was waived upon signing up for the hotel's loyalty programme. The hotel is often used by the Chelsea football team and we also just missed Jedwood at breakfast!!. The other advantage on leaving is that we were on the A3 in minutes as opposed to battling with traffic, had we been in a more central London hotel.",4,2012,09,04
122,Great hotel,"Excellent hotel, fantastic rooms and a nice stay.

Sit down check-in setup is a nice concept but not efficient.",4,2012,09,04
122,Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour,"We stayed here in August overnight in two suites, rooms overlooking the harbour nice and clean and bed very comfortable.  Would definitely stay again if going to London.",5,2012,09,03
122,Superb,"We would definitely stay again , the rooms are beautiful and the staff and porters are very helpful .
The hotel is just a short distance from kings road and Kensington is £10.00 in taxi, perfect for us as our son got to have photo with Chelsea FCC manager and met few players who were more than happy to have pics with him .

122,Excellent stay,Quiet and very peacefull great hotel good location by the river and transport to central london easier than expected. Weather could have been better for riverside walks,5,2012,09,03
122,A truly first class hotel,"Absolutely loved the Wyndham Grand, Chelsea.  The staff are excellent and eager to please.  Sheets turned down in the evening and complimentary water replaced. The room I stayed in was superb, with a view of the harbour.  The only set back was that the WiFi in my room had a bit of a problem after a couple of hours, but when I called the reception to complain, the charge for the WiFi was immediately reversed before I asked.",5,2012,08,29
122,Anniversary celebration,"The hotel is excellent, with spacious rooms. The service is first class, and the food was lovely. The location is ideal, just a few hundred yards from The Kings Road. The friendliness and professionalism of the staff is as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.",5,2012,08,28
122,A very pleasant four day stay at the Wyndham Grand.,"This was my second stay at this hotel and I found it as satisfactory as the first time. The staff are very efficient, very helpful and friendly. The hotel location is excellent with regards to shopping and restaurants, some of which are very easy to walk to. Cleanliness is very important to me, especially if I am staying somewhere for a few days, and I could not fault the hotel on this. We were staying in one of the suites which has a harbour and river view, and it really was quite beautiful.Wonderful to sit out on the balcony early in the morning with a cup of coffee. I think well worth the money for the view alone and everything in the room was well placed and very comfortable. We were there for a family celebration and the hotel were very accommodating  in providing a special family breakfast for us, including family who were not staying at the hotel, and provided one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had in a long time. Amazing choice to be had.  I do have only two small criticisms . It would be nice to provide ordinary packets of coffee in the rooms as neither of us cared for expresso, although the machine is a nice touch and a greater variety of teas.  It also would be helpful if at check out you are provided with a full account of your expenses and not like I was, charged a further  £250 on your credit card a day later. The charges were founded, but I checked out at midday and that should have been enough time to gather all the bills in the hotel . However, this did not take away from the pleasure of staying at the Wyndham and I intend to return later in the year. ",5,2012,08,28
122,Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour,"Great hotel.  Locations leaves something to be desired.  Taxis required to get almost anywhere.  Still, overall it was a more than satisfying stay.",5,2012,08,27
122,A room with a view,"The customer service at the Grand is exceptional, very welcoming and extremely efficient, I would definately recommend and will definately stay again, probably in my top 5 hotels I have ever stayed in. The accomodation is comfortable, and of a very good quality, the public areas are lovely. ",5,2012,08,25
122,the best I've ever stayed at in London,"It was from A to Z TOP. Good service, very nice stuff and a very beautiful location. Till now we have always stayed at the Ritz, the Mandarin or the Sanderson and only went there because the people we met wanted to go there. the only disadvantage might be the 10 minutes ride to central London. apart from that it is all perfekt. the rates are really low in comparison to the other Hotels we've chosed so far and the evenings in the Chelsea Harbour Area were superbe. The Bar, the Lounge and the restaurant near the Lobby are as fantastic as the Lounge and the Bar on the top floor of the Hotel. The gym is fully equiped and the indoor pool as well as the Spa and Sauna are great. We will definitely go there again by our next trip to London! ",5,2012,08,24
122,Perfectly perfect if a little tucked away.,"This is a staggeringly beautiful place to stay!
We stayed here with our two kids in a suite with a sofa bed larger than a king for the kids and , in the bedroom, a queen bed for us! Lush!!
The staff are happy to do anything for you without making you feel uncomfortable if you don't tip.
Position wise, you find yourself a £13 journey from Kensington or the Science Museum. The train trip from imperial nearby is only 3 minutes to the underground but it runs only twice an hour.
One thing to remember is that this is a great place with great food and great staff!!
Enjoy it if you can afford its high but worthy costs. ",5,2012,08,23
122,August last minute stay,"Reservations staff were very kind and efficient

122,"Fantastic view, fantastic location","I stayed here for a spa weekend for my birthday with a friend. The hotel and apartment was fantastic, we upgraded to a room looking over Chelsea Harbour. The room had a balcony and we could sit out looking over the harbour. The weekend exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be going back.",5,2012,08,20
122,London Olympics stay,"Stayed in a harbour view suite and absolutely loved the room.  Had breakfast most mornings at the hotel and ordered a room service breakfast one morning.  Very good food quality.   Absolutely superb service by all the various hotel staff during our week stay.  While the hotel is definitely out of the way from Central London, it worked out well as we often just got on the very close Imperial Warf overground train and rode it all the way east to Stratford where it let you off at the Olympic Park!",5,2012,08,13
122,Superb Hotel!,"Excellent hotel, the room size was really impressive, compared to standard rooms in London. The service is very good, nice view on the harbor. The only negative thing would be the location.. I had the impression of being in the middle of nowhere.. We used to take a taxi to Earls Court for 10 pounds +/- to avoid walking for ages to the DLR.. But the hotel on itself is perfect ... The shower is the best!!",5,2012,08,05
122,"Fawlty Towers without the humour - Over priced, lousy location, few facilities that work","I was in London this week to attend a business summit and the Olympics. The summit organizers had blocked booked this hotel which purports to be a luxury suite only hotel.  Firstly the location is awful.  Chelsea harbour is in the middle of nowhere with no pubs, cafes or interesting streets nearby.  The area is also unfriendly.  I was out taking photos and was approached by a security guard who told me that I couldn't take photos without a pass within Chelsea Harbour. After I checked into the hotel I was taken to my room and told along the way that wi fi was free in public areas but a paying guest like me would have to pay an extra $25 to access it in my room.  Who charges for wi fi these days? Especially in an already very expensive hotel. The 'suite' turned out to be a medium sized open plan room. Compared to suites that I've stayed in all over he world it was tiny (about half the size of a Courtyard or Embassy Suites in the USA).  Anyway the much vaunted $25 wi fi didn't work work so I asked to be moved to a room where it would work.  I was moved - guess what? Still didn't work! An IT 'expert' appeared but then disappeared. The only place I could get a connection was in the hotel reception area. When I had a shower (no shower curtain) the head fell off the shower.  The view was of a local railway station. Finally its a $35 taxi ride to central London. There are much better choices.",1,2012,08,03
122,great hotel,"This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in,everything was almost perfect and the suite overlooking the marina and thames was absolutely fabulous, walk a hundred and fifty metres to the local pub as the atmosphere is great beers cold and it has a couple of aussie barmen.",5,2012,08,02
122,EXCELLENT STAY,"Stayed at the Wyndham Chelsea Harbour before. As before our stay was faultless. This is a wonderful all suite hotel. The rooms are spacious, so clean and very comfortable. I highly recommend it.

122,Great family friendly hotel,Great hotel with excellent facilities and staff.  We stayed with our two young children and they were made to feel very welcome.  The room was a good size and we would recommend the breakfast.  We will definetly be looking to stay here again when visiting London.,5,2012,07,26
122,Nice hotel,"We enjoyed our stay here.  The room was nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  The harbor area was very pretty, even in the rain.  There are some really good restaurants nearby.
The only downsides were the price of drinks in the bar (crazy expensive) and the location is a bit far from the city center.  It takes about three trains to get to any of the major sights.  Not a big deal, but when traveling with a young child it can be challenging.  Overall we liked it and would go back.",4,2012,07,24
122,"A wonderful comfortable, friendly Hotel",A very nice place to stay with excellent comfortable rooms . The location is a bit out of the way but the staff work hard to ensure you enjoy your stay. The food is good without being great. I will use the hotel again but not when I have appointments in the City.,4,2012,07,24
122,"Luxury hotel, wedding night stay","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights after our wedding, it is a beautiful hotel, staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was spotlessly clean and had a great view. downside was that the bathrobes were not soft, they were quite stiff and rough.
The location is perfect for a quiet break, very peaceful. The food was very nice, drinks at the bar are expensive (a bacardi and coke and a bottle of bud cost £18.60) and they do not sell draught beer, also the minibar in the room has ridiculous prices (£3.50 for a can of coke, £2.50 for a kit kat, £5.50 for a bottle of beer) . 
I would defianatly stay there again for a special occasion but too expensive otherwise.
Our 2 night stay cost just over £700, including breakfast and dinner on ONE of the days.",5,2012,07,24
122,Dependable,"Another great stay at the Wyndham. This is our favourite place to stay whenever we are in London as we can depend on them for a comfortable, clean stay. The rooms are great, the staff friendly and helpful and the food excellent- both in the restaurant and via room service. 
Only advice to the hotel are 1) extra blankets are a must for a family and its best to stock the room with a couple because no one wants to sit with a whiny child at 3am and have to bother housekeeping, 2) skip the free fruit- it's usually half-spoiled and unappetizing. Spend the money on some complimentary tea biscuits/biscotti to go with the great espresso machine.",5,2012,07,23
122,Home is not where you live - it's where they know you,"Have been staying at the Wyndham regularly for the last 4 years. Never disappoints, except when they don't have any rooms. Staff recognize me and are very professional and accommodating. If you're lucky, the view can be amazing.",5,2012,07,23
122,Grand London Chelsea Harbour Hotel,"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at!! Everything was perfect from the room, and to the facilities. The location is a bit remote, but we enjoyed that part of it too. The staff was extremely responsive to all our needs. Thank you!",5,2012,07,23
122,Exclusive and wonderful,"Love this hotel. Very friendly check-in staff, nice location and great rooms with two TVs, a sofa and a super comfy bed. Despite jet lag, I slept well which usually never happens. I went there for a business meeting but also saw a lot of families staying during their vacation. The place caters to both groups easily. Want to come back and really enjoyed the stay.",5,2012,07,22
122,Great hotel just a bit out of the way,"Nice hotel , great staff - just out of the way in terms of public transportation. Concierge very helpful.",4,2012,07,20
122,Great Hotel,"First of all, this is a great all-around hotel. From the rooms to the lobby to the English breakfast to the location. It was an enjoyable stay. The staff was kind and everything was clean. If you are looking to relax this should be your first stop in London. If you are looking to sightsee, like us, it's even better. Just a short walk to the Imperial Wharf tube stop and easy access to cabs if you don't want to use the tube (it's very easy once you get used to it). Great views but don't waste your money on them. 

Overall, an amazing hotel.",5,2012,07,19
122,my reward program,I would appreciate it if you the hotel decided to add all my previous stays to my rewards program. Also they gave me different rates though I made the reservation for a long stay with what should have been a fix rate but they charged me daily which was not acceptable for me.,5,2012,07,18
122,Great Location!(Pity about the service from the Concierge),"Great location, lovely suite rooms and fabulous view from balconies. Our only disappointment was the service we received from the Concierge when we booked some tours. He double booked some of the tours on both my and my friend's credit cards and we had to spend quite a lot of time trying to sort it out. We were only in London for 4 days and had to waste valuable sightseeing time sorting it out. We both eventually received a credit for the over booked tours but are still out of pocket for the bank charges that our banks charged on the original incorrect charges. The Concierge also gave us incorrect train information on how to get to a particular place so that was another waste of a few hours.",3,2012,07,17
122,Vacation,Stay was nice.  room was clean and comfortable.  Knowledgable staff.  No issues except toilet mentioned below,5,2012,07,16
122,Best Hotel in London,"I know that is a massive shout... but because it is an all suite hotel, there are no bad rooms. I checked in a few weeks ago and the Chelsea Football Team were staying (when Chelsea are at home the hotel is generally rammed!) I checked in very late and had probably the last room in the hotel.. it was still magnificent. Big bathrooms, great views, furniture by armani???

I have stayed a number of times now and have also found the staff to be excellent!

For the money you get location, service and a cracking room.. tough to beat in London Town!",5,2012,07,16
122,Five Star Haven,"This hotel lives up to its star rating. The suite was a welcome haven after a busy day. The balcony view over Chelsea Harbor and London surrounds was a bonus. Allow extra time to get to attractions as traffic congested.  Room cleanliness above average, turn back service standard (impressive these days), mega comfortable beds and tasteful decor. Expresso machine a nice touch. Hotel restaurant excellent - the 20% dinner discount coupon placed in the room was good incentive to try. *Free internet would have been expected in this hotel's price range*. Disappointed we couldn't relieve aches after long flight -  called afternoon but only 1 slot (the next day 6pm), for a spa massage. Painfully loud music in the gym. Pool and changing area clean, adequate.  ",5,2012,07,16

122,"Luxury with style, chic, elegance and calm","Wonderful hotel.  We celebrated our anniversary and it was made memorable due to the fantastic service from all the staff, the setting and the relaxed surroundings.  From the suite we stayed in, riverside suite, which was fab, spacious, comfy, elegant and clean.  It was home from home, but luxurious and warming with wonderful views of the River Thames and the wonderful skyline of London.  We were made to feel very welcome, the staff were so attentive and at the same time, we did not feel they were in our face all the time, so we could really relax and chill out.  The food was fantastic with such aa wide array of choice, from the simple to the sublime.  We went for a lovely walk near the hotel and along the river which has lovely pubs and restaurants around, not too many, just right, so depending on your palet for that day, evening, you could choose, if of course, you fancied eating out as the hotel food was to die for. The area is very scenic in and around the hotel and the hotel was an oasis of calm and you would not imagine that you were in as huge a bustling city such as London.  It is a little bit out of the centre which is great if that is what you are looking for, but with very easy access to the largest shopping centre in Europe, Westfields.  I would reccommend this hotel, memorable stay and I am sure if you do stay, you will not be dissapointed. Dominic AE",5,2012,07,10
122,Luxury in London,Beautiful room - more like a suite than a standard hotel room with a separate lounge area. Bathroom well appointed and restaurant service excellent. Location nice but not that easy for public transport. Not on tube line so need to sort out train and bus service. Close to great shopping and good eating. Staff friendly although some of the accents difficult to understand. Wifi in lobby area frustrating to use.,5,2012,07,06
122,Wonderful London Hotel,"This is a bit off the beaten path but we stayed in central London for our first week for sightseeing, and then this hotel for our second week so we could be closer to Wimbledon.  Lovely hotel, beautiful room with two bathrooms!! And yes, a real King-Sized bed :)  Modern amenities, flat screen TV's, balcony.  One of the ground floor staff (Abdu) was so wonderful and helpful to us, recommending restaurants etc, everything he suggested was wonderful.  All of the staff was very pleasant, breakfast was delicious, I was very pleased here.  It's probably a little far from things if you are doing the regular tourist attractions, but otherwise I definitely recommend and will stay here again if given the chance.",5,2012,07,02
122,Enormous Room In Lovely Hotel!,"My parents came to visit me in London, and stayed here for 2 weeks. After seeing their ENORMOUS and beautiful room, I moved in with them! Absolutely huge, 2 baths, a sitting room and a true King Sized bed with lovely views of the harbour! The hotel is lovely, and has a very nice restaurant attached for breakfast and late night desserts! 
A WONDERFUL place to stay if you want to stay in Chelsea. It's a little off the beaten path, but for the price it is worth it! This is a 5 minute walk from King's Rd, where you can pick up the 22 or 11 bus to get practically anywhere in London, or take a lovely 30 minute walk all the up King's Rd.",5,2012,07,01
122,Nice hotel - decent location,"I was nervous about staying so far away from my normal stays in Knightsbridge and Mayfair; however, the location of the Wyndham is pretty nice.  It gave us a chance to explore the quaint neighborhood around the hotel while having easy access to the train to get to other locations easily.  In addition, the local bus goes directly to Knightsbridge and dropped us off at Harvey Nick's.  We really liked the opportunity to explore Chelsea, an area we had not explored in the past.  The hotel is clean, has water views.  The staff was very friendly and explained how to catch the bus and the train.  We enjoyed our stay.",4,2012,06,24
122,my Birthday ruined by the complete lack of acumen and customer service of this hotel,"I arrived at this hotel on the 18th June 2012 - my birthday;

I have stayed here before and although not perfect this  was quite a pleasant hotel.

Having booked my room via laterooms.com we arrived with my 6 year old son at 11pm - tired and desperate to get to our room. reception could not find the reservation - the menial called for his manager who could still not find the booking!  The card used for the reservation was requested and handed over but the applicaiton of the card details still provided no relief. 

I was asked to produce the email confirmation of the booking. I was asked to print that - how can you do that? 

No booking could be found. This would be understandable in rush hour times... possibly but with no others waiting this was quite hard to understand.

My 6 year old was left crying and exhausted whilst I had to log into emails to show my confirmation - which confirmed all my details but not even this was enough for the Chelsea Grand. I was required to forward the email to them.

30 minutes later,no apology given and the rudest duty manager I have ever encountered I got to my room - after producing the same car with which the booking had been made in the first place.

Considering I charge my time at £250 per hr and I wasted half of that on explaining basic hotel check - in procedure to this thing, I don't think this represents any sort of value.",1,2012,06,18
122,Great hotel and value for money,It is a great hotel with swimming pool and located close to overground and Tessco. Only drawback was that wifi was available in lobby only and not in rooms.

122,My Favourite Hotel in Town.,"Whenever I visit London, i always stay in this Hotel with my Mother, it is clean, fesh and Modern, the staff are helpful and nothing is too much trouble, 
The concierge service and valet parking make the stay easy and enjoyable. The restaurant has a good selection and is flexible with requirements. The breakfast is better than the Langham.",5,2012,06,11
122,Wow!,"Staff and service first class (Special mention to Craig serving on the terrace during the CFS!) Everyone contirbuted to our trip being memorable - we even saw Robbie Williams in reception before Socce aid - not that was a bonus!  It's a great venue and lunch on the terace with the sunshine made it feel like St Tropez :)
Thanks to all - this was a treat for my Mum and she loved it!",5,2012,06,11
122,Lovely Hotel,"My family and I stayed here when we came down for the Chelsea Flower show late last month, we were impressed by the fantastic rooms and attention to detail, the staff are lovely too.

122,London Favorite,"This hotel is now at the the top of our list for a favorite hotel experience anywhere!  We are travel industry people and have experienced a wide arrange of hotel and other accomodations worldwide.  Immediately upon arrival the attention to detail is prominently displayed by every staff member.  There is always a ""welcome back"" greeting at the front desk, and the personalized amenities in our room, always an excellent touch.  The staff at this hotel makes you feel as if you are the most valued guest with sincere friendly service that is not over the top nor insincere patronizing.  We love the stated elegance from the beautiful floral displays to contemporary art staged throughout the hotel, and we appreciate being in a more quite location, yet with easy access to get anywhere rather easily.  We love the harbour location!  We look forward to our next stay!",5,2012,06,07
122,Good hotel - not sure about value for money,"I am in two minds about this hotel. It was nice but not sure that I was wowed like I have been in other 5 star hotels. Luckily we did not book direct and therefore paid £280 for the night (exc breakfast). The room was large and had facilities such as coffee maker in room which was a bonus but although the room was spotless there was some litter on our balcony which was unexpected for a hotel of this calibre. 

Location wise it is slightly isolated but is only a 5 min walk to the kings rd and is right next door to imperial wharf on the overground line although it can take a while to get to central London and some of the main sights. 

Overall wld stay again if I cld get a deal and had to visit Chelsea or surrounding neighbourhoods.",4,2012,06,05
122,"Good view for jubilee river pageant but honestly, far from transportation and too expensive","Reception staff were lovely; room is beautiful and spacious. The reason I booked here, despite the extreme expense, was to have a river view of the Thames river diamond jubilee  pageant. The belvedere hotel or apts obscured the best part of the pier view, but it was still a good view. Problems were the extra costs of things. First, I asked if there would be any problems getting a cab in the morning and was told no. Then the concierge called and said that I should book a car since it would be iffy about getting a cab.now mind you, I caught a cab from St Paul's during evening hours on Saturday to the hotel and it cost twenty three pounds. To have the car hire take me, he quoted 25 pounds, and I repeated it back. I said, ""okay, for 25 pounds at 645 am on a bank holiday, that sounds reasonsable."" imagine my dismay when the driver asked for 35 pounds. I called Grand Wyndham to be told that was the price quoted to me off a list. I could hardly argue as I was at the station. I knew I should have gotten the quote in writing but I was so tired. Stupid me. Then, the wifi charge was about 15 pounds a day. Really? The exorbitant costs can't cover wifi? Sheesh.

122,Not totally 5*,We stayed for two nights and booked it through Booking.com ..obviously we didn't pay £850 a night and got a great deal..but our thinking was that we always stay in 5* hotels and this is the UKs only 5*all suite hotel so it must be better....it was nice but certainly nothing out of the ordinary.Our afternoon tea took over 30 minutes to prepare-and when it arrived had gristle in the chicken sandwiches..there were things missing out of the room that should have been there like spoons for the coffee and the leaflet advertising 20% off food was 6 months out of date.It didn't help having the hotel virtually  taken over by the soccer aid celebs and having doting fans outside the hotel.I would rate this hotel as a four star..but I'm rating it on our room and didn't see any other suites.,3,2012,05,29
122,Peace and quiet in a central London location,"Central London is a busy and hectic place ... but then you know that. This hotel however is like a peaceful oasis in central London. Our room was Harbour view (definitely worth that little bit of extra cost), so sitting on the balcony over-looking Chelsea Harbour with views out to the Thames was peaceful and relaxing. 

Great hotel - highly recommended.",5,2012,05,28
122,Wonderful,"I cannot fault this hotel, service perfect , rooms wonderful,  cleanliness excellent, what else can one say, I thoroughly recommend astray there,",5,2012,05,28
122,Great stay,Good service and excellent food! Lovely clean pool and room was spotless! Fantastic holiday in London,5,2012,05,15
122,Ideal Seclusion or just remote ?,"The suites are spacious, well appointed and clean. The balcony was sufficient size for a couple to relax comfortably, I suggest a suite that overlooks the marina.

Breakfast was not included in the rate and at GBP 23 per head is the same price as a decent Sunday brunch in Asia, However we tried one morning and were not disappointed, it was good. Cost aside it seems that the food is good, sufficiently so that Chelsea FC were eating there before their game with Newcastle.

There is also a classy looking on-site spa which unfortunately we didn't have the time to try.",4,2012,05,04
122,One of the best hotels in London !!,"Fantastic Hotel !! Probably one of the best hotels that I have stayed at in London. Staff were super efficient and very friendly. Room was just as described (in fact much larger than I expected - it puts ""Suites"" in other Hotels to shame). Food was top quality, Room Service was excellent. This was part business trip and part leisure and the Hotel was perfect for both. I put on my booking form that it was a birthday / shopping treat for the wife and they even made a small birthday cake for her as a surprise. I have read the other reviews and I can't believe the reviewer who gave it a one star and said the staff were unhelpful ..... perhaps his expectations need a sanity check as the people working at this hotel ..... from the front line staff right through to the General Manager were tremendous. A MUST STAY 5* HOTEL IF YOU WANT A GREAT BREAK IN LONDON. Gary C",5,2012,04,29
122,A Great Long Weekend,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights here and I absolutely loved loved loved. We had a marina view which was great to wake up to every morning, even on those rainy days. The room was almost too much room for 2 people. If anything, I would say I would appreciate an extra outlet in the bathroom, not just for a shaver. The concierges were really helpful. We never ate breakfast or dinner here so can't speak to that, but one of the concierges had recommended that we go elsewhere for breakfast on one occasion. It is a little hard to get to on public transport as other reviewers have mentioned...the closest stop is  via the Overground at Imperial Wharf which doesn't run that often during weekend nights and the District and Circle lines were being worked on that weekend so even harder to transfer to from the Tube. You can walk to the Kings Road with lots of restaurants and shops in less than 5 minutes and from there, meander down to Sloane Square, etc.",5,2012,04,26
122,An oasis of peace....,"Fabulous hotel with a suite overlooking the harbour.... the room was beautifully decorated and  had all the facilites one would need esepecially the quality toiletries and two loos!!! 
Walking distance onto Kings Road along the river (about 25 minutes in flat shoes!!)
The limo service was reasonable in Central London for travel connections etc.
The balcony lost the sun pretty early on which was a shame but all in all good value for London.",4,2012,04,24
122,Top Quality Hotel,"We spent a fantastic four nights at this super hotel and I cannot recommend it highly enough. All of the staff were pleasant, polite and couldn't do enough to help and are a credit to the Wyndham group. The suite was well furnished and perfect for our needs with our little girl having her own double (sofa) bed in her own room.  The pool is perfect, breakfast a real treat, brasserie and room service top quality and the perfect location. Brilliant value for money too.",5,2012,04,23
122,What a find....,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand in April - we were upgraded - free - to a 7th floor room overlooking the marina. The suite was perfect in every way. 
Plus points: attentive staff, spotlessly clean, cheap parking next door, super-comfy beds and as it's sited a little way from the action, a quiet night's sleep too.
Negatives: breakfast is ridiculously expensive, the bar was dead on Saturday night, so no atmosphere - you really do have to venture out for some fun.
Overall: will definitely return - but will taking breakfast with us!",5,2012,04,17
122,Great family stay,"This hotel gets a whole hearted seal of approval from us, staff all very friendly and helpful, brilliant with the children nothing too much trouble. The surrounding area is very clean and the walk round the harbour and river is very nice. We were doing the museums on this stay and to get to the heart of London was a short taxi ride costing average £14 for the 4 of us. If you have children and are thinking of staying in London look no further. Will most certainly stay here again, special thanks to Frank at the door, marvellous chap. Steve from Hereford.",5,2012,04,17
122,discovered i was expecting there,"we stayed for valentines day there and the whole way to the hotel was being sick, my husband pulled into boots and i got a test as i was planning on having champagne and wow what great valentines news, the hotel is lovely, amazing suite we stayed in and the food was top notch, shame the champagne we ordered was wasted but lovely hotel, would reccomend and hopefully take my son there for dinner soon",4,2012,04,13
122,"Great hotel, wonderful service.","We stayed in a River view suite for 3 nights which was spacious, modern and comfortable. The hotel was great but seems a bit out of touch when it comes to the pricing of some services!
Pros; Great location, lovely harbour views, staff could not be more helpful, clean, quality furnishings and decor, a great nights sleep due to comfortable bed, blackout curtains and quiet location.
Cons; Fresh milk in the fridge rather than UHT is a must when paying these prices, Wifi should be free as standard, in-room movies cost £20 which is scandalous, breakfast £26 which is crazy!",5,2012,04,12
122,Thoroughly Enjoyable Break,"Stayed at the Wyndham Grand for 3 nights over Easter. Weather was miserable but the hotel couldn't be blamed for that. Attentive friendly staff and beautiful room. We stayed on the 7th floor having a view of the River & Chelsea Harbour. My wife and I had had  spa treatment & massage which were both very good.

Plus points – Hotel is great - not too central which suited us and you certainly get more room space for your money here. There are plenty shops down Kings Road or Earls Court - £5/£6 in a taxi or plenty buses. Breakfasts were very good also. If you do want to go into Soho, Leicester Square etc it’s around £20- in a taxi or of course the less expensive option is bus / tubes.

Negatives that I’d say were, that it is expensive to sit drinking in the bar and one small criticism I’d have is that on the Sat evening whilst waiting in the bar for my wife to get ready before we went out I was asked by the waiter on ordering my drink “If I were a hotel guest ?” On confirming that I was he then asked for my room number  - as if he didn’t believe me, which was slightly annoying.

Anyway it certainly didn’t spoil what is a great hotel.",5,2012,04,10
122,Great Hotel and service,"Excellent hotel, ideally suited for Chelsea FC and the Kings Road. Excellent friendly staff, spotlessly clean, after poor experience at the Millennium (Chelsea FC) found this hotel by chance, an it is on a totally different level. Also had a suite overlooking the harbour. Slight criticism and only minor - the cost of breakfast, no free in room wireless and £20 for an in room movie is to much. Finally - getting a good nights rest is so important, this hotel is excellent, black out blinds, soundproofing and really comfortable bed - W New York take note!",5,2012,04,10
122,Very Relaxing hotel with pleasant staff,"My partner and i have just returned from a weekend at this hotel, we both would recommend this hotel, the staff are extremely helpful and pleasant, our room was 1st class very clean neat and tidy, we have no complaints at all food is very nice we had evening meal and breakfast overlooking the harbour. we would recommend this hotel",5,2012,04,02
122,Beautiful Apartments with some great views,"I only came across this place as a last minute thing but am so pleased to have stayed here.
We had a suite with views of the Chelsea harbour and it was very nice from the balcony, especially at night. We had asked for chairs to be put onto the balcony and everything was arranged when we got there.
The staff were extremly helpful in every way and the rooms were spacious and well equiped.
Good location as it's very close to the Kings Road area where all the boutique shops.
The west End and Knightsbridge are a few miles away so all in all good location. Car Parking is availabale round the corner in secured parking and you can walk directly",4,2012,03,29
122,Three hours to kill.,"I had three hours to wait for a client who was attending the Chelsea-Tottenham game. Where better to spend it in the Wyndham Grand overlooking Chelsea Harbour. I had a coffee in the bar and read the paper. It just happened to be my birthday so I decided to treat myself. I ordered the Seafood Pasta (which was excellent) and a glass of Champagne from the bar menu and sat on the balcony overlooking the Marina, which is a calm Oasis in this bustling part of London. It was a sunny day and sitting here was very peaceful. Less than half a mile away 60,000 people were having to watch 0-0 draw (yawn) but I felt a million miles away. The staff were very attentive and polite. The decor was modern and easy on the eye. The toilets were spotless with proper hand towels and pleasant smelling toiletries. i was made to feel very welcome and would visit again.",5,2012,03,26
122,"Fabulous rooms, great view, let down by indifferent service","The Wyndham is a fabulous hotel located at the prestigious Chelsea Harbour.  Having had a makeover last year, the decor is now very classy, modern yet welcoming.  The rooms are beautiful and luxurious, all suites with separate living areas and two bathrooms (!) and the fixtures and fittings are all of a luxury standard.

The bed is exceptionally comfortable with superb linen and the room was remarkably quiet during the night.  Breakfast in the morning was great, with bundles of choice, fresh juices, a breakfast chef making omelettes and a vast array of continental and traditional options.  Breakfast was expensive though, but in line with the cost of the hotel room itself.

A shame then that the service was so indifferent.  There was nothing particularly wrong per se, but the staff never went out of their way or made that one extra bit of effort that demonstrated they really cared about their guests.  The bar staff couldn't remember our orders, despite us having the same round four times, and when asked whether they could send the two bottles of champagne, glasses and ice buckets up to our room for us to finish there, we were met with a sigh of exasperation, a roll of the eyes, and ""I don't know if we have time to do that, but I'll ask and see what the manager says"".  It's not really is expected of a five star hotel and a definite blemish on our experience.",4,2012,03,19
122,Would be a 5* If the Grand had better management,"It all came down to one person ruining our stay.  Roberto- working in the reception area was a complete nightmare.  Very unprofessional, rude and could have cared less about our concerns.  Made us feel as if we were below him.  Was very aggressive in his tone with us as well. The whole experience of this hotel was soured by him.  

We have stayed at this hotel about 6 times in the last three months, and sadly to say we would never stay there again or recommend this hotel to any one.  We will actually warn people to make sure they don't go near the place.  On the plus side, the housekeeping staff was exceptional as were the doormen.  They have always been helpful.  It's sad that the management of this hotel hinders it from being a true 5 star.  Which it is not.  

The rooms are spacious though, but they could use a bit of an upgrade.  The location is also pretty poor.  Not much around... the better shops and restaurants on Kings Road are out of the way so you definitely need a cab.  The train at Imperial Wharf comes once about 30 minutes, so expect to wait out in the cold. 

Very frosty attitude from the reception.  As someone who has stayed in hotels all over the world, and true 5* hotels, again I must stress that this one is definitely not up to caliber.",3,2012,03,07
122,Excellent Holiday,Hotel was perfect for being in London. Didn't mind taking the underground or bus into the City since the Hotel was wonderful to come back to.,5,2012,03,06
122,"A very nice hotel, slightly off the beaten path","We had a wonderful four night stay in a comfortable suite after a week in a Mayfair hotel.  The spacious rooms were very nice in comparison to the large single room we experienced earlier in the week.  We found the Overground Rail access very easy to use to the north and traveled south to connect to train to Windsor for a wonderful day trip.  The bus near the Overground station traveled to the Earl's Court Tube Station for easy access throughout the city.  We were able to enjoy a show in Picadilly and a visit to Camden Market with relative ease.  The staff were always friendly and willing to help with any question.

Wonderful restaurants could be found on King's Road, a short distance away, by taxi, bus or even on foot.  Walks along the riverfront were quite comfortable, although in a definitely newly developing neighborhood.

The lack of internet in the room without a significant upcharge was suprise to us for a Wyndham property, although apparently standard for London.  Internet was available in the lobby and at the business center, but not always convenient.

Be careful when checking out.  We were asked if we wanted to pay in USD vs. GBP and were advised that dollars would be the better rate.  Wrong!  Paying in dollars was the worst deal we found during our entire trip.

I would definitely return for another stay here with due consideration of the cost and location of this hotel relative to other factors of the trip.",5,2012,03,02
122,A lovely hotel in a safe feeling area,"This is a lovely oasis area in London. You can walk round the beautiful riverside area and feel safe and relaxed.
If you arrive at Imperial Whalf then look round the platform until you see three domed glass roofs, exit the station so you walk towards them. Walk up the hill and in under 5 minutes you will be at the hotel, it is just past the design centre.
At the station you can buy one day travelcards. They will give free transport on any bus train or tube. If you purchase after 9.30am you get change from ten pounds.
About a two minute walk downhill from the hotel is the design centre, outside it is the c3 bus stop ,there is a very regular service.They go to Earls Court.
There is a riverboat service, but it doesn't run at weekends.
To get to the pub in Lots Road just walk out the hotel door and keep walking straight for three minutes. Great burgers, reasonable prices.
If packing light then this hotel has lots of free things for you. The normal tea/coffee plus very good quality shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, body balm. Also slippers, mouthwash, sewing kit,nail file, cotton buds, and free bottled water which was appreciated.
They put dressing gowns in the wardrobe for you so if you go to the spa you can go directly from your room there is a special tiny lift at the end of the corridor which takes you to the spa. Good massage. There is steam room and sauna but they do one for men and one for ladies.
We ate in the restaurant, the food was good and they achieved that top chef flavour that you can never figure out how they did it. If you are on a budget then the set menu has limited options but high standard food. it overlooks the marina which is lovely.
We got a great deal from spabreaks.com but the hotel has special offers on its web site.The staff were very nice.",5,2012,03,01
122,A reasonable hotel in the middle of nowhere!,"Having lived in London for a few years a number of years back  I thought Chelsea Harbour was quite close to the centre of town, it isn't. It is a very steep taxi fare away and the overground train station is not well connected at all.

Why the Hotel do not run a complimentary half hourly shuttle bus to and from Sloane Square is beyond me. 

Having said that, that is reflected in the price you pay for a clean functional no frills suite with reasonable amenities, an expensive but reasonable breakfast and the privilege of paying £15 for wi-fi connection in your room.

We checked in and had requested adjoining rooms, guess what we were told by one receptionist there weren't any and when we phoned down again the other receptionist said no problem and moved us instantly. What's that all about annoying to say the least.

The problem with the Wyndham is it's just reasonable absolutely no Wow factor at all.",3,2012,02,16
122,Excellent value suite hotel in London,"I have stayed at the Wyndham Grand 4 times in the last 2 years both by myself and with my family. It offers comfort and spacious suites at a competitive price. It suits business, leisure and family visits.

The hotel is clean and the public areas are comfortable and tastefully furnished. The bar area is relaxing and offers all days coffee, drinks and snacks. The restaurant has a pleasant ambiance and the standout for me was the breakfast. The staff were at all times efficient and courteous and the food of a high quality.

The rooms are all suites with really comfortable beds and spacious sitting rooms with desks and all the amenities you would expect from a top class London hotel. The one disappointment was the internet service in the suite which was slow and requires constant repeat log-ons. In addition, the hotel charges for internet access which is disappointing, given most top class hotels now offer this service free.

Generally, the hotel staff were most efficient. For me, the standout performance was from the various doormen who are constantly on hand to assist with taxis and advice. On previous visits they have entertained my 6 year old son constantly and on my most recent visit they were exceptionally helpful. 

The location of the hotel in Chelsea Harbour may appear a little far out from central London but my preference is for peace and quiet, whilst being a 10 minute taxi ride or a 15 minute bus ride to Sloane Square.

Overall, this is certainly a place to try if you want suite style rooms at a competitive price with a friendly, efficient and unpretentious service.",4,2012,02,16
122,Perfect for us,"Lovely warm greeting from the Doorman and Concierge right through to the receptionist. The room was fabulous for our family [2 children] and we asked for an extra bed as our 2 children do not sleep well together - it was free of charge and delivered and set up immediately. Beautifully styled , very spacious well equipped , sofa bed and comfortable king size bed - 2 flat screen tv's - gorgeous bathrooms and plenty of toiletries and we had an additional toilet in the room!
We ate dinner in the restaurant -  an expensive meal which was not up to the standard of the price tag but we could not fault the service and the friendliness of the staff . The restaurant only had 2 other tables occupied - very sad for such a lovely setting but the food was just OK.
Breakfast was good with exceptional service from Georgia - plenty of choice and truly international menu.The Spa was beautiful.
We definitely recommend this hotel especially if you are a family - so unusual to have such luxurious space in London. We found the travelling fine - the concierge organised longer journeys with Addison Lee and they were far cheaper than black cabs.
Enjoy it - we certainly did!",5,2012,02,12
122,1st class experience,"I first discovered this gem of a hotel through a relative and proceeded to check it on-line. The astounding reviews i read on Trip Advisor helped me make up my mind.This would be my 3rd stay  and i'v never been disappointed. The staff are so polite, helpful, warm and attentive. I love breakfast at the breakfast room. There are different varieties to choose from. The suites i'v stayed in have all been standard but they'r all spacious and extremely clean and so lovely. I absolutely love the beds which are super comfortable...the most comfortable beds i'v slept in! The bathrooms are gorgeous! I love the location which is posh and quiet though that can also be a downside for some people as there are no shops nearby to dash to.There's an overground train at the back of the hotel. What i love most about this hotel is the superb value you get for the money you pay. I'd definitely go back!",5,2012,02,08
122,truely five star,"From the moment we drove up we felt truely welcome, the doorman was so freindly and not stuffy and we were greeted in the reception area with a glass of champagne the people there were so nice and helpful, the room was very nice and large we had a 1 bedroom suite, we had a excellent stay and sleep and would stay here again in a heartbeat.  we walked to a wonderful little cafe called the rose pub, a bit of a walk but a lovely little neighborhood they had the best steaks with marrow butter, can still taste it in my mind.  It was truly a excellent stay and will revisit it again.",5,2012,02,08
122,"You won't get any better, PERFECT!","Having stayed in a number of London Hotels, I opted to try the Wyndham Grand. My stay was second to none and I am already planning my next visit. This all suite hotel clearly strives to give guests the personal touch whilst not being too invasive. For me they found the perfect combination. 
The train station is a 2min walk and 3 stops away is the Westfield shopping centre. You are also a short walk from the designer shops of kings road. If its peace you want then walking around the harbour you would never know you were in central london. 
Give this hotel a chance and I'm certain you won't regret it!",5,2012,02,01
122,"Good hotel, patchy 'extras'","We stayed here for two nights as a family of four.  At the notice we had, staying in the suits here was significantly less expensive than two rooms at a different hotel.

The compromise was the location but actually it was absolutely fine - it depends where you want to go in London, but we found it an easy journey to most places.  We had a day at the museums though - if you're headed for North London it might be trickier.  

This is not a 'family friendly' hotel, which is actually a positive as far as we were concerned.  It was extremely friendly towards our family, though.  The swimming pool is absolutely not designed with children in mind - it's single-level, deep and just a pool (with two 'fountains' on the side).  There are classy loungers on the side.  It's not a play pool.  However, it was empty every time we visited which was excellent for our kids, who obviously didn't care that the pool wasn't built with the in mind (and why should it have been), and just had a great time.  There was no designated swimming hours for children which worked well for us but could be a negative for other pool users.  However the pool was always bisected by lane dividers, so one half could easily be for 'serious' swimming.

The male changing rooms are tempoary and a bit of a trek from the pool.  The female ones were excellent - steam room and sauna, waterfall showers, hairdryers, towels and everything else you'd expect.

The room was excellent.  The sofa in the lounge folded down into a double bed for our kids - not terribly comfortable for an adult, but fine for our purposes.  The hotel happily removed the shelf of chocolate from the mini-bar area.

Bathroom facilities excellent, there was a balcony (this was the cheapest, non-water-view suite), with a table and chairs.  Main bed was huge and very comfortable.

In terms of quibbles, one major and two minor.  Around 6am the fire alarm went off, waking at least everyone on our floor.  We finally got through to reception to be told that a guest had been smoking in their room and set off the alarms, and to remain in our room.

Fine, these things happen - but the engineers were unable to turn off the alarm for almost half an hour, by which time the lobby and corridors were full of irate guests.  It was impossible to get back to sleep after that disruption.  No apology was offered by the staff.

Minor quibbles: we ordered from room service on the last night - the children's portions were huge and the food was great.  However the adults' two-course dinner was delivered without covers, so our main course was unpleasantly cold by the time we'd finished our starters.  There was also a complusory service charge and seperate delivery charge which together came to a quarter of the cost of the meal.

The other quibble refers to the staff in the spa - one of our posessions went missing from the changing room.  The staff were initially very helpful in helping us look for it but, when it was finally located (it had clearly been moved by a member of staff or other guest), they implied we were lying about its original location - ridiculous as they had searched the changing room alongside us and it was clearly not then where it was eventually 'found'.",3,2012,02,01
122,Another excellent stay,We had tickets to see Boys II Men and I wanted to treat my wife to a great weekend in London. It has been refurbished since I last stayed and it looks even better. The service from the desk to the Resteraunt was excellent and the doorman is a great guy. The smallest and chepest suit is very big and could take a family of four. Breakfast is excellent with a very good variety on offer and sitting by the tranquil inside marina on the Thames is very relaxing while just having a drink. iIts a great place to stay if you are spending time in the West End but taxi's can now be expensive.,5,2012,01,30
122,London? Stay here!,"There can't be a hotel in London that represents better value than this place, true 5* luxury and no abuse of the word 'suite'.
These rooms are massive with every facility imaginable including air conditioning, PVRs and 2 flat screen TVs!

The new spa area has a wonderful pool and gym, ideal for working off the calories from the excellent Riverside Brasserie Grill.

A sumptuous breakfast is served with a vast choice of exquisite ingredients, the perfect end to a great stay!

Just one negative from the whole experience-please don't charge me for what has now become a standard rather than an optional extra-internet access!",4,2012,01,27
122,Comfy all-suite hotel with great amenities,"This has become one of my favorite hotels that I've stayed at so far.  From the exterior, the hotel does not appear particularly impressive, but the interior is excellent. The rooms are larger than average for the European hotels I've stayed at, with a full bath with a tub, shower, bidet and an additional separate half bath.  The room would be comfortable for a party of four although the couch in the ""living"" room was not a pullout. Facilities include a modern, well kept gym that appeared to have very low usage and new equipment, a beautiful indoor heated pool, and a spa area.  The hotel looks out on Chelsea Harbor, which is a small marina for high end boats and yachts.  There is free wifi in the lobby but not in the room, a minor inconvenience for us as we were not on business. I loved the fact that the hotel was in Chelsea a short walk to King's Road which had some great restaurants and shopping but was more a high end residential neighborhood and less of the tourist crowd, hence it was less crowded and noisy than central London.  We were also right along the Thames, which while not the equivalent of being in Paris along the Seine was nevertheless a pleasant venue.  Access to central London was easy via either bus or Underground, there was an Underground station a block away from the hotel.  My wife and I would stay here again if it's available the next time I visit London!",5,2012,01,27
122,Very Relaxing,"I stayed in the Wyndham Hotel on a recent trip to London. I was over to visit my newborn niece. After a day of listening to a child screaming it was wonderful to come back to the bar overlooking Chelsea Harbor for a drink. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff were very helpful with any queries i may have had.

I do not usually stay in such luxurious hotels, but the price was just 15pounds more than the 3 star hotel around the corner so i decided to treat myself. And it was very much worth it.",5,2012,01,25
122,Wyndham Grand Chelsea harbour,"beautiful all suite hotels. Excellent location in Chelsea. Most professional and friendly staff. The best food in their restaurant and lounge with the beautiful view of the harbour.
Highly recommend this fantastic hotel.",5,2012,01,20
122,Best affordable hotel in London,"This hotel exceeded all expectations I had prior to my visit. I booked this hotel through booking.com and the price payable on this hotel was even cheaper than 4-star hotels in the Big Smoke.

The hotel is all-suite, meaning that rooms are at least 40 square metres each. That's a massive bedroom, and equally sized 'sitting room', bathroom with shower & bath and a spare bedroom - we also had a balcony. 

A number of reviews here wrote that the location was lousy. I disagree. Imperial Wharf overland is not more than a 4-minute walk from the hotel - walk out of the station, turn left up the road and into the second garage exit, go up one flight of stairs (through a door which say ""to wyndham hotel"", and you're bang in front of the hotel. You're also just off King's Road and a short bus ride to Clapham Junction (which can also be reached via Imperial Wharf overland.

Staff was very courteous. 

At an average £170/nt paid, to me, this was definitely the best hotel I've stayed in, in London, possibly in Europe.",5,2012,01,18
122,"Nice location, good value.","This hotel is situated within the Chelsea Harbour complex on the banks of the River Thames.

The hotel is large and modern and all rooms are actually suites. Very roomy and well furnished. We had a balcony also.

The bathroom was extremely nice and well appointed.

A nice touch was the free bottle of wine and selection of cheeses given to us on arrival. 

This would be a good base for visiting central London as there is good rail links nearby. Even better located for trips to Chelsea's Stamford Bridge or Fulham's Craven Cottage.",4,2012,01,11
122,Fantastic 5* Luxury,"I stayed at the hotel  with my daughter and grandsons on Xmas day and my stay far exceeded my expectations. The hotel is beautiful, the staff courteous but also very family friendly. we had Xmas lunch and then stayed in one of the marina view suites. I really cant fault the hotel in any way. The suite was amazing, spacious and had everything we needed. The food in the restaurant was excellent both at lunch and breakfast. The location is perfect for the Kings Rd and Chelsea area. The spa and pool were superb and much nicer than any of the other 5* star hotels i have stayed at in London. The staff were helpful and friendly at all times. We are already planning our next stay !!!!!!!!",5,2012,01,06
122,London trip,We stayed here for 3 nights and found the suite to be lovely. We were amazed at how large the rooms were.  We didn't find the location to be a problem. It was just a short ride on the overground. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was delicious. I was very happy especially since they had gluten free bread for me. We loved the price of the room also.,5,2012,01,04
122,Amazing!!,"I stayed three days in this beautiful hotel a wonderful experience from the front desk very minimal,the room very big with two toilette one small in the salon and one very big in the sleep room nice view on the harbour,absolutely silent,everything is perfect also the pub in the front in Lots road is great!Absolutely I'll come back",5,2011,12,26
122,Beautiful hotel & great location,"I was here for five nights at the beginning of December - my fourth visit actually. The suites are beautiful - comfortable with all sorts of extra detail for the perfect stay. Everywhere is spotlessly clean, and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. No criticism at all - just an extremely pleasant experience as always.",5,2011,12,24
122,Quiet yet trendy area! Solid hotel with modern decor and rooms,"Very pleased with this hotel...rooms modern and contemporary, nice views of the quaint harbour, and quiet.  A bit far to walk to the heart of London but certainly still convenient to walk 5 min to the nearest tube/LRT station by cutting through the parkade.  Nice walks along the river.  The gym was modest but fine for up to 3 ppl before it would feel crowded, featuring quality treadmills x2, elliptical trainer x2, a universal contraption and a few weights. Mini spa as well. The gym staff insisted on keeping the tv's on and blaring at full volume even after another patron and I turned them off 3 times (the view from reception can just catch sight of tv's so assume staff wanted to watch even though it seems tv's would be for gym patrons). Overall service courteous, efficient, pleasant and responsive, good food. Very solid on all fronts.",4,2011,12,24
122,"Huge Rooms, Good Service, Good Food","Was not as central as it could have been, but it was well worth being slightly outside central london.  The suites are huge, the service was good and the food was good and reasonably priced.",5,2011,12,21
122,Best value in London possibly?,"I had booked a one night stay about a week earlier through Expedia; as I was travelling with my wife and 6 year old daughter I asked for a suite and was surprised when I received a quote for around 200 Pounds. Although it was not a marina view both rooms had balconies and the size, cleanliness, furnishings etc were of a much higher standard than I anticipated.
I can only assume that as the hotel is not in a traditional central tourist location that the prices are such excellent value.
We ate lunch in the bar but could choose from the restaurant menu and the standard of the food and service was good quality and breakfast was fine too although nothing special. One disappointment - about 30 minutes Internet service came to 15 Pounds which is absolutely criminal!
However I can forgive this for the excellent price we recived for their Chelsea suite - hope it lasts!",5,2011,12,20
122,"Excellent hotel, but not central","It's hard to find fault with this excellent hotel. Located in Chelsea harbour it is a minutes walk from Imperial Wharf overland railway. It is quite handy for the Kings Road, Fulham Broadway and Chelsea that is not central as a tourist location. We had a suite overlooking the river and the room was extremely clean with a lovely view. The staff were marvellous and I have no complaints at all about the hotel.",5,2011,12,12
122,Very very poor shocking service,Hotel itself is ok but not five star.  The rooms are clean and spacious. The fundamental issue is the shockingly poor service my room wasn't ready till 5 pm after I'd requested early check in. My luggage didn't arrive till an hour later after 3 requests. The breakfast was a total joke. I asked for coffee three times and 35 minutes later still no coffee spoke to the restaurant mgr. Apologised and said he'd get it. Never arrived. Waiter took mine and colleuges breakfast order. Hers came out. 20 mins later mine still no where to be seen. No coffee either. This with 6 breakfast staff is shocking. If your after great service then avoid this hotel. There are far better options of 5 star quality with exceptional service to choose from in central London. Over rated and more a 3-4 star most def not 5 ,1,2011,12,10
122,Fantastic Hotel in London,"My family and i recently stayed at the Wyndham as our base for a London Theatre trip.
as ever the standards of service at the hotel were superb.  
The staff are very courteous and attentive to your needs with a personal can do attitude..
The rooms are great and it should be noted that all rooms are suites with a seperate living area which accomodates a large sofa bed. 
This is especially welcome when travelling with children as you get your own space.
We made use of Room Service and the Restaraunt and the food was of a high standard.
The hotel also has a swimming pool which is a great for a relaxing swim after a hard days shopping.
Staying at this hotel really enhances the whole London experience -",5,2011,12,02
122,Excellent Hotel,"From our arrival at the Wyndham and until our departure 4 days later, I can only describe this hotel as fantastic, after being away from home for two months; we definitely left the best til last. The check in process was a breeze, I especially liked the check in receptionist showing us to our suite and explaining everything to us. The suite itself was terrific, and the bed was oh so comfortable, the formal living area and its appointed furniture was spot on, the coffee machine was also great. Our view of the Marina was fabulous; I would definitely recommend the Marina view. The bathroom was well appointed with first class amenities, the toiletries supplied were what you would expect from a hotel of this class. All in all, a very enjoyable stay at the Wyndham. Would I stay here again, most definitely?

There is nothing I didn't like about the Wyndham itself; the only thing that might put guests off from staying at this hotel is its location, which however didn't put us off. The Wyndham is approximately a 5 minute brisk walk to the Kings Road, taxis not needed, from there you can get a number 22 bus that will take you all the way along the Kings Road to Sloane Square, and then on to Piccadilly Circus, cost of this great bus ride is 2 Pounds and 40 Pence. Or, and even greater bus ride, get a number 11 bus, again it will take you to Sloane Square, through to Victoria, up to the Houses of Parliament, through Trafalgar Square and down the Strand to Liverpool Street Station, much cheaper than those tour buses, again, 2 Pounds and 40 Pence, that's about $3.75. On Sunday morning, take the number 11 bus to Liverpool St Station, just around the corner is Petticoat Lane Market.",5,2011,11,28
122,"Beautiful hotel, superb service","We stayed for five days at this  lovely hotel at Chelsea Marina and from the moment we walked in the door to check out, we experienced superb service in a beautiful setting.  We especially enjoyed the tranquility of being away from the typical noisy, busy downtown London htoel locations and enjoyed the river walk and marirna promenade, yet we were only a short tube ride away from all of the  main London attractions.  The friendly staff were always gracious and accomodating of our every request.  Room service was prompt and delicious; the restaurant provided an excellent harbor side dining experience, and we had champagne service each evening in the lounge.  This contemporary, yet warm and cozy, hotel is an excellent alternative to the central London hotels and provides great value for the price.  We will definately stay here on our next visit to London!",5,2011,11,22
122,Great Hotel,"Having heard about how expensive and disappointing London hotels are, I was delighted to find a gem of a hotel on my first visit.  Starting with the staff, they did their very best to provide excellent service.  The rooms were very comfortable and tastefully appointed and we enjoyed using the espresso maker in our room every evening...  I thought the location was really great as we were only a short walk to the Overground - very easy to get around London from there.  It was an upscale neighborhood with a great pub only a block away.  Also within walking distance is ""Curry Mary's"" Indian Restaurant - an exquisite restaurant recommended by the staff.  I have to say that staying at the Wyndham Grand Harbor made our trip to London really special!",5,2011,11,21
122,an excellent experience and worth the money,"I took a risk and booked the Wyndham in advance even though I was due to stay in mid November. The weather was perfect blue sky and mild so I was lucky as usual. Room 510 has a good view over the harbour, with a small but adequate outdoor patio. The bedroom was a good size and the living room large for central London. Very good that there is a separate closed in hall to prevent noise coming in off the corridor. The shower in the bathroom was a delight; accurate temperature from the start and as much variable water pressure as most folks could want. Self parking is extremely convenient; the entrance only 20 metres from the front door of the hotel. Note that there are no coffee shops / cafes nearby and drinks within the hotel are in my view over-priced accordingly; perhaps take a drink or two in with you. I’d certainly stay again.",5,2011,11,21
122,Best UK hotel so far...,"I stayed there with my wife in November this year and I cannot wait to go back. Big cities hotels tend to offer small rooms. This hotel is the exception. Location is chic and classy. Rooms are like apartments. The service is wonderful. Apples are complimentary at the Front desk.
Two Flat-screen TV, two toilets, a living room area, a huge balcony, a shower and a bath. Complimentary goodies all over the room. Outstanding front desk service. Around the Saatchi Gallery, you will find millions of interesting shops.
It's worth being in Chelsea rather than in Picadilly Circus if you have this extra space and extra service.
Whenever I am in London, I'll be at the Wyndham Grand.",5,2011,11,16
122,'Disappointing on two occasions,"I feel compelled to write this review after my second stay at the Wyndham Grand which was complimentary due to the bad service we encountered on our first visit.  
Unfortunately, the second visit was not much of an improvement on the first.  We booked a suite through the Reservations Manager but on our arrival the Reception area were unaware of our booking.  Fortunately I had brought an email from the hotel confirming our booking but was told I was then mean to reconfirm again via an email???  Ive never had to confirm a booking twice!!  We had specifically requested a non smoking room but although it was meant to be the whole room smelt of cigarettes especially the bathroom towels.
We stayed at this hotel due to its location as we were attending an event nearby but if you are planning on staying just for a break I would advise you to go for something a little more central in London.  The whole hotel seems to lack any atmosphere espcially the restaurant.",2,2011,11,13
122,A lovely hotel for a special weekend away,"I got taken here as a surprise for my birthday weekend.  We visited here 11 years ago and said we would always come back as we had such a nice time, which made the surprise extra special!  The rooms are very spacious an entrance hall, toilet, lounge, bedroom, dressing area and a full bathroom and everything is extremely comfortable.  We really enjoyed just sitting in the lounge with a drink ( in the robes and slippers provided) watching the world go by in the harbour.  It’s definitely a hotel you want to spend time in and have a chance to relax.  
Service was excellent – there was a little mix up with the rooms when we check in, however this was sorted very quickly and professionally.  A couple of hours after we arrived a plate of birthday chocolates arrived in the room – a very nice touch!  The location is slightly out of the way of central London, but very close to the Kings road/Sloane square and we spent most of our time in London around the Chelsea area, which was a nice change.  I’d recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a bit of luxury in a quiet London location.",5,2011,11,10
122,Weekend Stay at Wyndham Grand,"Really nice Hotel.We booked through Late Rooms/Secret Rooms and had a suite which was fab!The bed settee made up for my child while we went to Dinner.Dinner was excellent and a good price at around £50.00 with a couple of glasses of wine, a beer,and soft drinks.Although didnt have 3 courses.
Breakfast was expensive at £23.50 each,the only reason we had it was because my child ate free,which compensated the extra cost.
Slightly far out of central London,this wasnt helped by tubes and over ground trains not running on the Sunday,in this area.This couldnt be helped and if the trains were running ,the train station a stones throw from the hotel.
We would stay again if picked up at the right price.",5,2011,11,07
122,Expensive.,"Although the rooms are large and good value, everything else is very expensive. E.g. £9.50 for a G&T from the mini bar. ",4,2011,11,07
122,High quality standard for business and week end,The hotel is not very easy to reach as away from subway and overground trains are not frequent. ThE hotel is new with very nice suite room for reasonable price 200£ a night. Staff is friendly and very capable.  Room was overlooking harbour. The suite is large enough to organize business meeting in office side of the suite. Bathroom is equipped with very high quality products. I loved the electronic shower. The hotel restaurant was not very exciting then I went out to excellent pub at the corner 200 meters away. One bad thing is they charge for wifi access in the room. I think that this is out of date for the hotel and for then price. As I travel a lot I am also in 2/3stars hotels in differents countries where wifi is included. ,4,2011,11,05
122,"wonderful location,pity about the welcome !","we had expected the usual 5star welcome,help with car,luggage etc,but it was not forthcoming.The 2 doormen were ""larking around""with some of the waiting drivers,and took no notice of us,one of the doormen was extremely unkempt,scruffy uniform,no hat and un combed hair.We noticed during our stay ,that these men,were totally unprofessional in there behaviour,and when we booked out had disappeared altogether.Contrast them with the excellent reception staff,who were friendly,smart,welcoming,and above all showed the hotel in its best light.We were given an up grade to a harbour view which was great.Unfortunately,after we had checked in .it was down hill again..no porters,and the concierge looked the other way,We were forced to find our own room,and to carry our own luggage,be prepared to do this if you stay here,as i saw several other guests struggling.This is not 5star service and a problem the management need to rectify",3,2011,11,01
122,short city break,"I'd read other people thought this hotel was out of the way, we didn't, it took just 20 mins via over/underground, taxi to park lane was less than £15 inc tip, the rooms are marvellous and the staff were fantastic, drinks & breakfast a bit pricey but this is a 5* london hotel
 Would definetly recommend this hotel",5,2011,10,29
122,One of London's Best Kept Hotel Secrets,"We've stayed at this hotel now four or five times over the past six months. It's the only place we stay when we come into London. I think the Rack rate is about £276 but as we joined the Wyndham Rewards  programme on our first stay, we pay £167+Vat for a great suite with a pretty view of the harbor. The rooms are first class, a bottle of wine is always sitting in a wine bucket in our room on arrival and the service excellent. Yes, it's a cab ride into the centre of town, but it's definitely worth putting up with that ever so small inconvenience when you take the quality of the accommodation and service into account. An excellent hotel and when you take advantage of the Wyndham Reward Programme exceptional value for money compared to the other 5 star hotels in London.Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2011,10,29
122,A good 4 star Hotel,"A great 4 star hotel but not a 5 star hotel as it is rated. The location is good although the overground did not run on the Sunday so its either cab or bus to the nearest tube link for an airport (Victoria) especially if you are counting on getting to Gatwick via Clapham. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the bar staff in the evening we wonderful and very hospitable. The room we stayed in was spacious, but the general outdatedness of the room is what brings this hotel down to 4 stars. Wallpaper is peeling back in some places , there are some staines on walls, the tiles around the bath are getting old and a bit grimey. With a bit of an upgrade on basic maintenance and renewals of the rooms this would definitely be a 5 star location. It looks like a lot of the funds went to upgrade the reception area, the bar with its 18000 pounds diamond spoon lamp rather then to the upgrades of the rooms. But overall, a very pleasant stay.",4,2011,10,29
122,A great hotel in an inconvenient location.,"A really excellent hote, great rooms (suites) excellent service situatd on the chelsea harbor, all in all a delightful place",5,2011,10,19
122,Worth being outside central london for,Great hotel with good sized suites. Staff could not be more helpful. Excellent restaurants nearby. Slightly out off the way but makes up for it in quality. Definitely will stay againn,5,2011,10,16
122,"Great room, great service","All the rooms are suites which is sweet. We had one bedroom apartment with two bathrooms and a view of the river. Service is great, coffee in the room, fast Internet close to the new London Overground and always a taxi outside the front door. A very nice sanctuary in busy London.",5,2011,10,15
122,Lovely hotel but not in a great position for central London,Stayed for 1 night recently when going to the theatre in the Haymarket. The hotel is lovely and the suites are spacious for London and good value if you have children as there is no extra cost. We did not stay for breakfast as this seemed excessively priced (£24 each). Great hotel if you need to be in the area but not great for the theatre or for the centre of London. It took nearly an hour for us to get to the theatre on public transport.,4,2011,10,15
122,Loved the space but location a bit out of the way,"Huge suite for London standards which was marvelous but not within walking distance of anywhere useful.  it's great for long stays but if you only have a few days and want to see/do a lot, this hotel is not ideal.
Breakfast was good (all English breakfasts are) as was the service.  The staff at the door (doorman, bellhop) were fantastic.  1 occasion I alighted did not have small change for the taxi, the bellhop loan me £1 from his pocket upon seeing me searching my pockets.  That young man will go far!
Last comment about the toiletries provided in the hotel bathrooms - they left a very strange slippery feel on the skin!  Not nice.",4,2011,10,14
122,Rubbish,"I recently went to use the spa for my birthday- this is not a spa, it is a swimming pool. I paid £70 for the worst massage I have ever had, with the strangest massuese I have ever had.

We were so bored we went for an early lunch and the waitress spilt lemonade all over my friend and still charged us service charge. The staff int he spa were rude. But a waiter was amazing and really made us feel special, as did the concierge and the porter. 

The worst thing is, I wrote a complaint to the hotel. After leaving me waiting for days and now weeks al they have done is said sorry and we will pass comments on.

I have had to make complaints at high end hotels before and received immpecable customer service. I expect more.",1,2011,10,12
122,Fantastic in every aspect,"We stayed here for 3 nights in early september and were not disapointed. The main concern for us was the location as my wife had a broken foot (Happend after we booked). Again this did not prove to be that much of a problem the train station 5 minute walk (on crutches) 3 without, short train jurney 1 stop to pick up the infamous London Underground from there you go anywhere in central London. It took us 20 minutes to get to the Natural History museim. Also on the kings road you can the bus to Picadilly Circus and it passes Marco piere Whites Steak house (fantastic meal in there). and if thats not good enough for you the London Taxi service is very reasonable about £20 from central london in busy trafic. 
The Room/Suite was fantastic the lounge changed into a second bedroom at turndown perfect for our 4 year old and we had the privacy of our own room then TV's in both. The pool was nice but not geared for Dad changing with his Daughter ""we had to go behind the scenes to reach the family changing room, they were very appologetic and to be honest it realy did not bother us. Would recomend and we are going back next year.",5,2011,10,01
122,Just stay... and the rest will be happily up to then,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in while working in London and have been a frequent traveller for over six years.  The bar and restaurant are exceptional. Surroundings chic and understated, something I love.  To be able to incorporate within your design a work of art from a range of centuries including some very impressive artisans from the 21st century just adds to the eclectic charm of the hotel.  Staff is so accommodating to the point that they want to escort you to your room even if you are just in the ""standard room"" category.  Amenities, amazing.  Men and women focused shampoo, conditioner, body wash and shaving cream and salve for the gents.  The restaurant I've been using as a destination for some years for business is excellent with an amazing view of the harbour.  My usual choice because of its proximity to the Chelsea Harbour Design Centre and I need things done right when entertaining clients.  But I never took advantage of the hotel -- no heartfelt explanation here.  Some may say it is pricier than others whether  business or vacation you want everything right and not spend an arm and leg on fantastic lodgings, please look at the Wyndham Chelsea.  Just a few blocks from Kings Road and every restaurant imaginable.  I did not pay a fortune for this room by any extent of the imagination but feel very much like a VIP.  Oh, did I mention the bar and expresso machine in every room?  London speaks to the very best whether it be wine, food or experience.  It is both exotic yet familiar and makes you thirsty for more.  If you ""do"" London, ""do"" the Wyndham.  You will never regret it.

Robin",5,2011,09,23
122,Spectacular Hotel,"We booked two rooms at this hotel through Hotwire for a family vacation in August.  Since you can't specify the room type online, I called the hotel to do so. An exceptionally friendly and informative desk clerk told me that we could request the room type, but it could not be guaranteed and would be subject to availability since we had not booked directly with Wyndham.  Despite that, our rooms were exactly as we had requested - one king and one double.  The kids' room even overlooked the harbor, which was beautiful.  The suite rooms are indeed sweet -- well appointed and impeccably decorated.  Staff throughout the hotel was cordial and helpful, with the possible exception of a waitress in the bar/restaurant who was clearly new.  We did not use a car during our stay in London, traveling only by Tube.  The station is a bit of a walk (10-15 minutes), but the neighborhood is very pleasant and we all enjoyed the walks back and forth.  We would absolutely recommend this hotel, and hope that we have the opportunity to visit there again.",5,2011,09,21
122,A Real Gem!,"Stayed here in August with my wife and son. We were very surprised to find that we got a 1 bdrm suite overlooking the harbour. For the price, we could not have done any better in high season for this quality.Service was attentive. We did not eat at the hotel during our stay. 

The over ground tube was by the hotel, which can get confusing to use at first. We figured it out the second day.",5,2011,09,20
122,Fantastic suite with fantastic view,"Stayed in London for a weekend with a friend. We had a fantastic twin suite overlooking the harbour, and it was very comfortable for the two of us. The room has all the amenities you expect from a 5* hotel. The shower is pure bliss! With big robes, slippers and a in-room espresso machine this caters for comfort and luxury. Only one question: how come english hotels don't have free wifi? 

The room was not ready for check-in at 3 pm, but a complimentary drink on the terrace and 10 minutes later, we got our room. 

The staff is accomodating and helpful. The location is outcide the city centre, but the overground is only minutes away, if you choose not to take a taxi. 

Will definetly come back to the Wyndham Grand.",5,2011,09,19
122,Disappointing,"Hi, we stayed at this hotel - my husband for work purposes and myself for leisure. I don't think either would like to come back here or recommend as firstly we ordered room service, the pizza was terrible, perhaps the worst i've had and i'm not even that fussy abotu pizzas and then sweetcorn was even worse, it was like powdered soup, no taste of sweetcorn! on top of that i asked the reception when we checked in what time the leisure facilities were open til, and they told me the pool til 9pm and the gym til 10pm. I went to the leisure club at 8.30pm hoping for a quick swim and workout thereafter only to be told everything closes at 9pm! therefore i couldnt go swimming and by the time i changed for gym could only have a 15mins workout. i was not impressed as had i known i would have gone there earlier and not so leisurely and i was only staying there one night!",3,2011,09,15
122,Had to return to this outstanding hotel!,"If this hotel is ranked 44th best in London, I'd love to test out the ones that are supposed to be better! In terms of quality, staff-helpfulness, cleanliness, spaciousness and facilities, well - it's the tops! A more central location would be the only slight downside to this place, plus it does not have the historic splendour of a classic hotel as it is clearly very modern. In every other way the hotel is superlative.",5,2011,09,14
122,Excellent 5 star experience,"This hotel has everything you could ask for in a short stay in London,
You are greeted by friendly doormen and can have your car valet parked if you wish, The staff are helpful and polite and did everything they could to make our stay special even give you umbrellas if its raining! The locatoin is great nice quiet area not too far from west end.
The rooms are amazing, with 2 teles stereo expresso machine rain shower and balcony ours over looked the harbour. As it was our wedding anniversary they even spread rose petals on the bed for us when we arrived. The hotel also has a proper spa with large pool and sauna all very clean and well staffed. I would recomend this hotel to anyone spend a bit more its well worth it!",5,2011,09,13
122,PreCruise stay,"Great suite, Friendly staff but you are in London. We flew overnight to London in August 2011 arriving early on a Sunday morning. Prior to going had contacted the hotel and they gave us excellent help in getting to the hotel. If you want to save time and money get a train to Imperial Wharf station, within a few minutes walk from the hotel rather than taking the Gatwick Express to Victoria station. The front desk were friendly and took our bags and provided a place to freshen up although the suite was not of course ready.
After sight seeing returned to the hotel finished check-in with bags already in the room. The room was a King Bed Suite, not on Harbour side as expected. The suite was spacious, clean and restful. The cleaning staff, after we asked, provided ice ""cubes"" each day.
The bar is nice but being tired we ate a small meal of the bar menu before going to bed the first night and had some problems with the staff understanding a southern drawl request for ice. 
Had breakfast buffet the next morning very pricey but this is London. We would reccommend looking for alternate just down at Lot Road or in old Chelsea.
Slept well for the three night stay and would reccomend to anyone. Remember you are outside the sightseeing of central London or West End theater. Cab or rail at Imperial Wharf or bus just a few steps away to get anywhere in London.",4,2011,09,12
122,Huge rooms,"I stayed at the Wyndham for 4 nights in August. We had 3 people so had a bed brought into the room. The rooms are so spacious. On one side we had a couch, chair, desk and cot. On the other side we had a king bed and a make-up vanity. The bathroom was beautiful. Marble, separate room with toliet. The shower was amazing. Had a refrigerator in the room. We did not use the mini-bar but did chill beverages we bought elsewhere.  Loved hthe hotel. Only two negatives to add. I thought the restaurant was pricey and it was a little off the underground route. We grabbed the train and switched at Earl!s Court. Highly recommend he hotel if you want large rooms. I have stayed in other areas of 
London that had more going on in the area as far as restaurants.",5,2011,09,12
122,faultless,"A really fabulous hotel . Luxurious but not pompous . Beautiful rooms , brilliant bathrooms  and really nice service from all the staff . Also great value for money . Breakfast not included but very good buffet and individually cooked hot options . The only downside( but possibly upside)  is the location with quite challenging public transport links into central London but Kings rd close",5,2011,09,10
122,PERFECT LOCATION,"We stayed four nights at this hotel and found it to be excellent value for money. The staff were always very helpful. The location on Chelsea Harbour is fabulous,with fantastic restaraunts nearby. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for the first time",5,2011,09,06
122,Great rooms! Very spacious,"Location is a bit out of the way; however, it gives you an opportunity to see different areas of Greater London. Make sure you if you do not like cigarette smoke that you request non-smoking and follow up with a call. I requested but they still put me in a room on the smoking floor. They assured me that the ventilation would not allow smoke in the room. We arrived late at night so we slept there. Next morning I couldn't stop coughing and wheezing. They did move us to a non smoking floor.  They did advise me that because I got the hotel at a very cheap price that is the room I should be staying in.  No one should be subjected to a smoking floor unless you are a smoker. These days most places don't allow it. 
Both rooms very spacious; living room with a desk and t.v. and a little fridge. We weren't there until the evening. Breakfast in the hotel healthy but pricey-23 pounds per person approximately. 
We ate in the hotel bar late a couple of evenings; food was adequate. London has great options for eating out closer to the center. The harbour was pretty muddy due to lack of rain. View was okay.",4,2011,09,04
122,Good hotel-poor service,"I recently stayed at the Wyndham Grand 26, 27,28th August taking 2 lovely rooms for me and the children. We have stayed here many times before and have always returned as whilst it’s a bit of a distance from the centre its ok.

The hotel reception area has been revamped and the rooms have had a bit of a spruce up, so as usual pleased with the accommodation. The family flew into Heathrow on the 26th after staying a week in a 5 star hotel on Lake Como and maybe this is where the problem comes from as the service in Lake Como was far far superior to London.

On the second night my eldest son who works in London joined the rest of a family for a meal in the restaurant, the food was fine but the service was slow and less than attentive. I had to continually attract the attention of a waiter to top up our wine or to order more drinks and one occasion I had to go looking for someone to order drinks as I was fed up of waiting.

The following Day we decided to have breakfast in the hotel and it’s not the cheapest in London. We had to wait 15 minutes to order and receive our coffee, the first batch of toast that arrived was cold and we sent it back, the second batch was cold as the first so we did not enjoy breakfast at all!

The hotel appears to suffer from not enough staff or the staff are not trained, all in all we felt let down by the Hotel and disappointed that after spending £2000 on a 3 night stay we did not feel like we had been treated well.

Will I use it again? Who knows? I am a creature of habit normally-find something I like and keep going back ""this was our 8th stay here in as many years"" but when I pay I expect good service and this was not so maybe a change is in order.",3,2011,08,30
122,Great Hotel,"We have just come back from 2 nights here - a spa package run into an extra TravelZoo night and had an amazing time. We walked all around Chelsea - there is tons to see and do such as the Chelsea Physic Garden, and no shortage of shops and places to eat on the Kings Road.

We had massages in the spa and I had one of the best hair cuts of my life in the hair salon. The swimming pool was big and very little used and the spa was clean with loads of towels etc.

Breakfast was very good with a vast choice and the spa dinner menu was also very enjoyable. We only had a Chelsea suite but extra touches like fresh fruit made it seem even more special.

We will be back! One teeny thing -  as a Wyndham rewards member it would have been nice if this had been acknowledged even though we were there on a package/cheap deal.",5,2011,08,30
122,Wonderful Luxury Hotel but beware of location,"My wife and I have stayed 3 times at this hotel, and would be happy to use it any time.  The suites are just wonderful.  The staff are great, very professional and very well trained.  The swimming pool is also very good.  I would recommend it for all aspects except its location.  If you want to be near the main tourist sites then this location is inconvenient and would disappoint.  And it is a considerable walk from a tube station, though the Imperial Wharf overground is very close (we take the short cut through the enclosed car park and can reach the station in 2 minutes).  If they ever put a water-bus station nearby then things will be even better.  Our only drawback on our most recent visit (3 nights) was that we specified a non-smoking room and that was confirmed by the hotel in writing, but were allocated a 3rd Floor smoking room - so beware of that when checking in.",5,2011,08,30
122,"Fantastic, fantastic. You just have to walk or cab a while","Loved it. Easily the most comfortable accommodation i ever stayed at in London. That includes stays at hotels such as the Langham. Large luxurius suites for ALL. Ok so if you want to be in the centre of the action its not for you. BUT in London ""centre of the action"" means many places, such that you are never really in the centre of ALL the action. Hope this helps.",5,2011,08,24
122,Fantastic Hotel and we will be back,"Arrived at this hotel via the London Overground station (Imperial Wharf). The station is just 3 mins walk from the hotel. What a hotel. Beautiful , all rooms are suites and have a balcony. Enormous Lounge, Massive Bedroom,2 large tv screens. Large Bathroom with big bath and seperate shower room. We even had another seperate toilet. Lovely views from the balcony of the Chelsea Marina and part of the Thames.Did not use the Spa and pool area and restaurant. Breakfast was an excessive price so we just had breakfast at local places.The room though had Tea and Coffee facilities. I beleive the internet was £24 per day , but i had my blackberry , so did not need it. Location is OK, 3 mins to London Overground, 5 mins walk to bus No 11 & 22 which were frequent and took 15mins to Victoria (Buckingham Palace)or 25 mins to Westminster (Parliament) and London Eye. Taxi is reasonable if there is more than 1 of you. About £10 to Knightsbridge. In my view stay a little further out of the centre and get the luxury of this hotel. A hotel room like this in the centre would be £300+.",5,2011,08,23
122,"Modern, boutique 5* hotel, delightful location but lacking soul","Another of Travelzoo's fab deals £139 one night in 5* for four ( 1 adult 3 teenagers) on Chelsea harbour - no breakfast included though. Had booked this months ago ( Craig at the hotel was most helpful when booking) as part of a planned sight seeing and London attractions visit for the kids during the summer holidays. When we stayed however it was right in the middle of the Riots! Thankfully the hotel wasn't affected but it did limit our overall experience as we had planned to dine out on the Kings Rd which is adjacent to the hotel but the security guard informed us that the area was getting a bit 'moody' that evening so we got a picnic take out from the local Tesco and watched an inhouse movie instead which was very enjoyable.
The hotel itself is very swish and modern and this is reflected in the decor and furnishings. Quality, complimentary beverage making facilities in room. Quality, complimentary toilettries - bathroom a bit on the small side for four people. We had a room with 2 queen beds - not the most comfortable i must say and a sofa bed in lounge - the maid was in fear of her job i'm sure when we said we'd make it up ourselves! Lovely Spa and swimming pool area with accomodating staff. We didn't think breakfast was worth it even at the discounted rate of £12 pp - we had a hot beverage in the room and pastries / fruit could be easily purchased form the very nearby aforemntioned Tesco for breakfast on the hoof ( for a 'budget savvy 5* break')
T he hotel is located right on Chelsea Harbour and has a very upmarket, classy feel to it but i don't know if it was because of the riots but the was no soul or atmosphere. The harbour area was devoid of bars or cafes which left it feeling 'dead' which is a shame because for the location it should be a hive of activity - anyone who knows Brindley place or The mailBox in Birmingham will know what i mean, and it's rare that Birmingham gets the nod over London!  Security was good - i noted the front desk staff challenging a young man trying obtain access to room because he had lost his key and the hotel appears to have it's own cordon of security access  via rd too, personnel were highly visible. The train station was literally a stones throw form the hotel - and journey into central London 20 - 30 mins depending on waiting times and connections.",4,2011,08,20
122,Relaxing and enjoyable - a treat,"I thought this hotel to be `spit spot`  Without studying every nook and cranny, it all appeared very fresh and well maintained.  Reception were helpful and friendly as was the concierge.  The ladies down in the spa area were very helpful - and showed us around before we had a swim.   My husband booked this as an anniversary treat and we really enjoyed our stay.  We had a balcony with a marina/river view.  All those little extras - like coming back to your room after dinner and finding it all ready for you to settle in to bed etc. slippers and water by the bed,   fresh towels etc ..the room tidied.  Well, it just makes a nice change from having to do it yourself like at home!!!   I will say, however, that we are not wealthy wealthy people and we did not partake of any mini bar offerings or breakfast.   I found those things a little pricey for our pocket, although standard for this kind of hotel.  Instead in the morning we wandered into Chelsea - the Kings Road  to ""Le Pain Quotidien"" .  Highly recommend - very relaxed and friendly and they have a huge (and I mean HUGE) long dining table to eat at.   Breakfast here was much more to our budget.
It was good to stay in a different area of London - a little out the centre - and enjoy the area around the hotel.  There were a number of places nearby to eat and also a Tesco Express to pick up a few bits and bobs.   It`s easy enough to get to the hotel.  Just change to the `over ground` at West Brompton and you are only one stop away and the hotel is almost in front of you as you leave the station.   Just along from the hotel there are some lovely gardens along by the river, which are open to the public during the day - (actually part of the apartments there).  they have a `sense` `sight` and `touch` garden and are lovely to amble through.
All in all - we really enjoyed our stay - a special treat for us.  a little bit of spoiling now and then does you good.
thank you.",5,2011,08,15
122,We can only reccommend this hotel,"Me and a girlfriend booked the Spa package and thought overall it was excellent.  The staff made the experience to be honest, couldn;t do enough for us, so that you.  Even the spa area staff were second to none.  The cleanliness was spotless ( although the ladies spa shower area could do with a deep clean, but wasn;t dirty at all) in the rooms and hotel and in the spa exceptiion see brackets. We were upgraded to suite, even though it wasn't ready until 6pm, we were given another (smoking ) suite to tied us over while we were in the spar.  The move was all taken care of and as we were up graded had no complaints.  

The spa area is brilliant all you need, its pretty complicated to navigate around but Teri was very very helpful and the beautician (Lucile) was fab. For us the location was perfect, we could explore chelsea design ara and kings road and area we didn;t know. SImple get the trian to Imperial wharf or to sloane square and get the 11 or 22 bus (every 4 mins) and get off at Lots road.

Reccommend-",5,2011,08,15
122,How did this hotel receive a 5 star rating?,"This hotel appears among other 5 star hotels but based upon my experience with like hotels, it does not in any way meet the criteria. The service was awkward at best, the common areas were dirty and decrepit, and the room, tired. There was nothing redeeming about this hotel, EXCEPT the bath products, which were lovely. I would suggest that whomever evaluates the exclusivity of hotels take another look at this one. There are certain minimum expectations of 5 star hotels that should be reliable across the board, this hotel does not meet them.",2,2011,08,11
122,So peaceful,"Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. From the moment you arrive it is so peaceful and that is hard to find in London. We had had a river view suite which was amazing (7th floor). It had everything you could wish for. Very spacious, lovely decor, 2 bathrooms, fresh flowers in the main bathroom, amazingly soft linen and very comfortable beds. Turn down service even filled your ice bucket! We didn't eat at the hotel but had few cocktails at the brasserie which again is pure class. Fantastic service and views overlooking the harbour. Only complaint I would say was the checking in and out, it took a while and it seemed that it took up to 3 members of staff to deal with each person and that made it a bit of a wait. All and all so lovely that we will definitely return!",5,2011,08,10
122,"Best London hotel when travelling with children, we will definitely return!","Having been to see Shrek the Musical as a birthday treat for my daughter we stayed one night in this great hotel.  On arrival we were checked into room 605, it was a HUGE room with a large bed for us and separate double sofa bed for our two children.  The hotel had even arranged for a birthday message and piece of cake for my daughter, a lovely touch which she thoroughly enjoyed. The room was immaculate and the fact that the children had their own bedroom and toilet made for a very good nights sleep for everyone, that's a first in a London hotel!
The location of the hotel does mean that central London is a train ride away but it is very  well connected and the area felt safe at night when returning from the theatre.  We also found it to be very convenient for the Natural History Museum the next morning.
We will definitely be returning for our next visit to London, thanks to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2011,08,09
122,convenient: seperate room for the children,"We travelled with a 14 yr old boy who liked the fact that he had his own bedroom very much. The rooms in the hotel (at least the one we had, I don't know if it is true for all rooms) are en-suite. When you need an extra bed they place it in the sitting room. Very convenient.  The hotel is very good. It has a swimming pool which is great, it has space, it has coffee and tea facilities in the room, all very good. In my opinion the breakfeast is very expensive (around 13 british pounds per person for breakfast buffet), which includes fresh fruits, coffee, tea, bread, cakes, cereals etc. But if you'd like scrambled eggs or s.th like that you'd need to pay extra. Also, the surroundings of the hotel are quiet. Nice if you want to sleep, but there are not a lot of bars around to go out for a drink at night (we found 1 close by; of course; except for the hotel facilities). Also internet access is not free...  For a weekend trip next time  I'd choose a hotel a little better connected and in an area a bit more alive. That is, i would when I travel without child. When you travel with a child the hotel is very very convenient because of the space and bedroom/living room lay out.",4,2011,08,05
122,We loved it and got a great deal :),"We booked this hotel after seeing it on Travel Zoo's weekly top 20 at a great price.  Chelsea is a little out of the way from central london (especially at peak times) but not too far from the west end (about 3 miles) where the main focus of our short break was.

We loved the hotel.  We were greated warmly and the hotel interior itself is very impressive.  Our suite was on the 3rd floor and was perfect.  We had a small lounge area with a temp bed for the little one and my partner and I took the main bedroom.  

There was a toilet for the lounge area and a bathroom for the main bedroom with great shower cubicle, bath and all was as you would expect in a 5 star hotel.

Loved the experience of staying here as next morning my partner and the little one went down to use the swimming pool and loved it.  A walk around the outside of the hotel tot the harbour side was beautiful in the sunshine and there is no arguing that this a great spot and great hotel.

Would only go back, though, if got the same deal again.",5,2011,08,02
122,Still one of the best in London,"Have stayed here many times over the past 15 years both as a Wyndham and as a Conrad (Hilton). The staff have changed many times over (except for dear George the doorman) but it still remains my first choice in London.

Same old complaint - the internet charge of 24 Pounds per day is outrageous. Get with it guys .. internet access, like TV, hot water and heating/air conditioning  is now considered a necessity for everyone, not a luxury or optional item !

The new Imperial Wharf train station adjacent to the hotel has really improved access to public transport which used to involve a 20 minute hike to Fulham Broadway Tube station or an expensive cab ride. Now you can easily connect to the Tube for trips to the City via the Central or District/Circle line. There is also a regular bus service to Earl's Court.

The ""Lot's Road Gasto Pub"" is 2 minutes walking from the hotel and is excellent value with tasty food. Other good restaurants are 10-15 minutes away by foot. The Chelsea Harbour complex also has a mini-market open 6 days a week and a dry-cleaner open 5 days a week (2 day service). A 24 hour Tesco mini-mart (attached to a gas station) on King's Road is 12 minutes away by foot.

Staying here for two weeks once, I could not justify the hotel laundry expense (even on my company account). There is a self-service laundry about 10 minutes walk away but it is hard to find. (the Google Earth Placemark ID is ""15299588594152887122"")

Will be back again soon.",5,2011,07,28
122,Great stay but a little overpriced...,"We stayed here for one night while visiting London and found it was a little overpriced. We stayed here primarily because all the reviews said it was amazing and really the rooms are gorgeous. Products are great, bed was comfy and shower was awesome. We did also choose this place for the wi-fi though and they were charging 24 pound for 24 hour access in the room. You would expect wi-fi be free when you are paying over 250 pounds for one night?

We had a little balcony where you could also see the London eye and the city - not sure about other dining options in the area as it was near Chelsea harbour and the area looked dead - so not sure...but i'm sure there are better locations for the price.",4,2011,07,28
122,Highly recommended,"I have stayed in many hotels in London over the years & this my favourite especially as my children are older (12 & 15). It is an all suite hotel, the suites are huge by London standards & very luxurious. The bathroom is the best I have experienced at any hotel & have raindrop showers. There is even a second small loo/sink for the children. The location is not central of course, but I prefer the peace & quiet to disturbed nights in central London. Since we first stayed here the Imperial Wharf North London overground station has been opened adjacent, & one can change to the underground at West Brompton or Shepherds Bush. There are also several bus stops very close by.

The main bed is very large & comfortable & the children's sofabed or beds are superior to most other hotels I have stayed in. Each room has an expresso machine, which is a nice touch. I find the staff very good especially at breakfast. I haven't eaten there in the evening but breakfast is very good although the cooked breakfast perhaps a little salty for some tastes.

The hotel is expensive of course but there are internet deals available. Unfortunately parking in the hotel car park is ridiculously expensive at £40/day, so not surprisingly the car park is empty! The only slight grievance we had was that they charge £4 each for the bottles of water left by one's bed, which one assumes are included, but these were kindly removed from the bill when I objected.

I thoroughly recommend this hotel if you can stretch to the price & hope I will be able to stay there again.",5,2011,07,23
122,"Great experience, ultimate hotel","Really great hotel with friendly and unprofessional team.

The only weak point could be the location depending on your needs and travel purpose.",5,2011,07,22
122,"Nightmare, avoid at all costs!!!!!!","I was very concerned when I  saw the negative reviews on here, however felt it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! After a long flight I was greeted by the duty manager Piotr who informed me he only had a smoking room available, I told him that I could not take that room as I am asthmatic. He went on to say that I could sit around for another 1 1/2 hours and perhaps a non smoking room would open up. So here I am sitting in the lobby waiting for a ?room to open up. I have stayed in numerous hotels in London, in fact this is my third trip this year and I would have to say that this is probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a city that I really love to visit. Not a good start to a week to celebrate my sisters birthday. My advice to anyone thinking about staying here, there are many fine hotels in London, this is not one of them. Avoid at all costs!",1,2011,07,19
122,Great week-end destination,"Great position on the Thames, near to Kings Road, restaurants and bars. Every room a very comfortable suite with great views. Staff very helpful and courteous, efficient too. West End not far away, but not too near. Will certainly return in the not too distant future.",5,2011,07,19
122,stunning,"stayed here for a few nights for my birthday.
on arrival was given a free upgrade to harbour veiw room (because it was my birthday)
well worth it!
veiws were beautiful, parking was a bit of a mess. staff were lovely, room service was AMAZING! room was absolutely beautiful, I will definately be returning soon!",5,2011,07,17
122,Wyndham Grand - Best value for money in Central London!,"I personally love the Chelsea area and King's Road, and this specific hotel gives you the best value for money in Central London.

It's virtually the best option to get a spacious suite, in a good price for the city.

The hotel services are superb and indeed 5 start, and the staff is polite, helpful and efficient.

I gambled when trying this hotel for the 1st time as I had meetings in the Chelsea area - always stayed in London in either The Cumberland, The Montcalm or The Ritz (which are all great), and this was a very good surprise.

I do have one point as a criticism - I think high speed internet in guest rooms should be complimentary, it always adds bad taste when you need to pay for it, especially in these days and when you are using Wi-Fi.
I wouldn't mind paying a little more on the room rate and get internet for free, I think it's a better customer experience.

Overall - I really enjoyed my stay and will be happy to come back.",5,2011,07,14
122,"Woke up, it was a Chelsea Morning!","My wife and I stayed for one night at this hotel, beside the Thames. The hotel boasts that it's the only all suite 5* hotel in London and that may be so?  The idea of the stay was to remove ourselves from the  world of work and families and to enjoy abit of luxury.
Having driven through a traffic nightmare, turning into the private road leading to the hotel,  it was clear we were going to enjoy a bit of escapism, at a lot of cost!  Parking at the hotel is £40 per day, so be prepared to start spending, even before stepping aboard.
The hotel is luxurious and it's clear that a refurbishment has taken place, very recently, with the public areas and suites hung with modern paintings, seascapes, etc , adding  to the hotel's  nautical theme - i believe it was originally built by P & O, so there's  sailing  history here in the overall design and feel of the place. 
Indeed,  walking around the hotel is a bit like being on a cruise ship, looking out out from the bar onto the harbour of small boats, you could be imagine yourself on the South Coast. The reality is that you're in West London and unfortunately theres no disguising the sound of Heathrow bound aircraft,  descending overhead, which is intrusive in the early hours. Also, ours was a suite that overlooked the front entrance and  we heard the sound of black cabs cruising below our balcony window, rather than sailing craft. That said, the suite was beautifully appointed with great furniture,a huge bed, two Tv''s, a CD system, well stocked fridge, and  good quality slippers and bathrobes. The linen was brilliant and everything was clean and sparkling in the bathrooms, all  extremely ship shape.
Anyway,  regarding service, the only time I needed to call  was for fresh milk and this came chilled, in less than 5 minutes. Then having breakfast  in the sitting room, was seriously good  and as my wife pointed out,  the table was laid out  ""his n hers"", just  as we had ordered items off the menu.  A nice touch, adding to the impression that the hotel is trying hard, with an unexpectedly great attention to detail. The  breakfast was great quality,  really plentiful and nicely cooked,  including fantastic plates of fruit,  good pastries, plenty of fruit juices, we were hugely impressed and delighted.
We did try the Spa and both enjoyed a massage, which was nicely done in tranquil surroundings.  Both Male and Female Changing, provide dedicated steam and sauna rooms, which are well appointed and really nice  to use.  
We both agreed the hotel is a special treat and gave us the kind of  experience we were after and could afford. Would recommend it to anyone who likes to be pampered and fancys to float away in London Town.",4,2011,07,12
122,"Fabulously Good, Fabulously Expensive!","We had a wonderful stay at the Wyndham Grand.  Lovely room, excellent service, great location.  A bit disappointed that we were offered a choice of smoking or non-smoking room, requested smoking, received confirmation that our booking had been updated as such, then ended up in a non-smoking room due to lack of availability.  But, on the plus side, popping out the front for a cigarette break actually turned out to be better.  The doormen were friendly and it was great for 'people-watching'!
The bar was lovely, excellent service, tasty complimentary snacks delivered to our table to enjoy with our drinks.
We chose not to have dinner in the hotel as we are curry lovers and had seen the previous recommendations for 'Chutney Mary' down the road.  We also highly recommend this restaurant!
For breakfast, I was not hungry so just had a latte, while my husband went for the Full English.  At £23.50, it was very expensive and, to be honest, not that good!  I found the breakfast options to be very over-priced.  Breakfast is not 'fine dining' so shouldn't be priced as such.  A '3 egg omelette' was close to £20!  Granted, the price also entitled us to a selection from the 'tasting table', but I don't think that makes it good value!
The espresso machine in our room was a nice touch, but I'm not an espresso drinker and could not see that we were provided any alternative coffee-wise.
Over-all though, we were extremely satisfied with our stay at the Wyndham Grand and will definitely return.  Thank you very much for a very pleasant stay.",4,2011,07,10
122,Not 5 Star Quality or 5 Star Management,"Upon check in there was a problem with the room (a harbour room not available) and a king sized bed for two women (although it was noted prior to booking that we needed two beds). I emailed the Wyndham a month in advance and the hotel and received a note back that hotel received the requests- upon check in I was told they never received the email even though I had it with me. We were then offered a smoking room- disgusting and when that didn't suffice, offered a room with a couch bed and a king sized bed. Ordinarily we wouldn't had minded this until I pulled the couch out (which had not been made up) and had an enormous urine stain on it or something worse. When I mentioned that I had an email with the request ""that had been forwarded to the property"" to the Duty Manager he said ""let me see your email"" and so I pulled it up and than realized, the customer is always right and it's not my responsibility to have to pull proof of what I'm saying. I did have the email but the fact that I was questioned really disturbed me. We walked away from the front desk and waited for the room. I could hear two of the people at the front desk talking about myself and my traveling partner- totally and unquestionably irresponsible and inappropriate. 

After getting up into the room and seeing that the mattress was stained, I went downstairs to the Duty Manager to let him know that our mattress was unsanitary and needed to be replaced immediately- which it was with an equally pathetic mattress with wholes in it that was probably an 80 dollar ikea foam mattress. Very uncomfortable and very unsatisfactory- as we traveled from Los Angeles to London and with 5 star, you expect 5 star treatment both in the quality of the room and the quality in which one is treated.

We were there for business and pleasure and have routinely stayed at hotels such as the Savoy in Central London where 5 star is truly 5 star. We were called two days later and informed of an available upgrade and dinner on the hotel as an apology. (However now reading that a couple was offered an upgrade upon check in angers me even more as we waited until the 5th to be called). The urine stained mattress should have been more than enough of a reason to make us happy as it's a health hazard- quite honestly makes me sick even thinking about it.

We utilized the complimentary dinner which was lovely- only because of the way we were treated. The food was sub par at its finest unfortunately. However we were treated very nicely by the host and server so it made it worth it.

While we did book this on priceline, it shouldn't matter where the reservation, money is still money and everyone should be treated well. The one upside- the size of the rooms and the two bathrooms. The view is very nice and it's walking distance to Hyde Park if you don't mind walking a few miles. Overall- very unsatisfactory visit with this hotel and unhappy that we spent over $2k on a visit there for a week.",3,2011,07,09
122,a wonderful break,"I surprised my partner with a one night stay here for his birthday. Well our stay couldnt of started better as when we arrived at the hotel to drop off our bags before check in we were told our suite wouldnt be ready until the check in time of 3pm (which we expected) but we could be upgraded to a suite that was free and ready for us to check into straight away. The suite was beautiful, clean, had a wonderful view over the harbour and had everything and more that we could need (the complementry products were devine!) and a very comfortable bed.
We used the spa facilities and had a massage in the afternoon. Again, everywhere was very clean, beautifully decorated and the staff were friendly and couldnt do enough for you. The lady who gave us a massage had hands of an angel and got rid of so many knots in my back. Although the spa area is a bit of a rabbit warren (I have no sense of direction) the staff very kindly showed me the way. 
We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant where we recieved very good service and fantastic food whilst enjoying the view.
The location of the hotel was fantastic for us as it wasnt right in the hustle and bustle of town but only a 2 minute walk to a station so we were able to get where we wanted quickly and easily whilst enjoying the peace and quiet.
We had a wonderful stay here and would definately like to return. Thank you",5,2011,07,04
122,"Huge rooms, pretty location but a bit remote from the city","As per the title, all suite hotel with large rooms and nice setting by the harbour. However it's location is not good for visting central London, but for Chelsea it is near Kings Road and some good local restaurants (Chutney Mary very good).",4,2011,07,02
122,Quiet Oasis in West London,"Decided to spend a few days in London but frankly fed up with the constant hustle and bustle of the West End (and  the prevalent attitude of some hotels that tourists will put up with anything) so decided to look for a place outside of the West End. Chelsea is still pretty chic if pricey, and has a very different feel especially in the evenings particularly if you don't like the after dark sleaze found in some areas. A casual look around will be rewarded with a literal plethora of good interesting local pubs and restaurants to suit all tastes, cuisine and budgets. (A quick search of Time Out's website is more than worth the effort and cannot be recommended too highly).

Chose the Wyndham because of its excellent value for money, its location right on the river, and in particular because of the recently opened Imperial Wharf station literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel front door. If you are sightseeing, the reality is if you need to move around London the only quick, cheap and efficient way is to use the tube/rain network and for £8.00 per day for a travel card gets you everywhere in central London. The service to and from Imperial Wharf  is excellent; Gatwick 40 mins airport to hotel. The reason I mention this is simply because I noticed another reviewers comment that said its a bit out of the way. All things are relative and if you are travelling anything more than walking distance from your hotel it doesn't really matter which side of town you are. Give me Chelsea rather than the east end any time.

Excellent room quality, (seems they are all small suites). Basically couldn't fault it; clean, lovely linen, even 2 TV's. We were given a room on the top floor which was very quiet and spacious. Staff were unobtrusive yet still helpful, attentive and approachable. The hotel was not overly busy but not too sure what happens when there is a match at Stamford bridge; probably worth checking if your not an aficionado of the beautiful game. 

We didn't use room service or the hotel restaurant at all, simply because of the prices. That being said we did eat dinner at Ramseys, and had breakfast at Simpsons on the Strand as well as the best Kebab I have ever eaten from a place on Fulham Broadway........ an eclectic mix. The point I am making is not simply confined to the Wyndham. The prices here are the same as the prices charged by well known fine dining venues. Why would anyone take the risk on somewhere that has absolutely no cachet? There's simply no incentive, and previous experiences at many 5 star hotels would seem to support the view that they may just be catering to a captive audience. (Interesting to note not very many reviewers give stars for the restaurant or room service).This is perhaps a pity because on the day we left we sat out on the terrace with good bottle of wine and a lovely view directly over the marina which is a stones throw from the river. Probably a unique selling point in London yet still very quiet with just a few customers. Wasted opportunity perhaps, but would still book again and would recommend it for a great place to stay, but would still not even try the catering at these prices.",5,2011,06,26
122,GREAT HOTEL,"Large modern well-decorated suites, many overlooking Chelsea Harbor. Adjacent to London Design Center and a short walk to antique area on Kings Road, where bus access to Knightsbridge and Piccadily is available. A short taxi or bus ride from high end and fun shops on Kings Road and Saatchi museum. We have stayed in more than 10 hotels in London, and this is by far our favorite.",5,2011,06,24
122,For those who wants to pampered in luxury,"From the moment you step into the lobby and reception area of this hotel, you are struck by the beautiful and sophisticated design and modern atmosphere. It is really a 5 star all suites hotel.
The Suites are quite spacious and well appointed and some with views of Chelsea Harbour. there is abouslutely nothing to complain about the rooms. If you want full comfort this hotel is a great choice.
The staff was very helpful and professional. 
The location of the hotel is not that close to London's main attraction. This would be the only negative to the hotel. The taxi drive to the Piccadilly for example would be close to 20 GBP and depending on traffic it could take 10 to 20 minutes.
Even with that draw back i would stay in that hotel.",5,2011,06,22
122,Pure accomplished class...,"What a wonderful, understated, classy, elegant hotel this is. I have been fortunate to have stayed here almost 100 times over a three year period, traveling from Ireland to London, sometimes almost weekly, as we developed our business in the UK marketplace and feel suitably qualified therefore to echo the previous reviewer - it truly IS a home from home experience; the staff are warm, pleasant (Craig on reservations is an absolute gentleman), always discrete and highly professional - the surroundings plush, elegant, the atmosphere polished yet never fussy - the rooms contemporary and thoughtfully designed, with an extra large & wonderfully supportive bed, crisp sheets, deep pillows - superlative harbor view from the balcony, calming colour scheme inside, gorgeous breakfast (you must request room service on a sunny morning and bring your breakfast outside to the balcony, sitting there in the fluffy white robes, sipping the freshly squeezed juice, munching the hot croissants and soaking in the view as the sun warms you...it's just something you'd not expect to find in London at that price (or even 100% more - extraordinary value in truth and possibly the best 5 star value in the city if I'm not mistaken(?). 

Anyway, if you are in the city, want your hotel to be in a beautiful, exclusive setting, want a gorgeous, extra large suite (with two toilets), a huge comfortable bed and want the pleasure of sitting out on a balcony to survey the world below and want it all for the lowest price in the city then I believe you need look no further.",5,2011,06,17
122,A truly 5 Star Experience,"There are many aspects that make this hotel outstanding, not least of which all rooms are suites.  So many amenities are provided, from his and hers complimentary toiletries, both a kettle (with premium teas) and an espresso maker, two sinks, in room safe and umbrellas, to the superior bedding, space and comfort of the accommodations.  The staff are helpful and after many trips to London, one of the best  meals we have ever enjoyed was in this hotel's dining room.  The only negative is its distance from ""Central"" London, and transportation on the tube.  But buses are readily available.  It was amazing to find all the benefits of a resort in such a bustling metropolis.",5,2011,06,17
122,Oustanding All Suite Hotel off Kings' Road and Imperial Wharf,"As soon as I got here I  got the feeling of having reached a home away from home accommodation. After being courteously welcomed by a receptionist coming from Portugal I checked in and I got a nice accommodation in front of the elevators.
The suites are modern and furbished in a classic way. The guest tolet and the bathroom are luxurious with a lovely shower and a nice bathtub. Custom made toiletries and towels could be improved while the hardware of the  changing room and of the bedroom with  the linens are outstanding.
The SPA opens early but closes too early for someone who works all daylong to take profit of its existence and the personnel there is not so friendly
 The hotel service is discreet and professional thought not to the standards of a Luxury Hotel but to the ones of the most luxurious Condo-Apart Hotel. 

The location of the hotel is the one you choose if you want to stay far from the crowds but off Kings' Road. Chelsea and Hammersmith are at your feets together with awe inspiring views when having a walk on the Thames.",4,2011,06,09
122,Great staff. Beautiful hotel,Great hotel. Suite was large with 2 washrooms. Staff was very helpful.,5,2011,06,07
122,fabulous hotel,"WE stayed here for the second time on a special deal. The suites are fabulous, loads of room, two  two toilets and a bidet, lovely toiletries, two tv's  complimentary wine. The staff are welcoming , very profession , attentive,  helpful,  Five star hotel in every way and on the special deal at £139 pounds amazing value for money.We would stay here every time. Only drawback , a bit far from the centre  of London but worth the extra taxi fare.",5,2011,06,06
122,Not 5 Star,"Stayed here for 1 night, lugguage took 3 hours to arrive at the room after continually calling the operator. The furniture was dated (and I don't mean vintage- just old and knackered) the room was certainly not 5 star. The air con didn't work properly, had to get someone to fix it. Was disapointed with the room but the food in the restaurant was nice. Shame about the atmosphere in the restaurant though. Very dry. If you want a 5 star hotel in central London do not stay here- it is too far from the main attractions- you will waste time and money on tubes and taxis.",3,2011,06,03
122,Lovely luxury hotel,"We stayed at the Wyndham over the Bank Holiday weekend. We arrived via Imperial Wharf station (less than 5 mins walk away) and the hotel was easy to find having asked at the station for directions.
 
Our room (a suite, as all the rooms in the hotel are) was fantastic. Clean and modern with a huge comfy bed, televisions in the lounge and bedroom, a coffee machine and best of all a large balcony overlooking Chelsea Harbour. We also paid a visit to the spa area which had a gym, a lovely big pool with water fountains and strange underfoot water jets. There were seperate sauna and steam rooms in the changing rooms. I loved the sauna, so relaxing and very clean, with all the towels and toiletries you could require.
 
The hotel service was very discreet (indeed Barcelona football players were staying in the hotel at the same time as us but there was little fuss other than an abundance of severe looking sercurity guards!). We had breakfast daily and the food could not be faulted, my eggs royale were delicious. The only slight issue was that service was a bit slow, requests for tea, toast and the delivery of cooked items took quite some time. I'm not sure if this was because you were supposed to linger over your breakfast or because the staff were busy with room service orders. We were lucky enough to dine in the hotel one evening and the food again, was fanastic. Reasonably sized with lovely flavours especially the celeriac dauphinoise.
 
The location of the hotel is great for a nice peaceful stay, as previously mentioned it is close to Imperial Wharf overground station, there's a bus stop about 3 mins away that goes direct to Earls Court station or a short walk (less than 10 mins) to the bottom of the Kings Road and you have buses right to Piccadilly. Fulham Broadway station is also about 15mins walk away. There is no lack of transport links, just buy yourself a travel card and off you go.
 
If you are looking for a luxury hotel, with great service, and without the hustle and bustle of being right in central London then this is definately the place for you. I am looking forward to our next stay already!",5,2011,05,31
122,"STUNNING HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION & VIEWS, GORGEOUS ROOMS","Love this hotel.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Gorgeous chic suites with espresso machines, cd players etc.

The only down side was this hotel was full (due to chelsea flower show) and so the service in the restaurant for lunch, dinner and breakfast wasnt too great.  They needed extra staff and the food was cold so we had to complain.  But other than that is a lovely hotel and would definately go again.",4,2011,05,31
122,"Loved the room, pool and fitness facilities!","The Wyndham Grand in Chelsea Harbour was one of the nicest hotels we stayed in so far on our European trip.  It is located a bit far from the sites but if you are okay to walk 15 minutes to the Fulham Broadway station, it is easy to get anywhere. My husband, 5 year old daughter and I stayed in this beautiful hotel for 3 nights and could have easily stayed longer. The pool was a good size and perfect temperature. The fitness facilities were fantastic - lots of free weights, machines, etc. The room was nice: bedroom separate from the living room with flat screen TVs in each, plus a bath and shower. The best bonus was the espresso machine.
We would definitely go back!",5,2011,05,31
122,Superb!,"Had dinner in the new brasserie restaurant.
Excellent service from Lionel and Francesca, hotel lucky to have them.
Food pretty good value, too. Spagbol around £11, chicken £12 and burger £15.
Coffee v expensive, Americano for £4.50!
Barcelona FC stayed here before the Champions League Final at Wembley.",5,2011,05,27
122,bad location with horrible staff...NOT 5 star,"We stayed at the Wyndham on Chelsea Harbour because it was a 5 star all suite hotel. What we did not realize is that the location is incredibly in convenient. You must take an overground train to a different stop to even get on the underground. The location is awful for seeing London, and there are not restaurants and pubs nearby. 

To make matters worse, the night before we left, or safe completely malfunctioned and shutdown. Someone was sent up to fix it, but evidently, it had just died and had to be drilled. They had to bring in a special technician the morning we were to leave. They spent 2 hours drilling into the safe  at 9:00am in the morning in order to retrieve our belongings. It was loud and ridiculous. Not one person apologized for the inconvenience, nor did anyone even inquire about our stay when we checked out. After stay in 4 great hotels on our vacation, this was the worst way to end our trip. We will definitely not return.

The rooms were large with 2 bathrooms and a living room. However, they felt dingy and dated. This probably was a nice hotel 10-20 years ago. Based on the location alone, this is not a good hotel. Add in horrible service and dingy feeling rooms, and you have a recipe for disaster.",2,2011,05,27
122,Worst Experience Ever,"Terrible Terrible hotel. I often stay at the Berkley and the Mandarin Oriental, but I thought that I would give this hotel a try after seeing it on the internet. First things first. The hotel is miles away from anything and getting from the hotel to any point of interest is a complete nightmare. You have two options here - one is to walk all the way around the hotel to the back, (10-15 mins) and then use the OVERground, which is not as frequent as the underground and could take up to 30 mins to show up. The other is to walk to the underground station. Now the people at Concierge told us that that this would take 15 mins, but it ended up taking us half an hour, and we got lost several times on account of their directions (""you just go up this road and take a left""). While we were walking, we noticed several unsightly buildings including construction sites, sewagy looking streams, and a power plant of some sort. We did not like either of these options, and had to end up taking a cab everywhere, after the first night which, given the hotels location (i.e. in the middle of nowhere) cost a fortune.

When we arrived, there were no doormen in sight, and we had to drag our own suitcases through the door. This is completely unacceptable.  Check in was slow and arduous including an awkward moment when they tried to sign me and my wife up to a loyalty program, which, after a 6 hour flight, I was hardly interested in. To be honest, this was rather crass and completely unnecessary. 

We had to wait an eternity for the front desk to get to us because there was a massive queue when we arrived that almost went out of the front door. It seemed that the reception staff were taking absolutely ages to process simple requests, and they were clearly under trained and in a state of panic. We were guaranteed an early room by the hotel, which was not honoured at check in, which seems to be a common trend after reading a few of the other reviews. When I tried to explain to the girl that it was guaranteed by reservations, she just shrugged her shoulders and said ‘we are really busy, so you will have to wait as I don’t have any rooms to give you.’ So we were told that we could leave our bags with them and go out for the day. Once we got back we were told the bags were in the room, which they were not, and after several calls, I had to come down and get them myself. Now when I say I got them, I actually mean that I had to go into the luggage room and pick them up myself as the luggage porter could not find the bags(!). 

Once we got to the room, there was a welcome letter from the General Manager which was addressed to someone else! 

There were a catalogue of other service slip ups, including a missed room service order,  several billing mistakes, unsophisticated reception staff who can barely put together two words of English etc etc. Oh and the noise from slamming doors. It seems that every door in the hotel slams shut, and the noise penetrates into the rooms. During the day, I can live with it, but it really bothered us all night. Do not pick this hotel if you like sleeping.

You really notice the difference between this hotel and hotels in Central London….it really reminds me of the old adage ‘you get what you pay for.’ I mean the class of the staff is on a completely different scale. The fellow at concierge walked with a ridiculous swagger, and was talking like he was out of a gangster movie. At the Berkley and the Mandarin, it just seems that they are so much more refined. 

All in all I think that this hotel does not even come close to those in Central London, location is terrible, transport links are not great, and staff seem like a bunch of incompetent jokers. My advice for anyone who normally stays in central London to stay away at all costs, as this hotel is not in the same league.",1,2011,05,25
122,Service,"After reading one of the recent reviews I became concerned about Non Smoking rooms and early check In, and I was also concerned that because I used an Internet site to get a discounted room I might not get the best of service.

This has not been the case as I was very impressed that the Hotel replied to my concerns and assured me that no smoking rooms had been reserved and they would do there best to accomadate my early check in request,  They also outlined a back up plan for luggage storage and using the health club for changing if a room was unavailable .This was very important to us as we will have been traveling over night and will really apreaciate having the abilty to freshen up'
This Hotel is already offering 5 star service and I have 'not even checked in. 
Really looking forward to our stay now.",5,2011,05,16
122,Highly Recommended,"Great hotel. We were in town for a funeral and stayed there for a week on a hotels.ca discounted package. Quiet, clean rooms with a sitting room and bedroom, balcony, and friendly staff. Food was good and looking over the harbour and Thames was a treat! It is a little bit out of the way but the bus is easy and there is also a water bus that runs during rush hour to near Charing Cross. A few nearby Fulham restaurants are excellent and much better value than what one gets closer to the big attractions. I would say it is not my definition exactly of a five star hotel in that some parts of it are a little worn and tired but compared to other pricey locations in London - a good alternative.",4,2011,05,14
122,DONT STAY HERE IF GOOD SERVICE IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR,"We stayed in the Grand Wyndham Chelsea Harbour for 3 nights from 20/04/11. It was our anniversary and I called them in advance to make them aware of this. We also requested an early check-in and was told to call on the day of arrival. We called many times on the day of arrival and were told our room will be ready by 2-00pm. However when we arrived we were told our room will not be ready until 4-00pm. So after already a long day we had to leave the bags with them and go and kill another couple of hours.
When we came back and picked up the room keys, we could not get into our room as the keys were not working. So we waited for the person who was bringing our luggage up to let us into our room. Also it was our anniversary and they had given us room 108 right opposite the 3 lifts, which we really were not happy about. We requested for an alternative room and the only other option was a Smoking room, which obviously was a real turn off. For gods sake it was our anniversary and soon as you enter the floor of the smoking rooms you could feel the smoke hit you.
We had no option but to stick with room 108 and were assured there is hardly any noise but throughout the 3 nights, there was continuous noise of people going in and out of the lifts at various times and it was really annoying!! Also for the first two days, we could not get into the room as our keys just would not work and we had already changed them about 4 times. We were told we were keeping the keys next to our mobile phones which was disengaging the keys but when the security of the hotel tried to let us in with his various master keys, he had exactly the same problem. He admitted they have had a lot of problems with this lock and changed the battery recently. So we had to go wait downstairs while someone could open our door and finally when they opened the door they said someone will come within 30 mins to fix it but nobody came until the next day!!!
I am not sure if the hotel staff had something against us, as on many occasions when we called the reception and room service there was no answer. Add the parking nightmare of £40 a day with the hotel or £27 a day for the NCP then all in all it was a very disappointing stay. Don't get me wrong it really is a nice hotel and the suite is lovely but we experienced so many problems. It was our anniversary and wanted it to be very special but the level of service was very poor and all the above issues were avoidable.
After reading so many good reviews for the hotel we were really looking forward to our stay but after the 3 nights we certainly will not be returning.",3,2011,04,25
122,Fantastic Hotel,"The Wyndham is slightly out of the tourist area, but closer to Heathrow and it was only 15 minutes ride on our return. The area is lovely and suites have balconies to sit and watch the boats on the Thames.
The hotel has two room suites and 2 bathrooms (one is powder room)
but ideal when traveling with 2 teen girls. Two queen beds (so many hotels only had
one king) and pull out sofa.
The cab fare to the Eye was nominal and we picked up the Tour bus there.
Staff were very friendly/helpful and the food/service in the restaurant was wonderful.",5,2011,04,22
122,"Very good hotel, charming staff.","I had to do some business in London, so I took my family with me for a bit of sightseeing. I booked the Wyndham because I thought we'd get more space than in a city centre hotel, there was Chelsea Harbour to walk around and it has a pool. More of which shortly.

From the moment we arrived the staff could not have been more hospitable. Those that greeted us at the door were always cheerful and charming, with a high-five for the children. Nothing was too much trouble.

The hotel is ""suites only"" which suited us  as a family and it also seems quite popular with business people. The acccommodation was well appointed and maintained as well as being carefully thought out. The espresso machine in the room saw plenty of action, though Internet access at £24 per day didn't. It is free in the business centre and in my opinion should be throughout the hotel.

Breakfast was good. Not always perfect but any requests (for example lighter toast) were speedily and politely dealt with. The homemade muesli, which is like a cold porridge with fruit and nuts, was lovely when combined with the preserved fruits also on offer. It is also worth mentioning that the kitchen was very accommodating with regard to breakfasts for the children, producing pretty much whatever they asked for. 

The pool was difficult to use as a family because children are only allowed to swim between 9.30-11.00 and 3.30-5.00. This is because it is in use by ""members"" of the hotel gym / spa faciilites at other times. This ruled out an end of the day family swim after returning from the City. 

Getting into the City was always easy because there is a taxi rank outside - it cost £8-£18 depending upon where I was going.

Just down the road from the hotel is the Lotts Road pub, which serves good wine and excellent value food, with a children's menu. 

We didn't try the hotel for dinner because we thought pub / pizza dining would better suit our children after a tiring day. We tried some food samples though and they were excellent.

All said and done, then, the Wyndham was an excellent hotel for our purposes and we will use it again. We probably won't use the pool next time because it is just too much hassle with children. But even without that facility the Wyndham could well become our default choice for trips to the City when travelling as a family.",5,2011,04,15
122,Superb Hotel!,"I read some reviews and was a bit concerned before arriving; however, this is truly a superb hotel!  As an American, I'm use to getting a decent size room with a king size bed . . . something I don't always get when I travel abroad . . . this all-suite hotel offers spacious rooms with nice amenities and very comfortable beds.  While they had a fantastic deal on their phone service, especially for international usage, for some reason the Internet service was quite expensive and not very good.  The location is a bit out-of-the way from the center of things in London; but given the quality and price, I still found it to be a great choice!",5,2011,03,30
122,Close to perfect and highly recommended.,"My partner and I spent Saturday night at the Wyndham. We had not stayed there since it was the Conrad, and so were intrigued to see how the hotel had changed, if at all. I apologise that this is a lengthy review but wanted to record all the details of our trip to make sure the hotel is done justice. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly and professional reception staff, who offered us a very welcome and refreshing hot towel and took us through the usual check in details. We were then asked whether we would like to receive some free wine and a cheese selection, in return for becoming a member of the Wyndham loyalty club. Since this only involved giving an email address, we happily agreed, and were then able to specify what time we’d like to receive our cheese and wine. 

The reception area itself has been vastly improved since my last visit; as well as a general décor overhaul, the reception desks themselves have been brought to the forefront of the area, presumably in order to ensure that guests are greeted immediately rather than having to make their way across the large lobby to the reception desks which used to be towards the back. The remainder of the lobby is now given over to comfortable seating, and to an in-hotel store which appeared to stock, amongst other things, clothing and jewellery lines. 

We then made our way up to our suite, which was on the marina side of the building. The suites are simply beautifully appointed; they are absolutely pristine and include all that even the most seasoned and cynical traveller could want from a hotel. Our suite included, non-exhaustively, a Muletti coffee machine (as well as the usual kettle), well-stocked mini-bar, safe, two televisions, CD player, bathroom with twin basins, bath, separate shower and luxury products. 

We then made our way downstairs to the bar area where we were able to have a table by the window overlooking the harbour. We dined on a selection of very good ‘small plates’ washed down with two of the nicest cocktails I have ever had the pleasure of consuming (and I have probably had more cocktails than the average person!). 

We then returned to our suite, and the only disappointment of the weekend was that we were unable to book for a massage in the on site spa. I completely accept that this is entirely our fault and that we should have booked in advance, but it’s worth a note so that others know that this is necessary. Any disappointment was quickly made up for, however, when we discovered a bottle of white wine and a selection of beautiful chocolates, which had been provided as an extra treat by the hotel as it was our anniversary weekend (I later discovered that a good friend had informed them of this). 

We decided to have our wine sitting on the balcony which had lovely views over the harbour and river beyond and was very peaceful and secluded. 

We then went back down to the bar area and enquired as to whether we could have a newspaper. There weren’t any immediately to hand but the helpful bar manager quickly found us a selection to choose between, and we settled down on a comfortable sofa to read and relax. The bar was quite full at this stage, mainly with people indulging in afternoon tea, and this provided a pleasant buzz and plenty of people watching opportunities without being obtrusively noisy. We stayed in the bar for the duration of the afternoon, and chose from an excellent selection of champagnes to get the evening off to a celebratory start. Whilst in the bar we were given a seemingly endless supply of complimentary nibbles and our time there was accompanied by subtle live piano playing. 

That evening, we settled in the lovely restaurant to enjoy one of the very best meals we’ve ever had the pleasure of eating. We are generally quite hard to please and have eaten in many beautiful restaurants, but at the Twenty Ten every detail was exquisite. The food was sublime, from the amuse-bouche to the pudding, the selection of wines and champagnes was exemplary, and the service was perfect. The atmosphere, too, was one of the best we had ever encountered. 

After dinner, we retired and enjoyed a night of peaceful sleep in one of the most comfortable beds we’d ever slept in. So great was the comfort that upon check out, we actually enquired as to who supplies the pillows for the Wyndham so that we could buy our own. Unfortunately they were unable to tell us but even so this should give an indication of what a lovely night’s sleep we had. 

The next morning we enjoyed time drinking delicious coffee on the balcony, overlooking the river and soaking up the morning sunshine, before making our way down to the restaurant for the Harbour Brunch we had booked the night previously. We were greeted by the exceptionally friendly restaurant manager, Jan, who deserves a special mention for looking after us so brilliantly throughout our stay. We were given a table by the window and taken on what I can only describe as a guided tour of the phenomenal buffet brunch selection. Non exhaustively, we were offered: a continental selection of croissants and pastries et al, a plethora of cold meats and cheeses and breads, a seafood buffet with prawns and oysters and dressed crab, a selection of salads such as Caesar, cous cous, confit duck with wild rice, chorizo and potato salad, an omelette bar, a cooked breakfast station, and then the hot ‘main course’ selection – rib of beef, poached salmon, loin of pork…the list goes on.  And then puddings! A whole bar of a seemingly endless variety of different puddings: cakes, tarts, crème brulees, macarons, salted caramel tarts, a chocolate fountain with fruits and marshmallows. Everything was beautifully prepared, and enjoyed with first a complimentary glass of champagne and then a glass of reasonably priced and extremely delicious cabernet sauvignon. We spent a truly delightful morning sampling everything that was on offer, and left the hotel feeling extremely relaxed and happy.

This is a wonderful hotel, and I cannot imagine how anybody could review it negatively – I can only assume that they are either deluded or so cosseted that they have completely unrealistic expectations of perfection. I have noticed that a number of customers have complained about its location, and to this I would say that surely an element of ‘caveat emptor’ applies – presumably the customer themselves has an element of responsibility in selecting what hotel they stay in and if the location of the Wyndham is unsuitable, they surely should have chosen to stay elsewhere. For our purposes, a hotel slightly away from the hustle and bustle and noise of central London was ideal, but had we wished to go out more centrally it would certainly have been easy enough to do so. 

From the décor to the food and drink and especially the service, I thoroughly recommend the Wyndham and very much look forward to returning.",5,2011,03,30
122,Eccellente,"This hotel was really great.  I travelled with my family ( 2 very young children ) and we loved this place. Room was great, clean and big enough for us. Staff  polity and helpful . Breakfast was good too We had twice the room service and was perfect; service fast, food very good.  In the morning we were used to spend some times in the pool and it was wonderful. 
Location is not bad, is not central , but  you only need to take a bus to an  underground station  and from there you can go  very fast everywhere.
Next time  we will go to London we will stay there for sure.",5,2011,03,30
122,Truly Grand,"For the price, this Hotel is without doubt the best 5* Hotel that Iwehave stayed in in London. Rooms are spacious, well appointed and the staff were very courteous and polite at all times; nothing was too much trouble for them. On one occasion when no taxi was available for us at the front of the Hotel, one of the Hotel Limousines was brought around for us and took us to our destination, which was a nice touch.
 
This break was an early Wedding Anniversary celebration for us and a bottle of chilled wine and chocolate covered strawberries  were waiting for us in our room, which we really appreciated. The only slight niggle I have about the room is that I found the bed  little hard and it would have benefited from a mattress topper.

Meals in the restaurant were excellent and the service very good, however we did find that the breakfast was a little expensive .

All in all this Hotel is one that we will definitely visit again and with the new Imperial Wharf rail link only a short walk away access to all the sites of London is made very easy.",5,2011,03,29
122,Good reasonably price stay in London,"We were looking at a place to stay for a couple of nights in London and our usual haunts over in the west end were just way to expensive and no deals. So we ended up here through one of the hotel web sites and have to say it was very good. The room was comfortable - a suite, and had all you could need, in fact more than we needed as the living room area really wasn't needed.

The staff were friendly and the bar was pretty good too, very relaxing. The location was fine for us as it allowed us to see a bit of Chelsea.

In short if you are looking for a reasonably priced quality hotel you could go far worse than this place",4,2011,03,20
122,First class,"Stayed for a weekend when extending a business trip to London.  After a few days staying in central London, the location was a nice change of pace. It's a great jumping off point to explore Chelsea and King's Road (which I hadn't previously visited) and the rest of the city is still accessible via taxi and tube. 

Exceptionally spacious and comfortable suite. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We accidentally left an item behind in the room and they were very responsive and helpful in returning it.

If you're there, I would recommend checking out the Lot Road Pub across the street for great food, a good beer list, and free WiFi.",5,2011,03,17
122,What a lovely hotel!,"This is a beautiful new hotel. They only have suites so that limits the number of people who can stay. I had a beautiful sitting room- with a sofa, a chair, coffee table, a desk, a flat screen Tv, an espresso maker(it uses pods) and a tea maker.  I also had a powder room in the foyer leading from my door to the sitting room. The room was a good size and they have both British and an American socket(I didn't have to drag my own socket along). The bedroom has really nice linens, another TV, a large closet and then a full bathroom with a shower and separate tub, monu toiletries, a robe, slippers and a separate toilet(with bidet).  At night there is turndown service when they provide ice and more filtered water(the hotel says not to drink their softened/treated tap water except for rinsing your teeth so they provide thier own bottled ewater). The staff was very nice and friendly.  Nearby in the residential area, there are a few restaurants. a coffee bar and a lovely new Tesco(express or metro- I forget). It is extremely quiet because the hotel is off of a private road- buses,taxis and residents/local workers cars only. As I prefer not to take taxis, there is a bus- the C3 and the London overground- the bus can be slow during rush hour but I prefered it to taking the overground and then the underground to reach Earls Court. I did take the underground/overground to and from the airport(the overground can be quite crowded on weekends but the bus was not possible for me with a suitcase).",5,2011,03,13
122,Lovely hotel but location not great.,"We stayed here mid February and while the hotel itself is lovely, we found the location inconvenient. The nearby Imperial Wharf was not working due to construction ( not the fault of the hotel) but when we enquired on two separate occasions about the complimentary shuttle service advertised on their website, there seemed to be general confusion. We eventually gave up. On our first night, a false fire alarm went off at 3:30am and we had to dress and leave our room. As an apology, we received a letter and a bottle of wine which was a lovely touch. On the whole, we enjoyed our stay in our lovely spacious suite and the friendly staff made the stay memorable.",4,2011,03,07
122,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We stayed here for my wife's 40th birthday surprise weekend in London (which I managed to wrap around us attending the England v France rugby at Twickenham!!).  The location is a little more out of central London than those who are looking to do the London tourist sites may want but if you want a relaxing location in a great hotel near some outstanding restaurants and bars this is what you are looking for.  Having the space of a suite was a real bonus - for £40 upgrade we had a room overlooking the marina.  Reasonably priced (you are in London so nothing comes cheap), lovely rooms (suites), friendly and efficient staff, very nice spa (which is reasonably priced for London), OK gym but the pool was out of action.  We didn't eat at the hotel - try the Chelsea Bun cafe 10 mins down the Kings Road for a more reasonably priced ""down to earth"" breakfast experience and were out to dinner on both nights - but overall a cracking place.  Thanks to the Wyndham team.",5,2011,03,01
122,Perfection !!,"I have stayed at the Wyndham before when my father has been visiting from cheshire and have always found it the absolute best hotel in london and now im old enough to be going on my own mini breaks my boyfriend and I decided to book.

We live in East London and coming to Chelsea Harbour is like a visit to the South of France for us, the hotel is relaxing from the moment you walk in the door, greated by George who is always helpful and a happy face.

The staff are polite, friendly and not afraid to have a chat which makes you feel at home instantly.
We were given our room an hour early as it was ready and our luggage was brought up for us, as usual the room was PERFECT.

The bed is so soft and inviting its easy to just melt the day away! We went for a wander to the Kings Road for a late lunch but couldnt wait for our cozy evening in our room.
Everything we wanted was in the room or at the touch of a button, the bathroom has lovely products and a great bath, two toilets are available and two television which helps with any tv choice arguments that may occur.

After a blissful sleep we indulged in the Sunday Brunch, which is a hidden gem, miles of food of the highest standard greeted us and the service couldnt have been better, delightful staff and the chef staff were so polite and helpful as well. Couldnt have been a better start to a sunday. The views were also breathtaking and had us planning a chelsea wedding.. despite not being engaged!!

I have never written a review  before but i felt the need to after our stay, this hotel is a relaxing and luxurious break and despite having stayed in some of the top hotels in the world, the Wyndham will remain one of my firm favourites.",5,2011,02,28
122,Have returned for London feeling refreshed because of this hotel,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband and son age 11 for 4 nights.
We found the accomodation to be of a very high and spacious standard, and the staff to be equally well trained and attentive.  We will definitely be staying there again.  The hotel was slightly outside the main areas, which I found really good because it gave us a sense of sanctuary, and we loved walking along Kings Road or bobbing on a bus.  Everything including the food, concierge and reception and service was great.",5,2011,02,27
122,Hotel was lovely though first impressions are everything,"Firstly I would like to state that the hotel in general had exceeded my expectations. The foyer and style of the public areas from the bar to the lounge was exceptional. Probably one of the best styled hotels I have stayed in and in my line of work I usually attend a number of hotels around the world.
I had recently had time to spend in London with my wife as I travel a lot on business and chose to stay at the Wyndham hotel on this particular occasion.
My first impressions were of delight at the friendliness of the door staff upon my arrival, the problem was when I had to check in. there was an eastern European blonde tall lady receptionist who I hadn’t caught the name of, who was arguing quite loudly with staff near the concierge desk. She instantly gave both myself and my wife dirty looks and was abrupt, disrespectful and rude when we were checking in, as if we were disturbing her. She was annoyed at our simple questions regarding the facilities and made my wife rather upset at the way she came across and spoke to us both. Although she didn't use rude language her tone was harsh and discourteous, not what you'd expect from a five star property. The rest of the stay fortunately was enjoyable and most often the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful and the service prompt, it’s just a shame about the one or two bad eggs.",3,2011,02,25
122,Fantastic Hotel,"Hotel suites/rooms, staff and amenities were fantastic.  Great value.",5,2011,02,20
122,Absolutely fantastic. Highly recommended.,"I have never written a review before DURING my stay at any hotel . My husband and two daughters,aged 2 and 5 checked in this afternoon. From the second we stepped out of our cab the service has been absolutley 5star. From the doormen, to check in, to the standard of the suite, absolutley fantastic. location is great if you would like easy acesss to London's main attractions, yet a peaceful location. The staff also have all been exceptionally welcoming and friendly with our children. We have stayed at other Wyndham hotels whilst living in the US, but so far this is definatley the best. Top tip , I would recommend booking breakfast with your room. It works out much more cost effective. We didn't which was a mistake on my behalf. Overall a fantastic hotel, and a fantastic price considering suite size and true 5 star service. Mcmanus family.",5,2011,02,18
122,Fantastic weekend,"Beautiful spacious suite, with a great view of the river a night.  Delicious food in their own restaurant.  And great customer services throughout.",5,2011,02,13
122,Very Classy All-Suites Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights on the way back to the States after a week in Southern England.  We got a very good deal on Priceline by purchasing well in advance.  The suite was roomy with a balcony and very nicely appointed.   It's a little out of the way from Central London, which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you are looking for.  It is about a six block walk to King's Road where there are good restaurants and nightlife.  Absent the 24 pounds it cost for wireless internet in the room, we had a great experience there.",5,2011,02,12
122,Silver Wedding,We stayed at the Wydham Grand to celebrate our Silver Wedding. The Hotel left a bottle of Champagne which was a lovely touch,5,2011,02,07
122,"Very Nice, Comfortable Hotel","We loved our stay at the Chelsea Harbor.
The area was new for us, but we found it convenient: direct bus lines take you to the center, and the hotel offers a courtesy limo that can take you to Harrods or Knightsbridge, for example.
A nice and diverse selection of restaurants (Megan, Chutney Mary etc) and interesting interior decorating stores are within easy walking distance.
The suites were beautiful, fresh and well appointed, the breakfast (expensive if not booked with the room) offered a nice selection and was served in the restaurant facing the harbour.
We will definitely try to stay here again in the future.",5,2011,01,28
122,outstanding hotel,"5 star hotel for service, amenities , staff courtesy , food , spa 

 Ideal for business travellers",5,2011,01,24
122,"Great hotel, challenging location","I used some free nights to get a five-star hotel experience in London, and I wish I had opted for the Days Hotel.  The Chelsea Grand itself is very nice, what you would experience at an upscale hotel, but not extraordinary.  The suite and accomodations were very nice, but we were there to see and visit London, not stay in a room.  The hotel is close to an overground stat - not the tube.  The connection from the city center can be a challenge, especially on New Year's Eve.  By the time we arrived a the last connection the trains had stopped running on that route, so we took the tube to the next stop and walked about a mile, as I'm too cheap to pay for the taxi.  It was a nice evening and we enjoyed the adventure.  The axiom for hotel pricing held true - the more expensive hotel, the less free amenities - wifi, breakfast, etc.. Oh well...nice experience, but we'll stay elsewhere next time.",4,2011,01,17
122,Lovely all-suite hotel,"We stayed for one night in December, on the first night of our honeymoon. 

Check-in was friendly and efficient, and although we were a little early for check in (arround lunch time) we were told that the room would be ready in 20 minutes. We waited in the bar and unfortunately 20 minutes turned into over an hour. It was a pity - if they'd said up front that it would be a while, we wouldn't have had a problem leaving our luggage and returning later on. 

The suite itself was lovely, with splendid views of the harbour. A comfortable lounge area and a magnificent bathroom were great feautures, and the champagne and strawberries the hotel send up to the room made us feel really special. The only real criticism of our room was the bed, which was strangely soft and bouncy for a hotel and didn't provide a great night's rest. 

The hotel isn't particularly well situated if you're planning to do some sight-seeing in central London, although the Imperial Wharf station is a few minutes away. We still managed to get to wherever we were going with a minimum of fuss, but sometimes we wished we were closer. 

The staff were very good about helping out with directions and other little things. My Blackberry needed charging and I had forgotten the charger, so I called reception. They couldn't lend me a charger but offered to charge it at reception for me, and then sent someone to collect it from our suite. 

Overall, a good experience which we thouroughly enjoyed, the soft bed notwithstanding. Would we stay there again? Probably, although if we were in town for sightseeing again we would probably stay somewhere closer to the action.",5,2011,01,11
122,Disappointed,"I had previously stayed at this hotel when it was a Conrad and it was a true five star experience. So we were unsure of what to expect as a Wyndham.  Phone conversations and emails to confirm the booking were helpful and welcoming.  All this changed when we arrived at the hotel at 21.00 hungry and tired.  The reception desk is small and umimpressive for such a large hotel, so we were kept waiting by the staff who were busy answering telephone enquiries.  No apology when the receptionist finally got around to us, no smile or nice welcome.  

Accommodation - The three of us (my two daughters and I) shared a suite -  this was fine as the sofa bed was in the lounge area so we had plenty of space.  The suite was clean, two TVs, large beds, plenty of towels, good housekeeping service, two toilets, tea and coffee making facilities.   Downside was the hairdryer that packed in after 3 mins of use each time, the separate shower cubicle was really small which meant there was no way to get out of the flow.  The electronic control panel enabled you to control the shower and to pause it so I guess this was a way of saving water.

Food - We were tired on arrival so ordered room service.  Pizza, cheeseburger, fries, desserts.  Nothing too challenging - It was OK but would not rave about it.  Still tired the next morning, we decided to be lazy and ordered breakfast in our room.  The Room Service line was  busy so the reception took the call and asked if they could phone us back - how unusual in a five star hotel!  After a 20 mins wait, I gave up and after another couple of attempts managed to get through to Room Service.  The continental option we ordered was disappointing - the breakfast basket products all had a weird oily taste which made them inedible.  The only items we managed to eat were the individually wrapped Weetabx and Rice Krispies. Vastly over priced at £19 a head.

Staff - the concierge staff were cheery although they could find no trace of the taxi were ordered to take us to Heathrow Airport even though it was ordered at the same time as we stowed our luggage with them.  A bit worrying!

The pool and spa were closed undergoing renovation during our stay.

The one great advantage to the hotel is the opening of the overground Imperial Wharf station which is 5 mins walk around the neighbouring Design Buiding as directed by the Concierge.  On our final day, we discovered a short cut through the hotel car park - pity we had to find this out ourselves.

So sorry Wyndham, I was not impressed by this hotel which was a real shame as it was superb as a Conrad.  As in all these Trip Advisor reviews, opinions differ depending on persona experiences, but to me this hotel is not hitting five star standards.  As this was our first ever Wyndham experience, if this is representative, then this will be our last.",3,2011,01,02
122,Wonderful hotel,"This is my 1st stay at the Wyndham hotel and it was a very enjoyable stay.  I had a difficult day getting to the hotel due to adverse winter weather and ended up arriving late in the evening. I found the suites to be spacious and had a homely feel to it. I ordered from the room service menu which was delivered on the time given and when the food was delivered I asked the member of staff for an additional item which he happily delivered very quickly. There was very little noise and I enjoyed a good nice sleep. 
I have two areas of criticism. The first when I arrived at Chelsea harbour I drove directly to the nearby car park. I then called hotel reception and asked ‘what is the best access to hotel from the car park’. The member of reception staff I spoke to told there is no direct or convenient access to the hotel. I then proceeded to walk out the car park exit and around the residential street to reach the hotel. I later found out from a guest staying at the hotel at the back of the car park level 1 there is a signpost for Wyndham hotel which leads to a stairwell exiting to the side of the hotel.
The second area of criticism is when I approached the hotel with my luggage there were two doormen standing outside not one asked me if I was guest staying at the hotel, offered any form of greeting or offer to take my luggage into the hotel.  The worst thing was one of the doormen stood in front of the glass door this meant I had drag my luggage through the revolving door which is not ideal if you have luggage.",5,2010,12,22
122,A wonderful experience,"We had been concerned, after booking, that recent reviews had suggested problems at the Wyndham Grand. We are confident to report that we encountered none of these. We were impressed with the hotel and its staff from the moment we arrived. The suite was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. The facilities were above expectation. The romms are quiet and we had very good nights' sleep. We ate an evening meal in the hotel and enjoyed the food which was reasonably proced and very tasty, breakfast was also delightful, the range of food available to be freshly cooked was impressive. We cannot speak highly enough of the experience offered by the hotel following a relaxing and highly enjoyable stay. We would encourage anyone to book to stay here.",5,2010,11,30
122,Shiny and Lovely,"I stayed here this weekend with my husband for a night away from the children and for dinner in Chelsea. The suites were lovely, very clean, modern and high end. We were shown a room on the smoking floor as we were early for check in, I was apprehensive about this, but thesuite didn't smell at all. The products were great and the robes, bed linen etc very comfy. The check in staff were plesant and helpful. We had room service breakfast which was tasty and they even provided soya milk! I would definately stay again! Shame there was no free parking though for the price for the room! Parking was £23",4,2010,11,29
122,Just terrible,"I cannot believe that this place has the nerve to call itself a 5 five star hotel. The restaurant is an absolute travesty. The food is literally disgusting. For example the 'spiced braised carrots' were literally floppy bits of old carrot out of a tin with some cumin sprinkled over it - yours for £4.50! The 'chunky handmade chips' can only have come straight from a very old freezer (£4.50 again), the wine was like vinegar, the bread was stale, the 'cucumber, cherry tomato and olive salad came did not have cucumber or cherry tomatoes in them. It was literally just chopped cherry tomatoes with red onion and nothing else. I could go on and on!

The decor is like something out of a channel tunnel ferry and the staff are hopelessly under trained and clearly low on moral, which is hardly surprising given the complaints they must have on an hourly basis. 

Just terrible.",1,2010,11,26
122,The best hotel I have ever been to!,"I was so taken aback by the two critical reviews I have just read about this hotel that I felt compelled to write my own review immediately! I do not claim to have the international experience of the cameraman, but I see many top hotels in connection with my work so I do have objective comparisons to draw from.

The Wyndham does not count the cost when it comes to standards or service, both of which are comparable to the finest of cruise liners. American hospitality businesses really do know how to 'do' service, but it is often fake or shallow: not so at the Wyndham where every reasonable effort to create satisfaction is made without fuss.

The standard of fittings, furniture, bedding, soft furnishings - all very high indeed. The breakfast was a sheer delight - we were provided with our very own fruit- preparer who was surprisingly skilled (I didn't realise it was possible to be so skilled in such an apparently mundane chore).

My wife and children cannot wait to return to this oasis of style and comfort. If it is any consolation to the management of the hotel, I have read the 'bed-bug' review to my wife who has specialised knowledge of skin complaints. She states that bed-bugs like to inhabit warm, preferably moist areas of the body. This is not consistent with an arm rash,
obviously! People should be sure of their facts before publishing  written complaints!",5,2010,11,14
122,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"We have just returned from a two day trip to London. The purpose of the visit was for our daughter to visit prospective universities but we decided if we stayed overnight we could do some sight seeing as well. We checked available hotels and found a special offer - late booking at the Wyndham Grand.

From the moment we approached the frontage of the hotel to the moment we left we felt we were in a different world, a much prefereble world. The location, Hotel building & facilities and food were truely ""out of this world"".

The aspect that struck all of our family though was the friendly, sincere and professional aproach of every member of the hotel staff that we encountered. All the staff went out of their way to help us, with a warm smile and obvious sincerity.

Every time we came into contact with any member of the hotel staff we were treated like V.I.P's. and made to feel special.

We were sorry that we could only stay for one night, due to work commitments, but will be looking for an excuse to stay at the Wyndham Grand again in the near future.

Highly recommended -NOT TO BE MISSED !!!",5,2010,10,29
122,Arm covered in bed bug bites. Management in denial mode.,"I'm a cameraman and director. I decided to stay at the Wyndham Grand with a colleague before a days filming with an early call time in London.
Hotel seemed nice enough, although they want £25 to park your car in a car park that costs £10 if you do it yourself. At their price, parking your car should be complimentary.
 
Horribly distracted during my filming the next day by an angry red rash on my arm. Never had one before. Showed my wife when I got home that evening , she said it was a classic case of bed bugs and asked what 'flea pit' I had stayed in. 
I tried to speak to the manager to tell him there may be a problem in the room. 
He was 'away' and it was impossible to have a conversation with anyone else about it , despite trying three different numbers I found online.
After about a week, long after I had given up, the manager finally got back to me. Basically made me feel like a liar, denying it could have been anything to do with his hotel and suggesting it was an allergy. 
I'm 41, and have never had an allergic reaction to anything, ever. I know my own body and diet well enough by now to know if I have allergies. 
I wish he hadn't called. Up to then I just thought the Wyndham was an overpriced flea pit I would avoid forever, now I know the management are in denial too, and both hard to contact and aggressive when finally reached. 
In the last 6 months I've filmed in South Africa, Madagascar, Alaska, Afghanistan, Texas, NY, Canada, Ohio, Italy , France and across the UK. I've stayed in every level of accomodation imaginable, from army tents by runways to 5 star chateaux in Provence. 
Because of the effect on my work, and the attitude of the management , I have to say The Wyndham was the worst , not just for it's price bracket, but period. 
Avoid, or bring your own pesticide.",2,2010,10,23
122,WONDERFUL HOTEL,"I cannot tell you how much we loved this hotel!  The room was unbelievable, very spacious and clean.  The bed and the pillows were so comfortable.  And most importantly it was quiet.  I did not hear a peep from any other room.  Free WiFi is available only in the lobby. The only very tiny issue would be that the closest UNDERground station was a 15-20 minute walk away so we took the OVERground, which was actually fine because it was only about a minute walk from the hotel and it takes you to most of the underground connections and is very clean and new.  But it runs infrequently compared to the underground and if you miss a train it could be upwards of 30 minutes before the next train.  Just make sure you are familiar with the schedule so you don't get stuck.  We will definitely be staying there if we ever go back to london.",5,2010,10,21
122,Very nice rooms in an OK location,"The rooms are very nice and spacious. Breakfast was also very good. I might not choose the location for sightseeing or nightlife, but since I needed to be in the Battersea area for business it was a perfect spot. And one can take an extensive morning walk or run along the Thames.",5,2010,10,18
122,Nice four star (billed as 5 star) hotel in inconvenient location.,"We got this on Priceline for $175.00. it was billed as a 5 star hotel. Clearly it was not up to a 5 star level. Walk into any 5 star and you will immediately know the difference. The concierge was not particularly helpful. The physical facilities were either unfinished or poorly laid out, for example the Spa was a hopeless maze. Bits of the hotel were off key like the strong solvent smell on our floor and baseboard that was separated from the wall.  That said, the room was a suite, the beds comfy with lots of pillows, the bathroom roomy and the water hot and plentiful. Like I said, it was a solid 4 star. 

Hard to get a taxi on two occasions, with a 15 or longer wait. There was no other option because it is over a mile to the nearest tube stop or a 1/3 mile to the overland train with trains every 20 minutes or so. You can walk to civilization but it is at least a mile before you get to anything decent and then it is even longer before you are in the middle of anything worth eating or buying. That is my chief objection with Priceline. It has twice on two occasions put me into an inconveniently located hotel. I suspect that is why they get the bargains on those properties. Internet access was hugely expensive at 24 pounds (about 33.00 PER DAY!.) A real downer if you have any intention of staying in contact. 

I bid $175.00 which was a good price for the property. The Taxi fees we paid to get in and out, however, ate into the savings quite a bit.",4,2010,10,12
122,Beautiful room-- Excellent stay,This was a gorgeous hotel.  I have been to London several times and this by far was the nicest hotel I have stayed at. The room was a suite and it was just awesome to see my cousin( a first time traveler out of the USA) marvel at the amentities in the room.  He thought the robes were just awesome. LOL!!  I have to say this is at the top of my list of places to stay the next time I am in London.,5,2010,10,08
122,Honeymoon disaster!!!!!,"We booked our stay here through hotwire--am seasoned traveler, however first time abroad hotwire customer.  Upon arrival we were asked to give 150 POUNDS PER NIGHT (7) DEPOSIT.   As our trip was paid for before we left and we had only brought small balance credit cards with us, this put a serious damper on our plans (including theatre tickets of which they charged 3 TIMES THE RATE) plus concierge fee.  DO NOT AT ANY TIME SPEAK WITH THE CONCIERGE--YOU WILL BE CHARGED.  Our room was not as we requested upon arrival.  The toilets would not flush (even after calling down 3 times to have someone look at it)  The beds are atrocious!!!  i just came back from a weekend in a 3 star marriott and it was night and day--bed was fabulous.  The beds at Chelsea are horrendous.    The area--well, we had to walk about 3/4 of a mile to a tube station.  THIS HOTEL IS WAY OUT OF THE WAY.  There is NOTHING TO DO OR SEE IN THIS AREA.   IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE SOPRANOS VERSION OF LONDON, TAKE A WALK OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL.  Oil tanks and stacks are the view along with cranes and construction.  The Harbor.Marina in the picture of the hotel--no wonder they took the picture at night--the marina is filled with cheap and old boats--and oil slick on the water and trash floating.    The overall sense of the hotel is COLD and modern.  Some of the people were nice, but that is what they are being paid for, right???  and the mantra of  ""it is not our fault--it is company policy"" grows weary.  

We were held hostage here for seven days, forced to use their facilities to eat and see our shows.  ALSO--food leaves much to be desired--breakfast consisted of two overcooked eggs, one piece of fatty ham, one sausage, a half of tomato, and a two inch disc they called homefries, toast, and a small pot of tea--total came to 16.99 pounds, plus 4.50 pound TRAY CHARGE, plus 3.50 SERVICE CHARGE, plus tax, total coming to 31.00 pounds or in american money $49.60.   THIS IS FOR ONE PERSON.

Just so you know, this is my 5th trip to London and my first experience (and my last) with Wndyham.  I travel extensively for work and have NEVER had a bad experience before this one in London, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Rome, Paris--and i stay at 5 star hotels---I HAVE NEVER BEEN CHARGED FOR CONCIERGE SERVICE.

The only GOOD thing i have to say about the hotel is the shower---absolutely fabulous.

SO, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE TO STAY--THIS IS NOT THE PLACE.  LOOK ON KENSINGTON HIGH STREET, NEAR THE PARKS-ST. JAMES ETC. 

Oh, by the way, I wrote to hotwire about this and they told me ""so sorry"".... Got no help from them.   Guess they don't need me as a customer anymore.",2,2010,10,06
122,Not worthy of a five star rating - very disappointing!,"We stayed at the Wyndham Grand for one night and were promised a relaxing and romantic night away by a very glamorous website. The suite we booked shown on the hotel's website was completely misleading and what we were actually given could only be described as a 'Best Western / Travelodge' style hotel room. 
We went to the bar for a pre dinner drink and on asking for olives we were told that the hotel did not have any and we were offered nuts instead. We had dinner in the hotel's restuarant which was far from the five star meal we had expected. On asking for a side order of potatoes we were told we could only have mash as there was no other alternative. To finish the evening off we returned to the room were we found that the complimentary cheese and wine offered to us by the hotel on check in had not been delivered to the room as promised.
The following morning (Sunday) after an awful nights sleep on a matress that was somewhat past it's sell by date we were woken by housekeeping entering the room at 08:45am despite the 'Do not disturb' sign being placed on the door the previous night. After the rude awakening we went down for breakfast only to be told that the hotel could not supply us breakfast 'due to circumstances beyond their control'. At that point we returned to the room and promptly checked out vowing never to return. Poor, Poor, Poor",1,2010,09,26
122,"Fantastic hotel, staff very friendly - worth a visit","We have just come back after stopping 3 days at this hotel, we got a good deal via travelzoo and wouldn't normally stop in a 5 star hotel.  Room/suite was fantastic it had 2 balconies, well equipmed bathroom with the best rainfall shower ever, another seperate loo and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  Couldn't fault staff or service who were very friendly and accomodating. Didn't eat in the hotel as we like to eat out and about and to be honest couldn't justify paying £45 for sunday brunch!   My only small gripe about the hotel was that it had a turn down service on an evening which is lovely but they always set up the sofa bed in the lounge area even though there were only 2 of us staying in the room and there was no need for it.  Location isnt the best if your travelling around by tube, taxis from the hotel to various places  in the centre of London cost us approx £20-30 each time including tip.",5,2010,09,22
122,A rare treat for the family,"Booked last minute, as ever, and got a good deal on the room (I say room, actual a suite). Bedroom, lounge, bathroom, lobby and WC. The dearly beloved very impressed. All the staff were very pleasant, and helpful. Food was totally yummy. Downside spa being rebuilt, so no pool, which was a shame (reopens soon). Not near to the underground so taxi was favourite (not expensive about £10-15 each way). Train station close by but does not connect easily to places of interest. We did walk to Buckingham Palace but a bit of a way. Really super hotel",5,2010,09,06
122,Fantastic Hotel - Secretly found,"My partner booked last minute on laterooms.co.uk under secret rooms so we did not know where we were going until we confirmed our booking...All i can say is WOW, it was lovley. Staff very friendly, lovely atmosphere and the rooms were lovely too.

I would definitley go back.",5,2010,08,31
122,WISH WE COULD HAVE STAYED LONGER,"My wife and two children decided to take me away for a weekend's sightseeing for my birthday. Lots of things to pack into two days in London including a show (Wicked) plus all the other attractions the children wanted to visit. As two days isn't long enough to ""do"" London we wanted to use the time to its utmost and this meant not checking in at the Wyndham Grand until 1130 pm. This wasn't a problem and the family room (a master bedroom with en suite and the living area converted for the children) was splendid. Sunday morning's breakfast was more than just ""continental"" buffet style with a wide variety of fresh fruit prepared and brought to our table along with cereal, pastries, croissants, tea, coffee, juice etc, along with the choice of Cooked ""full English"" if referred. As our time in the capital was short we booked out shortly after our morning meal but both my wife and I would have loved to have stayed and benefited from the warm, friendly luxury of the hotel. On leaving the concierge arranged for the hotels car and driver, Richard, to drop us near the the Palace to see the changing of the guard and I must say its the little touches like this that made staying at the Wyndham Grand so special. Top marks to all at the Wyndham Grand.",5,2010,08,24
122,5 Star at it's Best!,Wow! I've stayed in several 5 star hotels recently but this hotel is superb! The service is second to none with food to die for! After a long week at the office it was so nice to return there at 5pm and treated like a real VIP! Will defiantly return on a leisure basis!,5,2010,08,20
122,"Wonderful, food, service and the rooms.","I only stayed here for a night with my family- 3children over 13 and my husband, but i found the hotel a wonderful experince, i have stayed in many 5 star claiming to be luxurious hotels in my life but this one topped them all by far, we arrived early before our check in time not expecting to get checked in, but the service was great, the people were helpful and we were unpacked in our rooms within 15 minutes. When we arrived back we all had a small complimentary plate of chocolates and raspberries laid out, and some apple juice for the children. The beds were amazing to sleep on, i had one of the best night sleep i had experienced in a long time,  and the breakfast was equally as good, we had it delivered to our room and collected when we wanted, the food was amazing and so was the service, overall a fabulous weekend.",5,2010,08,20
122,"Fab, Friendly Service","Stayed at this hotel for a weekend break. Arrived at 10.30am not expecting to check in but checked in with a free upgrade. Room was better than expected and we enjoyed drinks on the balcony overlooking the harbour. Nice touches at the hotel included newspaper being left without requested, free use of umbrella amd essential emergency items included. Breakfast was busy but service still excellent. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful with advice on transport and places to go. Location isnt for everyone but we walked to Kings Rd in 3 minutes with regular bus services to central London and within walking distance of Stamford Bridge if going to the football. Luxury hotel would definately stay again.",5,2010,08,16
122,Not worth the money or the stars.,"We were so excited when we booked this hotel on priceline. It quickly became a disappointment and were upset that we had already paid. We started out our check-in with a few people around and were quite surprised at how long it took us to check in. Once we received the key to our room - it was fantastic! It was on the third floor and had a beautiful espresso machine. However, we had requested a non-smoking room due to my husband's asthma. We could not stand the smell in the room and called down to inform them that this room would not meet our needs. They said that they would call back up to the room when they changed our booking. 
We waited 15 minutes without a phone call and went down directly to the reception where we waited even longer. After we approached the desk and the lady barely said two words to us when we changed our room. She handed us our key and we went up to find a totally different room. It was without coffee maker, kettle, balcony or fridge. Also, it was right next to the elevator and I could not believe how loud it was. The doors slam when they are closed and the maids who were in the room next to ours cleaning were extremely boisterous and kept leaving their room. On top of that were the large families, with their slamming doors and talking in the hallway.  I have never been in a less sound proof room. 
It was a fair walk to the the metro and taxi was easy to obtain from the hotel which was a nice perk. 
We decided to go for breakfast in the hotel and was that a mistake! We went into the lounge and the bartender told us to take a seat. We walked over to the breakfast buffet side and sat. We waited for the waitress who told us that we would need to move back to the bar section and that we would have to pay a la carte prices. We assumed we would be paying a la carte prices... however not 12 pounds for 2 eggs and toast. As we left and had no service while looking over the menu for drinks, we heard the hostess talking to another server who said, ""They are leaving."" And the response from the hostess was, ""That's fine."" Wow - this is a five star hotel! I have been to many five stars in many cities and have never been treated so poorly. This was by far the worst service.",3,2010,08,02
122,We will stay here again for sure.,"My wife and I stayed here with our teenage daughter and her friend for a week.  All the rooms are suites, meaning they all have a seperate living room with every bedroom.  We were able to get two adjoining rooms with one a king and the other a double, which was perfect.  The hotel staff was excellent.  The location in our opinion is one of the best in London, as we were not downtown in all the noise.  Chelsea is one of the finer areas to stay for sure.  There is a brand new tube (train) station just outside the door.  The hotel had a driver that would carry us to our destination at no charge in a very nice BMW when he was not in route with someone else.  What a perk?  He delivered us to the Palace in style.  The rooms are very large with an awsome bathroom, seperate showers with tons of water pressure.  Wifi in main lobby and use of hotel computer in lobby was great.  Having stayed downtown before, we would never do it again.  We will be staying at the Chelsea Harbour on our next visit.",5,2010,08,01
122,definitely worthy,"had to pop into london for a  business trip last thursday 29 july,so i went into this hotel with my missus.check in was extremely fast comparing with other hotels i have been, and in less than 5 minutes i was already in my room.room itself was lovely,very clean and bright, with a huge bed,really comfortable.the suite is divided into 2,having the living room big plasma tv,comfortable sofa and armchair and charming decoration.after a bath and shower,as you have both in the bathroom,
we went down to eat something.the service at the restaurant was absolutely exceptional,we felt welcomed since we stepped into the restaurant.the staff was keeping an eye on us for every detail and we receive our food quickly.the food itself was very tasting,well presented and on time,so you can not expect much.everything was absolutely delcious,me and my missus enjoyed every bit of our food.honestly,we felt treated as vip every minute were at the restaurant and we enjoyed so much.
then we went to sleep,were i did not heard any noise till next day when i wake up,so quiet and long and quality sleep we had.we ordered breakfast in room service,and everything arrived soon,hot and delcious as the dinner,definitely a place just to came back to enjoy their food.then we checked out,and was again very fast and enjoyable.
a hotel definitely to come back or recomend",5,2010,08,01
122,Disappointing. Satisfaction will depend on what you pay,"Had I paid the website rate (£317 incl tax, no breakfast) I think I would have wept. As it was, I had booked through lastminute's secret hotels for £174 - which is still too high IMO but bearable.

Check in was slow - I had to sit and wait while they processed my booking, as did several others - and when I did eventually reach my room, it was a smoking room, complete with ashtray. I immediately went down to Reception to request a non smoking room, but none were 'clean' or available. At 3pm. I was too exhausted by this stage, so resigned myself to a sinus headache and returned. (Ventilation worked but I would not book a hotel again which could not guarantee a non smoking request).

Rooms themselves are fine (though if mine was a refurbed example, I hope they kept the receipt, the design and style is dated and the upholstery needs a good deep clean) - with a small hallway, sitting area with sofa, armchair and desk, tea and coffee making facilities, minibar with fresh milk carton, kettle and a desk/work area.

There are large flatscreen TVs in both the sitting area and the bedroom. There is a good sized bathroom with toilet and bidet in its own compartment, 2 sinks, bath and walk in shower - which was very good.

Initially I was worried about noise - I have never seen so many people either sitting in the corridor (my room was near the lift) or with doors open holding loud conversations with extended families (?) and/or friends. Inside my room and with the bedroom or sitting room doors and TV on it was quiet however.

Aircon in the sitting room was anaemic, fortunately with the window open and with a cool breeze was not a problem.The bedroom window would not open at all but the aircon worked better and would be necessary during a hot spell. Esp as you are under the final approach path to Heathrow and can hear planes loudly every minute or so. (This did not bother me unduly but it is not what I would want for this rate of hotel for a treat or special occasion stay).

Room service food was relatively reasonably priced and there is a 24 hr Lebanese menu which I imagine would be good as it caters to a large Middle Eastern clientele (who presumably don't mind or don't use the hilarious room service charge of £115 for a 700ml bottle of gin; £144 for Grey Goose mind).

The mattress was uneven, one side was noticeably more worn than the other but the pillows and linens were good.

Location wise this is an oddity. Chelsea Harbour is an attempt to redevelop a brownfield site with in my view, mixed results. The hotel is surrounded by upmarket apartments but the landscaping leaves a lot to be desired and it is frustrating for public transport. Imperial Wharf (overground) gets you to West Brompton. The C3 bus is better for Knightsbridge (change of bus) or Earls Court but it is a taxi (or chauffeur) ride to anywhere resembling shops and restaurants - there is a pub on Lots Rd within walking distance and that's about it. 

In short there are better places for the money. If the service were superb, or the rooms fabulous I could forgive the location but since these were mediocre at best and the location is difficult especially for a tourist, I could not recommend it and would not stay again. I shall be sticking with some tried and trusteds but do not altogeher regret the experience. The lower rate above was quoted to someone enquiring at reception so maybe the direct approach would be best. And budget for taxis if you are going to stay here and want to go out. Anywhere. It is very cut off from the 'action'.",3,2010,07,19
122,Beautiful Hotel but a few things you should know...,"Stayed for 3 nights in June with my husband.  This is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful area.  The hotel sits along the Thames and a walking path along the riverfront leads to two very cute parks and a couple of restaurants.  The staff at the hotel was friendly, the food and room service were good.  (Better food down the street at Lots Road Pub)  The rooms are very large especially compared to London standards.  

So here are the things you should know...
1. Although the location is beautiful it is quite far from the city center.  The closest tube station is a £9 taxi ride.
2. In room WiFi is £25 per day...ridiculous for a 5 star hotel.
3. In room air conditioning is insufficient.  Lobby air conditioning was fine.  It was 18°- 20°C during our stay.  I can't imagine how hot the room would be if it was any warmer outside.  At night it was cooler outside than in our room but the windows barely opened so we could not get any relief. 
4. No gym, although they are constructing one, which leads to number 5.
5.  Warning, if you are jet lagged or enjoy sleeping in on vacations...they are currently renovating and there is loud construction noise starting at 8am.

I am choosing ""recommend to a friend"", but that is only if they don't mind the things I mentioned above.",4,2010,07,03
122,Fabulous.  Spectacular.  Luxurious.,"First class service.  All hotel personnel were extremely attentive to the needs of their guests.  All personnel exude their commitment to their customer.  The rooms were extremely large in comparison to european standards.  The rooms had separate living rooms, extremely large bathrooms and bedrooms.  Very luxurious and clean.  The location is not in the heart of the city BUT the metro was accessible within a 2 minute walk from the hotel.  Very convenient.",5,2010,07,02
122,"Great hotel, imperfect location",Wonderful experience.  Everyone was as helpful and friendly as you would hope for in a first class hotel.  Beautiful hotel facing a harbor on the Thames.  The ONLY downside is the somewhat inconvenient location; it is a bit of a walk to the closest underground station.,5,2010,06,27
122,"Real luxury, but no kettle...","This is a really luxurious hotel.  The suites are big and luxuriously furnished, with lots of little extras that really make a difference.  We had a balcony too.  Could have spent days inside!

The check in, and most importantly check out, was super-efficient and friendly.

I got an excellent deal on Last minute.com - it worked out cheaper than a regular 4 star closer into the centre.  (It was a 'secret rooms' offer as they had building work going on, which did not affect me)

My only gripe: no kettle, just a coffee machine!  And as any Brit knows, you need BOILING water to make a decent cup of tea.  When I asked about this the guy who brought up our room service said I should heat the water in the coffee pot... Oh dear!!!",5,2010,06,26
122,"Location, Luxury, Location","I know it is supposed to be ""Location, Location, Location"" but this hotel has got Luxury, right in the middle of one of the best locations in London.
I travel extensively for business and this is one of my favorite hotels. The rooms are absolute luxury, I never want to leave. 
If you book early enough in advance, the price can be just right too. I plan to go to London with my Wife in the fall and this will be the first hotel I check rates at.",5,2010,06,22
122,City Break,"We stayed here in May for 2 Nights.  There were 3 of us, so we got a twin suite with the sofa bed made up for the 3rd person.  Luckily we did not use the room very much because the bed in the lounge area was left up during the day and I did find this a little annoying because it meant we completely lost the use of this room during the day.  The service in the hotel was excellent.  Location was good but I would prefer to stay a little closer Chelsea itself if visiting again.  The bases on the single beds in our room were solid wooden with hard square edges.  I whacked my leg off the corner of one while walking past and almost a month later still have a big bruise.  These in my opinion are dangerous.  This is the second time this has happened to me with these type of bases in hotel rooms.  Mattresses have rounded corners that do not cover these edges which are dark brown and not easy to see.  Our stay was brief at just two nights.  We did not eat in the hotel. Wifi was only available free of charge if using it in the lobby.  It is £25 per day in your room. I found this incredible for a 5 star property.  I expect it free in my room.
I don't know if I would stay here again, its location while loving overlooking the Marina was a little bit out of the way for us.",4,2010,06,15
122,An amazing 5* London hotel with stunning views of the river,"Had an amazing stay at the Wyndham Grand with my partner as a birthday treat. The suite was truly luxurious with great decor and stunning views down the river towards the London eye and across the marina. The staff could not do enough for us and made us feel very special. We had amazing cocktails in the bar and great food in the restaurant before going back to the room. This was real 5 star luxury with everything we could want for in the suite, all within easy reach and in perfect condition. Room service in the morning was first class and again the staff were fantastic. If you want to get away for the night and enjoy real luxury then this is the place to stay! Will definitley be coming back!",5,2010,06,15
122,Truly spectacular!,"Had the most fantastic night here last Saturday.  The staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful from the moment we walked through the door to the second we left.  We had a magnificent & spacious room overlooking Chelsea Harbour, exceptionally clean and beautifully modern décor.  We were lucky enough to have a suite and I can't recommend it highly enough, the extra space make you feel as if you are in your own little river front apartment!
The parking is expensive at £35 per stay, quite a bit more than I would have expected, but as that part of town has very little non-permit parking it is probably safer to use the hotel facilities to save risking a parking ticket!
This was my husband and my first stay here but we will be returning. It was beyond exceptional, I cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2010,06,14
122,"Spacious clean room, dated reception area",The staff were very helpful with any travel queries but I had my room robbed and all my cash was stolen while I was out having dinner.  I have reported this to the duty manager who assured me he would look into this.  It is now 36 hours later and I have received no correspondence.  This is absolutely shocking and dissapointing for an incidence such as this to happen in this calibre of establishment!,3,2010,06,14
122,"Very friendly, helpful staff - Exceptionally clean and comfortable room","We stayed at the hotel on the occasion of our wedding and I cannot fault the hospitality of the staff or the cleanliness and comfort of our room.  Neither the wedding or reception took place at the hotel but the kindness and attention to detail that the hotel offered us during our stay added to the success of our special day.  

Way beyond the call of duty was the incident when one of our guests called us to say that he had left his railcard in our room.  When asking at reception the quickest route to the train station, a member of staff kindly offered to 'run' the railcard round to the station and reunited railcard with guest and avoid a lot of inconvenience and extra expense for him.

There are plenty of options to reach the hotel  the underground at Fulham Broadway the overground train at Imperal Wharf and taxi - we used them all!

I would also like to mention the florist at Chelsea Harbour (just at the end of the drive).  Again excellent service, even offering to deliver the flowers to the hotel reception for us.

We booked what we hoped would be a special hotel for our special occasion and we were not let down in any way.  I would like to think we will be able to return again to celebrate our anniversary!",5,2010,06,06
122,"Very nice, would stay again but not quite 5 star","Don't get me wrong, this hotel is very nice and the rooms are amazing for thier price (I paid £149 as i stayed over 3 nights) as they are really big and everything is very good quality.

The staff are cool but more 3 or 4 star in thier attitude, also there are some annoying small things.
WiFi is £25 in your room - a lot when it is meant to be 5 star
No Gym - OK but at least have a shuttle to the local gym and provide passes, Paying £10 for a gym 5 minutes away in a taxi - as i was advised, is not really that good
Location - pretty far from the Tube routes - best bet is earls court and then it is £6 in a taxi",4,2010,05,27
122,Room 716 incredible view,"Loved this hotel...5 star...great location....nice staff...incredible view of the River....views of St. Paul's, Big Ben, London Eye, P.O. Tower...two bridges....close to the OVERground and a ferry....border of a dodgy part of London so stay close to hotel....but quiet in the midst of the chaos of London - paid for the upgrade for a 'room with a view' well worth it...make sure you request the no smoking floor....I will be back.",5,2010,05,23
122,"a wonderful 5 star hotel, on the water, incredible service and reasonable. what a find!","I travel to London often on business. This time, I put in a search for ""chelsea"" and the Wyndham Grand Chelsea Harbour came up. I had no idea this section of London existed, a tiny pocket of posh waterfront flats and this one large hotel that felt like part of the harbour community. It's an all suite hotel, and I had two bathrooms and lots of room to hang out. The hotel offers one hour of international calling for 5.5 pounds, a big savings form my overworked blackberry costs from Verizon. Internet (wireless) was free in the public areas and a bit expenseive in the room (24 pounds a day).
Hotel recently renovated, I understand. (Used to be the old Conrad). the spa is still undergoing renovation.
The rates are amazingly low, given the quality of the accomodations and the service.
I mentioned the service, but want to highlight a few things - the staff is incredibly caring, patient and thoughful. I was a woman traveling alone, and felt pampered by their attention. One front desk employee, Rui, from Portugal originally, waled me to my room and made sure everything was perfect before returning to the desk.
He is reason alone to stay there.
It's quiet and very charming at Chelsea Harbour. It's also a hike form everything else, but one of my favorite London curry restaurants, Chutney Mary.
This trip, I never got there and instead found a great local restauarnt Lots Road (they called it a pub, but it felt more like a mediterraean trattoria) Amazing food. the black cod was as good as the best I've had in NY. The panzanella salad (tomatoes, onions and day old bread) was as good as I had in Tuscany.
Their burger was terrific, with handmade fries (chips).
and it's 50 yards from the hotel and much more affordable than the diningroom. They also have wifi.
If you take taxis, it's cost you more and it's charming to walk around here, but a long walk to get to central downtown Oxford Street. It abuts Kensington, but can't figure out how.
I understand it's a bit far form the underground too.
But I will stay here next time and the times after that.
An affordable 5 star hotel, available on Priceline (with luck), quiet and on the water...
couldn't ask for more.

122,"Stayed During Renovations, Sure it's Nicer Now","As a gamble, I booked this hotel though one of those discount hotel sites where you book a hotel blindly and only after you pay do you find out which hotel you'll be staying in. I had never done such a thing before and I never will be doing it again. 
When we arrived at The Wyndham, they were in the middle of an extensive renovation. We had to move to a smoking room to try to escape the noise. The main restaurant was closed and the walkway was as well. If we would have booked through a more traditional manner, we would have known about this ahead of time. 
I'm sure the renovations are complete or nearly so now and the hotel is in a much better shape to receive guests.",3,2010,05,17
122,GREAT STAY BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"We stayed at the wyndam for one night with my two children who are 8 and 2 years old, the kids loved the pool however this is very deep im 5ft 1"" and couldnt touch the bottom of the pool, The rooms are great size and the staff freindly and helpful. we didnt have breakfast in the hotel as we walked down the Kings Road to get breakfast in a great little caffe.",4,2010,05,15
122,LUXURY WITH VIEWS,"All rooms are suites at this hotel, there are huge with luxury beds, big bathrooms, separate lounge area etc etc.  My friend and I went shopping for the day and stayed here as a treat, we sat on the balcony in the evening looking at the marina drinking.  Footballers go here, so as i say ""if its good enough for them, its good enough for me!!!""  We used room service in the evening and the meal was lovely and of a good size.  I would definately recommend this hotel, its very close to Kings Road aswell.",5,2010,04,29
122,Peace and Quiet at the Wyndham,"A whirlwind (4 days) trip to London from Australia to attend a wedding required a hotel in the Kensignton/Chelsea/Fulham area that would enable my husband to work and both of us to get plenty of rest.  

We arrived at the hotel at 8.30am and were immediately shown to our room -- great views of Chelsea Harbour and definitely the most spacious of any London hotel we've previously stayed at (bathrooms are large for London, with a separate bath and shower).  The hotel is finalising renovations on it's leisure/spa area -- not a problem for us, and will look great when finished in a couple of months time.  Service at both the front desk and in room was prompt and excellent -- we ordered a room service breakfast and supper while there and both were delivered promptly and very good.  

Best of all was the quiet location overlooking the harbour -- no traffic noise meant a great sleep, and the hotel was a brisk walk to shopping on the Kings Road (or a short bus trip) and all of Chelsea's amenities.

The hotel suited us perfectly -- we previously lived in London for 4 years and were not there to take in the sites, and the location was great to catch up with old friends.  I'd definitely stay here when we're next in London.",5,2010,04,16
122,Pure luxury,"Excellent hotel, luxurious suites had everything you can think of in your suite.  Great views of the Chelsea Harbour.  Staff were very attentive and food was very good.",5,2010,04,04
122,"Fantastic hotel, can't fault","When we arrived at 10am we were immediately made to feel welcome and given an early check in with no hassle.  We were shown to our suite and asked what our plans were for the rest of the day.  To our delight we were told that there was a shuttle that could drop us at our planned destination that was available in 10 minutes which made it so much easier to get 2 children across London.
The room was lovely, everything we needed and we had a comfortable and quiet nights sleep.
Cannot fault the staff at breakfast, they coped admirably catering for our 2 toddlers as well as us.
All in all a brilliant stay and a hotel that we will stay at in future.",5,2010,03,30
122,"Excellent stay, great value","Excellent hotel and top rate service. Paid a reduced rate due to renovations which were invisible to us. Very comfy bed and slept well as it was very quite and we were next to the lifts! Yes, it is not in central London but you know that if you read trip advisor. A 10 minute journey on the C3 to Earls Court then the tube can take you anywhere, was a very simple way to travel. No there are no restaurants on your doorstep but Kings Road has a selection of pubs. Breakfast was lovely, and we had it on room service too, bar a tad pricey. So I would highly recommend even with young children.",5,2010,03,19
122,"Luxurious, fabulous night","We stayed at the Wyndham Grand as some good friends had a 40th birthday party on the Thames nearby. On arrival our room was ready and for £190 we were given a beautiful suite - the view was nothing to write home about (wrong side from Chelsea Harbour) - but the amenities in the room were fabulous. The bathroom was superbly appointed, the bedroom and lounge were immaculate.
After the party at 2am we had an urge for bacon sandwiches and tea - they arrived promptly, very well presented and hit the spot perfectly.
Breakfast the next day was first class - you couldn't ask for better presented or cooked food - and the appearance of John Terry and his wife was an unexpected bonus!
Drinks at the bar were inevitably expensive but worth it - all told a great find. In the summer I would go for a harbour view room.
The staff were excellent in every respect - from the valet parking to the waitresses - many thanks for a lovely stay!",5,2010,03,02
122,Perfect,"I wanted a balcony wiewing the river Thames, It was perfect. The suite was warm and welcoming, and I sat on the balcony every night, and it`t great for sole travelers. he only thing I missed Was a grocery store nearby and a complimentart bus to the west end and back,. the staff was exellent, and I got a cheap rate £ 190, I wanted to stay longer than 4 nights, but then the rates got more expensive. Please bring your rates down for easteR 2010, an I will come back............",5,2010,02,22
122,Do not book on an offer you are given a sub standard room,"I booked my family two night stay through Travelzoo, this was a good offer for £138 per night for a suite. On arrival at the hotel we were very happy with our suite but at night the problem occurred. At midnight the hotels air conditioning chillers were turned on and the main pipe for tis went through our bedroom, the noise was impossible to sleep through. We complained the next day and they offered to move us, fine. 

On arriving in the new room we found we had been given a smoking room. The smoking room was disgusting, dirty furniture and burn and stain marks on tables and stank. An odd choice as we had requested non smoking and had a child in tow so at 11.30pm at night we are then moved again to another room and have to await a roll away bed. All very late with tired child. 

The hotel although very apologetic could not offer any further refund on the price we paid as we were on an offer they explained. So I would say if you are thinking of booking through an offer beware it maybe for a substandard room! 

It was room 403 so ask not to be given this one!",2,2010,02,22
122,Would stay here again,"Unfortunately only stayed for one night, would have liked to stay longer.    Everything was super, staff and service were excellent.    Booked through TravelZoo and got a fantastic rate with discount on breakfast.    The health suite was under refurbishment so this was closed unfortunately when we stayed.    Bit of a walk into Chelsea but only a 10 minute walk to nearest Tube station so that was fine.    We didnt feel that the area was dangerous as identified in another review, we walked from tube station at about 8pm with our 7yr old and felt it was fine.    Would stay here again.",5,2010,02,16
122,Simply outstanding in every way!,"I spent many hours searching for the right hotel for our four night break in London, and found Trip Advisor very useful, infact that's where I first found the Wyndham Grand. I booked direct with the Hotel group, and found the telephone operators  to be extremely helpful and friendly. We booked a suite overlooking the Harbour, the rate was around £200 per night, not including breakfast and parking. 
We found the hotel quite easily, upon arrival a very helpful Concierge immediately came over to help, he took the luggage out of the boot and loaded  it on to a trolley, whilest another Gentleman took the car keys and vallet parked for us. Checking in was simple, we were then shown to our room, which turned out to be the wrong one. This was immediately sorted out by the lovely Concierge and Receptionist, and within ten minutes we were in the correct suite..first impressions..WOW! There was a large lounge area, with very comfortable sofas and arm chairs, a desk & chair with telephone, large flat screened TV, glossy magazines and books on the coffee table, just lovely. The bedroom was equally beautiful, with another TV, huge wardrobes, loads of drawers, and the bed is the most comfortable we have ever slept in, I would love to have some of their pillows!
We have never seen such a large and luxurious bathroom in any other hotel anywhere,  there are twin wash basins, loads of mirrors, there's even a separate toilet and  bidet, complete with telephone! 
The bathroom was constantly restocked with high quality products and gorgeous soft fluffy white towels,  twice a day if needed. There was also another toilet off the lounge area, which was very useful.
On arrival we payed in advance for all of our cooked breakfasts, the receptionist advised us that it would be cheaper to do it that way, which she didn't need to do, we were very impressed with her helpfulness.
 As there were extensive refurbishments  going on at that time,  breakfast was served in the Penthouse, which afforded wonderful views over London. The food was really outstanding, perfectly cooked and extremely well presented. Our Waiters were always so polite, helpful and friendly too.
 We were told about the building work at the time of booking, but as we intended to be out for most of the day time, we weren't worried about the noise, actually it didn't bother us even when we were in the room when they were working, you get used to it really quickly, and could only really hear anything if the patio doors were open, so it was no probem at all. There is a small amount of aircraft noise, which is to be expected in London, but that was no problem either.
The Housekeeping staff were also brilliant, nothing too much trouble for them, always polite and friendly. Everything was spotless, we requested the complementary turn down service, which meant that when we came in during the evening, our beds were turned down, the lamps and heating all on, and fresh slippers were placed at the side of the beds on white mats..pure luxury! 
The ever smiling Concierge were always there to hail a taxi for us, or to help us out on our return, with an umbrella if needed! They were also very helpful with local knowledge, such a  good places to eat. 
The location of the Hotel was just fine for us, as we used Taxis to get around (I have mobility problems) I can't see that it would be difficult to get to anywhere from the Wyndham, as there are bus stops  right outside and the new Imperial Wharf  rail link at the back.
 Standing on the lovely balcony it felt more like the South of France than London, so quiet and relaxing.  There are  some lovely walks around the Harbour, and along the Thames enbankment to Imperial Wharf, I would say this is the best of both worlds really, and we would highly recommend it to anyone! In the space of a day we saw a famous football player in the Reception area, and came face to face with Robbie Williams!   
The Kings Road is great for more low key shopping than the chaos of Oxford Street, and is really close by.
This is a very high class Hotel, but unlike some of the others in London the staff would never make anyone feel uncomfortable, we noticed that everyone is treated with the same respect and high standards of customer service regardless of if they have small children with them, are there on business, or for what ever other reason for their stay.
We realise that the room rates were reduced at that time to take in to consideration the building work,  which made it very good value for money.
We were having such a fantastic time that we decided to stay for another two nights,  we really didn't want to go home!
 The next time we're in London we will certainly be booking in to the Wyndham Grand, we can't wait to go again!",5,2010,02,13
122,Very poor,"This is not a 5 star hotel. It is also not in a 5 star area which is decidedly seedy. It's a long long walk to anywhere at all.  We'd guess a good hour to walk to chelsea, if you dared to do it as it doesn't feel that safe. We had to wait 30minutes for a taxi as there were none outside the hotel and then pay over £20 to get in to London. This is on top of paying £40 to park our car in a car park next door.  If you start adding up the costs of staying there (let alone their astounding food and drink prices) then you'd be better staying in a more expensive hotel - it would work out cheaper.

The staff are disinterested and unhelpful, food extremely average as well as expensive and heating didn't work properly. We ordered room service which never came and when we complained the guy on the end of the phone he hadn't a clue what we were talking about and could hardly speak English, so we went out instead (another taxi ride). We experienced bar staff and reception staff who seem more interested in talking between themselves than serving customers and when eventually served it was as if we were interupting them. There was a lot of noise both inside and outside the hotel and basically the whole place is a bit rubbish. 

We have stayed in the Ritz, Dorchester, Lanesborough, Savoy and Claridges in the past which are all true 5 star hotels in a good location. Unfortunately we thought we would try the Wyndham, but changing its name doesn't seemed to have changed its character - it's not a 5 star hotel - it's an expensive 3 star in a 1 star area. We'll never go again and would not recommend.",1,2010,02,05
122,Avoid,"This is truly an awful hotel - it looks ok on the photos but it truly should be avoided.  A member of our staff arrived to find the room not ready (he needed to sleep after a long journey) in early afternoon.  The room was unbearably hot even with the heating off.  There was drilling with a hammer drill and banging coming from the room above all afternoon and early evening which prevented him from sleeping.  He was woken up by 2 unwanted telephone calls, one in the middle of the afternoon and another at 5 am in the morning at which point he checked out and in to another hotel.  

The hotel refused any liability and the staff were surly. It's not a 5 star hotel that's for certain.

The hotel is located in what we would consider a dangerous area to walk around at night and a mile from Chelsea, probably 2 or 3 miles from Central London, so if you want to be in London this hotel is not for you. There is nothing local to the hotel and you need a car or expensive taxi rides as you couldn't and wouldn't want to walk from the hotel.  

All in all a very poor experience, no apology from the hotel management, zero compensation and a large bill for 3 hours sauna temperature disturbed sleep.  

Our advice would be to avoid and stay more centrally in a true luxury hotel as there is little or nothing to recommend this one.",1,2010,02,03
122,A Grand Hotel,"Wyndham staff were very polite and accomodating,when we arrived and left.Good location.
Our suite was with balcony over looking the small harbour at Chelsea-first impressions very clean and tidy ,(however I assume the rooms are due a re furb as the sofa bed was rather jaded and the mattress pretty thin and not level,although our child who was accompanying us was able to sleep ok (only 5 Years old!).
The bathrooms are very large but again a little tired looking.
Bar well stocked and pretty much eveything you could ask for -housekeeping happy to oblige with any request.Tea and coffee facilities were a little sparse and I think for a 5* hotel there should be free biscuits and Milk.
We had a room service meal,very polite and helpful ,however apart from the childs portion which was a good size and quality,I think the other food we had was lacking the quality factor.
Disappointingly we were told when we arrived the pool,gym facilities weren't available although one could go ten minutes up the road to a gym at £10 per person!",4,2010,01,28
122,"Exellent Hotel, Friendly staff and good location (Great for Chelsea Matches)","I stayed in this hotel last October for the Chelsea V Man Utd game at stamford bridge, I went with my Grandad. We go to a lot of Chelsea games and we nearly always stay in this hotel.(That says a lot). During this time the hotel was undergoing refurbishment but this was not a problem as a very nice doorman kindly showed us where to enter. From the moment we checked in the staff were exellent and a nice man showed us to our room.

Our room turned out to be the wrong room as it was a double bed not two twin beds but the man who brought our bags to the room was very nice and called reception immediately and we changed room. Our suite turned out to be great as it overlooked the harbour. We then had dinner in the top floor restraunt as the usual one was being refurbished. It was exellent service. Also it had great views over London and this night was Guy Fawkes night and there were loads of fireworks. Afterwards we went to bed.
The pillows are very comfortable.

The next day we went up to have breakfast.It was exellent(I was sitting beside Petr Cech and John Terry) We then checked out and the hotel stored our bags for us free of charge while we went to the game. The ground is only a 5 - 10 minute walk from the hotel.

Overall this was an exellent Stay and I would reccomend it to anyone.",5,2010,01,27
122,Fabulous suites and sumptious breakfasts - wonderful,I stay at the Wyndham several times a year and absolutely love it.  As a regular traveller you also get a complementary bottle of wine and snacks.  I love the fact it is an all suite hotel and not a tiny bedroom like you get in some London hotels.  Also it is located in a great area for interiors shopping with the Design Centre next door and Lots Road on your doorstep.  The nearby Lots Road pub and Rams Head pub are great for dinner.,5,2010,01,25
122,When Construction is done will be great!,"We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend to take part in the wonderful London theatre.  The rooms were lovely, clean, and very comfortable.  The location is a little out, but easy enough to get into town via bus or overground near by (5-10 min. walk).  The area is quite industrial and nothing to do in the immediate area, but there is one pub across the street (we found the food here to be quite good).
     The service at the hotel left a little to be desired, and couldn't be bothered to help us more than 1-2 min. at a time.  However, most people in town were quite nice and helpful. 
There was quite a bit of construction going on to build what appeared to be a new lobby.  Maybe when this is done, the service with improve.  
    Overall the hotel was quite nice and we enjoyed our stay there.",4,2010,01,08
122,when in London,"decent hotel - clean, large, quiet, dining room, usual stuff etc. 

Rooms are large, have dining rooms and lounges within them, great room service, good food, quick, all hours. 

Location of hotel is a bit ""Beiruit"" - not much going on at Chelsea Harbour aside from restaurants and hotels. soulless area, close to Kings Rd, but 20min in taxi to Covent Garden area.

Ok but nothing special.

Only recommend the hotel for a purpose - ie need to be in the area, stay here its clean and safe. any other reason, nope !!",3,2010,01,05
122,Super comfortable stay,"Just back from a three nights stay at the Wyndham with my 10 yrs old son. The reason I chose the hotel was, at the beginning, quite prosaic - we had tickets for the Chelsea match and I was looking for a hotel situated at walking distance from the stadium. I must say I do not like football but love a good, elegant  high quality hotel. Then, I fell in love with the idea of being in the centre but still quite away from the incredible crowds which populate the West End all over the year and especially before Christmas.
We had a truly excellent stay at the Wyndham - which we reached easily from all over town with the C3 bus that stops just in front of the hotel from Earls' Court station, or else with the many bus lines going along nearby Kings Road from Sloane Square. The neighbourhood is peaceful and lovely (great shopping around Sloane Square), and the hotel is quite and a great place to come back to. Since we left earlyish in the morning and came back around evening, we really didn't hear any noise from the works. The beds were truly the most comfortable we both slept in ever (I suffer from lower back pains which disappeared for the length of my London's stay). The suite has two rooms which enable the early riser to get up and make herself a coffee without disturbing the slumbering one, as in our case - with separate heating systems, which also is a big plus on December mornings and two Tvs. The bathroom is a huge room on its own, with a very clever shower system cubicle, two sinks, a bathtub, and a separate WC and bidet room. Great cosmetics, constantly replenished. All the amenities you could wish for (and some more - paperbooks...) - and a great view over the marina and the Thames up to St Paul's. Tasty and varied breakfast (to be taken in the penthouse floor for the duration of the refurbishments, which affords some more stunning views from the terrace). Polite and prompt concierge and desk service. All in all, a highly recommended property, which I am sure will be fantastic after the refurbishments will be over. Oh, and the game was highly appreciated by those in the know ...",5,2009,12,16
122,good stay!,it was a good stay...very comfortable....good staff...no negitives about this hotel for me....a bit far from the key locations in the city...,4,2009,12,10
122,"Distant from attractions, but excellent hotel!","Stayed here for 3 days, and loved it! I had paid extra for a view overlooking the harbour, but since I was checking in early -- the room in question wasn't ready. I was exhausted from the traveling, so they prepared another room for me while I had complimentary breakfast. Had a delicious breakfast sipping on fresh orange juice while overlooking the marina. They had construction going on, at times audible -- which the staff was very apologetic about.

Moved into the hotel room, and was very pleased -- a spacious living room/office, large bedroom, and 2 washrooms. The main washroom had a separate door for the toilet, awesome! 

Very courteous and friendly staff members. The front desk staff greet you by your name (they make it a point to remember it) as you come back into the hotel daily. Breakfast rolls in on a trolley at a time you prefer, and cleaning ladies visit your room several times during the day to tidy it up. It's really difficult to beat the level of service!

The only downfall is that the main attractions are all quite distant from the hotel. You will end up cabbing a lot, which adds up pretty fast! The internet is not free and phone relatively pricey, so expect extra charges for that. 

Overall, you can't go wrong with Wyndham Grand!",5,2009,11,21
122,Excellent!,"We booked the Wyndham Grand after reading reviews on Tripadvisor. We weren't sure what to expect and were hoping that we would have a small kitchen so that we could be self contained. In reality, this is a 5* hotel with a bedroom and a sitting room but it is great. The location of the hotel is excellent if you want to be in this part of London. At first, we thought we were a little isolated but once we knew the area this was not the case. 5 minutes walk to Kings Road, 10 minutes to Fulham Broadway for the tube and all in all, a quiet area but near to the Central London.  The best way to get around is with an all day travel pass which is cheap and gives access to the buses and the trains. We came from Gatwick Airport so used the Southern Train and then after changing at Clapham Junction, the local train which was one stop to the hotel at Imperial Wharf.
The hotel staff were, without exception, outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble and they were charming and helpful if not always knowledgeable. The lifts were always available and the corridors to the rooms were warm. inviting and well furnished. The room itself was a delight. There were two toilets, two televisions, a well furnished sitting room and a stylish bedroom. There was a safe and tea/coffee making facilities - you need to ask for a kettle. The bed was very comfortable and the heating was easy to operate. The bathroom was first class with a power rainforest shower with easy to operate controls. There is building work going on but it didn't disturb us and when the hotel is finished it will be even better. All in all, a great hotel, with great rooms in a good location and if the prices remain reasonable, (we paid £150 a night wthout breakfast) well worth considering. Next  time we visit London, if we don't need to be in the East of the City we will head straight for the Wyndham Grand.",5,2009,11,20
122,Everything was great apart from noise,"The suite we had was fantastic - a real luxurious experience. Location was good - right near the new Imperial Wharf overland train. Breakfast was of a good quality and also good value. My only concern was the noise at night - not because of the renovation - but from the suite doors which bang when shut and also we were in a room with an adjoining room and could our neighbours word for word. Fortunately they also had a child and it quietened down earlier enough. I did raise this with the hotel via a feedback email and received a positive reply saying my account had been updated to note I require a quiet room next time I stay. You may want to request this if noise concerns you. If you are stuck for somewhere to eat in the evening, I can recommend the Indian round the corner in the Harbour development.",4,2009,11,14
122,Stunning Rooms and Excellant Service,"Me and my boyfriend received a good rate for this hotel with Travelzoo as refurb works were ongoing. We managed to get our friends to come along too for a nice weekend away. 
The hotel location is very good, close but not too close to inner busy London. The surroundings are beautiful - the Marina suite we booked delivered well -it was lovely. Very spacious and comfy. We could not believe we had 2 toilets!! 
We barely ever noticed the building works but did guess that the entrance being used at the moment is not the original. However it was all still very nice. Exceptionally clean and tidy even if there was works going on. I would love to see it once its finished. 
The staff were efficient and friendly, especially in the bar on the Penthouse floor.",5,2009,11,02
122,Best pillows ever!,"We booked the hotel for £149 through laterooms.com and were advised that the usual rate was £500 but as the hotel was under refurbishment all suites were reduced.  
Firstly we struggled to find the hotel but eventually found the best and safest route from Fulham Broadway tube station was via Harewood Road, New Kings Road and Lots Road.  This route takes you direct to Chelsea Harbour and the Wyndham Grand.
We checked in very easily and although the refurbishment work was clearly evident it did not impact on our stay.  The suite was large, clean and comfortable.  The children slept on a spacious sofa bed in the lounge whilst we had a large bed with huge pillows.  There were two TVs, two toilets and an adequate bathroom with White Company toiletries.  My only complaint was the very small, extremely low bath, altogether quite odd.  Overall the room was a great choice although I think the usual price tag would have been a bit steep.
We didn't eat in the hotel but opted for the Blue Elephant thai restaurant on Fulham Broadway ... truly excellent as ever!
We were still full the next morning so gave breakfast a miss.  The full english would have been approx. £24 if we had opted to eat in the hotel.  Express checkout made our departure quick with a receipt posted to our home address.
In all a lovely hotel that will be fabulous when the refurbishment is complete.  The harbour setting is peaceful for London and very handy for shopping on the Kings Road.",5,2009,11,01
122,This doesn't feel like 5 star service,"I've stayed here before and loved it but this time, for 2 nights for my birthday, there were several things wrong:

-  no doorman and I wanted to feel welcomed after a long hard week
-  I was kept waiting to check in without even being acknowledged - even barmen manage to say ""I'll be with you in a minute""
- my husband had ordered champagne in our room with a personalised message but the message wasn't there (he'd spelled all names out too)
- TV didn't work unless both tvs were on - someone came and said it was fixed but it wasn't so we had to keep the second tv on (which went on standby after a while so it was a pain to do so and anyway we shouldn't have to after paying 14GBP to watch a film)
- fire alarm went off both nights we were there, not confidence inspiring
- internet access is 75p A MINUTE - I therefore used my blackberry instead
- I  called to ask what certificate a flm was as it wasn't mentioned on their entertainment package onscreen and they said ""it's on the tv"" - it isn't. They could have looked it up but obviously couldn't be bothered

Good things:
- at 130GBP it's cheap for a suite 
- 2 loos are great especially if you have children with you, which we did
- room service is quick (but expensive, 52 quid for 2 cooked breakfast, 2 frosties, toast and croissants, juice and coffee)
- rooms are spacious

last time I stayed I was really impressed. I did email with my issues and did receive an apology so that's nice but not enough to make me go again.",3,2009,10,29
122,Top Quality Hotel,"Stayed here for one night on an anniversary trip. Everything was fantastic. The rooms, the service, the friendly attitude of the staff etc. The view across london and the chelsea harbour are amazing. The list goes on.
A special mention to Adnan Malik, the guest relations manager, very friendly, helpful and professional, he really epitomises the fantastic class of the hotel. 
Can't wait to go back when the refurb is done!",5,2009,10,28
122,perfect in every way,"What a perfect break at this wonderful hotel. We stayed at the  Wyndham Grand for my husbands birthday. Did some research as wanted to stay in Chelsea and came across this hotel and its superb reviews on Trip Advisor. Have to say it did not disappoint and cannot wait to return.

We are advised when we booked there could be noise as the hotel was undergoing refurbishment but we didnt hear a sound. We arrived on Saturday Lunch to be greeted by George the concierge who was such a welcome friendly guy. Nothing was too much trouble for him, very friendly efficient and informative. Check in was quick and when we walked into our suite ....wow..We were on the first floor overlooking the harbour. Rooms are beautiful, modern spacious and very quiet.

We walked to the Kings Road which was 5 minutes from the hotel. On Sunday we wanted to go to the London Eye and concierge George arranged a car for Milton to take us to the London Eye. The service at this hotel was exceptional and we cannot wait to go back. Breakfast was continental in the Penthouse bar and there was so much choice.  

If you want a nice hotel, with quality and exceptional service I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. We have stayed in many hotels around London but this is now our favourite. Suitable for families with young children, romantic breaks and also for business. You will not be disappointed.",5,2009,10,27
122,"Warm, roomy, comfortable suite with a friendly and helpful staff; very relaxing after a long trip.","We stayed in a wonderful suite at this hotel, overlooking the marina.  Having previously stayed at a top rated Trip Advisor hotel in London that turned out to be comfortable but very small, the contrast with the Wyndham was tremendous.  (We live in Hawaii so are used to resort hotels, and the suite at the Wyndham was comparable or better than any we've stayed in here.)  The bedroom was huge with a large flat screened TV and welcoming soft sheets and comforter.  The living room was large, again with a TV, desk, couch and side chairs, and lots of magazines.  And the large bathroom with all of its amenities was luxurious.  We also had a balcony overlooking the marina.  We had hesitated staying here because I'd read Trip Advisor comments about it's being far out of the way and expensive.  However, the Imperial Wharf Station opened a few weeks before we arrived, and although our stay wasn't long enough for us to use it, I assume it would help.  We took a cab to the hotel from Victoria Station and a cab to Heathrow when we left and didn't find the cost of either unreasonable.  The concierge was very helpful with suggestions of where to walk to find shops and food, and we found it an easy 2 block walk to King's Road and only about a 10 minute walk into Chelsea itself, with lots of choices of small restaurants.  We also stopped at a nearby market to buy food for a continental breakfast, which was easy and inexpensive.  The hotel is very close to many antique shops; we were sorry we arrived too late and left the next day too early to spend time browsing through them.  The hotel is undergoing renovations, so the main dining room (which we probably wouldn't have used, anyway) and the health club (which I might have used) were closed.  But food and a bar were available on the top floor, if wanted.  With the discount because of the renovations and what I assume is their off-season Fall discount, the hotel was very reasonable for what we experienced.  My husband says he'll only return to London if we stay there again.  Thank you, Wyndham, for a delightful end to our 3 week visit to London and the continent.",5,2009,10,25
122,Truly wonderful comfort,"Arrived at 3pm and our suite was ready, efficient check in. We knew about the renovation work and, as we wouldn't have had time for the spa etc, this didn't matter. Bit less delighted to be woken to the sound of drilling in the morning but then it was 9.45 and I was only still asleep because my son had had a bad night (high temperature). Would love to visit again next year though if the hotel offer a repeat visit to former guests.

The suite we had was on the first floor but still had a nice view and we loved the decor and furniture, especially the bed spreads and ultra stylish bathroom. Never in my life have I come across a pillow menu, you can choose the type of pillow you want, even Tempur pillows are available. I was happy with my supplied giant puffy ones though and the crisp egyptian cotton sheets - very comfortable. What a treat the turn down service is - the only other time I had floor sheets placed beside the bed, and then they didn't provide slippers, was at the ""uber luxury"" Reids in Madeira. Nice touch to come back to find lighting etc adjusted for bedtime, plus classical music playing softly and our bottled water renewed. We felt pampered.

I also enjoyed the quality and choice of teas in the room and the speed and friendliness with which my skimmed milk was brought up on request. Perhaps biscuits would be a nice addition to the complimentaries?

Another plus is the great selection of reading material, including Red magazine, Time Out plus some luxury stuff. Not sure the Sky channels all worked but poor son was unwell so not such a problem. ""Poor son"" needed paracetamol and a very friendly and kind member of staff went out and bought me a bottle, no charge.

The rooms are so quiet, no sounds from fellow guests at all and the area is itself very peaceful. We walked to & from the Kings Road and used buses to get to the restaurant theatre in Haymarket last night and then to Imperial War Museum today. We arrived via the new Imperial Wharf train station which was fine but we wanted to see a bit more of London en route than is possible via the tubes so we used the buses. The walk to the Kings Road stop is not far at all (10 mins max) and the street felt safe.

Breakfast was a very pleasant affair from the Penthouse with a good choice of cereals, breads, fruit and cold meats, cheese etc. Would like to be offered toast with my tea/coffee rather than DIY but I am sure it would have been brought if I'd asked as I heard someone else order it brought to them.My son wasn't charged as the hotel has a child friendly ethos. Good news as he wasn't up to eating more than a little cereal and a few grapes anyway.

The attention to detail in this hotel is impressive, the location is tranquil (but allow time to get places and note the river boat service is operational in commuter times only). Overall a truly luxurious experience, I would love to return if I can afford it.",5,2009,10,23
122,10 out of 10,"Firstly the bad - They are working on the hotel during the day.

Now for the good - We spent one morning and one afternoon in our room and didn't really notice the work. Other than that this is an excellent hotel and can not recommend it enough. The staff are helpful, friendly and attentive. Everything about this hotel and team shouts quality. 

Truely one of the best places I have ever stayed.",5,2009,10,13
122,"Outstanding hotel, highly recommend","This is a great five star that's a bit overlooked because it's in zone 2, so it's a little off the beaten path.  Five star service and rooms, it was a great experience.",5,2009,10,09
122,Amazing stay,My girlfriend and I have used this hotel on a weekend break...it was my girlfriends birthday and i wanted it to have the wow factor and it didn't disappoint! I have traveled lots and generally stay in hotels 5/6 months a year and i have to say that this hotel room is one of best!. It is a fair walk to the nearest tube station but there was a over ground station just opened 100 meters away so it should be an easy journey into the west end. The health club was not open due to refurbishment and the service was a little slow at breakfast but they are the only criticism of the hotel. overall a great stay.,5,2009,09,28
122,Spoiled rotten!,"I was given a weekend at the hotel as part of a fantastic 40th birthday present; I had asked to be spoiled rotten and I thoroughly enjoyed being so. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable from every member of staff with whom we came into contact from the doorman onwards. Valet parking was welcome and our bags were whisked up to our room and set out for us. Although we were only only the second floor, the views were attractive and the room was extremely spacious for a London hotel with a separate sitting room, huge bathroom and comfortable bedroom. The air-con was whisper-quiet (a change after some recent hotels!) and the bed was exceptionally comfortable; I had the nicest nights' sleep! Little touches, including the turn-down service, were welcome and made the stay all the better. The bathroom toiletries were especially nice!

Breakfast in the morning was extremely generous despite the apologetic ""I'm afraid we only have the express buffet today"" and included delicious pastries, scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon, cereals, fruit and yoghurts - the hot food was tasty and fresh and far better then some congealed hotel breakfast offerings. Despite breakfast being in a conference room as a result of improvement works, the view over the harbour was an attractive way to start a Sunday.

The walk to the tube station is no big deal and didn't take long - there's always a taxi if this is a problem. Worth noting that the area is quiet and smart and we felt totally safe walking back to the hotel late at night.

I don't like to ask about how much it cost, as it was a gift, but my partner assured me that our stay represented good value for money. The facelift works were barely evident and in no way impeded our enjoyment of the stay and I would hope that we would be able to stay here at some time in the future - the service was really that good!",5,2009,09,23
122,Not a bad option for corporate travel,"First-I hope the bloody building work has finished.Awkward location although anyone not fussy about transport links will find it rather picturesque.Chinese lady in the check in spends more time on the phone chatting to her mates then doing anything else.Stayed in the 1 bedroom suit ,rooms well appointed,entertainment system up to good standards,cleanliness superb and sporting facilities and spa equipped well.Evening entertainment non-existent.Probably would visit again.Good for corporate folks or family visiting.",4,2009,09,22
122,Fantastic Stay,"We chose this hotel due to the great price and location and we were not disappointed. The rate we got was excellent due to an autumn promotion and also due to the fact that some refurbishment was going on. I telephoned the hotel beforehand, and they assured me that  only a small part of the hotel was affected. I think it was the conference rooms and health suite. 
On arriving at the hotel, the staff were really attentive and took time to explain everything we needed.
Our room was fantastic. I understand every room is a suite. Great size for a London hotel. 
Large bathroom and separate toilet. Great lounge with balcony. The bed was huge and comfortable.
Staff on concierge really helpful, pointed us to a great pub just a 2 minute walk away which was right on the Thames.
We had a problem with our room key. We were escorted to the bar for a complimentary drink whilst they quickly sorted it. 
Hotel was fairly quiet. I imagine that people may be put off due to the refurbishments. Don't be. We didn't have any problems with noise etc. Just check before you go to see which areas of the hotel are affected.",5,2009,09,21
122,Treat others the way you yourself want to be treated,"Simply the best. This hotel will treat you as well as you do yourself. Perfect execution, the rooms are lovely and the staff as polished and professional as can be.",5,2009,09,14
122,Quality hotel again & again,We have stayed at The Wyndham at least 6 times as we often travel to London & need a good base. The staff are always attentive and friendly without any pretentious nonsense. The food is A1 & the rooms are spacious and clean. We have 2 small dogs who even accompany us!! Our 7 year old loves this hotel as she gets a swim in the pool & her own TV! Yes the bar does have a 9pm watershed for kids which is fair enough but you can dine in the restaurant late and this gets around that issue! We loved this hotel so much that we even spent Chrsitmas 07 here & intend to return for Christmas 09!!,5,2009,09,06
122,Fabulous Suites in a Fabulous Hotel,"Wyndham Grand exceeded our expectations at every turn.
Set in Chelsea Harbour near to the King's Road, the hotel is in a great location.
The suites are fabulous with ample supplies of bottled water, tea & coffee.

We really appreciate the wonderful service that we received at the hotel. There was some confusion with our reservation which was speedily rectified. 

One of our children is disabled and we generally find it difficult to find accomodation that allows us all to be together without a prohibitive cost. 

Wyndham Grand is a fabulous hotel with wonderful staff - thank you for a fantastic weekend.",5,2009,08,31
122,"Refurb makes it difficult to assess fully, but service and room were impeccable","Visited for 2 nights at the end of August. Our room/suite was very impressive, and the level of service we received could not be faulted. It was unfortunate that the restaurant and more particularly the spa/pool facilities were out of action whilst being refurbished, although in fairness the hotel did E-mail in advance to advise that this was the case. The price we paid also reflected the fact that the hotel is not the ""finished"" article. The hotel is a little off the beaten track in terms of the tube (20 minute walk to Fulham Broadway), although the new station appears to be coming on well. We highlighted a couple of minor problems with the room one morning: by evening, they had been addressed. All in all, quite difficult to review properly due to the ""work in progress"", but I've no doubt that when fully refurbished, the hotel will be highly impressive.  One small gripe: I'd E-mailed to advise that it was a special birthday for my wife, and whilst I received an acknowledgement that this had been passed to the Duty Manager, there was no evidence to suggest that this was the case.",4,2009,08,31
122,"Lovely hotel, you must stay here!","My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night and it was the icing on the cake after a very special day. 

We'd booked a Marina suite with a view of the harbour but the hotel rang us a day before to say there was a leak and we were being moved to a similar suite with a different view. To apologise they arranged for a bottle of chilled champers to be waiting for us on arrival, it was!

The view wasn't bad  but the room made up for a lack of harbour view. It was amazing, like a little flat!  I've never stayed anywhere before where there is a separate living area. The room even had a little hallway from the main door leading to the main rooms.  The living area was spacious with a flat tv on the wall and stereo, big sofa, armchairs, desk and usual fridge, tea making facilities etc in the sideboard. 

The bedroom contained a massive bed, another big tv and wardrobes.The bed was really comfy with plenty of pillows.

The bathroom was great, big and spacious. A seperate loo at the back of th eroom with a door, good for boys!  The shower was powerful, the bath is big enough for two and the towels were fluffy and soft. 

We had breakfast in the room the morning after and is was just lovely, see the pic!

The staff were really friendly and helpful, couldn't fault anything about this hotel.

We didn't have time to check out the pool etc but going be what we saw I'm sure it was lovely. 

Do take advantage of the free chaufeur service on offer. it doesn't take you miles but the driver will drop you at nearby landmarks and tube stations. 

The Chelsea footie team stayed there the same night as us and I saw them boarding the coach as I was handing my dress over to my mum outside.

If it's good enough for them it's good enough for you!",5,2009,08,27
122,Great hotel,"Two school friends and I had a suite at this hotel for one night including breakfast.  The location on the harbour is wonderful and  like being abroad.  You would not think you were in the middle of london.  

Downside... well yes you are in the middle of london, but a taxi drive from the underground station, and no where much in the immediate vicinity to go.  

Beautiful room and bathroom with expensive toiletries, bathrobs and slippers.

Nice breakfast although they seemed in a hurry to clear away.

We had a great deal via Travel Zoo",4,2009,08,04
122,Incredible stay (if you dodge the building works),"We stayed for 3 nights with my spouse and our two little kids. The rooms (actually suites) were huge, furnished with taste and perfectly clean. Room service was excellent throughout : the staff was charming, it took them hardly five minutes to bring a baby cot to the room, we didn't even have to ask. Complimentary tea, coffee and daily newspapers was also appreciated.  The free access swimming pool is a real treat, unfortunately it is now closed or refurbishment until jan'10.

We paid £150/night VAT included, which is incredible value when you know London hotel prices.

Not many things to say on the down side :
- we had to bear two false fire alarms, one of them at midnight. I guess it's linked to the ongoing refurbishment. But I suppose better safe than sorry...
- apart from that, we were lucky not annoied by the refurbishment or by the exterior works (they were building a new railway station just beneath our windows), but if I were you I would check by phone with the staff, and ask for a room with a marina view (with higher rates though). 
- the breakfast rates are exagaratingly steep (over £20 for a full breakfast, a little less for continental) whereas, strangely enough, the other room service food prices are rather reasonable.
- high speed Internet rates are also highway robbery. They should know that many good hotels (even 2 stars) have free Wifi access.",4,2009,07,24
122,Lovely stay,"We stayed at this hotel May 23rd for 2 nights on a deal with Travel Zoo and really enjoyed our stay there.

We were given room 315 which was lovely, we did ask if the hotel was full as we wanted to upgrade sadly it was.

All the staff were lovely so attentive without being intrusive.

We had a problem with our TV in the lounge so, we phoned downstairs and the problem was sorted within 10mins.

It is about a 20 minute walk to the Kings Rd, not to far at all.

Had a good walk then finished our evening with our drink on the outdoor decking area, it was lovely.

Would love to return but with an upgraded room, hopefully in the summer.

Cant fault it",5,2009,07,13
122,"Fantastic, great value for luxury rooms!","This hotel made London worthwhile.  What a view of the Tower bridge and the Eye!  After roughing it Provence this was luxury, great beds, great sheets, great staff.  Family suites were very nice.  A special shout out to Craig and Romina, thanks for the extra help with the blinking red light.  A great value for what you get, rooms are comparable to a Ritz Carlton US.  We were VERY pleased, good job Wyndam.  Also, I never expect much from room service, but the food was very good.  We were impressed.  A word to the wise I think there is a little Tesco express right outside of the hotel.  Also, they purify their own water and is complementry in the rooms.  I appreciated not having to scrounge for bottled water once we got there.  Classy!",5,2009,07,10
122,"Beautiful Hotel, however. . .","The hotel suite was beautiful, very roomy, with balconies overlooking the harbour which is a great place to relax and enjoy a bottle of wine.  Meals are very overpriced.  Breakfast for two $80+ and the room service food was what I would expect at bargain hotel - tasteless, overpriced and very disappointing.  If you want to be close to the heart of London this hotel is a distance away, a one-way taxi ride cost $12 - $20, and a taxi to the tube cost $8 - $10.    Construction is taking place and noise is to be expected during the day.  This information was given to us upon our arrival and then again later in our stay with a letter left in our room.  We did ask for a late checkout and were told the first hour would be complimentary but every hour thereafter would cost 20 pounds ($34 per hour).  Overall, a beautiful hotel, spacious suite with great views overlooking the harbour, over-priced meals, and a distance away from the heart of London.",4,2009,07,02
122,Lovely Modern Hotel in good location,"Booked our room via Hotwire and had no problems.  Had called prior to arrival after reading reviews about the construction works to request a room away from the works and this was accommodated.  Check in was smooth and was taken to room 407 on 4th floor, was a bit worried when we stepped out of the lift to find the room directly next to the lifts as was worried it would be too noisy but couldnt hear the lifts at all.  Rooms are much larger than most standard London hotel rooms.  Small hallway leading to a lounge with sofa and desk and refreshments and safe, and a separate bedroom with lovely comfortable beds with choice of a variety of pillows (pls note you have to request turn down service at reception). Bathroom with shower cubicle and bath and separate toilet and bidet.  The White Company toiletries were provided which were very nice.  Tea and Coffee and one bottle of drinking water was provided and there was a mini bar which we didnt use.  
Service at reception was very good.  I tired to order an English Breakfast tea from the bar only to be informed that they didnt have any and they didnt offer to get any either which I thought was pretty bad for a 5* hotel in London and also found the receptionist at the health spa quite unfriendly.  Other than that no complaints and didnt hear or see any construction work in or around the hotel so we didnt have any complaints about this.  The restaurant is closed at the moment which we were informed at check in but we didnt have plans to eat in the hotel anyway.  Would stay here again.  Its a good location to Chelsea and Knightsbridge, we walked to Fulham (15-20 mins) and the Kings Road (15-20 mins) and Harrods (30 mins) and it was a very pleasant walk as the area is very nice.",4,2009,06,29
122,five star hotel 0 star service very disapointing never will return,"we travelled to the wyndam on tuesday 26th of may two adults and a small child, we were impressed with the hotel for the price £150 as the are improvements 9am to 6pm.
BUT when we retired to our room got our son to sleep at 1145 all hell let loose jcb,s diggers and rock breakers lee than 100 meters from the hotel the noise was unbearable this lasted till after 5 am. we complained twice but the front desk told us they are laying new rail lines down appparently till december. in the morning i asked to speak to the manager (helen wallace) she made us wait in reception for over an hour then told us it was not the hotel it was the railway so not her problem. i think the noise is well over any reqired levels and the hotel know this but ultimately it will provide a rail stop to the hotel door, this is why the rooms are cheap not because of the daytime improvements.
the manager is very rude the staff are afraid of her because of improvements the hotel has little facilities and most of all cant even offer a quiet room, if you fancy a 24 hour building site go ahead but im sure you can do better.
marriot and hilton are much nicer.",1,2009,06,03
122,Fantastic short break - highly recommended,"We decided to go away, at the last minute, for a Bank Holiday break with our 2 children (3 and 7).  We found this hotel almost by accident on 'late rooms', and got a great rate.  The suite was perfect - marine view and comfortable sofa bed, separate bedroom, balcony overlooking the marina, top quality furnishings and equipment (2 HD TVs, a brilliant Monsoon shower and a mini sailing boat for the bath to name just a few).  Lovely pool for the children and great service throughout.  

Sitting on our balcony, sipping wine whilst watching the sun set, with the children fast asleep after a fun filled day pottering around the King's Road, we felt worlds away from the daily grind and one night away felt more like a week. 

The hotel is being refurbished (although we had no sight or sound of this during our stay) so now is the time to grab a great rate and treat yourselves!",5,2009,05,26
122,Worst Hotel Ever!!!,"We visited this hotel as a treat for my son who wanted to visit a 5 * Hotel for his birthday treat.  We arrived, were greeted brusquely, had our credit card details taken and then once these were taken informed that the hotel was undergoing major refurbishment and that there would be noise from 9 a.m onwards.  We were shown to our room where the TV didn't work and the fold up bed was tatty.  We went to investigate the pool using the lift we were directed to .. and found instead floors of broken chairs.  We went to the pool and couldn't get in with the key ....asked where the restaurant was ...only to be told it was closed.  At this stage, we began to wonder what the point of our stay was.  So, we complained, were offered a £30 reduction, use of a WII and a few snacks from room service.  We decided to cut our losses and leave.  Apparently we should have been advised in advance that there was building works on but when we booked and when we phoned on the morning of our visit for travel advice there was no inkling that things were less than normal.",1,2009,05,23
122,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"I booked this hotel through a travel zoo offer, so only paid £129 for the room, breakfast for the kids were free and the adults only paid  half price.

As i stayed over the bank holiday, I did not hear the noise from the penthouse refurb,  which I heard was pretty bad. Our room overlooked a train line but you could hardly hear this, so not a problem. The room was nice and large, with a balcony complest with 2 chairs and a table,  fantastic quality toiletries, large fluffy towels and so far so good the best hotel slippers I have worn. There were lots of TV channels to chose from which you would think most hotels would have with the freeview we now have, but there are still so many with just the basic 1-5 a news channel and maybe one or two european channels, here you get at least 30 channels. The bed was lovely, the turndown service was fab, all the towels changed, bathroom cleaned again, and 2 large bottles of water on each bedside table. 

For those who dont want to pay for internet in the room, there is a PC located by the entrance that is free to use.

The staff are really friendly and helpful, the gym is a little cramped, but good up to date equipment and weights with a seperate stretching room, lots of bottled water to help yourself to, and even cold towels to cool yourself down with! The pool is deep, it is 1.5metres all round, which is fine for an average height adult, but could pose a problem for kids or anyone shorter than me :-) (im 5ft 2) but it was clean and large.

The only downside, but not enough to take a mark off was the breakfast, it all seemed a bit disorganised, they ran out of rice krispies and they didnt even have weetabix, and these cereals are a basic really in any hotel, may seem a bit picky but as a mother of a 1year old with 4 teeth these are the only cereals he is ok with eating. The tea was the loose version, but was so weak it was pointless and one of my pancakes were burnt to a crisp. If I had to give the breakfast a mark out of 10, it would be a 5, certainly nothing special, and would have been very annoyed if I had paid the full price for for it , infact I have had better in the Ibis! but the staff really do try their best and once again all very friendly.

Would certainly stay here again,ideally over the August bank holiday, as that way you avoid the building works and hopefully will be hot so then you can really enjoy  the balcony",5,2009,05,04
122,Avoid Building Works,"We stayed for 2 days in mid-April. The hotel staff were very friendly, though service was a bit haphazard and internet access was charged at 24pounds Sterling a day. . The room was very nice with a separate bedroom and living room. However, our room (617) overlooked a building site where, for some unknown reason, building work took place only at night. After an interrupted first night the noise got so bad during the second night that at 3.30 in the morning I asked to be given another room as sleep was sinply impossible (this was speedily organised).  What was annoying was that the staff clearly knew about the possible interruptions (our bedroom window could not be opened) and despite the hotel not beeing fully booked gave us the room. So, if you are planning to stay there in the near future avoid any rooms (on any floors)  with uneven room numbers!",3,2009,04,28
122,The most near perfect you can get to a stay in London!,"Writing this review a little late as I have been travelling since the end of Feb when we stayed at the Wyndham. What a fabulous hotel!I have stayed at many hotels in London for either work or leisure, and they are either over priced, or flatter to deceive. This place was perfect. It's out in Chelsea, about a 5-10 min walk from Fulham Broadway station, but that shouldn't bother the healthy walkers amongst us and the area is quite pleasant.

 I had some business to tend to very quickly then me and my friend were going to enjoy the rest of weekend in London. The hotel check-in staff were friendly and helpful, and gave clear advice on cost when I wanted a upgraded room. We got a good offer of upgrading to a harbour view room and breakfast for a very reasonable price.

The rooms are brilliant. You get a living room, complete with sofa, tv and SPACE!, a nice balcony to either have a quick drink whilst watching the nice boats or to just lounge. The bedroom was separate, but very clean with nice twin/double beds.The bathroom was one of the nicest bathrooms we had seen, The toilet was in a separate room, and there was 2 in the suite!The shower was amazing and very comfortable. I wanted the penthouse but me and my friend needed separate beds.

Once I had sorted my work things out, We went out and explored London a little as we always do, before hitting the vibrant life of Kings Road later, which was WALKING distance from the hotel. We came back (peacefully) in the early hours but worse for wear. This is where the breakfast came in....

We went downstairs for breakfast the next morning in almost zombie like states. The staff were amazingly attentive and helpful, and the breakfast was fresh, warm and made to a very high standard. There were hot options, cold options, fruit platters......allsorts!

Overall we had a fantastic stay, I haven't even mentioned the lovely ambient bar/restaurant in the lobby, or the fitness suite with 2 steam rooms and swimming pool. Certainly a hidden gem, and I am already trying to get a loyalty agreement so I can come and stay more often for both work and leisure.",5,2009,04,25
122,Great service and location!,"This hotel is well located, has great service, and is superb value. For GBP 160 per night, we got a suite with balcony overlooking Chelsea Harbour - right off the Thames River. The breakfasts were the best we've had in the UK. Well stocked meeting a large range of dietary needs. The staff were attentive and pulled out all the stops. The location provides excellent access to the better parts of London. Great for walks or runs along the Thames embankment. Hotel Spa was small but decent including 17 meter heated indoor pool.",4,2009,04,19
122,Excellent hotel,"The wyndham is an excellent hotel, the suites are big and comfortable and the price is very good for london. It is a bit outside ""tourist"" london but buss 22 stops 500 meters from the hotell  and takes you straight to the city center so it is realy no problem. Everyone was realy helpfull and nice. 
If you go up to Big Easy in kings road you will get an excellent meal. We did not try the hotel resturant as we travelled with a 3 year old and needed something family friendly.
Only major  complaint i have is that they charge 24£ a night for wifi access that is close  to robbery seeing many hotels has it free or atleast to a more sane price. I recomend that you try to  access BtOpenZone, that will cost you  15£ for 5 days.

Overall an excellent hotel and we will stay here again if we go back to london",5,2009,04,14
122,Very high standards,"Did a one-nighter here...got upgraded to a Marina view. I echo all of what's been written on here - a fabulous hotel - especially by London standards. Many excellent touches - including an Easter egg for our daughter (as we were staying over Easter).

The leisure centre is excellent - although the pool is a little deep for novice swimmers / young children (1.50m all the way around).

Will definitely return.",5,2009,04,13
122,Off the Beaten Path Exceeded Expectations,"This luxurious hotel is off the beaten path from Central London but ideally located off Kings Road.  You feel as though you are in a private gated community but close to a trendy neighborhood.  This suite hotel is hard to find in London and the spacious rooms are enormous for London standards.  Our suite had a balcony facing Chelsea Harbour where each morning we read our paper with a coffee.   The service is exceptional treating each guest as their only one.  It helps to be a Wyndham By Request member:  down pillows, fresh fruit and wine with our arrival. Can't wait for a return holiday to stay here and be pampered again!",5,2009,03,27
122,Excellent!,"The minute we pulled up to the hotel door in our taxi and the doorman helped us out the taxi. I knew we were in for a great time. Check-in was smooth and quick with no problems. We were shown to our room by a very helpful member of staff who showed us how to work the TV's and AC/Heating. The hotel has no rooms, they are referred to as suites, which have a living room area and desk and the bedroom with ensuite bathroom and shower cubicle, double sinks and even a guest toilet. The suite had two balconies with views over the Chelsea area. Room amenities included an umbrella, bath robes, slippers, luxury toiletries which retail between 10 to 15 a bottle, a fully stocked mini bar, and a coffee maker with real coffee, not instant. Full use of the health club was available, which included the gym, swimming pool, sauna and steam rooms. The health club was in excellent condition and staff very helpful. The hotel breakfast was varied and included everything from cereals to pancakes and full cooked breakfasts to muffins. All the staff in the hotel that I encountered were very pleasant and professional. Check out was very quick and we were asked how we enjoyed our stay. The hotel was in Chelsea and 10 mins walk from the nearest tube station - Fulham Broadway. I could not find fault with this hotel and I would definitely go back. Well Done, Wyndham Grand.",5,2009,03,18
122,"Great Service, Great People.","We had a wonderful 3-night stay in early Feb. It doesn't seem like you are in the middle of London staying at this hotel. After a long day of sightseeing the children couldn't wait to get back to the hotel for a swim and they couldn't wait to go to the restaurant in the morning for the wonderfully prepared breakfast!
On the second night, the cable television went out and we were upgraded to an even nicer suite!! 
What makes this a truly outstanding hotel are the people who work there -- from the doorman who was so welcoming, to the concierge staff that made us a reservation at a lovely Italian restaurant just up the road, to the staff at the front desk who always had smiles and answers to the questions we asked. 
We'll certainly be back the next time we're in London!",5,2009,02,27
122,One really wonderful hotel,Perhaps the best hotel we have ever stayed in.......excellent service and attention to detail......our 8 year old loved the fact that the hotel had a swimming pool....great at the beginning and end of the day after sightseeing.....truly great breakfast and room service....thank you to the management and staff of the Wyndham Grand London Chelsea Harbour.....special thanks to the Concierge for their unbiased advice,5,2009,02,22
122,Everything we wanted,"Although we live in London we booked the Wyndham for a one night get away. It was perfect for us. The staff were extremely helpful. We rang up and asked if we could check in early and they were more than happy to accomodate. This allowed us plenty of time to use the hotel facilities before going out for a late lunch. Having never stayed in a suite before, we really enjoyed it and will now find it difficult to go back to normal hotel rooms! It was extremely spacious and very comfortable and avoided the clynical feel that many hotels have. If you are trying to sightsee in London the hotel is a little bit out of the way (and a decent walk from the nearest tube station) but for us this didn't matter at all and I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough.",5,2009,02,20
122,"Large, luxurious rooms, great food and service.","Stayed here with my wife and then 7 month old son for 3 nights last year and was very impressed with the hotel and more specifically the rooms. 

A rarity in London to find such a spacious suite as standard, the separate sleeping and living areas (with sofas, magazines and separate flatscreen tv) were idea with a baby and the room was very well appointed with the best mattress/pillow combo I have ever slept in. 

We used the swimming pool twice which is a very good size and there was only ever one other person to share it with. The food was great and the staff very courteous and professional.

Admittedly it is not a short walk to the Kings Road or to the nearest tube station but that was not a priority for our stay as we didn't mind meandering into Chelsea or taking a cab elsewhere.

We got what we felt was a good deal on our stay (around £145 a night) and even had a quick chat with Nicolas Anelka (Chelsea footballer) who was also staying there. 

Would definitely stay there again for that price.",5,2009,02,19
122,Amazing Stay,"My boyfriend suprised me with a Valentines weekend 2 night stay here and from the moment we walked through the doors the staff were friendly and eager to help. Our suite was perfect, fluffy towels, his and her tolietries. Tbed was enormous and i barely noticed my boyfriend in it! It was clean, fresh and  so comfortable. 

We sampled breakfast in bed on the first morning, expensive but a nice luxury if you want to splash out.

We had lunch in the bar on the saturday which again was costly but good quality and the fish finger sandwich is a must!
The gym  is not large but adequate for a workout, but the pool and changing facilities are great.

Everything about this hotel is luxury, the staff make you feel welcome and will bed over backwards to make your stay perfect.

It is a 5 minute walk to the top of Kings Road but be prepared its a long walk all the way down if you are shopping.But there is no problem for the Conceirge getting you a taxi

Would recommend this hotel.",5,2009,02,15
122,Fantastic stay at xmas,"5 nights spent at xmas as attending football match boxing day, wonderful river view suite, loads room for 3 of us, great bathroom amenities, very good housekeeping, very discreet, no noise in corridors, excellent gym facilitiies. Also concierge lady Danielle deserves a mention  , nothing too much trouble for her. Do not want to stay any where else when next in london !!!.",5,2009,02,13
122,"Fantastic hotel, wrong location","We stayed here for one night after booking through lastminute.com. Overall, the hotel was fantastic. We were very pleased with our suite, which was clean and spacious. However, the location was not great. The hotel is not ideal if you are sightseeing in London. A taxi to Victoria cost us about £15 and the nearest tube station, Fulham Broadway is a good 15-20 mins walk. Also, don't go if there is a Chelsea game on! The tube is busy, roads are closed and taxis can't get through the streets because of the traffic. It was so bad that the taxi driver told us to get out of the taxi and walk...which we did all the way from Earls Court! 
Although Chelsea Harbour itself is attractive there is very little to do in the area. I had read comments on TripAdvisor before I went regarding the noise of planes flying over. I can honestly say this was never an issue, don't be put off by this. 
Finally, take a credit card with you! We were surprised to be asked upon check-in for our credit card to take a £100 security fee in case we damaged anything or used the mini bar. Maybe this is normal with 5* hotels but we were not expecting it. 

I would recommend the hotel for people on business in the Chelsea area, not for tourists.",4,2009,02,10
122,Suite heaven,"Stayed here for 5 nights which included New Year's Eve. The accomodation was excellent - very clean and all  needs catered for - eg: full set of towels including face cloths, dressing gowns,  slippers, shoe horn, clothes brush, compliementary bottled water, newpaper delivered each morning. 2 plasma TV's, (one in the bedroom and one in the sitting room). 

And wait for it .. filter coffee ! no instant in sight !

On our first morning of sight seeing we took a taxi to victoria ( approx £8 stg) but when we got our London transport travel cards we took tte tube to Earl's court and from there the C3 bus which stopped outside the Hotel (well about 45 seconds walk away !). 

On your way back to the Hotel from London city centre  and getting off at Earl's court make sure to take the Earl's Court Road exit from the tube station, turn to your right and the bus stop for the C3 is accross the road. 
 I would recomend the travel card as taxi fares add up very quickly. 
 
The hotel is very close to city centre using public transport and as it is not right in the centre you get a very peaceful nights sleep in excellent surroundings.  Enjoy your stay !",5,2009,01,08
122,Upscale yet refined,"You cannot get much better than the Wyndham Chelsea Harbour.  The rooms are very spacious with flat panel televisions, a stereo system and a sitting area.  The bathrooms are some of the largest I've seen in quite a while.

The service was subdued yet helpful.  I used the conceriege many times and they always seemed to rise to the occassion; equally, the front desk was most accomodating.

The Fulham Broadway metro station is an easy 15 minute walk if you don't mind walking (which I didn't). If you plan on using a taxi, expect to pay 6 pounds from the tube to the hotel.

The hotel borders on being a 5* - very pleasant and accomodating.",5,2009,01,05
122,Very very good,"We've just returned from 3 nights at this really lovely hotel.  We already had a London hotel booked for our trip when, 2 days before we were due to travel, I received an email from Travelzoo with a special offer on the Wyndham.  After checking  reviews on TA, I decided to go for it and this was definitely the right decision.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a marina view suite which was amazing.  We had a balcony overlooking the marina and it was so quiet we could have been in the heart of the country rather than in the middle of London.  There was also a bowl of fresh fruit waiting for us in the suite with a welcome card from the manager - a very nice touch.  The suite was large and very comfortable with a plasma TV in both the living room and bedroom.  Everything was spotlessly clean and daily housekeeping was excellent.  All members of staff with whom we came into contact - reception, concierge, doormen, and particularly room service, were polite, charming and coudn't do enough to help.  We didn't use either the restaurant or the health club, being too exhausted at the end of each day to do anything more than order room service, but the room service menu was pretty extensive and everything we ordered was delicious.  The only very slight drawback to the hotel is the 10 minutes or more of very brisk walking it takes to get to Fulham Broadway, the nearest tube station.  This was OK in the mornings, but returning in the evenings we could never quite face it.  We hit on a compromise of getting the tube to Victoria and then getting a taxi from there - £10 or so.  However, the payback for this very small disadantage is being in a beautiful, quiet hotel far away from  constant traffic noise and sirens.  I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and would love to return next time I'm in London.",5,2009,01,04
122,superb,"Wow we booked this Hotel as we where going to Olympia on the 21st Dec. This hotel is Stunning, We have stayed in some amazing 5 star Hotels in Vegas and this is up there with them infact the rooms beat them. The only thing that lets this Hotel down is the moody staff who dont make you feel very welcome. The breakfast staff where fantastic and 100% to Housekeeping as we forgot our washbag and within 1 min of calling housekeeping the doorbell went. (yes you have your own doorbell.) The main reastaurant is expensive but heck its worth it, although we didn't rate the Puddings and the staff as i said before could of been nicer. The breakfast was superb and the staff where fantastic. BEWARE the breakfast was included in our room rate but twice they tryed to charge us, And its very good but i did feel that when i went to the cold bar to get a skinny muffin i was fround apon felt that they maybe shouldn't watch what your taking it gave us a complex as it was st stunning we did want to sample it all. (still rubbing belly now) But its xmas after all. The bar snack menu looked very good aswell and half the price. But for us eating in the main reastaurant made the trip for us. I can't say enough about the room and how fantastic it was. We can't wait to go back next year. Lets just hope the staff are nicer. I f you have any question please feel free to E mail me.",4,2008,12,22
122,"Steer well clear, lovely hotel staff are an utter disgrace with children","I had booked the Wyndham hotel again after staying a number of times, staying before as a couple. This time we came with our 4 year old. He has travelled internationally many times and is a very well behaved boy..... still he is not welcome at the Wyndham. 

After arriving at 19.30, we went straight back down to the bar at 20.00, we sit down, order a bottle of wine, food and sit down for a nice evening. The waiter brings our 4 year old a colouring book and crayons, so all is on for a relaxing evening, or so we think.... Our 4 year old is enjoying chilling on the sofa with us, whilst colouring in his book.

So, Imagine how we feel when we are asked to leave the bar or move to the restaurant at 20.50, half way through our main courses, before 21.00 as the policy is no children afer this time. Not best pleased  with the waiter at telling us this, he suggests that he get the duty manager, so he brings a coleague with the badge 'German'

'German' then proceeded to make us feel like criminals in the restaurant (after all our 4 year old was sat quietly eating a pasta dish), standing over us, asking us to leave and making us feel positivly unwelcome.  His attitude was a disgrace in any environment, but in a 5 star hotel we expected much better service, or at least some consideration for their customers, after all, we had no idea of this policy.

He then stunned us with rediculous claims that the law stated that children were not allowed in a bar area after 21.00, which we claimed was not true. This he changed,  his claim reverting to hotel 'policy.' When asked to show us this policy he was unable to do so (at least this way we knew we wern't being victimised). 

All this carry on was in front of a busy bar, and of course of our 4 year old, who now thinks that he is totally unwelcome in the hotel, so feels very very aware of what people may be thinking of him. After all 'German' made him feel totally unwanted. Not what you would expect from an internation brand such as Wyndham.

To sum up the hotel, after being here for a little less than 2 hours,  I am now booking another hotel and intending to leave immediateley. 

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone with children, even the best behaved ones. We have been made to feel like criminals and second class citizens just because we wanted to sit in the one and only  bar with a very well behaved 4 year old.

Even when challenged about his shameful behaviour 'German' offered an email address to complain to when we got home.... although a little pointless considering our sintiment about this hotel already.",1,2008,12,19
122,Loved it,"From the moment we walked in and was shown to our suite, we knew we were in for a good 4 days.  Room very spacious, 2 loos, 2 flat screen tv's, cd player, complimentary water, shoe clean, papers, turn down service with your slippers placed at the side of your bed, tv radio switched on and bedside lights on.  Starbucks coffee served.   Didn't get a harbour view, but this did not dampen our stay.  Ate only once in restaurant but it was very good.  Breakfasts were also good with plenty of choice, we even managed to eat outside on the decking on the last day, overlooking the harbour,  as the weather was so nice, not bad for late September.  They have a very efficient invisible maid service, never saw them once or any sign of them (no trolleys etc) which was a nice touch.  Reception staff very welcoming.  A pleasant  10 mins stroll took you to the nearest tube station (Fulham Broadway).  Ate at the Blue Elephant Thai Restaurant, near the tube station, which is set-up like a rainforest on the inside, nice meal but not outstanding.  A cd library would be a good idea for guests.  Wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2008,12,09
122,Definitely one to think about.,"I can't stand hotels where you're treated as nothing more than a number, and thankfully that wasn't the case here. I walked in, not dressed for the occasion I must admit. Someone had tripped and spilt coffee down my suit whilst I was actually trying to find this place. Not a problem, said the receptionist, whilst he was checking me in. He said that if I came back shortly with my suit, it would be drycleaned for the next morning, free of charge. 

The hotel looked impressive from the outside, in a modern and secure complex. It was just as impressive from the inside. Every detail finished to the Nth degree. My suite (There were no ""rooms"" in the traditional sense, it's a suite-only hotel) was a marina-view, and was as impressive as it sounds. The only thing I could be disappointed in was myself, for the fact that I didn't go down and have a walk around the marina. 

The restaurant was maybe a little OTT, but as a fan of all things extraneous, I was impressed. I was given the option of sitting on the balcony with my meal, which I decided to take. Quite often, I find that staff in restaurants at hotels are too embroiled in coversations between themselves, and are leaving me waiting at the table for my drink or to take my order. This wasn't the case here; the staff seemed to go out of their way to cater for my needs (I have some strict dietary requirements because of my many food allergies).

After my meal, I decided it would be time to get into bed, because I had a busy day ahead the next day. My bed was very comfortable. The only complaint I do have about the room is the poor proximity of power sockets to the bed. I could barely reach my bed with my laptop's power cable. I put my shoes out to be shined (As this service is complimentary). 

The next morning, I'd overslept and didn't have time to go for breakfast. The staff at the desk, before checking me out, went to the trouble of arranging a car to take me to my destination.

Certainly a 5 star hotel, but there are maybe one or two niggling things about it which prevent me from choosing ""Excellent.""",4,2008,11,21
122,Best Yet,"I have stayed in most of the 5 star hotels in London but this one is very nearly the best of the lot. I booked in there for 4 nights last weekend with my wife and 2 kids aged 11 & 12. The 1 room i booked  consisted of 1 large bedroom and a huge lounge with double sofa bed, 2 plasmas,2 toilets etc all of a very high standard. The breakfast in the hotel which was included was excellent. Food top class, view over Chelsea harbour fantastic and the service second to none. Some nice touches in the hotel were free internet access a morning newspaper and unlimited amounts of filtered bottled water. The staff too were very very helpful and courteous. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and cannot fault it in anyway. The only negative is you have to go on a generic website to get a room because there never seems to be availability on the Wyndham website itself.",5,2008,10,28
122,Lovely suite - but a bit out the way,"We stayed at the Wyndham on a romantic weekend break and attended the last night of the proms. It was a great experience - the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. We had a sunny balcony where we had our own breakfast. It felt like we had hired our own flat for the weekend as opposed to a hotel room. 
The breakfast was not included in the room rate and we didn't fancy paying £20 odd quid for breakfast - so we brought our own. 
Nice pool and gym facilities and great hand and hair products. 

If you are wanting to get public transport - it is a bit out the way  to get to - fine if you are driving or getting cabs everywhere. 

Very quiet and a real taste of chelsea!",4,2008,09,30
122,Absolutely Fantastic,"What a fantastic stay at the Wyndham Grand!
This hotel is absolutely amazing from the first moment we arrived. On arrival the welcome was warm and friendly and the staff were more than helpful.
The door to our room took a bit of mastering but the wait was worth it once we got in! Sofas, 2 flatscreen TV's, a dressing room, 2 balconies, 2 bathrooms, a pile of the newest magazines and a CD sound system. There was a suprise behind every door and in every drawer. 
Then there was the bed - deep bouncy pillows, the softest sheets and so wide you could get lost. 
Sometimes when you stay in a hotel you can hear other rooms doors banging, people down the corridoors etc but not here - it was so quiet it was like we were the only people staying there.
The little extras were a real treat and we will definately be going back! 
Take a walk around the harbour - so nice and peaceful.",5,2008,09,28
122,Great Hotel,"Great hotel.  There were 4 of us - myself, my wife, and my 2 children aged 9 and 6.  The rooms was more than adequate and the staff were exceptionally helpful.  The staff made up the childrens bed for us. Parking was reasonable especially as we effectively parked for 2 days.  The breakfast was £21 per head but the children ate free.  I had to ask for more bacon as the portions were small but the additional request was no problem.  It was a little on the expensive side but ithe stay was stress free and the room was of a high standard.  Getting into central London by taxi was £15-£20 per journey.  There is no tube nearby.  There is only 1 bar and 1 restaurant but this was not a problem.  Does not ahve the hustle and bustle of the central London hotels but a very comfortable stay overall with great facilties.",5,2008,08,23
122,"Nice Sized Room, Terrible Service","We must say that, for London, the size of the suites were quite large, however don't go for harbour view coz whilst the boats are really nice to look at, BUT don't look down from the balcony .... because the terrace below has old discarded cigarette butts and weeds all over it, the hotel is also stuck right out of the way at the wrong end of Kings Road, the really nice bars and restaurants around Sloane Square and that end of Kings Road are really out of walking distance because Kings Road must be at least 2-3 miles long!  The mini bar also charged £5 for a small packet of biscuits, hence we went hungry until we went out for dinner!  Our stay was also overshadowed by the appalling service we received, the water was turned off without any warning, the telephone was disconnected due to engineering works again without warning, the valet parking and concierge was a shambles and we had to wait nearly an hour for our luggage, overall, not what you would expect for a five star establishment, its really bad value for money and I can think of much nicer establishments for the same price or less.   We WILL NOT be staying there again.",1,2008,07,31
122,What a luxurious treat!,"We stayed here on a Friday and Saturday, I booked using my trip rewards points 45,000 per night and then upgraded to a Marina View Suite on arrival for £40 per night.

The suite was wonderful, spacious bathroom, bedroom, living room and also a nice size balcony.

Lots of attention to detail, his and her basins and toiletries for example.  Starbucks coffee in the room with a coffee maker, magazines etc.

We had breakfast served in our room on both mornings, and were able to choose from an extensive menu, the food arrived quickly on both mornings and was cooked to perfection.

The staff were very helpful and the cocktails in the bar are wonderful, but pricey!

We are already planning our next trip as we found it so relaxing

The only draw back is the helicopters and planes that fly over every 10 minutes or so, very annoying when you have the doors to the balcony open.  However, it hasn't put me off returning and once the doors are closed you can't hear them.",5,2008,07,29
122,Very good value!,"I booked this online through Easyjet and it is by far the best deal on-line for a 5 star hotel in London.  Great value for money as it was £285 inclusive of full English breakfast and VAT for a family room.  It was not 5 star in the sense of being the Dorchester, but it was great for star spotting during Wimbledon, as John McEnroe and Martina Natrilova were both staying there!  We had a few hiccups such as 3 hours to check in (we had to wait in the restaurant as we showed up early and they kept putting more important customers before us to do with Wimbledon) but all that aside, it was great value for money.",5,2008,07,23
122,very clean and friendly.,very clean and friendly service with large room and by london standards reasoably priced.alittle bit far from underground but bus#3 runs regularly to earls court.,5,2008,07,20
122,"Nice, bit out of the way","Booked through Hotels Direct. Actually booked the Park Lane at Green Park, thankfully after reading reviews on trip advisor, they were fully booked and so the company offered me The Wyndham Grand.

Its lovely, a bit out of the way tho. I was travelling with my two children and since the nearest tube station is around 10-15 minute walk and I am not good at navigating my way round tube stations and lines - we took cabs most of the time which was quite expensive but worth the peace of mind that I wasnt going to get lost with a 13 yr old and 7 yr old as my husband usually navigates. A taxi from London City Airport was about £50, and to Marble Arch was about £25, Westminster Pier £20, Oxford St £25. 

The hotel is all suite, this impressed the kids, it was good that we had two televsions, no fighting about what was on. I shared the bed with my daughter, a very comfy king size, my son stayed in livingroom on the sofa bed, my only complaint about that was that they did not make the bed back into a sofa during the day. 

The mini bar smelled at bit and had a puddle of water in it and was not restocked, also the glasses which had been used were taken away and not replaced. 
The bathroom was nice, big enough, shower smelled a bit musty but otherwise was adequately clean. Nice small balcony, separate air con for livingroom and bedroom which was good.
The public areas are nice, the pool is good, we went a couple of times, it was quiet. 
Breakfast was good, but if its included in your package, check your bill - they tried to charge me for one day. Room service was also good. Concierge very helpfull and friendly staff throughout hotel.
Even tho its a wee bit out of the way, I would have no hesitation to stay here again.",4,2008,07,14
122,Wyndam Grand - a little chic a little shabby,"I cannot deny that this hotel is somewhat fabulous.  It is lovely and grand, and maybe a little swanky you could say.

I was extremely disappointed to enter a room that we had booked for 3 people to find not three but two beds.  The solution for the front desk staff was to give us a cot... a cot.  I cannot believe that with the price tag of the hotel their solution was a cot, I was somewhat disgusted.  Very disappointing.  Based on this I would not stay there, nor would I recommend others to stay there.  I found the front desk staff weary, and blase.  When we were checking in there was another lady trying to fight room charges that had been placed on her tab, without her using such services - not a good first impression.

On a positive note. The rooms really were lovely and spacious.  The bathroom was a huge and fabulous, with an eye for detail and luxury.  I LOVED the products they used in the washroom, sheer heaven.  The beds were super comfy and clean - didn't feel hotel like at all. Really crisp linens and lofty duvets.  The 'rooms' were also clean, and probably more than  I could ask for in terms of luxury.

The concierge staff and the cleaning staff were fantastic and accomodating!   They were a pleasure to deal with.  They brought up the cot almost immediately and set it up efficiently.

My one other complaint was that in the morning I went down to get a coffee from the 'bar'.  The staff member there was less than communicative.  Did a million other tasks while making my making my coffee.  Gave me the wrong drink.  Then set about making it right, but still walked away and chatted with others while making it. So, I sat down to wait for my drink.  Then, the waitress brought me my tall/small coffee and it was 5 pounds.  5 pounds because I had decided to sit down while waiting (being pregnant and all) forever... and they charged me the stay in rate.  Some of the worst service I have ever encountered.

So, although I ultimately enjoyed my stay because I wasn't the one stuck in a cot, I was generally disappointed with the fact that they put one of us in that situation.  The disappointing staff did not make up for the loveliness of the rooms.",2,2008,07,05
122,Great room but staff need to learn English,"We got a bargain on booking a room here through laterooms.com. We were celebrating and wanted to spend the night in a plush hotel. The room was great, it was like two interconnecting rooms. One had a large sitting area with a sofa bed, kitchen area, large balcony and a flat screen TV and it's own toilet. The other had a double bed, great big bathroom and a flat screen tv. The view from the balcony was amazing. I would give the room 5/5 as it was huge! There was even a full ice bucket in the brilliant kitchen area.

On the downside, breakfast was not included in the rate. We didn't bother paying for it seperately but went to a cafe instead. We did have a room service dinner in the hotel which was really nice. The food was delicious. The lady who brought the food to us wasn't suitably dressed for a plush hotel though. She was wearing a very short mini skirt and really high stillettos and it made us wonder what her other job might be. Like most of the staff there she was from Eastern Europe. This wouldn't be a problem but the staff we encountered couldn't speak  English very well at all. This includes the staff on the front desk.

The other negative point was that we were woken at 8 a.m. by housekeeping wanting to clean our room. She banged loudly on our door 3 times, waking our baby and ruining our lie in. When we called the front desk to complain they said that she was just checking to see if  the room was empty. Apparently they dont have a computer system that can tell which rooms are occupied. We found this unprofessional and for that reason we can only rate this hotel 4/5.",4,2008,06,22
122,"Great location, a bit dated","I stayed 2 nights in june. Its a great hotel, a bit too far from most tourist attractions, but very quiet and stunning views from the balcony.  However, the bathroom ceiling was falling down, and the room could have been a lot cleaner. The carpet had a musty smell, and it was a super expensive place to stay.",3,2008,06,16
122,Plush rooms,"This hotel was AMAZING and we loved it! We have previuosly stayed in a few central London hotels and paid the same sort of price for nothing like the same luxury.  I stayed for just one night with my daughter, who was attending an audition less than ten minutes walk away.  There were TWO wide screen tvs, one in the sitting room and one in the bedroom.  There was also a bathroom AND a cloakroom.  We did not have a harbour view but we were near to two huge glass domes, plus the courtyard, so the view was not bad at all.  We did not eat at the hotel apart from the room bar but we did go to the indoor pool.  This was beautiful and clean and there was only one other person swimming.  My daughter would like to go back and have a proper weekend here, which we will probably do some time.  This hotel IS near the Chelsea ground and I do not think the nearest tube is far away.  But, If you can afford to stay here for a holiday why not travel in a cab? We got a cab back to Victoria and I think it was only about £12.",5,2008,06,07
122,wyndham hotel,"This hotel is excellent, spotlessly clean, wonderfully comfortable bed. lovely views from the balcony, which we paid extra for. We upgraded the breakfast, to a full english, which was delivered to our room. it was rather pricey, but well cooked and plentiful. This stay at the hotel was a surprise for my 28 year old wifes birthday, and she fell in love with it and did not want to leave. There were only two down sides to it, and neither would stop me going again.Many of the staff did not speak english, so it was sometimes difficult to make yourself understood, and secondly it was a very long walk from the nearest station. After having walked from the station to the hotel, then we went out in the evening, we walked back to the station, on our return at night we caught a cab, and when we left next day we got a cab, this could prove costly, if you stayed longer than a weekend, so ladies, comfortable shoes, the walk really is a long way, so would suggest maybe the hotel should think of running a courtesy bus from the station at certain times. Otherwise this is a lovely place to stay.",5,2008,05,05
122,"Nice room, but poor (and overly expensive) breakfast","The room/suite was excellent, and we enjoyed the leisure faciliities. The front desk and concierge were very helpful. The quality of the cooked breakfast, though, was disappointing (especially for a hotel of this star rating); in addition, the restaurant staff were unclear over what was included in the room rate paid, which caused more confusion than should have been necessary. Overall, a very comfortable hotel, but the experience was undermined by the breakfast, both in terms of quality and service.",4,2008,04,22
122,Allright,"I spent four days at the Wyndham and I had a pleasant stay. The hotel is a bit of a walk from anything, but King's Road is a few minutes away and has lots of nice cafe's and a little further up in Fulham you got plenty of nightclubs etc which are a cheap cabride away. But, there is no shops right around the hotel for quick fix stuff like bottle of water, papers etc.

The rooms are nice and large as are the balconies. The bathroom, by british standards, is very spacious and has the usual toiletries. The room's (suite) are nicely laid out with a wall separating the bedoom area, which also has it's own tv.

There's a direct elevator that you can take to the spa using your room key, but I sadly didn't have time to take advantage of the swimming pool.

The room service menu is varied and the burgers and breakfast were really excellent and the service was very fast. The only annoying thing was that after every time you used room service, you'd get a call from reception asking if everything was fine. I can appreciate this, but after a few times, it get's a bit old.",3,2008,04,07
122,Wyndham Grand - Chelsea Harbour,"Loved it and would go back again. However,  It just seems very expensive for the location as it is definitely in the midst of nowhere unless you need to visit the design centre at Chelsea Harbour. Although it is now the Wyndham the taxis only seem to know it still as the Conrad. !!!",5,2008,03,16
122,Excellent Accommodation & Cuisine,"I'll mention the only drawbacks first, to get them out of the way, because that is how I felt when I stayed here. So much is excellent that it is easy to overlook the odd negative and just enjoy everything else.

Location - yes, it is a little out of the way for central London access. It is also not particularly close to the nearest underground station (Fulham Broadway, 10 minutes walk). You just need to decide if that extra time & expense to reach your hotel is worth paying to benefit from all the positives this place has to offer. However, on the positive side, the neighbourhood is one you feel you can walk through safely at night.

Cost - my company paid for this trip, so I cannot comment on value for money, as I don't know what rate they paid. However, we did sign for our own breakfasts, and it was over £20 for a continental breakfast. Curiously, the full English breakfast (including the full continental buffet too) was only a couple of £'s more, so was better value.

You have probably read in the other reviews about this all-suite hotel and the high quality of its rooms. I note one reviewer was quite negative about the non-harbour-facing rooms, but I had no issue at all with mine. Yes, there were train tracks to look at (and a whole lot of other buildings - this is London!) but there was no problem with noise at all (trains or road or planes).

One little tip - join the Wyndham ByRequest programme before you stay. Although the site states that you will only receive the ""little extras"" after 3 nights, I found my free welcome drinks waiting for me on day 1 of my 2 night stay.

One very big pleasant surprise was the quality of the cuisine. I stay at several good quality hotels on business, where we have conferences or meetings on site and invariably have lunch at the hotel. I am pleased to say this hotel surpassed ALL others I have stayed at in terms of the quality of its lunch. It was quite simply superb.

Service was excellent throughout my stay, with a great attitude shown by all the staff I encountered. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble, so don't be afraid to ask if you need to.

I'll be back!",5,2008,02,16
122,One of the best hotels I have seen in a while!,"I recently had the pleasure of visting The Wyndham for business and was throughly impressed.  The hotels houses all suites and 6 stunning penthouses.  All rooms are modern and to a very high standard.

I ate in the restaurant for lunch and had the buffet which was high quality and for a buffet was hot and very tasty!  The staff were all very attentive and polite.

There is a lovely area off the restaurant/bar for sitting outside which I am sure would be excellent in the summer for drinks over looking the harbour.

Overall I would definaltey go back here for a weekends stay.",5,2007,12,11
122,Excellent property in a (somewhat) inconvenient location,"This is a great hotel, with nice suites and lavish decorations. The location, on Chelsea Harbor, is pretty, but a long way from London's sites. The rooms are easily twice the size of anything else I've seen in London and are an excellent value as well. You will not be disappointed by this top-shelf property.",5,2007,11,28
122,Very Nice,"I stayed in this hotel for a week on a work conference. The rooms were great as it's an all suite hotel. The quality of the food was also very high.

I would recommend this hotel for business travellers.",4,2007,09,24
122,Not a change for the better,"I have stayed at this hotel 4 to 5 times a year for the past 18 years or so. Recently it changed from a Conrad to a Wyndham property.

If you are looking for a good central London location this hotel does not meet that criteria. It’s located in the Chelsea Harbor area and a cab ride to Knightsbridge is UKP 10 and Piccadilly Circus UKP 14, more if there is heavy traffic as there usually is. At one time the rack rates, given the standard of the hotel, made sense with its suite accommodations and services but the rates have recently increased dramatically so that it is possible to find a 5 star hotel with a more central location, if one also takes the cab fares into consideration, at a lower rate.

I can only recommend the Marina view rooms with balconies which have odd numbered rooms and definitely not the non Marina view rooms that back onto rail tracks. The hotel is also located under the Heathrow flight path where an aircraft passes overhead every 90 seconds from 5am to 11pm if the winds are blowing from the west as they normally are.

Services within the hotel are expensive, room service $10 for a pot of tea, $20 for a laundered shirt. Very few places to dine in the area, a pub and a couple of expensive restaurants, otherwise its a cab ride. 

The Concierge team are excellent and go out of their way to help, good contacts for show tickets

Housekeeping has recently improved, some renovations are needed however, phone system, new TV’s.

All that said I like the hotel, the views of the Marina and the River Thames are calming in busy London, the air conditioning is excellent so for business trips it worked for me for many years but it seems they are pricing themselves out of the market.
",4,2007,07,16
122,"conrad-wyndham, great hotel whatever the name","I stayed at this hotel with my 5 year old son in June 2007.  

The Conrad had just changed hands at the time of my stay and has become a Wyndham resort.  I don't know what changes this will bring, but there were people walking about with clipboards looking at some of the more worn features, like the pool tiles.  So hopefully there will be positive changes.  

Even without any changes though, the hotel is great.  It is built around Chelsea Harbour and in design and feel it reminds me strongly of staying in a hotel on Sydney Harbour in Australia.  It is modern, light and airy and each suite has big windows and a balcony with two chairs and a small table.  The suites are two defined rooms, both with windows, which is very good for a family.  The TV's (one in bedroom, one in sitting room) are large and there are some sky tv channels.  The beds were very comfortable with crisp white cotton sheets and feather duvets and pillows.  We had two good size single beds.

The bathroom was huge and had a great power shower, a seperate bath and a toilet with another door.  Toiletries okay, smelled fresh and citrussy.

We had room service dinner; very good, as was breakfast in the restaurant.  All the staff were extremely nice and professional at all times.

This hotel is not particularly central or well served by public transport.  It does not have that classic ""Mary Poppins"" rooftop view of London.   There is a good jazz club locally, a few restaurants within the development, a few gastro pubs nearby and the Lots road auction house.  The Chelsea Harbour development is a destination for interior designers and is amazing if you are interested in design, fabrics etc.  A slightly longer walk would take you to more good eating/shopping places and would be pleasant in the summer.  

I have stayed more centally in London and have left feeling a bit grubby and exhausted by the constant noise, small rooms, indifferent staff etc.  Cental London can also be very impersonal.  It is nice to feel that you are in a real neighbourhood where people actually live and go out in the evening for a drink etc.  This hotel is really a refuge from the city in some ways, while being only a 5 minute (£10) taxi ride from many places you would like to be, ie knightsbridge, kings road...

I really enjoyed my one night stay at this hotel and left feeling rested and like I had had a holiday.  My son adored everything about it, especially the pool.  The best things were the staff and the quiet, peaceful rooms with that great outlook onto the harbour.  Also the rate that we had through lastminute.com was very reasonable for london.  I heard some other guests had used priceline.

122,Conrad - worth staying here,"We recently returned from our visit to London.  The Conrad Hilton was a highlight and so classy.  We loved the 2 room suite hotel.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from front desk to conceirge to waitstaff.  Everyone was very efficient.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  Toiletries were nice and the shower was the best we had all week.  Beds were most comfortable.  Other posts mentioned the Heathrow flight path, but we didn't seem to find this a problem inside the hotel.  The only drawback is the distance from London central - but the local bus #11 for 2 pounds each made it easy to get into London and get off as desired.  Food items were a bit pricey - but then so is most of London.  This is a first class operation and I would definately stay here again.
",5,2007,04,10
122,A Proper 5*,"I booked at the last minute using Hilton Honours points - we asked for a high floor room on the marina, but they were full.  Instead we were given a really great suite - 703.  The  view from the balcony was straight down the river to the London skyline.  Check in was prompt and very courteous.  The concierge parked my car without being asked - our luggage was brought up to the suite within 5 minutes.

The suite was excellent.  Gracious in style, large and well appointed.  Nice touch to have a second bathroom.  

Things about the room I liked:  two balcony's from both bedroom and living room; well designed, newly decorated; nice artwork on the walls, coffee station; great bathroom with full range of cosmetics and ameneties & a very powerful seperate shower; vase of flowers; great bed - very comfortable; very efficient and quiet aircon; TEAK CD system; big fluffy robes; amazing views across London.  

Not so great things about the room:  sofa was stained - should be replaced in a 5* hotel, or at least steam cleaned; TV's old and tired - one remote not working - get new ones guys.

Spa area is not the greatest - needs an upgrade.  Pool OK, but nothing special - sauna and changing areas average.  This is not a destination spa, but does have dedicated lift from geust floors.  

We ate in the Aquasia restaurant - very good meal and very reasonably priced - £125 for two including wine and cocktails, but the ambience of the dining room is very corporate Hilton and not Conrad or Four Seasons standards by any means, but the view across the Marina is good and the service was excellent.

Housekeeping is exemplary - extremely clean room and the turndown service is wonderful - ice bucket topped up, towels all replaces, bed remade and charming service.

Overall this does deserve its five star rating, but a four seasons it is not.  However, depsite being on the outskirts of central London, it is a delight to come back here after the busy city.

An excellent hotel, with negligable issues that deserves to be five star, but the Conrad chain from my experience, has a long way to go to match four seasons levels of quality and service.

122,Loved this place,"Stayed here with children over Easter and it was truely wonderful. last year at Easter i had to check out of the Dublin Hilton early this year in London you just wanted it to go on and on.
Location 5 mins walk from Kings Rd Chelsea, easy bus ride to Victoria or Harrods,
15 mins walk or £5 in a taxi to Fulham Broadway tube station,
2 mins walk to water taxi to Westminister,
yet far from the crowds of London easy to relax in lovely pool area with sauna and steam rooms, take a walk around the harbour, enjoy a drink in the bar or for a less expensive drink a local pub 200yrds away.
the rooms are huge, we had Harbour view, private balcony,living room with pull out sofa bed, work desk, seperate toilet,  a bedroom with dressing area, full bathroom, loads of luxury items, nightly turn down service with bottles of water left and a range of cleaning products for your shoes etc.
buffet breakfast which as gold h/honours was included for free was wonderful, fruits, cereal, salmon, fresh baked breads etc etc etc.
free internet in the business centre.
staff very helpful
overall a luxury hotel. only complaint drinks a bit pricey but you dont have to buy them  and everything else more than made up for that 
well done Hilton

122,Great Rooms but watch out for the odd numbers!,"I booked this hotel through Asia rooms.com and got a fantastic rate for 2 rooms. My colleague and I stayed 2 nights on business.

Rooms: All suite hotel, spotlessly clean, great seating area and even has a cloakroom as well as the toilet in the bathroom, very comfy beds, great bathroom with a bath and separate power shower, again very clean. 

Staff: Reception helpful and polite, concierge also friendly. However we were both very surprised to find the restaurant allows smoking anywhere which spoilt my breakfast and when I complained about it and asked to be moved away from the smokers I was met with indifference, like it was my fault for not smoking! Shame, as the restaurant has a lovely view overlooking the harbour.

Location: Away from central London, so quite different from say staying in Mayfair or Knightsbridge, but Kings Road is a stones throw away.

I have one big moan and that is if you get stuck with a room with odd numbers, i.e. we were in 419 and 421 you won't get much sleep! I had the worse 2 nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel. There is a railway line very close to one side of the hotel  and it kept me awake at night and woke me up at 4am in the morning. Also the hotel is under the Heathrow flight path as well! 
I mentioned to reception on checkout about the trains - yes I should have done it earlier - and they told me that the hotel was half empty and they could have moved us. I was quite annoyed by this as if that was the case, why did they put us in those rooms in the first place? The other side would be much quieter.

I would stay there again, however would ask for a room away from the train side.

122,"Great rooms, not so great location","Got this hotel on priceline for £125 per room per night including taxes etc (bid £105 per night, but the above was the cost including taxes).

Positives:  Lovely rooms - this is an all suite hotel, so all rooms have a lounge, hall and bedroom.  Great service - staff here all seemed very friendly.  Concierge - great for booking theatre tickets at the last minute and saved us a lot of time.  Great bathrooms with powerful showers.  Nice restaurant overlooking the harbour.  Room service breakfast was very good.  Nearby King's Road has some great shops and restaurants.

Negatives:  Booking through priceline won't get you the best room available - we booked two interconnecting rooms, and both were either side of the lifts, so a bit noisy.  Prices for food etc extremely high - eg, breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children in room - £99, bottle of coke from mini bar £3.50, dinner for 2 adults and 2 children, including a relatively cheap bottle of wine - £250.  A bit out of the centre of London, and nearest tube is 20 minutes walk - so taxi costs can quickly add up.  Only one restaurant - no cafes even - would have expected more dining options in a five star hotel.  Noise was an issue - the hotel seems to be below a flight path, and we were woken by planes during the night.

Would we stay there again?  Probably in the Summer (the location would be very pretty in the summer), if we wanted to visit that area of London, and could get another great deal, but we would think twice about staying there again primarily to visit central London attractions.

122,Great for Star Spotting !!,"The Conrad is still a very classy hotel, despite the fact that the rooms (whilst still very nice and in my opinion still 5 star) are a little more traditional than some of the swanky newer hotels. i.e The rooms do not have flat screen TV's or DVD players. The bathrooms also look a little tired compared to some of the more recent hotels. That said it is a great hotel and is one of the places where you are guaranteed to see famous faces !
",4,2006,12,07
122,Absolutely fantastic-will definitely return,"Loved this hotel.  I have stayed at a number of 5 star hotels and service was by far the best I've ever encountered here.  Staff couldn't do enough for us and made us feel very welcome.  Staff at 5 star hotels are often strangely very snooty but there wasn't a sniff of this at the Conrad.  

Room was quite simply 'wow'.  Huge with various areas and rooms and a large balcony with breathtaking views of London.  We could see the London Eye, Battersea Power Station etc. from our balcony  plus our room overlooked Chelsea Harbour, which looks lovely at night when it's all lit up.  Masses of space, big bathroom, pleasant decor and spotlessly clean.  Loved the little touches in the bathroom like having nail scissors, nail clippers which you don't usually get.  

Chelsea is a lovely base.  It's not in central London but it's worth coming slightly out of the centre for the peace & quiet and pleasant surroundings at Chelsea Harbour plus shopping and eating out is great around the Kings Road.  There is also a regular water taxi right by the hotel which will drop you into central London within 10 minutes.

Food is excellent although maybe a little overpriced but couldn't fault the quality of the food or service.

We will definitely be returning and can't wait for our next visit.

122,Not 5 star...,"I stayed at the Conrad in a marine view suite on the first weekend of November 06. 
I arrived by car and used the valet parking at the hotel. This was handled superbly and efficiently. I then went to reception and booked in. The room wasn't ready so we had a drink in the Aquaisa bar and about twenty mins later a member of staff arrived with the room key to say our room was ready. The bar is modern and light with views over the marina. It's a nice place to sit and have a drink but nothing special, and I didn't feel I wanted to spend much time here.
The suite looked nice and modern as we entered and the balcony was directly over the marina as described. It is furnished in a modern but slightly bland way, so as not to offend any tastes. At first sight it is pleasant, but after an hour or two it all becomes rather boring. There is nothing distinctive about the rooms and even the view is not as good as we expected, blocked by buildings. After a while it starts to become clear why you can get one of the suites quite cheaply for London. they are furnished cheaply and even the TV's are bargain basement with terrible picture quality. AKAI? they need to sort this out asap.
I had a look at the health club and the gym was adequate and so was the swimming pool. The entrance up to this area needs to be sorted out though. It's tired and tatty, with black masking tape covering splits and cracks on the stairs. Not good enough for 5 star.
The staff are excellent in the hotel and everyone I encountered was extremely professional and nothing was too much trouble.
Overall, the hotel is good and you won't find anything major to complain about. But is that all you get for a 5 star? I would say it falls short.
As other reviewers have commented on...the location is not good to explore London. We spent a fortune on taxis to restaurants and attractions. You can get a tube but it's not always convenient to do this and it's a fifteen minute walk for most people.
A decent hotel but I wouldn't stay again.",4,2006,11,06
122,5 star hotel 3 star service,"I loved the  hotel, the room was fabulous but I was a bit disappointed by the lacklustre service from the waiters at breakfast and I waited on the phone for 6 minutes(timed) waiting for housekeeping to pick up the phone, although they did redeem themselves by responding promptly to my request. Breakfast buffet turned out to be very 3 star, I expected so much more not only in quality but also in variety. Overall The Conrad did not meet my expectations of a 5 star.
",3,2006,10,27
122,Thoroughly Enjoyed Our Stay,"This hotel deserves it 5 star rating.  We were able to check-in right away (we're silver members).  Found that the views were fantastic.  The staff was great.  The concierge was very helpful in directing us to the nearest underground, Fulham Broadway.  Though, I found that taking the bus to the hotel was much better.  You can map out directions using the London journey planner:

http://journeyplanner.tfl.gov.uk/user/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en

The hotel was quiet.  The room was clean and big.  Two bathrooms, a guest bathroom and the master bathroom.  A living room with a sliding door to the balcony.  There was a separate small room for the closet and an area to iron your clothes.   Evening  turn down service.  The hotel provided complimentary slippers and complimentary shoe shine service in a beautiful wooden box for presentation.  

At breakfast, the service was impeccable.  We were asked if they was anything we needed.  Our stay did not include breakfast.  As you might expect at any hotel, the breakfast was a bit pricey.  

The hotel is situated away from the noise and the traffic of London, ideal for peace and quiet.

122,loved the conrad,"my husband i just returned from a 6 night stay at the conrad london.  we loved the neighborhood (chelsea)--lots of  shops and restaurants.  some of the best restaurants in the city are located there.  The rooms were very large and are all suites.  All rooms also have nice sized balconies.  We never tried the restaurant, but the lounge was nice to relax in.  Internet was free 24 hours a day in the business center.  Though i saw another post said it was like $40 a day(?).  The only slight negatives were it was a little bit from the city center, and there is no hilton honors lounge to relax in (my husband is a diamond member--so we like this perk when available).  We were spending our anniversary at the hotel so asked the conceirge for some recommendations.  Initally they gave us a recommendation that received very negative reviews from the london dining guide (which they had us borrow), next they suggested benihana, but came through with a reservation at an amazing restaurant in the neighborhood (aubergine).  I would stay here again next time in london, however, would also consider staying a bit closer to downtown.
",5,2006,07,10
122,Very good hotel,"We picked the Conrad after personal recommendations as well as reviews here on TripAdvisor. Upon arrival we were informed that we were being upgraded to a corner suite on the harbour side of the hotel, which was superb with the private lounge separate from the bathroom & bedroom. We had an excellent view toward London as well as scenic view to the river. Wanting a romantic break, the hotel is great and very accomodating for gues requests. We had a very nice tapas style meal in the downstairs bar, where a loverly jazz pianist was playing and it was GREAT. The pillows on the beds are amazingly comffortable, the room very quiet, and I would definitely stay there again when back to the UK from Australia. The only negative, which we passed onto the staff at checkout was that the hallway doors need some felt padding to make them closing a bit more quiet. PERFECT location for that romantic getaway!!
",5,2006,05,17
122,perfect and quiet,"Decided on the Conrad Hilton i nChelsea, since I had to do business in Chelsea. According to reviews it is way out, which i did not find at all. It is only a short stroll to king´s road with shops and restaurants and a 10 minute bus ride to the center. The hotel is extremely nice with its 2 rooms/suite line-up. I had a corner suite with windows into the harbour and onto the side and I felt like being on an island vacation. Room service is great, people are nice and it does not hurt, that it is a chosen place to stay for celebrities, you bump into all the time. I would definitely stay there again and make it my hotel in London

122,"Good but not 5 star, out of the way neighborhood","I am diamond hilton honors member and was staying here recently on points.  The rooms are nicely setup and in good condition.  

The public areas are a mishmash of various styles and sorely need modernization.

The gym is pretty good but inconveniently located.

Internet pricing is outrageously expensive (almost $40 per day)

Staff are pretty uniformly pleasant but concierge was a disaster, did not return calls, could not order tickets etc.

Overall pretty nice hotel, not really 5 stars and definitely somewhat out of the way in a very quite area.
",3,2006,04,19
122,pretty good,"One of the better hotels I have ever stayed in (I was there for 7 days). The staff was fine, they actually take the time to take care of you. The rooms are really nice and there is a lot of space. Bathrooms are very clean and very nice, although the price is waaaay too much, services are also a bit expensive (they did my laundry but it cost an arm and a leg). But you get what you pay for, you're in chelsea (nice area) and not too far from central london. The nearest tube stop is Fulham Broadway and it's about a 10-15 minute walk. The night life is ok, there are a few places to go, but it doesn't compare to central london. If you got the money to spend then stay here (if you don't mind the walk to the tube, but you can always take the bus there). I'd go back if I had the money.
",4,2006,04,02
122,FANTASTIC!!!,"As a frequent business traveler in the U.S., I frequent Hilton chain properties.  I used a hotel reward for this stay and it was fabulous.  The staff are the best, from the front desk, wait staff, doorman, they were all very welcoming and most accomodating.  This was our family's first visit to the UK and we had enjoyed it immensely. Our room was overlooking Chelsea Harbour and the Thames with distance city lights view.  The two room suite with pullout sofa was ideal for my high school daughter with her own TV, stereo and bath.  We spent six very restful nights, the king bed was very comfortable and the master bath was super.  My daughter didn't give the sofa bed high marks due since it was uncomfortable because it was uneven in the middle but she managed to sleep at one end and it worked out fine. Before heading to the Conrad London, I read most of the TA reviews which were very helpful regarding getting to the Tube and local restaurants. After having such a nice stay, I'm puzzled as to why other reviewers weren't as satisfied.  Sure, prices are high for everything in London compared to the States and the Conrad is no different.  But after having a few weeks to let the experience of London sink in, I can't wait to go back. It was worth every penny, or should I say pound.  We bought a travel card upon our arrival and used the bus and tube to go everywhere.  The trusty C3 bus line to Earl's Court tube station worked out very well although a little slow during rush hour traffic.  I strongly recommend the crisps in the lounge (they're addicting) of course with an evening cocktail or draft.  The bar menu was very handy as well with a nice assortment of appetizers, fish & chips and burgers.  Lots Road Pub up the street also was fun to get a taste of the local scene.  I wouldn't have second thoughts about a return visit to the Conrad London...Definitely 5 Star treatment.

122,Who needs Buckingham Palace?,"We had just completed a tour of Ireland and planned a four day whirlwind tour of London before heading home.  I'm embarrassed to say it, but we got a great deal on the Conrad via Priceline AND I was a bit concerned about how we'd be welcomed when checking in at that rate.....how wrong to worry!

From the moment we arrived, until the moment we departed, we were treated as thought we were the most important people at the hotel.  Check in was easy, the staff were gracious, and the bellmen had our bags to us within moments.  Our room as beautiful, overlooking the harbor - and those pillows!! Wow.  The best.  I wish I could find them at home!  

While some reviewers complain about being ""far away"" from the action, we felt SO comfortable upon returning home to the tranquility of the place each night that we'd stay here in a New York minute next time we come to London.  You can have the crazy traffic and people rushing about for only so long, then this retreat serves to rejuvenate you for another day with the crowds.  WONDERFUL!
",5,2006,03,28
122,Chelsea Conrad - check the bill,"Firstly the hotel is very nice.  I just think that 5 stars is pushing it - 4* deluxe maybe.

The hotel is a good way out and should really be called Conrad Chelsea.

The Rooms are suites.  As a Hilton Hhonors Gold member, they upgraded both of my rooms to face the marina and gave me 2 breakfasts which was nice.  I liked the nice touch of frout cake in my room which I think was another Gold perk as the other room didn't get them.  Robes but no slippers.

On leaving, the consierge gave me bad advice on how to get to kings cross - I explained that I was usless and would a taxi be the best option - he sounded shocked and gave me a lond list of tubes and busses - It wasn't as if i look like im short of cash and I was staying at a 5* hotel but he said it would be best - I went in the taxi anyway on the taxi drivers advice (i know that he would say that) and it was only £20 and no big trouble.

Anyway - its true - the hotel do charge for everything and charge a lot for everything.  On checking out I checked the bill - there was a lunch that had been charged but I assumed it was on of my sisters that were staying in the other room however when I mentioned it to them, they had not had any food and the hotel had got it wrong.  The hotel did eventually credit it back however they did have a suspisious tone to their voice when doing it... as if I was trying to rob them of a £50 lunch which was probably only a prawn sandwich and a bag of chrisps!

Overall, if you need to be in Chelsea or away from it all then this is the place to be.

122,Conrad London a fine hotel,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Conrad for four nights in January 2006.  I chose the hotel for its large suites and location in Chelsea.  I was quite surprised at the value for money when booking one of their special rates.  I paid £145 a night which is a decent price for a 5-star hotel in London, but when you consider that you're getting a 2-room suite with massive bathroom the deal seems even sweeter.  Some have mentioned the fact that the hotel is a bit out of the way -- while that is somewhat true, Fulham Broadway tube is just a 15 minute walk and there is a bus which serves the hotel as well.  All in all, it's well worth checking out the Conrad if you get the opportunity.
",5,2006,01,18
122,Continued Greatness,"I have stayed at the Conrad over well over 20 times now in the past few years when visiting London, I have also left a few reviews on here and feel obliged to do so again after my last visit, this hotel hasn't let me down once in all of those times, i am slightly biased as the service i recieve has a established HH member is always that little bit better, however service aside the rooms are always fantastic, quiet, clean, spacious, comfortable and with great views, you'll be looking hard to find a bad room in this hotel, the penthouses are very large and very extravagent, however the standard rooms are so good that i couldn't give a good argument as to why one or two people staying would need to upgrade, unless you are Bono.

Yes it is out of the way, and yes the food/bar is pricey, but remember, it's too far to walk and too expensive for rif raf and tourists to go for a snoop around, privacy and comfort is what you pay for and get in abundance at this hotel.

With respect to other reviews, mentioning no tube station and poor bathroom condition, a new station is proposed within a minutes walk of the hotel and is awaiting approval, and Fullham Broadway is a 10 min walk or £3 taxi ride. And if you want to see what a grubby shower really looks like check out the Sheraton on Park Lane.

122,"a little secluded, but worth the distance","My 2 teenagers and I stayed at one of the suites of the Conrad.  I have to say it was one of the most comfortable and luxurious accomodations I have ever been in.  My son stayed in the front room and enjoyed the television and 1/2 bath all to himself whereas my daughter and I stayed in the bedroom with twin beds.  Our room faced the Marina and it was so relaxing to look out and see the view everytime I stepped into the room. 
On the Second floor of the hotel in the business center, I was able to use the internet, free of charge, hence checked my e-mails and connected with my husband daily.  My kids were so impressed with the room that we had room service several times during our 7 days stay.
If money is not an issue, this is definitely the hotel to stay in.

122,"A great hotel, but very secluded","We've stayed at the Conrad over several Christmases and had a wonderful time every time. It's a wonderful hotel for families, since rooms are all suites, and quite comfortable. Harbour views are spectacular. Staff has always been accomodating, especially those working on the holidays. We spent an Xmas day there and my son, then 10, was given a special gift of a teddy bear from Harrods. We were given champagne, chocolates and a lovely silver pen. there was also a special cocktail reception in the bar with free canapes and champagne. Health club is certainly European: but no one should ever expect the Sports Club in Europe. A pool is a rarity and this one was lovely. It's biggest drawback is the location: we took cabs everywhere, which easily added 50-70 pounds on each days stay: it's not an easy place to go back to for a quick rest or change. If it were more centrally located, I'd never stay anywhere else. We've switched to Claridges in recent years because it's more centrally located.

122,Hotel Nice but breakfast highway robbery,"After a long trans-alantic flight we found the hotle with no problem.  We arrived around 10:00 am, the front desk staff had trouble find our reservations, good thing I had my confirmation number with me.  Since it was early our room was not ready, Birttiany (who was wounderful) indicated that she had a second floor room, but it due to the workmen it was very noisy or we could have a 7th floor room overlooking the shops.  We choose the 7th floor room, Bittiany called housekeeping and put a rush on getting our room ready. 

First problem - we sat down to wait in the lobby after a few minutes I went back up the the front desk to ask if there was any place to get a cup of coffee and a light brakfast.  The gentleman indicated that since we were waiting on our room we could enjoy brunch in the dinning room.  I had a cup of coffee and glass of jusice and a piece of toast, my husband had a glass of juice, a scoop of runny eggs, a piece of bacon.  We recieved a bill in the mail when we got home for $60 for a horrible breakfast.  After waiting ~ a hour for our room my husband went back to the front desk to check on our room, the young girl indicated that we did not have a reservation and that our room was not being prepared.  Once again I had to go back with my confirmation number and even give her the room number that we had been assigned before she could locate our reservations.  Once Brittiany was back at the fron desk everything went fine, she even took us to our room to make sure everything was fine and even brought ice back to our room.  

The Bellhop to get our luggage was very slow. 

Room itself was very nice, bathroom was good, very clean, bed was big (great pillows!) and the sitting room was wounderful.

Second problem - Since a rush was put on cleaning the room the mini bar was not restocked from the previous guest - you guessed it I recieved another bill in the mail for $40 in mini bar expenses that I never used.  We call and complained regarding the breakfast and mini bar expenses.  The hotel did credit us for the mini bar but have not done so for the breakfast.
 
Proximity to anything is its worst feature, nearest tube... there isn't. The C3 bus stops outside but takes forever to get anywhere. Kings road is quite a walk, bits worth seeing are a long walk.  We bought a three day travel pass which saved us alot of money.  It was still difficult to get around and we found the bus drivers to be rude and unhelpful.

The concierge was of no help when we asked about sightseeing in London or where to eat.

Lots Road Pub right down the street did have wounderful food, but here is another hidden gem.  666 jazz cafe, it is located at 666 Lots road (just down from Lot Road Pub).  This Jazz cafe is located in the basement and provides live music and wounderful food at fairly reasonable prices.",2,2005,09,26
122,"Nice hotel, shame about the staff","A previous reviewer was correct about the photos. Unless you have a harbour view room the views are basically awful.

I overlooked onto a terrace that was in the middle of being retiled. It amused me to see that they have a table and chairs out there but who wants to see workmen bending over and yelling at eachother? Even if the place was re-tiled the view was an office block.

The reception staff are the most incompetent, unfriendly people I have ever met in my life. It is disgusting that such people even work in the hospitality industry. We did not even get a smile from the receptionist even when we said hello. 

Waited 1 hour for a room even though it was past check in time with no apology. The concierge lost my bags and I can't even believe I went into the bar at over £5 for bottled beer and don't even get me started on the prices for a salad.

I actually hope that the hotel reads trip advisor so that they can see just how wrong they were in employing their reception staff. I was very close to asking one of them just why she was working in this industry when she could not even provide a smile to guests paying over £200 a night. 

Bedrooms are great though. Housekeeping are very good and the rooms are spotless. We had a large suite with two bathrooms and good sixed lounge. The pillows are amazing and the bed is the most comfortable one I have ever found in a hotel. Be aware that there are no tube stations nearby and you will pay £28 for Kings Cross.

I would stay here again as the rooms are very nice BUT I won't hold back my thoughts on the reception staff if they have not changed their attitudes! Management should be aware of this.

122,Dont bother,"Directions to the hotel were fine, found it no problem, rolled up at the entrance and was ignored by a rather scruffy doorman who finally finished his conversation and took my car away. 

Hotel is in a nice position over looking the marina and the bar and restaurant are very nice on a sunny day. However... the view they don't show you on the web site is the one we had from our room of waste lands, building sites and worst of all a very close and noisy railway line! If you stop here make sure you get a harbour view because the rest stinks.

Room itself was very nice, bathroom was good, very clean, bed was big (great pillows!) Well styled but not exactly... no expense spared. Proximity to anything is its worst feature, taxi to trafalgar square is £15-£20 each way, nearest tube... there isn't. Bus stops outside but takes forever to get anywhere. OK the Kings road is very close but the Kings road is very long and the bits worth seeing are a long walk.

Continental breakfast is rubbish, OJ and toast is about it, have had a lot better in much lower class establishments. Watch out for the extras £24 per day car parking, mini bar resembled Dick Turpin... £3 for a bag of crisps!

My advise, spend the £35 a day taxi fare on something in the centre with a bit of class.

122,Mixed Bag,"When I checked in for my reservation of a Marina view suite I was allocated a 2nd floor room which is level with the roof of the public area. It was not a good location and there were workmen re-tiling the roof outside my balcony. I asked for another room and was told nothing was available. I said that we would not be able to stay and was promptly allocated an excellent Marina view suite on the seventh floor!! 

Due to the bad report of an earlier reviewer (the one with the photos of the bathroom), I had to check this out. The sealing around the shower heads and everywhere else in the bathrooms of both rooms had all been recently replaced, so I can only assume the management must read Trip Advisor!!

My room was a large King suite with a very calming view of the Thames and the marina. It is most unlike any other location in London and I did enjoy the views from the balcony...It was a great spot to entertain friends. The down side is that it is isolated and taxis are mandatory. In summer you can walk to the cafes on Kings Road and a little futher to Fulham road, but this is not the place to stay if you want to be in the heart of the action.

Three major complaints...The broadband internet connection is far too expensive at GBP24 per day. It is also very unstable and slow. 

I would agree with the previous reviewer that the cheap Akai TV's are from another era. They are not want you expect in a five star property. 

The other issue is the gym, which was a major disappointment. It seems to be an afterthought with the cardio and weights rooms tucked away on different levels. The equipment is old and tired and there is too much jammed into the cardio room. There is only one television and no personal controls or headphones. The gym is NOT suitable for a five star hotel.

So in summary, if you are looking for a unique location on the river and some serious space in a suite, the Conrad is great. However, you will pay top dollar for an inferior Internet connection and have access to one of the worst gyms I have encountered in a five star hotel.

122,Can't wait to go to this hotel again.  Goldilocks found her perfect room.,"We were booked into this hotel because it was the only Hilton left this summer where we could use HHpoints and we didn't know what to expect.

Well, Goldilocks found her perfect room:  sunny in the day, dark and quiet at night, sheets like butter, comfy, but firm beds.  Marble bathroom with great water pressure.  A separate living room with fold -out bed for son and another television. Both televisions had many channels. What more could you want after sightseeing for hours?  I have never stayed in such a quiet, pleasing hotel.  After our free nights we stayed on for another 2 nights because we loved it so much.  We stayed 4 nights at another London hotel at the very beginning of our trip that was an older boutique hotel with lots of old London charm, but I'd trade the charm for the quiet room and nice sunlight of the Conrad.

The staff were so helpful and friendly and happy I wondered if they all just got raises in their paychecks.  My children LOVED the indoor swimming pool and we spent hours there after several days of sightseeing. 

The food in the restaurant was decent, but overpriced, although the service was impeccable. (Desserts were the best course).  Only downside: far from underground (20 min. walk) and far from shops, stores, markets.  There is a pub at the corner which won a gastronic award and had wonderful food.  However, they were so understaffed, had few tables, and closed to the public for one night due to a private party.  We had to literally beg to get any table and the service was slow.  However, it was the only food around for dinner outside of the hotel.  If you don't mind begging to get in and a long wait for your food and in between coursed, the food there is actually good.
There was a sandwich shop in the morning just down from the pub and they couldn't have been more accomodating and less precious than the pub.

When we go to London we WILL stay in this hotel, regardless of where in London we will sightsee.  We can't wait to go back.  We have stayed in 4 star hotels all around the world and even though it doesn't have the charm of the older London hotels, the Conrad is just right for this Goldilocks in search of the perfect room.

122,Beautiful Stay,"Well, what can I say? We have been sent there by a businness partner for the night.. from the moment we entered the hotel, they make us feel like at home.. quick check in, very beautiful and spacious rooms (two bathroos, a living room with a big tv, a wonderfull bed)..

The service was ok, nothing to complain.. the bar was perfect to drink something in the night, with a lot of exellent wines..

Can I find something not perfect?? Yes.. the position in the city.. very quite but it is always a long taxi drive to go anywhere in London..

But.. if you have time and money, choose this hotel and you'll not be disapponted!",5,2005,07,28
122,Out of the way luxurious Hotel,"Conrad London is an all-suite hotel. So, if you like big rooms or suites, Conrad is great. I like the rooms, but I agree with the earlier writer than the TV could have been better. 

The location is at Chelsea Harbour and is quite a distance from the city center.  You need to take a bus (C3) to Earls Court, or if you are in the mood for walking (20 minutes), the nearest tube station is at Fulham Broadway, which is under Zone 2.  Overall, it takes around 20-30 minutes to get to the central area. Buying the travel card would be useful. A taxi ride to Waterloo International costs around STG18.

If you come with a family and appreciate the size, don't make too frequent trips back and from the hotel, this hotel is fine.  If you're alone, and want to be at the centre of the happening places, then other hotels that are more centrally located (which tends to have smaller rooms), might be better.
",4,2005,07,06
122,Conrad hotel--a little out of the way,"We just got back from staying 4 nights at the Conrad. The hotel is off on a harbour in Chelsea so if you want the hustle and bustle of downtown London you wont get it here. The rooms we had were very nice --large and very comforable. The food was way over priced so we ate elsewhere- the nearby Lots Road pub was very good. The big drawback was the commute to town for the attractions--an extra 15-20 minutes by bus or cab. I probably would not stay again because of the distance.
",4,2005,06,20
122,"Grubby room, poor service, 3* food, why bother?","Before I begin, we have stayed at several 5 star luxury hotels, including the Conrad hotels in Cairo, Istanbul & Brussels.  We also are Silver Hhonors cardholders.  So we are seasoned luxury hotel travellers.

This was by far the worst 5 star we have stayed in.  

When we rolled up with our luggage, we struggled through the doors while the doorman ignored/didn't even notice us - what was he there for?  The concierge didn't even tell us the local bus number from the hotel (it's the C3).  What was he there for?

The hotel directions were incorrect (""...take a right down Wadon Road..."", no such road exists in Chelsea!) so we got a little lost getting to the hotel.  When we advised check-in of their error, the guy got confused as he spoke poor English. When he realised the problem, he shrugged his shoulders.  Great attitude.

We reserved a Marina View suite 7 days in advance, but when we arrived reception said they were ""all taken"" - so we got a standard suite, overlooking some small mall & a bit of waste-ground.

Our door lock was faulty, working about 1 time in 5. Although the room was a good size (for London) & well insulated from the frequent aircraft noise above, the room was quite grubby, with ""greasy"" looking marks over many of the wood finishes.  The standard of decor & fitting were really below what one would expect, with mastic peeled off, mismatching wood & pictures askew.  Generally felt like a 3-star level.

Housekeeping was well below standard - they didn't even clean up the table or replace used glasses with new ones.  This ""luxury"" all- suite hotel had 2 cheapsville 20inch(?) Akai TV's and some channels had really poor reception.  Staff hadn't even set the bedside alarm clock to Summer Time (that was the last week in March guys - it's nearly June!) so it was 1 hour out. Am I being picky?  No, it's the attention to detail that we pay for in a 5 star place, overall this was lacking.

The bathroom was a shocker - how badly done can a 5 star place be? This bad!  I took a couple of pictures so you can see how  filthy  fittings are left for us to enjoy - typical of the environment.  Mouldy in some areas too!  The mastic was peeling off in the toilet - not attended to either.  The bathroom layout was badly designed, and small.

Next morning, Breakfast!  Hmmm, hungry after a hard night out?  We were! We were expecting the usual excellent spread, only to be told at the table that we were  entitled to a cold continental breakfast only & hot food would be extra! You have got to be kidding!  This was unbeleivable.  This hotel is over GBP170 (USD300) a night!  Breakfast choices were really poor for a top hotel.  One cheese choice? Two cold meats? Coffee was tasteless too.  The Sofitel London shows this place how breakfast should be done - perhaps Conrad management should pay a visit to learn something.
Also, the breakfast areas have inadequate ventilation, so even though we were in the non-smoking area, smoke from the smoking tables came through strongly.  I mentioned this to a member of staff, who agreed this was not good and that she had to put up with it everyday.

Coupled with the location (about 15 minutes drive from the city), this hotel has very little to offer the discerning traveller.  It's far, far below the standard for anyone who has 5 star pockets & expectations.  Do yourself a big favour, choose the Sofitel London instead as we have done - it's a much cleaner, friendlier, classier place and it's 2 minutes from Trafalgar Square too.  The Conrad London is in our opinion, bad news.
",1,2005,05,29
122,Luxurious but Friendly,"We've just returned from 4 nights at the Conrad, which included our wedding at Chelsea Old Town Hall.  I couldn't praise it highly enough.  Our 7th floor room had a fantastic view over the London skyline and the Marina.  The suite was gorgeous and very comfortable and clean.  A coffee maker and CD player were included, plus bathrobes, slippers and lovely toiletries.  The bed was huge and comfortable.  

Having a one year old daughter we certainly appreciated having a separate bedroom/living room.  The hotel provided us with a cot and highchair and a kettle on request.  The babysitter supplied through housekeeping was wonderful and we had no qualms about going out in the evening.  I did check the agency personally first to check their vetting procedures etc and was very reassured.  The staff were absolutley fantastic with the baby, and very patient with her new habit of throwing food on the floor and saying Hi to everyone in sight.  I was never made to feel uncomfortable by any of the staff (or the other guests for that matter) when she didn't always behave quite as I'd have liked.  

Our room rate included english breakfast - at the weekend this is a full buffet, on weekdays there's cereal and fruit etc available with a menu of hot and cold options.  Room service was always quick too.  We didn't have the Sunday Brunch, as we had big dinner plans for the evening, but sat having a bar snack and salivating over the oysters and the roast beef etc.  I'm tempted to go back just for brunch one day!  The bar did seem to get a very busy at lunchtimes /early evening with people from local offices but like many others we would recommend the Lots Road Pub for good food and much cheaper drinks than the hotel.

To sum up - it's not a cheap place to stay, and it is a bit out of the way, but compared to other London Hotels we'ved stayed in it's great value for money - the suites are huge, the views were fantastic and we're already planning our next visit.
",5,2005,05,25
122,"quite, luxury place","We stayed in the Conrad for three days in may and we found it a very quite and luxury place in a busy city like London. The rooms were very large and clean and the service was exellent. The hotel is located at chelsea harbour only a five minute walk to Kings road with its pubs and shops. There is a bus station right in front of the Hotel where one can take a bus to Earl court underground station (every 10 minutes), but if you are able to walk five minutes there is a very good connection at Kings road. Take line 11 and you get a free sightseeing tour through London. The prices at the Hotel are realy to high. Of course London is expensive but 35 pounds per person for a sunday brunch is a lot. Try Lots Road Pub (1 min walk) there you can have a nice english dinner for a better rate. If you are looking for the london nightlife book a hotel in the city because it is not easy to go by public transportation after 11pm in england (or take a taxi, about 15-20p to the city).",4,2005,05,19
122,Loved the Conrad,"I just returned from a trip to London with 3 friends. We spent 5 nights at the Conrad Hotel in Chelsea. It's off the beaten path but really easy to get around using the #3 bus to Earl's Court tube station (bus stops just steps from the front of the hotel). It's an upscale all-suite hotel with individually controlled air conditioning in each room. There's a nice bar off the lobby that had live music on weeknights and friendly staff. The rooms are very nice and clean and the beds are really comfortable plus there is a pillow menu that offers a variety of pillows to choose from.

Just down the street is a wonderful ""gastro pub"" called the Lots Road Pub - truly the highlight of our stay. The food is excellent and the staff at the pub were friendly, fun and made us feel part of the family. The atmosphere and food was so good that we ate dinner there 3 of the 5 nights! This is my 4th trip to London and previously I've always stayed close to the action so I was a little concerned about the location being out of the way. Everyone in our group loved the Conrad and the pub and we will stay there whenever we go to London again.
",5,2005,05,03
122,Will go back,"If you can afford to spend a few pounds in a taxi and to loose 15 minutes to go to the City, then this hotel is for you.
All the rooms are suites, very nicely apointed (large beds, nice furniture, 2 televisions, CD player), with a practical bathroom and a nice view on Chelsea Harbour.
The staff is, for London standards, very helpfull and the overall design of bar and breakfast room is perfect.
Finaly, and perhaps the most important in a large city like London, the hotel is very quiet. You will sleep like a baby !
I will go back !
",5,2005,03,23
122,A very pleasent suprise.,"I travel to London  about six times per year and stay in a different 5 star hotel on each occasion in my rather unusual quest to have tried them all.When I booked this one I had doubts that it would be up to scratch with it not been in the centre of town.
But I found the place to be great.All the rooms are suites and of the highest quality with massive beds and luxurious cottons and a nice view of the harbour.
If there was a downside then it would be that it is a little out of the way and a taxi is the only choice of transport in the winter.
I think it is worthy of its 5 star rating.
",5,2005,03,20
122,Top Notch!!!,"My wife and I spent two nights (one of which was New Year's Eve) at the Conrad. 

To sum it up - We had a fantastic time. We can't fault this property at all. The location, staff, facilities and value for money would all have to be given top marks.
",5,2005,01,19
122,Very nice!,"My wife and I stayed in Conrad a week in December.  Front desk staff was very helpful; went an extra mile to get me a room I preferred, and to make me feel special.   I thought concierge was helpful as well.  They checked train schedule for me (as they should); helped with buses, etc.  I never had to wait for a cab either.  Hotel is a few blocks away from King's' Road, with its upscale shopping and nice restaurants and pubs.  One can take a bus or a tube to Westminster area, tube (Forham Broadway station) is faster and takes about 10-30 min.  Staying in Chelsea gave as opportunity to see Londoners, and to see residential part of London.

Rooms look fresh; with one full and one half bath.    There is a separate shower stall. Shower is fantastic! Room are not huge, with regular two-room suite being the size of some good hotel room in US hotels (I remember my executive rooms in the Marriot).   Two TVs which are older and small, and there are no Movies on Demand!!!!!  However, bed was very cozy, rooms  were well decorated, and very comfortable and we had a wonderful view from our balcony (not all suites have them).  Drinks in the bar downstairs are ridiculously expensive, with 3.50GBP for 8oz beer, and 10GBP for cocktail.  Too bad, their loss, we would spent more time in this bar.  Instead, we went to Lots Road pub a few times.  If I would come with may dauther next time, I would stay at this hotel again.  Without a child, I may look around Oxford St for a more happennig place.
",5,2005,01,04
122,Fantastic Hotel - typical of Conrad,"Stayed at the Conrad for my birthday weekend and can quite honestly say that for the price it is hard to beat in London, ok its a bit out of the centre but for what you get in terms of facilities it more than makes up for its location (10-15 pounds taxi to west end). Fantastic Service, good food, lovely large suites, and possibly the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in. Highly recommended.
",5,2005,01,04
122,Conrad's great in a very expensive city,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Conrad for the New Years with our 3 kids.  It was truly the only good deal we found in a wonderful but very expensive city.  We had a great 2 room suite for 155 GBP, very spacious and nicely done room.  Staff was helpful and friendly, but we wouldn't use the concierge to book a restaurant for us in the future.  We travel internationally 3 or 4 times per year as a family and found this hotel to truly be one of our favorites.
",5,2005,01,02
122,Fantastic,"I Loved It!!!! What a fantastic hotel this is...you dont want to leave! We stayed with our children and they got attention from every staff member. Staff throughout the hotel very professional and genuinely welcoming. Amazing suites with a great view on the Thames. Location is perfect, just off Kings Road (good for shopping and restaurants/pubs) and you dont have the feeling your in a big city as London is. Worthwile the money! We will be back!!
",5,2004,12,19
122,How did this property ever get five stars?!,"No way is this a five-star hotel. The concierge desk is, in reality, the bell stand. After riding the Tube for one day, I was able to determine how to get around better than the ""concierge.""

The front desk staff was fine, but never went out of its way to be helpful as  one has the right to expect at a five-star property.

The hotel does, however, feature comedic entertainment in the restaurant during breakfast. The staff bears an uncanny likeness to that of Fawlty Towers. The hostess had a constant look of bewilderment and scampered everywhere; again, not what one expects at a five-star hotel.

Location is very much out of the way. It's a 20-minute bus ride to the Tube. It can be an equally long wait for a taxi, despite assurances from the ""concierge"" that a rank of taxis is always at the ready.

If you want five stars, go for the Landmark or Savoy. The Conrad is not that much of a step up from a Hilton Garden Inn.
",2,2004,12,17
122,Nice stay at the Conrad London,"My husband, 7 yr. old daughter, and I stayed at the Conrad London for a week over Thanksgiving.  We were in the regular Chelsea Suite.  We didn't face the water, but still had a decent view.  Our suite had an entry area/dry bar, living room area w/ desk, love seat and three chairs,  a bed room w/ king bed/vanity w/ built in blow dryer and a second tv, the bath was average size w/ a separate comode/bidit room, mirrored and marbled w/ tub and bath.  The hotel was very clean, quiet, and had excellent service.  We never ate a meal there as we were out site seeing from early morning untill evening.  However, we ate several meals at the wonderful gastro pub right outside of the hotel.  It is called Lots Road Pub (I think).

We used the small on site spa, swimming pool, steam room and sauna and found them to be very nice.  We had the pool and sauna to ourselves all three times that we used them.  It was a nice way to end the day.

As a travel agent I have been to many wonderful hotels and this ranks right up there.  It is very expensive and a little out of the way but if you can get a discount price (or if it's a business trip/not out of pocket) I highly recommend staying at this property.  You can take the #3 bus down to Kings Road (about three blocks) then hop on the #11 bus to Victoria Station and all the sites.  The Fulham tube station is about 8 blocks away so we tended to use the bus more often.  Cabs are easily available as well.",5,2004,12,01
122,Fantastic Hotel,"My partner and i have just returned home after staying one night at the Conrad Hotel in Chelsea Village. A few months ago we stayed at a hotel, which turned out to be a complete let down, but the Conrad was perfect. The room was much larger than i expected, with a lounge, bedroom, bathroom, guest toilet and balcony, there was not much more we could ask for. The service was fantastic and everyone was very helpful and polite. Not only am i looking forward to my next trip to London, but also spending another night (or two) at this hotel. Well worth the stay!
",5,2004,11,14
122,Flawless Conrad,"The Conrad could not be flawed from arrival to departure... I booked a room at this hotel for free using Hilton HHonors points (Conrad is the luxury counterpart of the Hilton chain). We were given a fabulous suite (very spacious ~50sq. m) overlooking the marina. Definately book the marina view (it's worth it!). From the guest bathroom in our marble lobby (in addition to the en suite) to the turndown and the quiet reflection on the balcony, this stay could not have been more perfect. Breakfast was impressive and this being the only 'all-suite' hotel in London, it was not too busy either (no queues or usual buffet hustle and bustle). The only slight downfall is it's location. Although quiet, it was just off Kings Road in Chelsea Harbour and it would be a 10 minute taxi drive to Knightsbridge. For me, a travel connoisseur, this hotel hit the spot. Highly Recommended...
",5,2004,11,11
122,Loved the Conrad,"We stayed here with 2 children in July 2004.  The kids loved it and the staff was very friendly to them. We had a great experience.  The Hotel is beautiful.  It is very clean and new.  The set up of the suites was super.  The area around the hotel is great for walking around and exploring.  The concierge was fabulous, he got us into restaurants at the last minute and was very helpful with a rental car return. We loved the gastro pub at the entrance to Chelsea Harbor.  The only downside was the distance to the tube station.  It was a 3-4 pound taxi ride or a 20-30 minute walk with kids.   (You could also take a bus to get to within 5 minutes)  We would definately stay here again!
",5,2004,08,17
122,Excellent is not enough...,"Spent one evening here on August 4. What a delightful spot. Our three teenage children took one room, my wife and I had the adjoining room. Arriving late, from Chicago, this was a perfect spot for us. The rooms are suites, and have sitting rooms, with wet bars and tv's and a love seat.  The bedrooms were quite comfortable, with tv's, extra comforters for the bed, and plenty of space for luggage. The baths were more than adequate, with two basins and a bathtub in the main room along with a separate shower. The toilet is in a separate room  . The breakfast was buffett. You can also order off a menu. We had a nice walk along the Thames before breakfast. Wish we could have stayed longer. An excellent hotel; we'd stay there again in a flash.

122,So Posh,"Lovely hotel. Very friendly staff. Fun location (after you figure out where you are). Breakfast was a bit pricey. Exchange rate is really hurting us Americans. Popular boy band staying there at same time, so little girls waiting outside at all hours for autographs - not bothersome though. Important note: Earls Court has 2 exits - kept wondering why the A3 bus stop was sometimes there/sometimes not. Blamed it on the pint! Only 10 min walk to Fulham Broadway tube - little mall area there.

122,Loved the Hotel,"We stayed here on 7th May 2004. Have never stayed in a hotel in London before and found this hotel to be very good. The Room was lovely and comfortable. The food was very good.

Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great hotel to stay in while in London.

Chelsea district is a very influential area...cool little pub near the hotel too.

122,Very Nice!  And pricey!,"WOW!  That sums it up.  Nice hotel!  Luxury!  You have a menu for which pillows you would like to sleep on.  It is on the A3 bus line, which drops you right out front.  The A3 takes you to the Earl's Court tube stop and you can use the same ticket for bus and tube.  It's a quiet location and off of the beaten path.  It's walking distance for most people to the main street where there are plenty of shops and restaurants/pubs.  The spa/exercise areas are very nice.  Very large!  If you can't find your equipment here, you won't find it in London.  This hotel is in Chelsea, so it's a ways from downtown, but easy access via bus and tube.  The only complaint is the when people shut their room doors, you can hear it a mile away.  It shook our room everytime someone shut their door.  It was loud and nerve racking in the middle of the night.  The marble bathroom is very nice.  People were friendly and it was very clean.  It should be for the price.  ",5,2004,05,14

You have 2 wonderful rooms which is wonderful for spreading out and two very comfy beds. The decor is modern but very warm and inviting. Fresh flowers, coffee maker, a fridge, and a balcony. They even offer free over-night shoe shine and a pillow menu where you can select one of ten or twelve that will suit you just right! The heating was great and we were never cold. Great, large bathroom with a good shower (and tub), as well as a guest toilet room... how many european hotels give you two bathrooms! Free internet and computer center available (telephone charges were very expensive). We stayed here because we used Priceline and were at first upset because we had chosen Knightsbridge, and the Chelsea area where this hotel is located, is somewhat out of the way. But once you get acquainted with the bus system, this hotel was worth it!!! We highly reccomend this hotel to anyone wishing for a non-tourist stay that is very comfortable and roomy!!!",5,2004,03,12

122,If you don't like lifts...go elsewhere,"The suites in this all-suite hotel are small (the bedroom area is no wider than the bed plus bedside cabinets). The bed is gorgeous - big, comfortable and with beautiful linens. Good bathroom: two basins, bath, separate shower cabinet, and separate loo and bidet. But - as in so many hotels - the bathroom lighting is far too bright. The numerous spotlights could not be switched individually, and the one over the bath was particularly irritating. A dimmer would make a big difference. 
The standard of housekeeping is generally high, though the tiling in the shower was in need of attention (mouldy!). There are no internal staircases, so one has to use the lifts. The route to the health club is via another lift, which is tiny (definitely not for the claustrophobic). One can get to the health club via the (enclosed) fire escape or by walking around the outside of the hotel...not good solutions! We didn't get a lot of sleep, because of the train line running below our window (the harbour-view suites may be quieter). We didn't take breakfast, because of the muzak. A pity, as the dining room was pleasant and overlooked the harbour. So...if you don't mind lifts, muzak and night-time train noise, this is a good choice.

It offers a varied and abundant breakfast with a splendid view of Chelsea Harbour.
Located in an excellent position near the center and the metro, it is a highly recommended place for families, couples and friends",5,2023,12,22
122,Fantastic experience,"I stayed for 3 nights and I must say that I found myself in a welcoming hotel with very friendly staff. The price is more than adequate for the services offered: spacious room, king size bed with very comfortable pillows, cleaning and towel changes as well as an excellent and abundant breakfast. The location is perfect, I love the Chelsea neighborhood, you can reach the center in a short time (the metro station is a short distance away) and many attractions can also be reached on foot.
Very satisfied, will definitely return!",5,2023,12,20

122,The paint is off,"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel has 5 stars and a very nice location. We had a beautiful suite with a balcony and a view of the small marina. So far so good. In fact, the 5-star hotel has seen better days. Everything is showing its age. The shower is of an ancient standard and is also very slippery, the toilet flush takes a lot of getting used to and is difficult to get going. The two (!) TVs theoretically have a lot of channels, but some of them still didn't work. It was also supposed to be possible to stream Netflix via Chrome Cast, but that didn't work either. Unfortunately, the breakfast was in no way in keeping with a 5-star hotel. Little choice and annoyed staff who seemed overwhelmed are not a good sign. We stayed here for 4 nights and every time several tables were not cleared at breakfast. If you did find a free space, it hadn't even been wiped down and was full of crumbs. The chairs and tables in the breakfast room are also all old and worn. We were also really disappointed with the spa area. Unfortunately, it is very outdated and also has lots of corners and is not at all inviting. 

The beautiful complex is in urgent need of renovation. Then the high prices will be justified.

La receptionist che ci ha poi seguito, Betty, è stata bravissima. La suite era ampia e confortevole con una balconata sul porto: una vista impagabile! Colazione ricca e di ottima qualità.",5,2022,06,07
122,Enttäuschend,"Das Hotel an sich hat eine wunderbare Lage, schöne Suiten zumindest die mit Blick auf den Hafen sowie einen kleinen Spa mit einem großzügigen Pool und Fitnessbereich. 

Für mich war es eine hervorragende Kombination - die fast schon beschauliche Lage am Chelsea Harbour mit der wunderschönen Terrasse und die Nähe zur quirligen Kings Road, welche in ca. 10 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar ist. 

Ich war in diesem Hotel mehrmals zu Gast als es noch ein Conrad Hotel war und war immer sehr zufrieden. 
Als unter Wyndham die Terrasse umgebaut wurde und der Zugang über die Terrasse zum Hafen abgerissen wurde, war das sehr enttäuschend und hat dem Hotel viel seines Charmes genommen. 

Nach vielen Jahren wollten wir nun wieder einen Versuch im Chelsea Harbour Hotel wagen, welches zwischenzeitlich zur Millenium Hotelkette gehört. 

Wir hatten ein sehr gutes Angebot über Secret Escapes gebucht, aber diese Buchung wurde uns später mit dem Hinweis 

""Leider wurden wir von unserem Hotelpartner darüber informiert, dass Ihr ursprünglich gebuchtes Hotel Ihre Reservierung für Ihre gebuchten Daten aufgrund unvorhergesehener Umstände nicht bestätigen kann und wir Ihre Buchung stornieren müssen"" 

storniert!

Was nun doch sehr merkwürdig ist da auf der Hotelwebseite unser Zimmer weiterhin zur Buchung verfügbar ist!

Nachdem in diesem Zeitraum die Chelsea Flower Week stattfindet, liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass von Hotelseite bei Freigabe der Buchungsdaten ein Fehler unterlaufen ist. 

Fehler sollte man aber nicht auf dem Rücken anderer austragen schon gar nicht wenn man in der Dienstleistungsbranche beheimatet ist. Zudem wurde uns noch bei Nachfrage im Hotel erzählt, dass das Hotel mit der Stornierung nichts zu tun hat und diese durch Secret Escapes veranlasst wurde. Für mich ein absolut unseriöses Geschäftsverhalten deswegen O-Punkte! 

(Der angegebene Zeitpunkt der Reise mit März 2022 ist natürlich nicht richtig, aber anders wäre eine Bewertung nicht möglich gewesen)",1,2022,03,11

Das Chelsea Harbour ist ruhig gelegen, bietet schöne, sehr grosse Zimmer (wir hatten eine Juniorsuite) und wenn man den Harbour View bucht eine malerische Aussicht. Das Personal ist ausnehmend freundlich, zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit. Allerdings hat das Haus einen nicht unbeträchtlichen Unterhaltsbedarf, der sich beispielsweise in nicht funktionierenden Steckdosen und Lampen, nicht richtig schliessenden Türen oder abblätternder Farbe zeigt.

122,Cinque stelle cadenti,"Ogni tanto viaggiando, capita che in strutture con ""5 stelle sul petto"" ci si imbatta in situazioni sfortunate. L'Hotel è molto comodo da raggiungere dall'aeroporto di Heatrow, il viaggio anche con l'autostrada trafficata è breve. La posizione è decisamente tranquilla, a ridosso di una Marina che dona alla struttura un'atmosfera particolare. Arriviamo alle dolenti note: la camera assegnataci aveva l'aspetto decisamente vissuto, una moquette ""stanca"" e dei tendaggi che avevano conosciuto tempi migliori in quanto a pulizia. Ma il peggio deve ancora arrivare, in bagno abbiamo trovato il soffione della doccia rotto e appoggiato per terra, in uno dei due bagni il rubinetto del lavandino non funzionava. Dulcis in fundo, il riscaldamento di una delle due camere era spento e non c'è stato verso di accenderlo, nostro figlio si era addormentato e abbiamo (sbagliando) deciso di attendere il mattino. All'alba infreddolito mi sono recato alla reception chiedendo come era stato possibile che il servizio in camera non avesse segnalato dei problemi così evidenti, non è accettabile che una struttura che vanta le cinque stelle possa offrire ai suoi clienti una camera così ""sgangherata"". Ci è stata assegnata subito un'altra sistemazione, allo stesso piano, abbiamo controllato che tutto funzionasse anche se l'aspetto generale anche questa volta era piuttosto ""fanè"". A una coppia di amici era stata assegnata una stanza all'ultimo piano, abbiamo potuto constatare che nell'hotel le stanze belle ci sono, questo ci porta a credere che ci siano dei piani riservati a una clientela meno esigente e frettolosa, che magari riesce a sfruttare delle offerte ""last minute"", altri piani sono decisamente più curati e offrono camere migliori. Abbiamo provato anche il ristorante dell'hotel, sarà forse perché due famiglie indiane stavano festeggiando un matrimonio decisamente pittoresco e rumoroso, con un mix di tamburi e cornamuse, è probabile che in cucina fossero distratti dall'evento, ma la cena è stata decisamente scarsa, il pesce grigliato che abbiamo ordinato era bruciato è immangiabile. Per finire, la colazione del mattino, un buffet risicato e minimalista, la presenza del cuoco che prepara uova e pancetta non è sufficiente per un albergo che dovrebbe offrire molto di più ai suoi ospiti. Non era la notte di San Lorenzo, ma ci è sembrato di vedere più di una stella cadente, il desiderio che abbiamo espresso è di ritornare presto a Londra, ma in un'altra struttura! ",2,2015,02,22
122,Perfetto,"Siamo stati in questo hotel a settembre , ci siamo trovati subito bene , dal personale super gentile , alle camere confortevoli e dotate di ogni accessorio , compreso la macchina per il caffè , per me assolutamente necessaria appena apro gli occhi al mattino!

122,Meraviglioso,"Un hotel meraviglioso nel cuore di Chelsea. Le stanze sono veri e propri appartamenti, arredati in stile classico e dotati di cuti i confort.

In pochi passi si raggiunge Fulham Road, e da li metropolitana e collegamenti comodissimi.",5,2014,08,10
122,Ottimo albergo per ottimo prezzo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in quattro in una suite con due camere e due bagni. Il prezzo, soltanto pernottamento, è stato davvero ottimo, anzi unico in tutta Londra. Unico difetto della location: la linea sopraelevata che collega l'albergo con la metro sotterranea (1 sola fermata) ha meno corse e termina la sera prima di mezzanotte. Ma se volete risparmiare e al tempo stesso stare in una struttura di fatto a cinque stelle (per la comodità e servizi nelle stanze) questo albergo è senz'altro da consigliare",5,2014,08,04

122,"Fantástico hotel en Chelsea, buenas vistas y buen servicio","Impresionante hotel situado en el barrio de Chelsea, Londres. Ubicado junto a la bahía y el río, ofrece unas preciosas vistas de la ciudad. Las habitaciones son magníficas, todas ellas suites, grandes y espaciosas. Nosotros viajamos con dos niños pequeños y aunque disponíamos de una sola suite, parecía como si estuviésemos en habitaciones separadas.
La decoración es agradable, y la calidad del sueño muy buena.
No está situado en el centro de Londres, está en el barrio de Chelsea, lo cual también tiene su encanto porque la zona es tranquila y está muy bien comunicada con el centro de la ciudad.
Quizás debería mejorar el desayuno, el buffet es poco variado. Un hotel de esta categoría merece contar con un desayuno más variado y saludable, los zumos deberían ser naturales y la bollería recién hecha.
Salvo este simple comentario, el hotel es un gran 5 estrellas y el personal muy, muy profesional, en especial los empleados de origen español. Todo ello ha hecho que éste sea nuestro hotel favorito en Londres.",5,2013,05,08
122,Una vera vacanza in città. Sorprendente.,"Vado spesso a Londra ma non ero mai stato in questo albergo, scelto quasi ""a caso"" perchè era vicino al posto dove avevo un appuntamento di lavoro.  Arrivo alla sera, un po stanco, Ottima accoglianza in spazi grandi e curati. Stile moderno ma non freddo. Personale educato e piacevile. Ottimo l'impatto inziale. Arrivo in camera. Spaziosissima: di fatto un mini appartamento. Corridoio, due stanze, due bagni, due televisori, tutto freschissimo, pultissimo e molto curato. Spazioso anche il bagno con vasca e doccia. Ma la vera sopresa è stata la mattina, quando aprendo la finestra...credevo di avere sbagliato città! La vista era sul porticciolo di Chelsea Harbour, con alcune bellissme barche ormeggiate. Una vera, ed inaspettata  sensazione di vacanza, interrotta dalla sveglia che mi ricordava che ero li per lavoro.Veramente un piacevolissima sorpresa.  Spero di tornarci presto. Prezzo sostenuto, ma li vale tutti. Non ho dubbi nel consigliarlo. Sia per business che per fine settimana o ""vacanzina"" a Londra.",5,2013,03,28
122,Assoluta quiete nel centro di Londra,"Grazie ad una convention aziendale mi è capitato di essere ospite di questa struttura situata in centro a Londra.

122,Bellissimo hotel in un angolo tranquillo di Londra.,"4 giorni a Londra all' inizio di settembre - camera (suite in realtà !) bellissima x 2 adulti e una bambina di 9 anni. La veduta sul porticciolo di Chelsea e' veramente carina e senza dubbio originale.
Servizi in generale molto molto buoni, cosi' come le attenzioni del personale, quanto ci si aspetta da un 5 stelle. Il costo non e' indifferente, quindi consiglio di approfittare delle offerte che spesso fanno (come abbiamo fatto noi!) e che portano il prezzo a quello di un 4 stelle in centro città'. Ottimo giudizio anche per la lounge, dove tornando tardi una sera, abbiamo cenato molto bene, meglio di quanto potessimo immaginare. La posizione non e' comodissima, non lo consiglierei a chi va a Londra per la prima volta, magari solo per tre giorni. L'hotel ha comunque l'Overground a 5 minuti a piedi (imperial wharf) e in una fermata sei a West Brompton dove ti colleghi con la linea verde. Considerate quindi un po' di tempo per raggiungere cuore della citta'.
Unica nota veramente negativa il Wi-FI a pagamento nelle camere !! E' gratis solo nella hall ... Con quello che paghi per la camera, chiedere altre 15 sterline ci e' sembrato a dir poco oltraggioso !",4,2012,09,16
122,Wyndham e ti senti... businessman in London,"Ciao a tutti, come sempre mi sento in dovere di dare agli amici di tripadvisor un piccolo contributo con la mia recensione alla struttura che mi ha ospitato 5 giorni a giugno 2012.
Ancora una volta le note positive lette in questo sito si rivelano corrette !
Hotel molto curato e situato in zona tranquilla residenziale a circa 100 mt dalla fermata metro - linea uscita Imperial Wharf  - biglietto giornaliero metro e bus 8 euro a testa (i bimbi fino a 12 anni non pagano in tutta Londra - dai 13 ai 16 anni ridotto 50%).
Circa 5 minuti a piedi dall'Hotel vale la pena di visitare ""ovviamente"" lo Stamford Bridge.
Posizione quindi ottimale con vista sul bellissimo porticciolo di Chelsea.
Hotel frequentato prevalentemente da international businessman  o comunque da persone non giovanissime forse dovuto al fatto che ogni movimento che fai ti costa (es. colazione: 1 tè = euro 12,00 - un uovo al tegamino = euro 24,00 e così via).
Lo consiglio soprattutto per chi cerca qualche ora di relax in luogo assolutamente pulito e ordinato lontano 15 minuti dal caos della metropoli.
Moltissimo personale dalla reception ai servizi al ristorante con musica dal vivo al piano bar il tutto in un contesto sobriamente di ""sottovoce"" - niente ressa o urla di bambini.
Non ho usufruito del servizio in camera, della colazione, della cena in quanto mi trovavo lì per visitare Londra - quindi ho pasteggiato sempre in giro per la città dal mattino alla tarda sera - anche se presumo fosse di ottima qualità come del resto tutto l'Hotel.
Unica nota dolente avevo prenotato attraverso il portale internet lateroom.com e pagato con carta Visa pernottamento e prima colazione. Arrivato sul posto - sorpresa - niente colazione inclusa ! Consiglio quindi a chi volesse prenotare con lateroom.com di accertarsi bene del costo dei servizi offerti. Per il resto... cosa puoi dire di un Hotel a 5 stelle di fama internazionale?
Posso solo fare delle osservazioni sulla carenza di un servizio banale libero - siamo nel 2012 !
Wi-Fi a pagamento!!!
Penso che tra non molto tornerò sicuramente al Wyndham G. Hotel Chelsea.",5,2012,06,24

Ombrello all'ingresso per l'eventuale pioggia, personale molto cordiale e disponibile. La metropolitana più vicina è quella verde , fermata Earl's Court ,per raggiungerla... taxi ( circa 7/8 sterline) o linea C3 (FATE LA OYSTER CARD). C'è possibilità di chiedere la colazione in stanza, ne vale la pena perchè costa relativamente poco (muffin, brioches e pane con burro e marmellata) e naturalmente tea. A vostra disposizione vi daranno ciabatte e accappatoio che troverete nell'armadio.
Consiglio vivamente e ci ritorneremo!",5,2012,03,08

El restaurant es caro, pero los desayunos son excelentes, sin embargo a pocos minutos tienes restauranes muy agradables y donde puedes tomar un buen desayuno por 6 u 8 libras.

Attenzione a due cose però!! Per prima cosa, si trova  afianco dell'eliporto di londra:( per cui dalla mattina alle 8 fino a mezzanotte ci sono i rumori degli elicotteri.. e poi dal bar ai servizi tutto viene quotato dallo staff IVA esclusa (tipo in america) per cui i prezzi dei servizi o altro rischiamo di essere ben più alti di quelli annunciati..

122,Un ottimo suite hotel,"L'albergo offre un rapporto qualità-prezzo molto buono. La posizione non è centrale, ma il quartiere di Chelsea è sempre piacevole da vivere. Staff gentile e molto disponibile, camera ampia e ben arredata, bagno comodo e pulito, servizio di cassetta di sicurezza impeccabile, ambienti accoglienti, location di pregio. Dopo tante note positive, tre piccole note negative: non ci sono canali televisivi italiani, la colazione non è molto abbondante e la richiesta di garanzia per il soggiorno è davvero fastidiosa.",4,2011,06,07
122,Modernes großes komfortables Hotel an der Themse,"Das Wyndham Grand liegt am Chelsea Habour, einem großen Stadtentwicklungsprojekt der jüngsten Vergangenheit. Die Lage ist für einen Sightseeing - Aufenthalt, nicht optimal, nur eine Stadtbahn mildert die Entfernung zum Stadtinneren. Die Suiten, denn es sind wirklich Suiten, sind nicht nur groß, sondern auch elegant. Allgemein gesprochen ist das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis nicht nur für Londoner Verhältnisse toll.",5,2010,08,12
122,Un affare! ma attenzione alle insidie...,"Ottimo hotel, 5 stelle, rapporto qualità prezzo notevole. Per i servizi offerti non è molto diverso da un buon 4 stelle. Tutti i servizi extra sono a pagamento, ben 24 sterline al giorno per il collegamento wifi internet e... sorpresa, 100 sterline al giorno di deposito richiesti al nostro arrivo, quindi per un soggiorno di 5 notti abbiamo dovuto pagare 500 sterline (con carta di credito). Sicuramente abbiamo preso ""male"" noi ma la pulizia e il servizio giornaliero in camera, per essere un 5 stelle, non era impeccabile. In generale un giudizio buono, lo consiglio.",4,2009,06,20
122,Tolle ruhige Lage...,...und großzügige Suiten. Das Frühstück war überschaubar vom Angebot her...,5,2009,06,07
122,Erstklassiges Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt im Herzen des Hafens von Chelsea, an den Ufern des Flußes Themse. Es ist ein schönes, sehr großzügig gestaltetes Hotel mit einem großen Freizeitbereich. Es gibt mehrere internationale Restaurants nebenan, wo man essen und die Rechnung ins Hotelzimmer bekommen kann. Die Hotelbar ist der ideale Ort um Prominente zu sehen. Das Zimmer war wunderschön eingerichtet wunder schönes Bad. Ein erstklassiges Hotel.

122,bastante bien,"El hotel me sorprendio gratamente, tiene unas habitaciones magnificas todas suites con salon separado y un sofa cama en le salon , lo que esta muy bien si vas con niños.
el desayuno es muy bueno ,superior a la media en Europa
lo peor es que no es centrico , pero el precio que pague era mucho menos que otros de categoria similar y mas centrico",4,2008,03,28
