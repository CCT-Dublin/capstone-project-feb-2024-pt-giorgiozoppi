22,STAY HERE,Everything about this hotel is sublime! The service- the room- the amenities! Can’t say enough about how much I enjoyed my trip! Fantastic location right in the heart of it all! Moha the bellman greeted us with warmth and genuine enthusiasm! I didn’t want to leave,5,2024,10,16
22,Perfect hotel - Centrally located!,"Our stay at this hotel was quite enjoyable.  The room was well appointed. The staff was incredibly helpful, with directions and advice.
The morning breakfast was incredible and got us off to a great start!

Regards to the hotel, the front desk staff were great!",5,2024,10,15
22,"My second home in Spain, best hotel in all of Barcelona","Basically a second home for me while I am in Barcelona. Breakfast is great, rooms are always super clean, accommodations in the room are amazing, the staff are always super kind and considerate. Half the reason I keep coming back to Barcelona is because of this hotel and I've been back everytime I visit Europe",5,2024,10,09
22,The best staff and rooftop pool!,"THE BEST EXPERIENCE! The staff were out of this world especially Mamadou and Mohammed! Went out of their way to get us taxis, fixed my sisters broken suitcase and so much more!! The pool was one of my favorites ever! And the included breakfast was HUGE! I will definitely be staying here again!",5,2024,09,29
22,Modern Hotel with Superb Service,"The Ohla Eixample hotel is wonderfully located. We walked to the Sagrada Famiglia, Las Ramblas and the port. Excellent restaurants and shopping are nearby.
The hotel is modern with a minimalist style decor. The shower was amazing with a rainfall shower head and wand. I loved the robes and turndown service. The rooftop pool, lounge and bar area were welcoming and comfortable. Breakfast was included with our room and it consisted of wide variety of quality breakfast staples (pastries, fruit, cold meats and cheeses) plus made to order items. 
Service was outstanding. We arrived early, were greeted warmly and the front desk staff kept our bags and brought us to the pool change rooms where we could shower and freshen up. We asked for a tourist map and the staff member gave us an abundance of info and set out a walking itinerary for us.
A surprise bonus was the unexpected birthday card and gift of chocolates left in our room. My partner was celebrating his birthday but we had not informed the hotel. I assume they noticed it on his passport.
I highly recommend Ohla Eixample.",5,2024,09,26
22,Outstanding!,"Perfect first stay in Barcelona! Great area with tons of restaurants and shopping near by. Staff is outstanding! Kind, helpful, thoughtful and friendly.  The pool was a nice getaway after a long day is walking and sightseeing. The daily breakfast was fresh and very yummy. I would highly recommend staying here!! 5 star",5,2024,09,26
22,Solid choice in L’Eixample,"Solid option in the L’Eixample neighborhood of Barcelona. Exceedingly clean, good linens, nicely appointed room/bathroom (although not too private due to lots of glass). I would say that the hotel is not luxurious to the highest degree. We found that housekeepers were chatting/making noise in the hallways and the front desk/doormen not greeting you when you come in and out. You may find a higher level of five star service in Barcelona but again the Ohla is a very well priced, more than acceptable hotel in a wonderful location. I would stay again.",4,2024,09,25
22,Stay at Ohla Eixample.,This hotel by far exceeded my expectations. The room was well appointed with modern touches and while I wasn’t a fan of having the sink as the first thing to greet me coming into the room the space and size of the hotel room was great for my sister and I to not feel cramped into the space. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The hotel restaurants are also must try.,5,2024,09,21
22,Top hotel and brilliant staff,"Top hotel, spotlessly clean, great food and very very helpful staff.
The rooms are large, well furnished and very clean.
Ideally placed just off Les Rambles (top end) you could ask for a better hotel in Barcelona.
Will definitely be returning in the future and staying at this brilliant hotel again.",5,2024,09,21
22,First class experience at Ohla!,Thank you Ohla for such a nice experience! From beginning to end the service and accommodations were first class.  From the moment we arrived to our checkout was flawless. All of the staff were so accommodating. We look forward to returning!,5,2024,09,04
22,We would stay here again!,"We had a great experience at the hotel. Our family booked two rooms for 6 nights - a junior suite and a superior room. 

What we loved: 
- Both rooms are spacious and have high ceilings. The rooms were modern, clean and very comfortable.

- great location. Great restaurants within walking distance. Two small supermarkets downstairs for us to grab essentials or fruits. Very quiet and posh neighborhood yet very close (and walkable) to main attractions (casa batllo and la pedrera) and nice shopping area. 

- great breakfast selection and generous hours (7-11am) 

- very helpful staff. They went the extra mile to make sure we had a good stay. We had a toddler with us so their help was much appreciated. 

If there were one thing I wish were better it would be the shampoo and hair conditioner. It wasn’t moisturizing enough for my hair and we had to purchase our own from the supermarket downstairs. 

Overall we had a great stay and I would recommend this hotel to families and those traveling with young ones.",5,2024,09,02
22,Truly a 5-star!!!,"An amazing experience, truly a 5-star! The staff is what makes this hotel special. They are kind, give great recommendations, and go out of their way to make sure your stay is great. 

Mahmoud - the bell man, took extra time to make sure we got a taxi safely. He had such a positive attitude and we appreciated him going the extra mile for us. Joel was also incredible. From the moment we arrived the hotel, he made sure to make our stay special. He took time to give us recommendations and even got us into our room early! We loved him! 

Breakfast at this hotel was UNREAL, so delicious  and special. Also make sure you make time to go to the pool. The pool is so awesome. Try the drinks and food at the Skybar, they were wonderful!

Again, thank you Ohla for everything. We will be back someday!",5,2024,09,02
22,Deign room by Ohla Exeimple : the trap,"Booked hotels with Very Chic in Europe for years, never be treated as insignificant people as we were at the Ohla Exeimple 
The receptionist confirmed I got a design room as booked . But I only saw a dark poor bedroom. Checking the  hotel website. I quote : “ design : Comfortable and elegant urban design, high-quality furniture and ceramic walls” well ,any ceramic wall in my room as described. Explanation from the director : we told you that your room is a design , design room can have or have not a ceramic wall ! What do you want ?  You want to change for a room on the street ? What’s going on here ? Is this a 5 star welcome  ! Not worth the price even with discount. Small entrance , poor  rooftop , dark bedroom , Hard mattress , not a 5* stars breakfast: hot water for tea from the cafe machine ! Swimming pool is ok but no ombrella.",1,2024,08,31
22,Super staff and delicious breakfast!,Staff are all so warm and friendly - and always happy to help! The location is great. Breakfast had lots of variety. Rooms were big with plenty of storage space. Bedside tables should be bigger though. Showers super powerful. Will highly recommend this hotel.,5,2024,08,18
22,Yes,"I stayed here for three nights in Barcelona. The lobby and reception area is definitely a vibe and I was excited to see what the rooms were like.

Of course having arrived after a 9-day cruise first thing in the morning, I didn’t expect my room to be ready at 9am…understandable.

I returned a few hours later, inquired about room availability and was pleasantly surprised that housekeeping had just finished a room and my room was available.

The finishes are exquisite throughout, very modern cozy chic. There was even a rooftop pool with very comfortable lounging pods, perhaps too comfortable because they were always taken.

The water bottles were always kept restocked throughout my stay, turn down service offered a different night time sweet from chocolates to biscoff.

I also opted for the rate that included breakfast, and I’m glad I did..their breakfast offered a full buffet and the option for freshly made omelettes or pancakes.",5,2024,08,16
22,A Hotel in the midst of beautiful Barcelona,"We would like to highly recommend the Ohla Eixample in Barcelona.  The Hotel is in a great location, has two highly rated restaurants, a fabulous rooftop pool and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly.  Special thanks to Mr Yves Vandekerckhove for his kindness and assistance during our stay.

22,Ohla hotel,"Great location. Quite and close to everything!! The  city center is only 24 minutes away ( we walked there every day.  The breakfast is amazing! A lot of choices. Rooms are  very clean, housekeeping is twice daily.. Staff is helpful and very friendly.",5,2024,08,08
22,Fantastic!,"Such a great hotel! The staff are all extremely attentive, helpful, friendly and accommodating.  We found the hotel spotlessly clean and the breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  The rooftop pool is perfect and a great place to relax. The pool side beds are very comfortable and soft towels are always available. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Thank you.",5,2024,08,04
22,Went the extra step....,"I mistakenly booked the Ohla hotel in DOWNTOWN Barcelona, rather than this one.  We arrived, we realized our mistake but they were sold out.  Our friends were staying here and we wanted to be nearby. 

The hotel had the penthouse available for one night and they gave it to us at a regular room rate.  They then helped us find another quality hotel (the Sixtytwo) for the following two nights and had the Ohla downtown waive the cancelation fee.  Technically they didn't have to do a thing---it was my mistake--- but they did.

Our thanks to the staff at Ohla Eixample for being so accommodating.",5,2024,07,27
22,Centrally located and good enough,"Overall, we enjoyed our five-night stay at the Ohla Eixample.

Positives include the amazing shower and daily cleaning of our room. They were very thorough with that. The on-site sushi restaurant was very delicious and the pool/bar service on the roof was great. It's also located in a very nice part of Barcelona and walking around is super easy.

Could work on? We were greeted warmly by the reception when we first came, but after that every time we entered the hotel, we felt ignored. A simple greeting would have bene nice. Our phone also didn't work and we told them that pressing 9 (we tried several times) to contact the front desk wasn't working, but they insisted it did. Also, the massages were booked weren't great. In fact, not even okay. No real pressure.",4,2024,07,26
22,Great value for money,"Excellent location, close to all attractions. Walking distance. Located on a calme street. Super friendly and reactive staff. GM of the hotel on top of things and ensures perfect experience. Breakfast was great. Swimming pool, gym and bar on top. Highly recommended.",5,2024,07,14
22,25th Anniversary break,"What an Amazing hotel we stayed for our 25th wedding Anniversary. We loved the location, the area felt very safe. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool and Sky Terrace area was a welcome break after a day of sightseeing and walking. The rooms were clean and spacious with everything you need on hand. Breakfast was amazing!",5,2024,07,04
22,Greatest high-end stay in Barcelona,"The personal service we received from Piter Joel and Nuria were top-notch. So grateful to be in a cozy safe place with convenience to all the shopping and restaurants 
Our driver Eugenia truly educated with a vast source of knowledge and to us to Monserrat for the day 
Grateful for this comfy hotel with it’s beautiful surroundings and very nice restaurants",5,2024,06,30
22,"The Higher the Prices, the Higher the Expectations","I spent my last night in Barcelona here because my previous hotel (see review of 10Cubik) had no Friday vacancies. Since this new one qualifies as a full star upgrade, naturally my expectations were higher. To a point, I came away rather satisfied. Over all, images on its website of the room as well as the lobby and sky bar with amazing lap pool bordering the building’s edge look the same in person. The Ohla Eixample has nailed the Restoration Hardware aesthetic that seems the norm in these nicer Spanish hotels. Service also proves noteworthy, with incredibly friendly and professional staff. As an American getting up early and still needing a real breakfast, the selection and quality of the buffet further earned its praise from other Trip Advisor commentors. 

In a few areas, however, this hotel fails to meet its own impeccable standards. Conditioned by consistent great quality, I could not unsee a couple of chips along the edge of my porcelain bathroom sink, along with a human hair near the drain, upon first entering the room. While the pool deck and bar seem flawless, the small gym with antiquated equipment, cups impossibly stuck together at the water dispenser, and no remote to change the TV channel, significantly downgraded my experience. The room itself for the gym has so much potential, with natural skylight and wood floors in decent condition. It almost feels like someone just decided to forgo any improvements. (Honestly, the gym at a Holiday Inn I visited back in the states a few weeks ago had much more going for it). 

Admittedly, these criticisms seem petty. I would never even have them at lesser hotels, where my real concerns remain simple cleanliness and a good night’s sleep. But failing to attend to the little details expected of an upscale establishment like this made the Ohla Eixample’s 5 stars a little dim.",4,2024,06,08
22,A Great Place before your Cruise,"Amazing service. Wonderful amenities. Clean and a great deal. Staff was fantastic.

My wife and I stayed here before our cruise. They made everything so easy. The rooms are beautiful. Everything is very modern and well kept. I look forward to staying again.",5,2024,06,04
22,Exceptional Experience!,"Exceptional Experience! impeccable attention to details, helpful and hospitable staff. Rooms are modernly design with great ambiance. The breakfast buffet captures the essence of the Catalan cuisine and is super rich. The rooftop pool offers a relaxing and tranquil atmosphere and the view is spectacular.  Overall an unmatched experience. Will definitely return here.",5,2024,05,26
22,Great Hotel in good location,"Greta Hotel, probably 4.5 star in our eyes, but great never the less. Good room with excellent under bed storage for the suitcase, should be in all hotels! Breakfast good with local style foods. Bar a bit expensive, but to be expected, desk staff very helpful and roof top pool would be great,in August.",4,2024,05,16
22,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel. All of the staff were really friendly and helpful with any queries we had, particularly Juanjo and Madhu. It was our first time in the city and found the location to be really convenient for exploring either by foot, metro or taxi. The breakfast offering was varied with a choice of standard continental and cooked dishes to order. The room was clean and comfortable and appreciated the free water top-ups and chocolate gifts each day. We were on the 3rd floor facing the street and found it quiet and peaceful. The only issue for us was the lack of privacy in the layout of the bathroom - the sink was in the hallway, the shower has no door, shower screen faces the beds so you can see the other person in the shower and the toilet cubicle doesn't have a sink inside. I went with my sister so it was fine, but would make people aware if you're sharing with someone you don't know very well or any light sleepers (you can't wash your hands in the night without potentially disturbing the other person for example). Also, being on your period and wanting to empty your mooncup in private is inconvenient when it shouldn't be!   Other than that small gripe, I would return and highly recommend this hotel.",4,2024,05,12
22,Fantastic place to stay!,"We stayed here for 5 nights in mid-April and were very impressed with the hotel. The location is wonderful, very central to everywhere we wanted to be but in a quiet neighborhood.  We were very close to bus/metro stops and lots of dining options, but away from the more crowded, noisy areas. The hotel itself is very modern, clean and comfortable.  We booked the Design Deluxe room and were very pleased with it, there was lots of space and a comfortable queen sized bed. We were on the 8th floor facing the courtyard and found the room quiet at night. We did not end up using the enclosed balcony, but it was nice to have the option. The housekeeping staff kept the room immaculate, with 2 visits per day (one turn down service).  The breakfast each morning had lots of choice and the offerings were always fresh. You could order a variety of hot foods (i.e. pancakes, crepes, omelets, etc.) from the kitchen if you wish. I did twice, but in general found the buffet offering more than enough.  We found all of the staff very friendly and professional. We did not use the pool as the weather was on the chillier side, but I think it would be a wonderful perk in the warmer months.  Overall, highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,04,30
22,Excellent!,"Went to stay here 3 nights.
First thing that you see is the great welcoming, very happy and warm staff!
The hotel is very clean, and room service twice a day. The pool area is good although cold pool in April.
The staff in breakfast area and restaurant where more than great! Also the area where hotel is located is good and calm with lots of good local resturants with not to many tourist but close to many good places in Barcelona.
I recommend this hotel",5,2024,04,19
22,"Amazing staff, good facilities","Hotel was great but the best thing about the hotel was the staff!! Honestly never stayed at a hotel where the staff were so attentive and genuinely nice. Everyday I was at reception asking for recommendations for places to eat and things to do. They bent of backwards to help us, made some amazing recommendations and made all the phone calls always with a smile!!! I will definitely stay here again because of the lovely staff, highly recommend!",5,2024,04,08
22,Splendid stay…,"Came for two nights in April. Wonderful hotel. From check in on (a trainee but clearly well trained!) we were meant to feel very special. Nice touches: glass of cava on arrival, turn down service. Attic rooms have a lovely balcony to get away from the sight seeing. Lovely area. Great bars and restaurants a-plenty near by. Bed, beautifully comfortable! Don’t believe the reviews slating breakfast - loads of choice and lots of local specialities. Appreciated the contact from the experience team before and during stay - it seems to matter to this hotel that guest have a good time. Hope to come back one day and would recommend very highly…",5,2024,04,06
22,Perfect staff,"Very good hotel with a perfect staff , at a very good location. The breakfast is bit boring, the roof top pool is not heated (cold before summer). The room is well equipped and spacious, the bath has glass wall, so it's rather for couples. The hotel has two marvelous restaurants and bar, good shops are close, la Rambla is also close",4,2024,03,24
22,A lovely 3 night stay,"We chose this hotel because of its fab location and obviously the rooftop pool.

Check in was at 3 but our room was ready as they had upgraded us to a bigger room on floor 7 which was amazing.

Breakfast was lovely, lots of choice and the staff were always extremely friendly and polite.

The pool was brisk but my husband still managed to have a swim as the weather was 23 degrees C 

It was lovely chilling with a cuppa and a beer with the fab view..

Shower was amazing ..!! Bed was a queen and was very comfortable.. and aircon worked a treat.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2024,03,23
22,Amazing stay,"I really enjoyed our stay at Ohla Eixample. I choose this hotel to celebrate my husband’s birthday and they were perfect in helping me to organize the surprise for him in every detail. They have also upgraded us on a larger and prettier room. On top of that, breakfast was very good (even if I would have expected a bit more choice, being a 5* hotel)",5,2024,03,21
22,"Super, fabulous, fantastic!","This wonderful boutique hotel just off Av Diagonal, is a gem of a place. From arrival being offered water or cava, to the friendly accommodating staff, this is simply THE hotel to stay in!!, the rooms were so so quiet beautifully modern. But it’s those “little extras” The rainfall shower / the best I’ve had in a while, the amenities provided, plus extras you can request. The constant replenishing of the free water in the room as well as team & nexpresso maker, the greasing gowns and chocs on our pillows! Linens changed daily too! 
Rooftop pool to die for views of La Sagrada, not  heated, but didn’t matter. 
The breakfast was plentiful and varied so much to choose from and always getting replenished, as well as a daily cooked option. 
We didn’t eat in the restaurant only because it’s not our thing, but we did order room service. I have to say it was beautifully presented and a truly tasty Cesar salad & tomato bread. 
We came for my partners birthday and were surprised by the chilled bottle of cava & chocolates left in the room. 
Would I stay here again ? 
100% yes! 
Would I recommend staying here?
100% yes!",5,2024,03,19
22,A haven in the city,"The staff is friendly, efficient, and accommodating. Our room was ready early, which was great after an overnight flight. The room was superb: clean, well appointed and quiet. The location made it easy to get around the city: near a metro stop and within walking distance of major sites of interest. The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever had; definitely worth including it in your stay. There were so many good choices, we would have needed two weeks instead of two nights to sample it all. We would definitely recommend it, and if we ever return to Barcelona, we will come back.",5,2024,03,16
22,Book this hotel for your stay in Barcelona! Fab-u-lous!,"Cannot fault anything with this hotel: location, service, room comfort, gym, breakfast buffet, checkout time, fridge in room, pool and sun terrace, little supermarket just down the road for extras, proximity to metro. All just brilliant. Will definitely visit again.",5,2024,03,10
22,Excellent luxurious 5 star Hotel in City center,I have been to this hotel often - once every month for the last year for Business purpose. Service is impeccable. Nice rooms and architecture. The Breakfast buffet is excellent ! Good neighbour (close to Diagonal station). I'm recommending this hotel.,5,2024,02,26
22,Great Location,"This was a Birthday treat for me and overall it was a great hotel, the only downside was when we arrived the rooms weren't twin as requested and the phone didn't work in the room. After a long day travelling it was a bit of a let down that a 5 star hotel couldn't get the room ready correctly and it took some time to fix it. That aside the rest of the stay was great, the room was lovely very comfy beds with everything you'd need inside. The bathroom sink in the room took some getting used to. There were nice touches like a bottle of wine on arrival and a Birthday card and chocolate for me on the day. The staff were really helpful, booking shows and trips nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was ok plenty of choice and a table service too. The hotel is in a excellent location in the new town so many restaurants within walking distance and plenty of shopping and sight seeing in the area. To get to the old town it's 10 euro in a taxi so all round it's an excellent hotel.",4,2024,01,24
22,Amazing Experience at Ohla Eixample!,"We had a wonderful 5-night stay at this hotel. Its location is ideal, right in the city centre, and all the staff were friendly and full of recommendations. 
The room was spotless and the breakfast delicious. I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,01,21
22,"Great, fun, friendly hotel!","Excellent place, amaizing restaurants, great staff, delicious breakfast. 
We loved it and it was perfect for our daughter aswell. 
Very good location and easy reach to all attractions either walking or by public transport. For sure we will return as it suited our needs.",5,2024,01,18
22,Wonderful New Year and Birthday experience.,"We booked here for a weekend City break and it was my husbands 50th Birthday. I had organised before our trip for the ‘experience team’ to decorate the hotel room with balloons, cake, Cava and even photos of us I’d sent via email which they hung from the balloons this was a surprise for my husband and it was just so lovely when we arrived at the room. It was a real special moment and I thank them for doing this for me.
The hotel was superb in every way. It had a relaxing vibe which was welcomed having left 4 kids at home!! Ha ha!! The staff were super helpful at reception and always happy to advise and recommend and guide us on our sight seeing.
The rooms were fabulous and such comfy beds and pillows. Lovely decor throughout and every comfort we could have wished for. Breakfast was lovely .
The location was spot on. Close to all the high end shops and great access to the metro.
The roof top pool was a lovely temperature for December.
We will definitely stay again when we return to Barcelona.
Thank you to all the staff for making our New year and birthday celebrations so very special.",5,2024,01,11
22,Fantastic start to our new year,"Great place! Lovely, helpful staff. Pool was fab, even in January! Varied breakfast with many choices, very quiet at night so we all slept well. Conveniently close to Diagonal station. Walking distance to great shops and many restaurants. We are so happy we stayed here and would return. ",5,2024,01,05
22,"Plenty to like at this convenient, moderately-priced design hotel","I stayed at the Ohla Eixampla for one night in mid-December 2023.  The rate was approx 200 EUR including breakfast.  This is a 'design hotel' and the smart interior leads with plenty of polished concrete, glass and steel - if that's your taste then there is plenty to like.  The room is ample (no luggage rack, no his n hers, no separate toilet, but a large, walk-in shower, writing desk, mini-bar, coffee machine and plenty of space to hang clothes).  The courtesy set is local, green, and appropriately understated.  Breakfast is a generous buffet with plenty to cater to most nationalities.

The hotel's real draw, however, is the location.  It's in a leafy suburb with plenty of local shops, a huge array of excellent restaurants (including a Michelin 1* and high-end Japanese on-site) and one of the city's best bakeries literally around the corner.  If you are in Barca for the food, you won't run out of options for at least a week!  I ate at Windsor (across the road) and recommend it.  La Rambla and Sagrada Familia are 25 minutes on foot and the metro (Diagonal) is two blocks east.  The staff deserve a special mention, too, as ""helpful"" barely does justice.

Drawbacks are few:  there is no parking included but they are happy to whisk away your car for 37 EUR per day.  I didn't have a chance to try the lap pool on the top floor or the gym. For central Barca the Ohla Eixample was just what I needed.",5,2023,12,27
22,Great experience at Ohla Eixample,"We had a wonderful stay at Ohla Eixample in Barcelona. Super friendly staff (Renata, especially), great breakfast, comfortable room and nice location. They even emailed us ahead of the stay so that we could request the type of pillows we wanted - along with other options. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,12,14
22,Perfect place with the family ,"Great hotel... clean, friendly, accomadating and in a great area. It is in the 'newer' part of town which is wonderful in its own right, but is close enough to the older part of town to walk pretty much anywhere. Convenient shopping and groceries on the same block. Great full breakfast with many choices that was included with our room. Would highly recommend. ",5,2023,12,03
22,Top hotel!,"I was here for 3 days 2 nights. Ohla is a nice hotel with clean spacious rooms. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. In the hotel is a restaurant with Michelin star that I want to recommend. 
",5,2023,12,01
22,A Fantastic Hotel experience!,"Our stay at the Ohla Eixample was a great experience. Arriving early in the morning, we were offered a private, clean area to refresh ourselves after a long trip, and begin our day in Barcelona. Once checked in to our room, we were thrilled at the service of everyone at the Hotel. There is no doubt that we will visit the Ohla Eixample next time in Barcelona. ",5,2023,11,22
22,"''Indice of Empathy'' in Ohla Exiample hotel, Barcelone, Spain is one of the highest","I have been all over the world and I noticed that   5 stars hotels I have been in are at a certain range similar in their spaces functionalities, services and their food quality, but what makes the difference among them, I have noticed,  is the staff (management and employees) empathy.
Since then with these mind-set, my criteria to juge an hotel 5* become their staff empathy. So I created  my own criteria which is  ''Empathy Indice: EI"",  measuring  on scale   0 to 5 the degree of empathy in hotels.

EI in my case is the  kindness we treat  guests  with and the willing to customize services to guest needs with out asking for a return. 

As a trainer/ a coach, I have some special  needs to conduct well  my sessions. the interaction with the staff is quite intense and  it's for me the ideal time to juge the hotel's ''Empathy Indice""  and  compare it to other hotels.
 
 In Ohla hotel Eixample, ''empathy indice'' is one of the highest, 
The proof,  I know employees names, they know my name and  without loosing neither professionalism nor respect during their short  conversations with me and others guests.
In few words that you feel sincere and true, they ask, they listen and they  act and accomodate in a frame of their internal internal policy to serve. At the end  they wish you an excellent ""séjour"" 
I want thank Yves the manger, Nuric, Raul, Li, Rentana, Eli, Dani, Alpha, Lari, Saida, Mazzo, Jesos, Wendy Raul, David Adizia Christina,.
For those I do not get a chance to meet, I want thank them also , they have been in a hiden offices or places  doing their job to make us happy....

All the best.",5,2023,11,22
22,The best 5 star hotel in Barcelona ,"My second visit to Ohla Eixample, and I gotta say it's always excellent. There is no wonder that this hotel has 5 stars. The staff are always super nice and courteous as soon as you walk through the doors. The room is wonderful, spacious and clean. The location is perfect for all the sightseeing and food. And finally the meals/drink selection is excellent. Ohla Eixample is my favorite hotel ever, and I regularly will come back to Barcelona because of my experience
",5,2023,11,17
22,A wonderful experience!,This was an excellent hotel with fabulous amenities. The room was beautifully appointed and the room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast options were wonderful - tasty and filling! The perfect way to start a full day of walking. ,5,2023,11,01
22,A great stay ,"when we arrived the staff literally came out to the street to take our suitcases, check in was super smooth! The lady that checked us in was so friendly and instantly we felt relaxed. We were offered welcome drinks and checked into our room early as the room was available - which was great as we had left london at 6am. 
We stayed in a Junior Suite, which was large and well appointed, large floor to ceiling windows, comfy bed, huge bathroom and great tub and shower. The suite was super modern and very comfy. The turn down service is a nice touch, the room maids do a super job at this, lots of thanks to them.
The concierge helped us plan our visit and gave us a top 5 list of eateries close to the hotel. The map showed us where all the key attractions and landmarks were. 
Breakfast at the restaurant was great, lots of choice, not overcrowded or noisy. Relaxing and enjoyable. Nice music playing in the background! On the morning we left we couldnt access breakfast due to flight times so the staff had arranged a take away breakfast selection for us which was a nice touch. 
Location wise the hotel is great, its in a nice area, lots of local shops, restaurants and cafes literally a minute from the hotel. Main landmarks are easily walkable. 
The only small negative for us was that the roof top pool was not heated whilst our stay because there was a mechanical issue with the heater. Staff were very apologetic about this and unfortunately these things cannot be helped. The hotel manager also emailed us to apologise which was very courteous. 
The hotel isnt far from Barcelona Airport and we paid approx 40 euros for the taxi one way. 
We are in Barcelona next spring so will definitely return to this hotel! Overall a great experience, made special by the staff. ",5,2023,11,01
22,Above and Beyond,"This hotel was amazing. First, all of the usual hotel amenities were exactly as they should be. The breakfast experience was amazing and the staff very kind. But what really set them apart, for me, was their response when I got sick with Covid on our 3rd day. They were able to find me a room for 3 more nights (2 rooms actually), connected me to a physician and checked to make I had what I needed.  Moving hotels at a time when I was so ill would have been very challenging.  I cannot express my gratitude enough and would recommend this hotel to anyone. Also, this area of Barcelona is lovely. It is pretty quiet and at the same time lively.",5,2023,10,31
22,4 nights vacation,"Services and staff was at a highest level. Everything was perfect, so you can be sure it worth every dollar you paid. Had couple problems with TV, but it was fixed really fast. Location is also great, because it's not noisy at night, but still close to everything you want to visit",5,2023,10,27
22,A great hotel to stay in Barcelona ,"We stayed here for four days from 17th October to 20th. On arrival, we were told that we had been upgraded from Design room to a junior suite. Also, the doorman rushed out to take out our cases from the taxi. 
In the evening, when we came back, there was a bottle of cava in an ice bucket with plenty of ice & water. It was a nice touch.
The next day, we went for a day trip to Girona. On the way back, we were distracted 
by a man and a woman who sprayed a black liquid on our backs. They pretended to help with a bottle of water and tissues to clean , This distracted us and the man somehow took my wife’s necklace from her neck.
We only realised it was gone when we reached the station.
On returning to our hotel, we informed the reception who sent a very nine card with some chocolates.
We requested the front office Manager to give us a written report for insurance purposes. Mr. Javier Navaza was exceptional & did so immediately.
The hotel was central &within walking distance of La Sagrada Família & other sights. 
The service of the staff was the best ever in all the years of staying in nice hotels. 
Highly recommended.

22,Definitely a good choice!,"Ohla Eixample was our last stop after 8 weeks touring and planned as a 5 star finish to our journey - it didn’t disappoint!

From the time of our initial booking when they called me in Australia to confirm some specific details, to the moment we departed at 6am when one of the staff asked could they get us a coffee before our taxi, the experience was first class.

The junior suite and hotel amenities were fantastic but the offer of a turn down each night with chocolates and asking do we need extra towels, water or anything else  was beyond expectation and very welcomed.

With a roof top pool, 2 in house restaurants (one Michelin rated) and a great location close to many attractions, the Ohla turned out to be a great choice!",5,2023,10,24
22,Excellent all areas! Highly recommend:),"We stayed at OHLA for 4 days pre Virgin cruise and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful and clean with a very modern vibe. The staff is so nice and accommodating especially the doormen. They all made sure we were safe and communication was very good and the roof top is a must as it’s one of the best views in Barcelona. The breakfast buffet was very well prepared and a lot of variety of breakfast items for all appetites including fresh fruit juices and plenty of bread and pastries and eggs, meat and cheese items. The best was the turn down service that included a different chocolate every night. We were happy to get a good night rest after a lot of walking in Barcelona!",5,2023,10,15
22,"Overnight before cruise and home-base  on last day of cruise, between leaving port and late flight.  ","Outstanding…beautiful room, excellent and accommodating staff.  We came in from USA, we are no experienced travelers and wanted to plan as much ahead of time, ground transportation, options for local things to do, etc.  The staff helped me so much in all of the preliminary arrangements and they were so gracious and helpful while we were in Barcelona.  We would highly recommend them and we would absolutely stay there again. ",5,2023,10,15
22,Amazing experience; highly recommend!,"From the moment we were handed a glass of cava upon check-in to the helpfulness of all the staff, to the delicious breakfast, to the great location and the well appointed room…We were blown away! Front desk staff made great restaurant recommendations, everyone so helpful. We felt very caring for.",5,2023,10,14
22,Your excellent service,"We  stayed in this hotel for 9 nights from 29th of September until 8th of October I  say that  this hotel is 
One of the of the best hotels I’ve been in after Covid 
I want to say thank you for the hospitality and the wonderful service you provide to us 
And my special thanks to Javier Navaz ",5,2023,10,08
22,Outstanding hotel and amazing staff!,"We stayed in the attic room for 2 nights.  From the second the cab dropped us off the staff did everything possible to make our stay perfect. They came out of the hotel to get our luggage when we were dropped off a little away from the hotel.  They greeted us with a glass of Cava. They sat with us and mapped out directions where we planned to go.  The rooftop pool is beautiful and the lounge beds very comfortable.  The room was big, clean and comfortable.  Our deck was also big and inviting.  Breakfast offered many choices.  We had chocolate and Cava in our room when we came in our first night.  Every thing about the hotel was luxurious and we felt pampered from start to finish.  ",5,2023,09,25
22,Great Stay,"I have just spent a lovely 4 days at Ohla Eixample, the staff where very friendly and extremely helpful, they spoke great English. The room was immaculate and house keeping were very helpful in changing the bed configuration due to my error when booking. The pool was lovely and such a nice space to sit on the terrace.   ",5,2023,09,18
22,Wonderful,"I strongly recommend this hotel for everyone considering. We had a great stay for 10 days. The Reception, The Bar, The Kin Tsugi restaurant’s omakasse experience were all great. We will definitely return as soon as our dates are set. Thanks to all for everything.",5,2023,09,13
22,It's as good as it looks. ,"The bed, my god. I would stay here again purely based on the bed!
The room was clean, and well looked after by the staff during our stay. 
We used the rooftop pool most days of our stay. A perfect space to wind down from a day of exploring. 
The concierge was helpful, and gave great recommendations. 
The location of the hotel is convenient to great cafes and restaurants. Also very easy to get to public transport, although most of the time we locked our bikes on the street and rode for transport. 
Overall we had a great experience from every angle at Ohla Eixample and would definitely stay here again. Highly Recommended. ",5,2023,08,31
22,Fantastic Stay!,"Absolutely wonderful Oglala Eixample experience! After a flight delayed 4hrs., the front desk staff was so welcoming and helpful, it felt like just the hug we needed. Our room was a stunning contemporary sanctuary - king bed, luxury bath, and ample room to lounge. The neighborhood was safe and walkable. Looking forward to going back in the future!",5,2023,08,28
22,Thank you for your loving kindness,"During my vacation my sister passed away. The staff  saw how emotional I was and embraced me as if I were family and showed me loving kindness and support that I did not receive from the group I was traveling with, they went above and beyone to ensure I did not have any additional stressors (airport transport, etc.). We also had a person in our group who was difficult to deal with. They went above and beyond to accompany her even when she didn't deserve their hospitality.  Now for the property itself,  it is even more beautiful than the pictures you see, let me say how beautiful the hotel is, the rooms were bigger than expected with beautifully designed furnishing, the beds were so comfortable. I loved the overhead rain shower (if the waterbill is high then you know why, because I took long relaxing showers) The roof top pool was relaxing and fun at the same time, we enjoyed the beautiful roof top pool, there was a DJ on Friday night with great music. I will definitely 100% stay there again.",5,2023,08,28
22,Great place,"I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this hotel! The location couldn’t have been more perfect – right in the heart of everything I wanted to explore. The staff went above and beyond to make my stay memorable, always attentive and incredibly accommodating. Their warmth and helpfulness truly enhanced my experience.  Would stay again without any hesitation on my next visit!",5,2023,08,28
22,Our 2023 Family vacation to Barcelona,"My family and I came to Barcelona from 08/14 to 08/17 for vacation and we stayed at the Hotel Ohla example.  We had a spectacular time in this hotel.  We reserve 2 rooms. They accommodate us in a junior suite that was beautiful, and our sons' room was next to ours, the rooms were amazingly clean, and we had a king-size bed very comfortable.  The breakfast was perfect, they have a good selection of food including eggs to your style. Fresh fruit juices. A good and tasty coffee. The staff at the front desk was amazing, including their front desk manager Javier. The swimming area is very comfortable and cozy, the swimming pool was very clean, the water was warm, and has a beautiful view, you can even see the top of the Sagrada family from the roof. I don't want to forget the bartender at the rooftop bar, He prepares the best white sangria that I ever tried, made from scratch. Good margaritas and pina colada. This hotel has a good team working there, they make you feel that you are at home, not like a hotel. Ohla Eixample thank you for making our trip to Barcelona spectacular and amazing, hope to come back soon, Geovanna.",5,2023,08,22
22,Amazing Hotel!,"Extremely pleased with hotel and service of every staff member!  The staff at reception, the valet, the design of our room, great sheets and pillows.  Our lunch and dinner were also excellent (best burger we had in Spain).  
Overall just lovely and a GREAT VALUE!! We will be back for certain.",5,2023,08,15

22,‘Nice but not 5 star’,"A ‘nice hotel’, although I have had better five star experiences in a four star in terms of service . The staff are nice enough but nobody seems to go above and beyond that we experienced; in fact sometimes at the rooftop bar and at breakfast it was difficult to get service. However, great location, clean, OK breakfast, nicely appointed rooms and great rooftop pool. There are limited loungers on the rooftop and these fill up fast. With the pool area being a smaller space, children seem louder as there isn’t the space to spread out… and there are quite a few children here. Nothing overly negative to say about this place but certainly not a five star experience.",4,2023,08,07
22,"Overall a very enjoyable and comfortable place to be based when in Barcelona,  a truly beautiful city with lovely people. Highly","A very centrally located hotel, with lots of choice eateries around.  Well served by the metro within walking distance. Big rooms are clean, modern and stylish with good and quick service.  Great staff , very friendly and helpful.  Inhouse Michellin-star restaurant providing great brekky which we tried.  ",5,2023,08,05
22,The Perfect Hotel Stay,"Wow - this hotel is just gorgeous! When we arrived early on the Saturday morning, we were greeted by very friendly, staff on reception. Check-in was easy, and even though we were too early to check in they offered to look after our bags, and directed us to shower facilities if we wanted to freshen up. 
We stayed at the hotel for 6 nights and it was just perfect!! Breakfast was included in our room choice, and it didn't disappoint - there was such a great selection including fresh fruit, cold meats and cheeses, cereal, hot bacon and eggs, and my favourite - the pastries!!! To compliment this there was a variety of fresh juices, coffee, tea and even champange. In addition to this you could order hot food from the menu - every day we had an omelette, which was delicious! 
The rooms were cleaned regularly, and every evening we arrived back to find chocolates on our pillows, and relaxing music playing in the background - nothing was too much trouble for the staff at this hotel! Furthermore the room was fully air conditioned which was great after a day of walking in the lovely, but hot sunshine! The rainfall shower and bath were also very welcoming at the end of, and beginning of a busy day. 
The hotel is in the most perfect location - the main sights including La Sagrada Famillia, Gothic Quarter and Arc du Triomphe are a 20-30minute walk away. The roof-top pool was the highlight of the hotel - we would often go in during the morning, when it was quieter: the perfect way to start the day.
Myself and my partner agreed that the staff made the stay what it was - the reception staff, breakfast hosts, security and cleaners were all so friendly and nothing was too much trouble for any of them. We cannot thank them enough for such a wonderful stay. If we were ever back in Barcelona we would stay there again and would highly recommend it to others :-) ",5,2023,07,22
22,"Lovely hotel, great location, friendly staff","Ohla Eixample is a modern hotel in a really nice area and great location. Upon arrival the front desk were really helpful and friendly. Water or fizz offered to start your holiday. One room was ready and the other was ready at 3pm. The ‘essential’ room was a nice size, lovely clean and modern feel room with a great shower and bathroom. The ‘junior suite’ is more of a very large room. There is not a lounge with a bedroom more of a large bedroom with a desk and sofa and plenty of space. Twin sinks, big shower and plenty of room. The corridors and dark but have a modern feel about them. We went to the roof top pool and bar each day. The first day was a bit slow but the management sorted it out and were very good in their approach to resolving any situation. The food was really nice, comes out as it’s cooked so there is always a chance you may finish your meal before the other is served. Plenty of choice for drinks and would definitely say try the sangria cava in a jug. It’s better value, not as heavy as sangria with red wine. Georg is a friendly server. To the management I would suggest that you do not allow people to bring their own drink or food to the pool. You lose business and also it is nicer that people eat at the bar area rather than round the pool. This happened on both days. The pool is a nice size and has about 8 soft beds to lay on bits a first come first served basis. Lots of fresh clean towels ready for use and replenished. Nice view from the pool and is heated to about 28 degrees. 
The breakfast is very nice and in the Xerta restaurant area. We didn’t eat at the Michelin star restaurant as shut on our days there. Nevertheless the breakfast was lovely. Great pastries, fresh food cooked to order and a great choice. Only setback is the drinks are self serve by a machine. The hot water for tea is tepid so tea isn’t great and the coffees are lukewarm. I understand that having a buffet service except for the freshly cooked saves staff and money but tea and coffee I feel should be served so is hot. Not a major problem, just my view. 
Overall this hotel is situated in a lovely area right near the two main streets running down to Plaça de catalunya and beyond. Many shops and restaurants bars line the streets with so much choice. The staff are friendly and really helpful. Checkout was simple (possibly Iria) and quick. With a pool, rooftop bar and great restaurants you will be hard pushed to find better especially for the money. Enjoy",5,2023,07,13
22,Amazing time at Ohla Eixample,"I stayed at this hotel while traveling through 3 cities in Spain and I must say the service here was top notch. When we walked through the door to check-in, the hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating, they offered drinks on arrivals and immediately told us to relax and enjoy our vacation! I was celebrating my 10 year wedding anniversary and there was a bottle of champagne and sweets waiting in the room for us…Such a nice touch. The bartender Robert at the pool bar was great and made the best drinks! The room was spacious and clean, the balcony was a very nice touch as well. The location was perfect we were in walking distant or short cab ride to all the sites we wanted to visit. I throughly enjoyed my time at Ohla Eixample and will definitely return. I would recommend this hotel when visiting Barcelona.",5,2023,07,09
22,Nice boutique 5 stars hotel,"Nice room with separate shower and toilet. Comfortable bed and fluffy pillows. My room has window but not a nice view to look out to. Drinking water in glass bottle, Nespresso machine with 2 coffee choices. Dark hall makes it quite eerie. Good breakfast with chefs cooking omelette as requested. Limited option when it comes to healthy breakfast. Take away breakfast was more than enough for 1 person. Great team manning front desk.",5,2023,07,05
22,Fabulous hotel and stay,"I stayed at  Ohla Eixample, Barcelona for 3 days a two weeks ago. 

Ohla Eixample is an urban boutique hotel and  is situated walking distance from La Pedrera, Casa Batlló and the Sagrada Família, and surrounded by luxury shops.

The check-in was very quick & smooth, and the room was ready even at 10.30am. The satff at reception were very friendly and approachable. One young lady even came with my friend and I to the end of the road to help us get a taxi. 

My room was very spacious and had all the amenities. The room was serviced and turned down everyday. It was so nice to come back to the room after a long day to treats and gifts. 

There are 94 rooms, 2 restaurants, 2 meeting rooms and a beautiful rooftop bar. I loved the interior of the hotel very much. Very elegant & simple.

Kintsugi is the new Japanese restaurant whereas Xerta is awarded with a Michelin Star since 2016 and officially certified by the Jewish community, Xerta is the first and only Michelin Star restaurant in Europe to offer kosher cuisine. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to eat dinner or lunch here. The continental breakfast was very good with local products and eggs can be ordered too. 

The Skybar Terrace of Ohla Eixample is listed among the best rooftop bars in Barcelona on The Rooftop Guide. Sagrada Família can be seen from here. There is a small bar for drinks and snacks. 

Thank you  Carlos & and the team for  a wonderful few days and your hospitality.

22,Best Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"This is the third time we have visited Barcelona and stayed in Ohla Eixample. On this trip to Barcelona we had several flight delays,lost baggage, and  cancelled rental cars. We were exhausted to say the least. The whole Reception Team at Ohla we’re always eager to help and ensured that we had a positive experience in light of the setbacks. We are very grateful for their attention detail and impeccable customer service they treat you like family. Valentina and Fatima, the management team, are Fantastic! They helped us with every issue and ensured we had the best accommodations available. We highly recommend this hotel. We look forward to our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2023,06,28
22,The royal treatment,"My sister and I had the best experience at Ohla eixample. We received the royal treatment. All the staff were warm , welcoming and professional. The service was impeccable and always with a smile. Their recommendations of restaurants were spot on. The breakfast served in the hotel was delicious  with many choices. Shout out to Oscar the Host in the restaurant he made you feel like family. Last but not least Daniel at the front desk you really made trip special. ",5,2023,06,23
22,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in Barcelona before heading on a Virgin Voyages cruise. We loved it so much, we will be staying a couple more nights before heading back to the USA. Everything about this hotel was great - the room, the front desk attendants, the view from the rooftop pool, the bar service and drinks, doorman (more like security in the evening), and the toiletries. I typically bring my own lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner - no need to do that if staying here. Their products are amazing and smell wonderful! Another thing to note: the air conditioning in the room works, almost too well lol - not a bad thing, but great to know if you are traveling with someone like my husband who likes the air on “freezer” 😜 
The shower is fantastic - choice of rain head or wand, temperature is consistent, and the bath towels are huge and great quality. 
Lastly, the location of this hotel is perfect. Easily walkable to all places we wanted to visit, 24 hour store for drinks right around the corner, safe area and easy to catch a cab (when needed)",5,2023,05,26
22,Wonderful Hotel,"Loved loved loved this hotel! The service was incredible. The front desk was so nice and helpful with highlighting all the best sights to see on a map of the city. The location was walkable to everything, which was great! The breakfast was absolutely delicious! I usually am not one to eat breakfast at the hotel, but I actually looked forward to it because it was so good. The rooftop pool was also amazing once we had nice enough weather to enjoy it. If I'm ever in Barcelona again I would happily stay at this hotel again. Thank you!",5,2023,05,23
22,The ultimate luxury,"Very rarely do I write a review before I’ve left the doors, but Ohla was truly an experience. The staff were extremely helpful and caring, and they helped from everything from recommendations to hailing a taxi. It is clear that they take pride in the hotel and making everyone’s experience a wonderful one. 

The room was fabulous - not too small at all and smelled delicious as soon as I entered. They had thought of everything. I loved the large bath tub and the bath products. I even had a little terrace! I slept very well here after very little sleep and a full day of sightseeing. 

The location was very good for sightseeing as well. Would definitely come back again, and now I really hope to!",5,2023,05,21

22,"Friendly, well positioned cool boutique hotel.","From the first greeting by the super friendly and helpful reception staff, with the offer of a nice cold glass of Cava to the efficient calling of a taxi on our departure three days later, this hotel offers a great experience. The rooms are very much ""designed""with a lot of the skeleton of the hotel still showing and the outdoor areas shoe-horned into the space, but the beds are super comfy and the bathrooms well equipped with great baths and showers. The infinity pool on the roof is wonderfully warm to swim in and super cool to use. Excellent breakfasts too.",5,2023,04,27
22,I can't rave enough! Best experience here!!,"Amazing boutique hotel. Excellent staff amazing experience . Everyone was so accommodating and helpful with directions helping us with bags and taxis even purchased Nou tickets for us! Only thing some might not like is you can see in through the bathroom the wall is glass, was great for us because we could see our two year old in the bath from the bedroom but might not be as convenient for teens. But breakfast was great entire stay was just perfect!",5,2023,04,22

22,Staff were fantastic and made us feel so welcomed!,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend (Fri-Mon) as she was running the Barcelona Marathon. The hotel is a boutique style hotel – we had a double room which was spacious and had a little veranda to sit out in when the weather was warm. 

The location of the hotel was great – around 20 minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, perhaps 30 minutes from La Rambla street (nice restaurants) and you can hop on one of the bus tours of the city (highly recommended) in just a 10 minute walk. Plenty of shops, supermarkets and restaurants of all styles everywhere  around the hotel.

The rooftop pool in the hotel was fantastic – seating area has around 8 very comfortable loungers (and many more chairs) but get there early as I would imagine it fills up quickly when the weather is warm! We didn’t have any problem getting a place by the pool however and the pool itself is nice and warm with great views over Barcelona. A really nice way to relax after a day walking around the city.

The bar served good sized portions of quality food and the wine is exceptional and even better being very reasonably priced (30 euros for an excellent 2015 red where it would easily be twice that much in the UK) 

What set this hotel apart however is the staff – without exception everyone we met was warm, friendly and very welcoming, the reception staff in particular. They made us feel very special and were so kind to my wife, congratulating her on completing the marathon and providing a generous gift in the room afterwards which was lovely. I can honestly say that of all the hotels we’ve ever stayed in, we’ve not been made to feel more welcome as I have here. We’d thoroughly recommend Ohla Eixample to anyone thinking of visiting Barcelona.

22,Great Stay at Ohla,"We absolutely loved our stay at Ohla Eixample. From the check-in experience with Albert to our check-out with David, the hotel and staff exceeded our expectations for the six nights of our stay. Of particular note: the delicious breakfast each morning in the hotel restaurant, the user-friendly coffee maker in the room, daily cleaning and turn-down service, the speedy elevators, our balcony overlooking the quiet courtyard, and the friendliness of the staff. 

We walked everywhere in Barcelona (never took city transit) and we found that the hotel was beautifully located within easy walking distance of the Eixample, La Rambla, Barcelonetta, Gracia and El Born neighbourhoods. It was also within reasonable walking distance to the trains to Sitges (Passeig de Gracia) and to Girona (Barcelona Sants).  Albert gave us some great recommendations for local restaurants and wine bars, and they were all solid suggestions. The hotel is also very close to supermarkets, banks and coffee shops. We will definitely return to Ohla on our next visit to Barcelona. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2023,03,20
22,Great place to stay,The staff were fantastic - nothing was to much trouble for them. I only had breakfasts but the food was lovely - great variety on offer. Room was great - lots of space and lovely decor. Location for Gaudi houses fab,5,2023,03,20
22,Perfect hotel to enjoy Barcelona,"Excellent hotel with very nice rooms. No carpet, which is great. 
A small suggestions for improvement : add an extra layer on the matress for superb comfort.
Pool has nice view on Sagrada Familia and water temperature was good (early March).
Staff very friendly and helpful
Breakfast : excellent buffet to start the day.

Situation is perfect as it is close to the Metro (+- 600m ?)  which connects to all major things to see or do.",5,2023,03,09
22,Fantastic experience at the Ohla Eixample!,"I was delighted with my recent 4-night stay at the Ohla Eixample. The entire experience from arrival through departure was excellent. This boutique hotel is located in one of Barcelona's best neighborhoods and close to great dining, shopping, nightlife, and just steps from the Metro. The hotel is sleek, modern, and minimalist. My guest room was well lit, comfortable and everything (including free Wi-Fi) worked well. I took advantage of the daily breakfast buffet, which offered a nice selection and made-to-order eggs and omelettes. Impeccable housekeeping and nightly turndown service were greatly appreciated too. Lastly, the staff was warm, welcoming, helpful, and professional. Thank you to Javier and the Ohla Eixample team for helping to make my visit to your city so comfortable and memorable!",5,2023,02,07

Breakfast, Internet and showers all very good - location convenient for most things and nice for walking from.

Only tip, if travelling with young children, ask for a room away from the street, motorbike/bin lorry noise can be loud and woke tbe baby (not hotels fault, so still 5 stars, but being away from the road would help the baby) ",5,2023,02,01
22,Premium service and accommodations,"I stayed at the hotel for 4 days during a week of vacations with my wife in January 23. Hotel is well located near bus stations, metro and restaurants. I asking distance to great shops. Concierge wrote a few restaurants to eat. Great choices!!!!! Not touristic, with great great food. We stayed at a suite (larger than regular accommodations). Bed was better than mine at home(!). Great shower, lots of storage space. Wi-Fi fast and reliable. Breakfast is superb with several options and also made to order. It will be my choice when back to Barcelona",5,2023,01,28
22,10 out of 10,"Fabulous hotel, absolutely love the interior design, staff where so helpful, breakfast was perfect and rooms where beautiful and comfortable, couldn’t ask for more and will definitely be staying again ",5,2023,01,24
22,Perfect Hotel in the heart of BCN!,"We recently stayed in Ohla Eixample on our first visit to BCN and it was such a great experience. The hotel itself is located a reasonable walking distance from the main sites and really amazing restaurants are just around the corner. The service was also great - particularly by David and Daniel. They were always 2-3 steps ahead with solutions and made us feel right at home. The hotel also has a great breakfast buffet! Some guests have mentioned regarding the design and features of the hotel room itself - but we found the rooms very comfortable. Though minimalist in design, our Junior Suite was spacious and we slept really well! Thank you to the Ohla Eixample team - we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to BCN!",5,2023,01,17
22,A wonderful stay,"I was at this hotel for the New Year and did book the dinner for the eve which was amazing.
I enjoyed the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff that contributed to such an excellent stay.
The room was well appointed and kept spotless.
The location is excellent and an easy walk to the Métro for wider exploration of the city.
A minor shortcoming was the lack of tea pots to steep my morning cuppa, they have them but not at breakfast - the 4star hotel in Paris did with the same machine nature of production that appears to be norm post pandemic.
The breakfast is excellent but the provided eggs were cold in the server- I subsequently ordered omelettes which were great!
All in all a great stay!",5,2023,01,17
22,We loved this hotel! Definitely recommend!,"We had a fabulous time at the Ohla Eixample. The hotel is in a fantastic location, it's clean and comfortable, and the staff gave exceptional service. Everyone we interacted with, from the front desk to the housekeeping to the breakfast waiters, everyone was so helpful and friendly and lovely. I have to give a special shout-out to the men concierges, both the daytime and the nighttime - they were incredible, so patient and nice and helpful - and thanks to them we discovered the best places to go. Our room was great and the beds were SO comfortable, wow. We also loved the ""experience menu"" that let us choose in advance the type of pillow, sheets, aroma, etc. so it was truly pampering. (The only thing that was slightly disappointing was that our bathroom didn't have a bathtub, only a shower, but I guess that was because of the type of room I chose - so if having a bathtub is important to you, make sure you choose a room that has one). And the room was SO quiet, which was really nice too. The housekeeping came around every evening to bring us extra chocolates, water, (and cava!) and even to tell us when rain was expected the following day. We were celebrating my birthday and they made me feel special with a lovely card, cava, and chocolates. We appreciated all the complimentary water bottles. And on the last day, since we were leaving early in the morning and didn't have time for the breakfast, they packed us a lovely to-go bag with a delicious sandwich, pastries, fruit, water and juice. Oh and let's not forget the rooftop pool - wow, what a view! Beautiful. All in all we had a delightful stay and would definitely stay there again!! Thank you!!",5,2023,01,17
22,Beautiful and modern boutique hotel,"This is a very fashionable modern boutique hotel in a great location. Walking distance to great shopping, food and site seeing. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Surprisingly large room for Europe.",5,2023,01,07
22,Great experience at Ohla,"The staffs are extremely helpful and enthusiastic. The experience is amazing! The temperature is comfortable, and the room is clean. We went to some restaurants that the front desk recommended, they were authentic and close to the hotel.",5,2023,01,06
22,Very nice hotel,"Excellent service and very nice rooms. Excellent bed, very good wifi, cleanliness is top notch. Only downside is perhaps a personal design taste issue than anything else, but I’m not fond of windows looking into the bathroom. The staff is very professional and friendly. The breakfast is excellent.",4,2022,12,16
22,Lynn Gay Humphries,"I started my trip alone for 10 days and then was joined by a friend for 10 days.
I cant say enough about the Front Reception staff. Fabulous. If you called downstairs for something they were there almost before you hung up. Very knowledgeable also. 
This hotel has such a location on a quiet street just a block from Placa de Catalunya and another block  to Passeig de Gracia. These streets are full of first class shopping and dining. Very close to the Metro which is very user friendly for tourists.
The hotel breakfast was ample featuring both hot and cold selections including freshly prepared fried eggs. Impossible to find in Europe.
There was a Michelin starred restaurant and also casual dining in the bar. 
The room I stayed in was unusual with the sink being in the main room. Nothing I read on your site description prepared me for this. I did get an email describing the see through rainfall shower about a week before arrival. So I agree with the review that the layout is unexpected for most traditional hotel rooms. It is a great room for a single traveler. 
I would definitely stay there again but look into a more traditional room design.",5,2022,11,28
22,5 Star Hotel?,"My wife and I stayed in a suite the first week of November 2022. We were on the 4th floor. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is very dark inside, I think it's a stylistic thing, but too dark for me. The room was disappointing. The toilet was literally a water closet and it's located behind a facade. Inside there was no window and no ventilation. The bathroom is ""open concept"" so unless you like exhibiting your private bathroom habits including showering, you may not like this concept. Your partner can literally watch you shower from the bedroom area. Not my thing. We paid extra to include the breakfast, which was so - so. I would not choose it again, although it was convenient.  Instead go down the street for a croissant and coffee. Save  your calories for gelato! Both my wife and I found the mattress too hard. Another thing that was inconvenient was that maid service often did not show up until later in the afternoon after we already had a full day and were resting up for the evening. Awkward. Like I said, the service desk was fine and they even changed dollars to euros without adding an excessive convenience fee. There is also an ATM down the street if you prefer. Hint: The Italian restaurant on the same block was very good and reasonably priced.  Next time, I'd prefer to be in a hotel closer to Las Ramblas.",3,2022,11,08
22,Perfect stay,"Can't recommend this hotel enough! 

In a very safe area in Barcelona, located close to the Metro and city centre. 

The rooms are beautiful and have everything you could possibly need. Toiletries, towels and water were replaced daily as well as room cleaning. 
Service from staff was exceptional with Cava on arrival. 
Breakfast was a real highlight with a great range of choice, our favourites were the cold meats and cheeses!

The rooftop pool, although small is a fantastic addition and I really recommend the strawberry mojito from the bar! 

We also went to the Xerta restaurant, whilst not our favourite in all of barcelona was still a wonderful experience. Mainly due to the service our waitress was phenomenal! Some of the food, including the rice dish was a bit salty but on the whole the food was very tasty. 
The tapas bar was even better! 

Would 100% stay again!",5,2022,11,07
22,Our home away from home,"We had visited Barcelona in the month of September 2022 for 5 days and we choose after a lot of deliberations OHLA EXIAMPLE . Although we weren't sure what we were getting into as hotels in big cities are very commercial but to our pleasant surprise we encountered the best hotel staff.. Be it at the reception, at the restaurant, room service and even at the concierge.
The rooms are spacious the bed very comfortable, equipped with a mini bar and the bathroom is unique and different from others i have seen..
Overall everything is excellent and kudos to the staff for keeping the standards high.",5,2022,11,06
22,Fantastic customer experience,"Location is amazing, hotel is great but what really makes it special is the super friendly and always helpful staff. they create an outstanding customer experience. We had and absolute devine stay at Ohla Eixample in the heart of barcelona. Thanks for having us.",5,2022,11,02
22,"Lovely place, great room, wonderful team","We spent a couple of nights here on a road trip and had a great time. Very stylish and functional room. Lovely rooftop bar and pool, but most of all such a welcoming and helpful team. It's also a great location in the city as a base to explore and lots of nice restaurants nearby. Thank you!",5,2022,10,28
22,Amazing stay.,"I stayed here with my friend at the end of August and this has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in for it's service alone.
We were greeted with a glass of fizz and once we had settled into our room a bottle was delivered to us.
The rooms were absolutely immaculate and the staff literally can't do enough for you.  All staff speak several languages perfectly and are friendly and keen to ensure that you are enjoying your stay.
The pool area was so clean and fresh towels are provided constantly.
The rooftop bar has a fantastic selection of drinks and really good wine which I thought was quite rare for a bar.  The music that is played all day is super chilled and the atmosphere is just so relaxing that you can chill all day long.
I cannot wait to return.",5,2022,10,27
22,Exceptional,"If attentive, friendly and helpful staff are what you have in mind as a rewarding hotel experience… look no further that the Ohla. We celebrated our anniversary with this trip and from front desk to wait staff congratulated us at every turn. Excellence in the kitchen (2 Mich stars) full breakfasts included and clean, modern, comfortable rooms…. I mean… WHAT ELSE can you ask for?
Enjoy your time in Barcelona!

22,Lovely base to explore Barcelona,"Great location, close to center. The room is very spacious and the staff very friendly and polite. The check in was very smooth and a welcome drink is available on arrival.
Great breakfast buffet all the usual options and the a la cart options are a plus. 
The rooftop pool is just perfect and a must after a full day of sightseeing.",5,2022,10,19
22,Pleasant Surprises,"We had a great room that was very spacious and well appointed. While the room faced the road, we didn’t hear any street noise. The hotel unexpectedly provided a nice surprise for our return visit and another birthday surprise for the following day.",5,2022,10,16
22,A delightful end-of-cruise experience,"This lovely hotel was selected for us as an extension of a cruise and I only wish I had booked more nights.  The location is perfect to explore Barcelona on foot.  The service was over and above when it came to booking a private tour guide.  The included breakfast had choices from hot traditional American breakfast choices to delicious yogurt and fruit, cereal, baked goods, and savory cheese and charcuterie offerings.  My husband and I agreed it was the most comfortable bed we have experienced.  We were on a low floor and I did not hear any street noise.  In short, Ohla Eixample will be our choice for future Barcelona stays.",5,2022,10,05
22,Lovely base to explore this wonderful city,"This well situated hotel was a delightful base to explore all Barcelona has to offer.  The room was comfortable and well appointed with all the small things that make a stay more comfortable.  It was the roof top bar that made this stay.  A lovely place to recover after a hard days sightseeing and before going out again, with the city laid out around you.  Breakfast was very good and sufficient to get us to dinner.  Service was very good whether at reception, breakfast or the bar, they couldn’t do enough to make your stay.  Highly recommend this hotel",5,2022,10,02
22,Wonderful stay at the Ohla Hotel for a birthday celebration.,"My husband and I celebrated his 50th birthday at the Ohla Hotel, after reading all the good reviews, and the reviews were spot on!
I emailed the hotel in advance to ask for champagne to be arranged in our room, as I explained it was my husband’s 50th birthday. Not only did they arrange the champagne, but added tied balloons, and chocolates, which we thought that was a lovely touch.
The following day, a lovely member of staff came to our room, which was my husband’s actual birthday, and surprised him with a complimentary bottle of cava, birthday cake, birthday card and a balloon!
The staff at the Ohla Hotel truly went over and above, and made my husband’s birthday even more special!
We had a lovely room, which was spotlessly clean, and a delicious breakfast each morning.
We enjoyed sitting by the rooftop pool in the afternoon, after all the walking and sightseeing we did, and the rooftop bar at night was amazing!
Perfect location, and perfect staff too!",5,2022,09,25
22,Marvelous,"Just stayed at this fantastic hotel.  The communication beforehand was exemplary and it continued during our stay.  ALL of the staff were so professional and helpful.  The hotel accommodations were really thoughtful and modern, not to mention immaculate.  The location was also  superb!  I cant say enough about our experience here.  Thank you to all opf the staff for making our 4 night stay so wonderful.",5,2022,09,21
22,may be repeated,"Excellent location, good room size, and the air conditioning was perfect  

The breakfast area is small so we were given two options to wait or sit in an area a little further from the buffet

The reception and staff were very professional and fast service",4,2022,09,20
22,Excellent hotel,"Great location, close enough to centre, but far enough away to be quiet. Superb room, staff very friendly and helpful. Room very spacious and pleasant balcony. Great breakfast, all the usual options plus a la carte..",5,2022,09,12
22,"Great facility, location and service - a must for Barcelona","Excellent hotel, great location (Diagonal/Paseo de Gracia), beautiful facilities, super friendly service - a must for a Barcelona stay. The rooftop swimming pool is not huge but really pleasant on a hot day. Rooms in a very contemporary but smooth style.",5,2022,09,04
22,Excellent hotel and services,"A total delight- staff are very friendly and welcoming they really went over and above to make our stay as comfortable as possible 
It’s a great location, for shops and attractions 
breakfast exceeded my expectations and again the staff and chef went above and beyond",5,2022,09,04
22,Great location/boutique hotel,"As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the reception staff, offered something to drink while checking in.  Our room was very clean.  The breakfast was delicious everyday.  The pool was a great plus after a long day of sightseeing.  However, there were never enough beds/seats.",5,2022,08,26
22,Excellent location and service,Super hotel within easy walking distance of a host of attractions and close to hop on hop off bus service. Staff are incredibly helpful and rooms great for a city hotel. The roof top bar and pool are an extra special treat.  Great place to stay in this wonderful city.,5,2022,08,25
22,Excellent hotel in beautiful Barcelona,"We had a really lovely spacious and airy attic room with a balcony overlooking the rooftops. The staff were very helpful and made excellent restaurant recommendations and bookings for us. A welcome glass of champagne at check-in was very well received after a delayed flight!
And the location was perfect for a walk into the centre but removed from the chaos of the tourists. Pretty tree lined streets.",5,2022,08,20
22,Outstanding hotel in a beautiful area,"Beautiful hotel in an upscale neighborhood not far from Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and walkable to the Rambla, Gothic Quarter and even Gracia. The rooms  mare sleek and modern and the hotel is impeccably maintained. The service is outstanding. My husband became ill  during our stay and they had a doctor on call. A lovely touch for those who need it is that their Michelin starred restaurant, Xerta, will serve a kosher meal on Wednesday evenings to diners who order it in advance.",5,2022,08,14
22,Everything you need,"Great location, superb service, excellent restaurant and a nice atmosphere at the hotel. If I would be forced to find something to complain at, it would be the presentation and explaining of there (great) winelist. The food and winepairing was not the best.",5,2022,08,09
22,Amazing!,"Check in was easy and unfussed, and importantly friendly and helpful with information.
Room was spacious, modern and with clean lines. 
What made it so special and a real nice touch was it was my wife's birthday and they left a bottle of champagne in the room, when we got back from a tour.",5,2022,08,08
22,Amazing stay,"Amazing stay at Olha Eixample, staff went above and beyond to make our stay extra special, we received a room was upgraded which is always a bonus. Spacious and modern rooms, definitely recommend in room breakfast worth the extra charge as it was incredible. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back again.",5,2022,08,01
22,Great hotel with nice pool area!,"Very happy about my stay at this hotel. Breakfast is great and pool area too. The only thing that is missing is a nice/cool cocktail bar at the roof. At the moment. Its a bit relaxed and people are laying there in swimsuits early evening too so you don’t get any nice evening vibe. So I recommend to go out for a drink if you are interested in that. However, I could definitely go back again!",5,2022,07,28
22,"Darling Boutique Hotel,friendly Staff, Great Breakfast, Awesome roof top pool area bar and very nice rooms-good location","I highly recommend this Darling Boutique Hotel.

22,LOVED IT!!  Will stay there again!,"One of the best hotels we have ever experienced.  Small hotel but had everything!  Onsite parking, rooftop pool, modern  clean rooms, turn down service, free breakfast buffet and friendly staff!  Conveniently located to everything within walking distance. 

We had an amazing time and plan to stay there again next time we visit Barcelona!",5,2022,07,23
22,Exceptional Barcelona Boutique Hotel!,"I was fortunate enough to stay here for 4 nights in an attic room.
From the moment we entered the hotel we were made to feel welcome and I knew straight away we had made a great choice.
Exceptional staff, beautiful rooms.

The staff, the food and beverages - everything was exceptional! Amazing service as well! Special thank you to the front desk personnel! The rooftop pool and bar were a great benefit.",5,2022,07,15
22,Very nice hotel,Great location. Service was very good. Attentive and friendly staff. Room was very clean and the bed was one of the best I have ever slept in at a hotel. Rooftop was nice. I did not get the chance to eat so I cannot comment. I would for sure consider returning to this hotel.,5,2022,07,10
22,Nice boutique hotel,"Boutique hotel just off Passeig de Gracie, so biggest draw is the convenient location. Rooms were quite big, I had one with a floor to ceiling window which allowed lots of natural light in. Downside is that the sound does come in at night so if you are a light sleeper ask for something on the quieter side. Design wise it is modern, and the bath is separated from the bedroom by a glass panel, which you should note if you are not traveling with your SO. No complaints and would recommend",4,2022,07,09
22,Wonderful experience,"Sharing my wonderful experience of our stay at this hotel. Both my son and I have enjoyed our stay immensely. The facilities are awesome, and the rooftop pool and the view are perfect. The ambiance of the music was relaxing and joyful. Breakfast is rich and super tasty and the staff is extremely helpful, accommodating, and efficient - we could not have asked for more.
 
Well done and keep up the excellent work. We’d be sure to stay with you again on our next trip to beautiful Barcelona.",5,2022,07,07
22,Absolute perfect stay,"I was totally impressed with our stay. From start to finish. The staff were polite and welcoming. We were welcomed with champagne and i had mentioned in an email months prior it was a special birthday and the staff prepared a bottle of champagne in our room complimentary. The accommodation was perfect. The cleanliness was perfect. The only issue was our doors in our balconette were broken and we coulsnt open them but this wasnt something to ruin our stay
The breakfast had a wonderful choice and a range of types of breakfast.i would definitely ckme back here when in barcelona . Thankyou",5,2022,07,05
22,Ohla Eixample,"Lovely hotel, staff is awesome and the breakfast buffet is the best of any hotel we’ve stayed at. 
Great location, walked all over the city. Close to wonderful bars and tea. 
Pool area is small but nice",5,2022,07,05
22,Outstanding,"An outstanding hotel in a great location, staff excellent, really helpful from start to end. Great breakfast selection, lovely rooftop terrace. Faultless all round, our flight back to Heathrow was cancelled and rebooked, hotel made everything easier along with a classy touch of a bottle of cava and a nice letter.",5,2022,07,04
22,Beyond expectations,Very friendly and helpful staff. They know how to treat guests. Delicious breakfast. Nice rooms with great bed and shower. Fresh water refill in the room twice a day (or whenever you want) and they cleaned up every time they come in your room. Definitely worth the money.,5,2022,06,26
22,Modern and good location ,"Stayed here for 4 nights 
Booked as a city break 
Nice location. 
Easy access to all the tourist sites and some lovely places to eat. 
Lots of designer shops within walking distance. 
Friendly informative reception service 
Nice,large and light comfy rooms. 
Water in the fridge replaced daily. However, not really a fan of  the trend that a lot of hotels now do, for having a bathroom in view of the bed area and a window from the bed into the shower 
Might suit some but it’s not me ! 

Great breakfast and nothing too much trouble for the staff 
Large selection of items to choose from to suit everyone 

Was really an added bonus to have a swimming pool large enough to swim in the middle of the city on the roof terrace. 
Only fault was the decking area at the side of the pool damaged and the thin legs of the chair went straight through and I ended up with a bruised arm which could have been worse. The next day the chairs were put back and no repairs done to this area whilst we were there. 
For a hotel at this price would have thought this would get fixed as a priority 

Overall, was a great stay and offered everything we needed for a lovely short city break.",4,2022,06,25
22,Ohla Eixample,"Amazing hotel, great location just off La Rambla. Very classy in so many ways, greeted with Cava upon checking in. Room was very spacious and comfortable, excellent bathroom. Roof top terrace bar and pool was superb and offered great views of the city. Breakfast also was very high quality with plenty of choice and great service.  Only down side was music from a neighbouring nightclub until late. Still a positive experience.",5,2022,06,23
22,Great hotel & even better service! 5*!,"From before we even stepped foot into the hotel, someone had come outside to take ours bags inside and welcome us in with water & cava. It was unexpected & deeply appreciated! 

We booked through voyage prive & had a quick, easy check in. We were also told that we had been upgraded to a junior suite which was absolutely gorgeous- very spacious with top amenities & a complimentary bottle of cava. 

Breakfast was buffet style with lots of options of hot & cold options. We were able to get a late check out and leave our bags at reception. 

Overall it was an incredibly personalised experience & the service was 5* & faultless. Hotel was sleek and modern with great facilities and I would definitely stay again!",5,2022,06,22
22,Lovely stay in Barcelona,"We have been here for 3 out of 4 nights so far, lovely hotel in a great location (within 30 minute walk for most places). Junior suite was big and spacious and had lots of amenities in the room including bottled water which was added every day. Breakfast is also very good!

The rooftop pool is great, we had a slight issue with the our order one day but the staff have apologised and were really great about it, taking it off our bill.

We would definitely come back for another stay.",5,2022,06,19
22,Wow...,Wow... An outstanding level of service.the workers at the reception always smile and helpful.the hotel is very clean and coasy.we loved it there. One if the best hotels we ever stays. Thank you ohla for best time we wilk come beck soon... Itay hassom,5,2022,06,19
22,great boutique hotel and great location,"Great boutique hotel with. a very helpful and competent front desk staff with most speaking several languages. Very helpful in solving issues and making recommendations based on customer wants  ( no printed list, but will write names of places and directions). The hotel location is perfect and within walking distance of good restaurants, shopping and sights to see and photograph.

Rooftop pool and bar was laid back and relaxing.

Our deluxe room was had a oversized bath tub, long double sink vanity and a large glass shower. The toilet was in a separate area behind a door in the wall that was not conspicuous.

The bedside light switch was cool since it controls ALL lighting  with the settings of daytime, relaxing, nighttime, off. Mini frig, bottle water and Nespresso coffee in room.

The breakfast/brunch is a great option to choose that offered a variety of food  with Nespresso coffee, juices and cava.

Thanks for a great stay from a well traveled Florida Couple.",5,2022,06,17
22,"Great Location, Exceptional Service","Honestly don't have anything negative to share about our two nights at the hotel. The rooms were comfy, most places we wanted to go were within walking distance and the service was super friendly. Femke Pijnacker was looking after us and even helped move our luggage around!",5,2022,06,09
22,Simply Perfect,"This was our first trip to Barcelona, and we were “wowed” by every aspect of our trip. The folks at the Hotel Ohla Eixanple consistently went above and beyond to make our stay simply perfect. The rooms were great, bed was comfortable, and the included breakfast was delicious. 
Special thanks to Femke, who worked at the desk, and greeted us the first night of our stay. It’s so nice when someone goes the extra mile to make us feel so much at home. 
I’d highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona.",5,2022,05,29
22,Would be 5* except for the dang bed and water pressure!,"Lovely modern hotel with wonderful front desk and main (breakfast) restaurant staff.  Rooms well appointed and clean with nice bottled mineral water already in the fridge upon arrival.  The extra gift of a bottle of cava on ice was also a nice touch.  Breakfast spread was nice, although missing the tomate to make pan con tomate in the morning, and also no form of any potatoes (which seems to be common in hotels in Spain).  However, the OJ was freshly squeezed and the coffees ordered from staff were made barista-made and artfully presented.  Also included at breakfast was an endless supply of cava to make mimosas - so a big positive there.  If you needed an instant caffeine fix, the Nespresso Wall was impressive.  Rooftop pool only open until 7PM during our stay but was heated nicely and the barmen were great.

Now to the reason why it lost a star...  The bed made concrete feel soft by comparison and the shower had terrible water pressure (especially on the hand wand).  If those two items were remedied, I'd happily make this hotel my go-to spot for all visits to Barcelona and recommend it to all my friends - however the bed is a dealbreaker for me - but if you love a hard mattress, this is your place!",4,2022,05,09
22,Very excellent  hotel,"The hotel is characterized by the high quality of service in terms of greeting and receiving customers with all friendliness, in addition to the cleanliness of the rooms and their beautiful character, and the bed is very comfortable, and there is an employee in the Xera restaurant called Lusie, who is excellent in receiving the patrons of the restaurant, of course we will visit again",5,2022,03,29
22,Perfect Stay,"Gorgeous modern hotel which is spotlessly clean.  We had a junior suite which was lovely, the bed was the comfiest hotel bed I have ever slept in.

The staff are all friendly and helpful, a really great welcome.  We also arranged for balloons and a cake in the room for my daughters birthday and the staff went out of their way to make it special for her.

The hotel itself is in a really good location, walking distance to the shops, Gothic Quarter, Sagrada Familia and Guell Park.  Close by a lot of restaurants so plenty to do.  

Well worth a visit",5,2022,03,22
22,Fantastic service and location,"Even before you arrive the fantastic team from Ohla Eixample makes you feel that everything will be fine with your stay
I had an email about all the services they provide so I can choose everything before I arrive 
We had a transfer from the airport and back with a beautiful car and very professional service!
Me and my wife both had our birthday and Mr Raul even before we arrived suggested few restaurants and bars so we can choose and after i chose which one i wanted he did a reservation for us 
In our birthday we had a champagne gift from the hotel which was fantastic to see 
Everyone in the hotel very friendly and the breakfast was also beautiful 
The location very close to everything 
What else can you ask for a beautiful stay 
We will definitely go back to this hotel 
Thank you very much for all your services that made our birthday so special and for letting us stay in the room until 2 o’clock in the day that we left",5,2022,03,20
22,"Style, Service, Location, Location, Location","We arrived a bit haggard and were immediately treated to a glass of mint lemonade and a free upgrade to a jr suite - corner room, full of light and high enough from the street noise below. From there, things only got better - Ohla is adjacent to the Gothic Quarter, Plaza Catlunya, Plaza Reial, and a nice walk to the water. Our room was super comfy. We had a ton of questions for the concierge staff, all that were answered with a smile.  Even the morning breakfast was delish and substantial. We are now HUGE fans of Barcelona in large part due to our stay at Ohla. We will return.",5,2022,03,17
22,Service over Substance (but substance was great too!),"We spent 5 x nights at Ohla Eixample earlier this month. A few highlights:

1- We were checked in at 10am, well before standard check-in time, and offered our preferred room.

2- Nomatter the member of the team, anytime we went in/out of the hotel we were greeted by our names/with smiles

3- Staff extended our stay by a day at a discounted price, but more importantly they gave us an extremely extended checkout with no questions asked and without making us feel like they were doing us a favor (typical of hotels nomatter what class) 

4- Got us into a very small/very popular restaurant with the best table in the house (chefs table). 

All of that beyond the fact that the hotel is extremely well desiged with great FFE, lighting and overall vibe.",5,2022,03,01
22,Very nice hotel in downtown Barcelona,"We had a very nice stay at this hotel. Excellent location, helpful staff (level of English could be better in some cases...), and a beautiful junior suite on the 7th floor. The breakfast was also excellent.",5,2022,02,14
22,A delight,"We are fairly frequent visitors to Barcelona, usually  twice a year, on our way to our daughter and grand daughter in Mallorca. This time we wanted to try something different. We picked the hotel because we wanted to treat ourselves to the Xerta restaurant, and both were great choices. The hotel is super nice, the service is friendly and professional, the location is fantastic, so yes, from now on, for our stays in Barcelona will include a night or two in the Ohla Eixample. Just absolutely loved our stay, and the Xerta restaurant really was a memorable experience all by itself. We will be back.",5,2022,02,01
22,A most wonderful stay,"I booked this hotel (in jan 2020, the review is a bit late i know, a lot happend) for my fiancées surprise 30 year birthdaygift. We were heading to Barcelona to dine at Tickets and needed somewhere to stay as well.

At first i scouted all the hotels in Barcelona in november, but settled with Ohla Eixample. I made the booking a late afternoon, and the day after i printed the papers. To my surprice i had booked for that night and not the stay in january. I called the hotel and they were utmost helpful with my mistake, helped me correct the booking and found a solution to the already paid and ""used"" night.

When we arrived they helped with transfer from the airport, and it went smooth.
We arrived and the room was already ready for us, so we went up.  The style and decor went right into my fiancées taste, and we especially liked the tainted window between the bedroom and the shower. A moment later a flask of champagne arrived to the room. 

The reception helped us with other dinner and lunch bookings, maps of the city, reccommandations and a lot more. Always smiling. 

The breakfeast was as well so lovely! Everything your heart could or would desire! Yoghurt, juice, danish, warm dishes, bread and spreads, cake, fresh fruit just to mention a few. 

When we one day return to Barcelona, i would no doubt offer the money and stay here again.",5,2021,12,31
22,Fantastic boutique hotel,"Our hotel room is clean and beautiful. The design is contemporary the way we like it. The breakfast is great with all appropriate variety. Xerta is a great one Michelin star restaurant in the hotel. But their greatest asset is the staffs. They made us feel at home, especially Esther. We stayed there total 4 nights. The last 2 nights, Esther upgraded us to a room with a balcony. She even wrote “welcome back” on the bathroom mirror. Sweet, sweet touch that brought a smile on my wife face. The room upgrade and little note touched our heart.",5,2021,12,13
22,Loved it,Stayed 3 days at this hotel. Loved the newness of it and how attentive the staff were. Great location with lots of great restaurants and shopping close by. Great breakfast selection. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2021,11,30
22,Excellent if you want to treat your partner,Excellent room and staff beautiful hotel would highly recommend for a romantic trip away location is nice part of Barcelona breakfast could of been alittle nicer it had alot of choice of drinks but food was just OK,5,2021,10,29
22,You will love it!,"Excellent, modern and clean hotel with well trained, attentive staff. Superior location within easy walking distance to shopping, Gaudi masterpieces and dining.  Breakfast was included in our reservation and the quality was high.  High end coffee and tea in room as well.",5,2021,10,28
22,Fantastic hotel in Eixample,"We chose this location because it is close to my old flat nearby.  Great location, excellent restaurants and bars and quiet (for Barcelona).  The staff could not have been more helpful and the facilities were great.  Swimming in a roof-top pool at the end of October was special!",5,2021,10,27
22,Excellent Hotel in a perfect location,"After our second stay at the Ohla Eixample Hotel I am more than convinced that this is an excellent place to stay in the heart of Barcelona. The hotel has a very central location, good access to public transport, restaurants, sights and shops but is still very quiet, no big city noise.

The modern design of the hotel, restaurant and guest rooms  is very appealing and elegant. The rooms have a good size, comfortable beds and the open bathrooms allow enough privacy. There are high quality toiletry amenities, free water, bathrobes and slippers provided for guests. Also to mention the outstanding good room service. In general all staff of the hotel is extremely helpful, always friendly and charming. 

The breakfast buffet offers a very good selection of juices, teas and coffees, fruits, pastries, etc.. Also one can order any kind of freshly cooked breakfast meals. The atmosphere in the breakfast room is very pleasant and quiet.

The best feature is the roof top pool of a very good size to swim with a stylish terrace and roof top bar. Towels are provided, also for early swimmers. There is also a small gym, for which we didn't have enough time to use, it looks very well equipped for a having a serious workout.

We look forward to our next stay at Ohla Eixample Hotel, it's always a good experience!",5,2021,10,12
22,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a 3 day trip to Barcelona staying at the Ohla Eixample in a junior suite.

The whole experience was brilliant. The hotel is very well located, modern and has a great roof top pool. The rooms are clean, luxury and the beds extremely comfy. But the biggest compliment has to go to the staff. Smiles on faces, always happy to help and really make this a 5 star experience. They were brilliant. The service was really very good.

I rarely write such glowing reviews and have stayed in several hotels in recent months but this really is the best of all we have been to and i would recommend it to anyone who is going to Barcelona. 

We would definitely stay here or at another of the groups hotels again. 

Thank you to the staff for making our stay that much better.",5,2021,10,10
22,"Listen, this place is a 5 star hotel!","Our experience here from start to finish was pure quality. 
Upon entrance to the hotel we were swiftly taken from the front door & seated at a mezzanine reception, the staff were extremely fluent in English & offered drinks and chocolate covered strawberries. Suitcases were taken from us & placed in the room. It was our honeymoon so the room was decorated & a complimentary bottle of cava & ice left for us in the room to cool. 
The staff were more than helpful, tickets, tours & taxis were all booked from the concierge desk with no fuss. The rooms were spotless, as were the communal areas!
The roof top bar is just stunning, I would say it’s worth mentioning to the rooftop staff you are a resident as the service is taken up a notch. Francesco & his team do a fantastic job, they recommended a restaurant & even pulled items from the menu they thought we should try. The drinks are overpriced but the views, comfort & service certainly make up for it. 
Great selection of breakfast & it’s served until 11.30am for any late risers! I would most definitely return!",5,2021,09,30
22,10/10,"Really nothing but kind words about the hotel and the amazing staff that works there. They are so helpful and kind, offered us welcome chapmagne and always helped us when we needed it. As of the hotel, perfect location near the two famous Casas, right in the city centre. The rooftop bar and the pool are amazing, the view is incredible and you can take great pics there :) the hotel restaurant is also so good, the food is amazing and it’s worthy of the Michellin star it has. 10/10 would recommend to anyone",5,2021,09,18
22,Highly recommended,"Nice boutique hotel at a great location with a delicious Michelin star restaurant. 
Our stay was great we booked a junior suite pretty decent size, comfortable bed and linens with a balcony. The hotel rooftop and bar is pretty cool, Juan Pablo prepared delicious mojitos for us. 
I strongly recommend to try the restaurant Xerta, it was delicious and a very pleasant experience. 
The best part of our stay was the friendly and helpful staff a shout out to Joaquin, Raul, Carlos, Albert and Della for all your help and suggestions. All the restaurants that they recommended were great, also they helped with transportation and  sightseeing suggestions.
Also the hotel breakfast was good Nella, Eli and the rest of the staff do a great job.",5,2021,08,07
22,"Splendid stay, just what we needed after 18 months of staying home","We spent 3 nights at Ohla Eixample and had a wonderful stay in the heart of Barcelona. Key sites are walking distance away. The staff were excellent and went above and beyond in making it special. Special thanks to Carlos and  Jaoquin for all the help with bookings and recommendations. The hotel is modern, has a great rooftop view and comfortable rooms. The Michelin star restaurant (Xerta) is a MUST! Good job, we will be back!",5,2021,08,06
22,"Great location, lovely rooftop pool and fab staff","From the moment we stepped up to the concierge desk (no realising reception was up a level) we had a great experience.
The lady on concierge went above and beyond. We were 3 hours early for checkin so just expected to leave our bags but instead she upgraded us to a Suite as it was ready.
Room was great - comfy and classy furniture.
Perfect bed
Lovely shower and separate modern bath.
Loved the rooftop pool. Decent size for a “dipping” pool and plenty of seats.
Great toiletries, fluffy towels and bathrobes.
Perfect!
And a great buffet breakfast with good fresh fruit, hot & cold options.",5,2021,08,05
22,Best hotel in Barcelona - great value for your money,We had a fantastic week at Ohla Eixample. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to most things. The staff is exceptional and incredibly friendly and helpful. The breakfast is lovely and if something is missing or you nerd something extra it can be ordered from the chef in the kitchen. We bought an upgrade to a room with a balcony and it was a beautiful and well-appointed room and super clean. We will definitely return to this wonderful hotel. Thanks for a lovely week.,5,2021,08,02
22,Great Modern Design hotel!,"Excellent, modern hotel in quiet but very central location. Just off Diagonal. Friendly staff, good service, excellent breakfast. Pool and roofbar after walking in the city. Close to touristy, skopoing areas but also to Grazia where you can have a coffee off the pongos walking around with cameras..",5,2021,06,28
22,Perfect stay,"Beautiful rooms, super friendly staff and excellent breakfast. The heated pool on the rooftop is awesome. Moreover, the hotel is located right in the centre of Barcelona. Many sights could be reached by foot.",5,2020,03,06
22,Tries a bit too hard,"A very nice hotel in good location.  Personally I found it a bit too Uber cool and not very welcoming.  The rooms are very nice but I didn’t want to spend anytime in there ... the bar was nice but lacked any atmosphere and was always empty, that being said we did spend a fair amount time in there and the barman was lovely who made amazing cocktails and bought out tapas which we hadn’t ordered.

We really enjoyed our stay and all the staff were very helpful.  I just found personally the hotel was a bit dark and tried a bit too hard to be Uber cool.",4,2020,02,24
22,"Although the accommodations great, It is staff that make your stay an excellent one","All the staff are easy accessible, professional, nice, always helpful and always looking for ways to improve your stay. All of them will do their utmost best to make your stay an excellent one. Even the barman is an artist. It s always good to see that people are passionate at their Job. I have stayed in Hotels all over the world from South Africa to Dubai, yet this one is one of my personal favorite. I have decided that every time I visit Barcelona, this hotel will be my home away from home",5,2020,02,14
22,Wonderful short stay at Ohla Eixample,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently as a surprise for my husband's 50th birthday and I'm so glad I chose this hotel. The whole experience was wonderful. When we arrived, we were greeted with a glass of Cava and an upgrade to a Junior suite, arranged by Dave in the Experience Dept, which was unexpected and so lovely.  The room itself was spacious, beautifully decorated and laid out, and so peaceful - had the best sleep I have had for ages! The location of the hotel was perfect for us - it is in a great neighbourhood with access to the metro a few minutes away (brilliant shop a few doors down by the way with loads of yummy food - perfect for a picnic in one of the parks) and not too busy. I can't comment on the food at the hotel because we chose to eat on the go - too much to see and do! The staff were really welcoming and friendly, and so helpful - if you needed anything you only had to ask. 

I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to visit Barcelona - it is perfect for a relaxing break and would definitely stay here if we are lucky enough to return!",5,2020,02,12
22,The perfect hotel,"Can’t fault this hotel! Stunning modern rooms which are a great size. Really good location to get around Barcelona - nice to be slightly out of the busy centre. We loved the cocktails and bar  at the hotel. Lovely to sit on the rooftop with a drink. Recommended to anyone staying in Barcelona! 

Thanks for a lovely stay ",5,2020,02,11

22,Barcelona conference ,"Our favorite hotel to stay at in Barcelona is Ohla Eixample on Corsega.  The hotel is a well managed,  beautiful gem that is elegant as well as very comfortable.  The manager Javier Navaza has done a great job In building a great team.  Thank you for a great stay!  I recommend this hotel to all who visit Barcelona.",5,2020,01,18
22,The Perfect PLACE!,"You have endless choices when choosing hotels in BCN.....STAY HERE! I searched and am 100% glad I chose this place. Smaller boutique hotel with attention to service! The staff was amazing from the time I booked on line to check in to making dinner suggestions! Felt like the service of a Four Seasons! The breakfast was much larger than expected and we enjoyed it! Turndown service was really nice and a surprise of a different chocolate on our pillows and water bottles morning and night! I booked the room with a balcony and it was nice to have a little extra space and keep the door open!  The location is perfect!! Literally 2 blocks from the best shopping and walkable to most anywhere! Train stop also 2 blocks away, 2 stops to Sagrada Familia. There a couple markets on the street if you need anything! We travel a lot we like nice places, you will not be disappointed! ",5,2020,01,05
22,Family visit,"We stayed for 5 nights in the Ohla Eixample hotel. The welcome was very good. The reception staff was very friendly. The room (a junior suite) was superior with a lovely bed and bathroom. In the morning we had a wonderful breakfast.
The hotel is located in a beautiful part of Barcelona with many good restaurants and close to the Sagrada familia and other sights.
We will definitely come back in the Ohla Eixample!",5,2019,12,30
22,Excellent staff at a great hotel,"Xavier and his team do an excellent job.
Right from the check in when all three team members at the front desk rushed to help me with my bags when they saw me struggling to get through the door to the complimentary upgrade and the added touch of putting a soft toy in the room for my baby.
There was some confusion (or I could even call loss in translation) in relation to the complimentary upgrade that we were offered and Xavier came through and bumped us up not one but two categories which was a bonus since we really needed a bath tub for our baby as bathing him in the shower or the wash basin wasn’t an option.
The breakfast is great especially the option of having made to order eggs.
Some guests can find the design of the rooms (which can’t be changed) a bit odd, the shower doesn’t have screens or curtains as a result one can see their partner in the shower when sitting in the room. Something not everyone will be comfortable with.",5,2019,12,29
22,Superb hotel,"     My friend and I took a cruise with Oceania Cruises and decided to stay on in Barcelona.  The Ohla Eixample was booked for us.  It was wonderful.  It is located in a very popular section of the city, within walking distance to many stores and attractions.  The staff was anxious to please and very friendly.  Our room was top quality.  Our breakfast was included and the buffet was delicious.  I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone.",5,2019,12,10
22,Love this place,"We are big Ohla fans but having stayed at the othe Ohla 3-4 times we stayed here for the second time and now consider it our hotel of choice in central Barcelona. 

Eixample just feels nicer and less touristy to us

But also the staff here are so good and so helpful   They really make a difference. 

Special shout out to Dave who was duty manager when we arrived.  And to the concierge team who are so good with restaurant bookings 

I do think the quality of breakfast declined since our June visit. But it’s still a very fine choice for a visit 

Rooms are lovely",5,2019,12,04
22,Week away,"Stayed here for a week while the protests were in full swing and felt safe and secure.this is a boutique hotel with Michelin star restaurant but we never got round to eating there ,but we did book the breakfast for the week which was excellent. I have been to Barcelona maybe 10 times in the last 5 years and always for a full week but the choise  of restaurants and hotels is massive so we have always tried different places. I would call this an affordable higher end hotel and while there is nothing wrong with it ,the staff are excellent, I probably won’t return having stayed in 4star hotels as good if not better. The room we booked was a large room with shower and separate bath and sit out balcony which was excellent but was room 403 right next to the service room with loud banging every morning from 9am till 5pm .maybe that’s the reason for my not so good review,but having never had reason to give anything other than excellent reviews for Barcelona hotels I thought I needed to say something",4,2019,11,10
22,Truly wonderful stay,The staff is immediately friendly and helpful. The lobby is chic and welcoming. The rooms are very spacious and modern. The top floor pool is an excellent amenity. The only drawback is that there isn’t a gym. ,5,2019,11,09
22,What an Amazing find this place is!!!!,"From the initial warm welcome when we arrived, (the ladies receiving a glass of Cava was a lovely touch), to the stunning bedrooms, fabulous swimming pool, excellent cocktails, but above all the attentive service from every member of the team. The staff at this hotel are what make the place so special and as soon as we have an opportunity the six of us will return.

Great Job Team Ohla Eixample and thank you for the wonderful memories.

",5,2019,11,01
22,Truly Boutique!,"The Ohla Eixample Hotel is in the perfect location (close to everything, but tucked away from the noise!). It is everything you'd want in a cool boutique hotel, with very nice updated rooms, an excellent staff and a great breakfast buffet. It's cool without being cold. I highly recommend it!",5,2019,10,31
22,Excellent,"We stayed 3 nights in an attic suite with a balcony which was great.  Room was well equipped, Wifi was fast and available everywhere. Breakfast included hot and cold options and was also good.  All the staff were excellent - particularly pleased with the concierge who gave some good advice on where to go and how to get there. Would definitely stay at the hotel again and recommend to others. ",5,2019,10,30
22,Perfect,"Loved this hotel. Great welcome, the most comfortable beds, luxurious.
Staff were superb. Nothing was too much trouble. Pool area was a little crowded at the weekend but quiet on the Monday.
Perfect location, we walked everywhere.
Breakfast had everything you could want including gluten and dairy free and there was no hurried ambience.
We were there the day the Catalan protests started and the staff gave support and advice when we were needing to get to the airport the following day.",5,2019,10,24
22,A Cool Hotel,"OHLA Eixample is a cool new boutique hotel absolutely downtown - a small block away from Diagonal, Rua de Catalunia, and 2 small blocks from Passeig de Gracia. 
Friendly staff, good concierge, good modern rooms, a roof top pool with a gym, plus an excellent tapas bar and restaurant (one star Michelin). What does one need more in Barcelona?
Rather good value for such a place. Make your reservation well in advance because there are not many such cool haunts in Spain. Check with the internet, but call for a reservation and explain what you need - you won't regret it.
  ",5,2019,10,21
22,Fantastic welcome with a glass of cava and just kept getting better.  Great location.,"ALL staff were very helpful - front desk, concierge, experience department (Daniele, Raul, Xavier, David, Ricardo...can't recall other's names).
Lobby is welcoming, roof top pool is spectacular, room was comfortable size, beds very comfortable.  Turn-down service was very nice.
Upon leaving we were able to store our bags and then freshen up in the gym area before their car service swept us away (sadly) to the airport.  We were asked if anything could have been better, I mentioned that the glass shower was a bit uncomfortable for me.  I was told that there is a fix for that....there is a curtain they can hang for privacy.  Oh well, I should have known that a hotel that strives to offer such fantastic customer service would have thought of that.  Now you know.
Unfortunately I only speak English - which wasn't a challenge as all staff spoke English very well.
I'd definitely would stay again if I return to Barcelona.",5,2019,10,09
22,Wonderful return to a great city,"We first visited Barcelona in 2004 and this was a long overdue return visit. We stayed at the Hotel Eixample and were not disapointed. The rooms were very good and i loved the Nespresso machine, home from home. the breakfast was really good and there was something for all tastes.
The addition of the roof top bar and pool really made it for us as the weather was good and we able to use these facilities. We couldn't fault the location, not far from anything. 
All in all given the opportunity we would definitely go back and this hotel would be top of our list of places to stay.",5,2019,10,09
22,"Wonderful place, great location, outstanding","Simply put - this is a perfect place to stay in Barcelona if you're in town for a visit. It's in the middle of the action, but nowhere near anything sketchy. It has a rootfop pool and bar that offers everything you could ever want. The rooms are lovely, clean, and the service was great. 

The location is really terrific for anyone who is hoping to walk a lot. It's a nice 15 minute walk from many of the obvious tourist attractions, but it's also super close to the amazing neighborhoods (like Gracia, El Born and Eixample) that make Barcelona such a special and memorable place. 

I'd love to give special recognition to Daniele and Tsu who were so, so helpful to us tracking down lost luggage and helping us make the most of our days in Barcelona. They were wonderful and I hope they see this! 

Definitely consider staying here, it is wonderful and welcoming to all.",5,2019,10,02
22,Weekend visit,"Definitely 5 star. This boutique hotel had all the extras you’d expect. Nothing too much trouble for the staff. Front of house went the extra mile for us, twice. Spent time on the roof top pool and bar. Will visit again if having a luxury stay in Barcelona. ",5,2019,09,29
22,Simply breathtaking ,"My now fiancée and I stayed from Thursday 19th September until Monday 23rd and what a magical place. Dave Lumbreras was my point of contact and he could not have been more helpful from before my visit to after. 

I had arranged with the hotel to make a special evening on 21st September so I could propose to my girlfriend. Dave arranged everything from flowers to candles to champagne and extras. The hotel itself is very clean, efficient and the beds are super comfortable. 

The concierge service was very helpful and showed us where we should visit and made several excellent recommendations so thank you. 

We dined in the Michelin star restaurant one evening and the food was excellent and the atmosphere very peaceful and relaxing. Breakfast was well presented with a good range of various dishes to suit every pallet. My only criticism was the waiters didn’t offer tea or coffee when you were sat and it often took a long time to get one. 

Our favourite place had to be the roof top pool and bar, the beds are full size bed bean bags which are amazingly comfortable. The bar staff were excellent, friendly and went out of their way to ensure everyone was comfortable. 

Thank you for the experience you will see us again. ",5,2019,09,24
22,Boutique Hotel Centrally Located,Great central location just a few steps fromm the best shopping in Barcelona. Easy walking to all tourist attractions. Several well known restuarants in close proximity. Very well appointed rooms. Nice breakfast buffet. Rooftop bar and pool. Excellent staff who were extremely helpful and informative.Would definitely stay there again!,4,2019,09,23
22,Sleek hotel,"The experience at Ohla Eixample was very good from beginning to end. The concierge made some recommendations for restaurants and shopping. The hotel room was very nice, very sleek design. Black white and gray color scheme. The only thing I wish that would be done different is that they keep the rooftop pool open later at night. It closes at 7pm bc the roof is open to the public. Since our days were pretty much busy, we didn’t get to spend time in the rooftop pool. ",4,2019,09,23
22,Excellent hotel,"This boutique hotel was a fantastic find. It was very quiet, extremely comfortable, and spotlessly clean. We stayed for three nights. The staff were all incredibly courteous , knowledgeable, and friendly. I would certainly stay there again.",5,2019,09,20
22,Did not want to leave. Perfect 5 night stay!,"ROOM: We stayed in the penthouse, which had its own terrace with a table and chairs and views of the street below. The room was extremely comfortable and spotless. The design was modern and slick, and the room had everything we needed (huge comfy bed, big bath, tv, storage, plenty of plug sockets and ‘getting ready’ space and a nice shower). Hotel also felt very safe with plenty of staff and security at all times, and a free discreet safe in our room. 10/10 

SERVICE: The staff are friendly, all speak good English and they really do think of everything. We were welcomed with a free drink on arrival, and they even brought complimentary bubbly to our room, as well as changing the toiletries and fresh flowers for us daily. You can really tell it’s a 5* hotel based on the service alone.

FACILITIES: Rooftop pool was stunning and a nice place to lounge in the sun, or have some drinks in the evening. If I was being very picky, I’d suggest there was more than 8 sun beds as we found there were no loungers free on some days. We also received some splash from the pool over our penthouse terrace, not ideal when you are all dressed up! I was also surprised this hotel did not have an indoor pool or spa area, which most of the other 5* in Barcelona do. (When we stayed, a few days were cloudy so would have been nice to have an indoor relaxation area of some sort)

LOCATION: Fantastic. 2 min walk from the big street with all designer shops and cafes. Took us about 25 mins to walk to Ramblas, the Sagrada Familia and gothic quarter, to get a taxi would be pretty cheap.

Overall would definitely recommend. Thank you for a lovely stay, especially to the reception staff who could not do enough for us.",5,2019,09,13
22,Excellent Stay in Barcelona,"This is a very fine and distinguished boutique hotel in a relatively quiet neighborhood, in walking distance to the big shops of Passeig de Gracia. The interior is very refined and stylish and the service is truely excellent. It offers a nice patio and great rooftop area including a bar and a pool. The number of sunbeds may be limited and it may be a bit crowded at peak time times. Nevertheless, the top floor is one of the highlights of the hotel. The Michelin star restaurant Xerta is simply stunning. Very recommended and will come back.",5,2019,09,13
22,Every last detail is considered,"We stayed for 2 nights and 3 days in early September. This hotel is an example of what's possible when attention to detail is a priority. From the scents in the room to the lighting, bedding, towels, robes, etc... the room was comfortable and pleasing to all of the senses. The staff is well trained and professional and consistently went out of their way to make sure we were pampered. I always choose a small boutique hotel over a large chain and I am so glad I opted for Ohla over the W or any of the other chains in Barcelona. This is a 5 star hotel in the perfect location. Short walk or taxi ride to everything. Highly recommended. My only complaint would be that the restaurant closes on Sunday and Monday which is a shame since although it is customary for top restaurants to close on those days in Spain, it's unfortunate for guests who only spend those days at the hotel and are looking for a great dining experience in their hotel.

It's located on a quiet tree lined street just around the corner from Passeig de Gràcia and a short walk from Rambla de Catalunya.",5,2019,09,11
22,Central location and comfortable stay,We stayed for 3 days prior to embarking on a cruise. The room was first class and comfortable. Location was quiet and central. We loved relaxing by the rooftop pool after all the walking on the tours. Staff could not have been more helpful.,5,2019,09,08
22,Awesome choice for 1st Barcelona visit,"My wife and i just returned from a 6 night stay at the Ohla Eixample.  Wow.  It was amazing.  I have never experienced such service from the staff, from the front desk to the restaurants and to the rooftop bar/pool.  they were very accommodating to all of our needs.  We chose a junior suite, and we really enjoyed it.  

As others have mentioned it is on a quiet street, and very close to grocery, shopping, dining and activities.  there is an awesome Flaminco show just a couple of blocks away.  We really enjoyed the pool at the end of the day as it was very hot when we traveled, and the view from the roof at night was spectacular.

We will definitely return!  Thanks for making our trip wonderful!",5,2019,09,05
22,Wonderful!,"The team are so so helpful. Such a wonderful experience. Every whim catered for and such thoughtful touches such as bubbles in our room as a surprise!

I would 100% stay here again and would recommend this hotel to everybody.",5,2019,09,04
22,Good Stay,"The hotel is located in a quiet street, not to far from main avenues like Rambla de Catalunya. Service is good, room is not really what you'd expect from a 5 stars, which is more like modern minimalist.",4,2019,09,01
22,Lovely accommodation in Barcelona,"Wonderful hotel, handy location, and super staff! Stayed for three nights whilst doing touristy stuff in Barcelona. Easy access to sights, helpful concierge. Ate some tapas in the bar one night but did not try the restaurant as there were so many other options nearby. Pool on the roof was small and looked lovely but didn't swim as it was a bit of a chilled out vibe (my kids would have been splashing everyone on the deck if they got in!) Would definitely stay when I return as very good value for money.",5,2019,08,26
22,Wonderful stay in Barcelona Eisample,"Spent 9 days  at the  OHLA  EISAMPLE HOTEL  in Barcelona recently .
Thought it was a terrific hotel in a prime location. The staff was  extremely
helpful and rooms very modern , quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is good with a combination of the usual breakfasty fare  but also with a good sampling of Spanish hams and cheeses, breads and other goodies.  I had to do some paperwork in the mornings and their roof top pool was  an ideal place to work, swim and relax.",4,2019,08,12
22,Best Hotel and Staff in Barcelona city,"This is my fourth time staying with Ohla Eixample and yet again it has impressed me. From the moment you walk through the door the staff are eager to welcome you, they will give you advice on where to go, things to see and just generally make you feel like you've known them a long time. 

The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable beds. I had visited several rooftop bars in Barcelona but always looked forward to coming back to the rooftop bar / pool at Ohla Eixample. Its perfect sized, friendly staff, great cocktails and good food as well. Pool closes around 7-8pm but the bar stays open until 1am. The pool is heater in the colder months as well which is nice. 

The hotel is 60 second away from ""diagonal"" road which is all high end stores (Gucci etc) so its a lovely area. There is a metro station on diagonal which can get you into the heart of the city. Otherwise its about 15-20 minutes nice walk to the Gothic quater. Great food places around the hotel too, I recommend ""somewhere"" restaurant that is 2 blocks away. 

If your looking for a hotel for couples, family or even singles then stop looking and just book this as you wont be disappointed.",5,2019,08,11
22,Brilliant,"This is a luxury Hotel at a very reasonable price. The staff are welcoming, helpful, efficient and always smiling. Nothing is too much trouble.
Rooms are modern and comfortable with self controlled air conditioning, well appointed bathrooms and beds you don't want to get out of.
One of our party had an accident in the pool area and their firstaider was there within moments. He knew exactly what to do and spent as long as necessary to deal with the situation, as did the General Manager. 
The Hotel is situated right at the top of the main posh shop area which runs down into Las Ramblas. Restaurants, bars and local attractions abound.
Breakfast is first class with a huge variety that should satisfy most people.",5,2019,08,09
22,We booked for week but loved it so much we kept adding days.,"I really loved our stay here. My first impressions involved a very friendly reception, quiet but attentive energy and a clean and safe place to feel comfortable. The room was simple yet elegant, a little tight for space but had a good vibe. A particularly wonderful surprise was that the very necessary Air Conditioning during the high heat of summer was completely silent. You wouldn't know it was on except for the gentle cool breeze. Amazing. The bed was firm but comfortable. So most importantly I slept very well there which is rare when travelling. Rooftop pool was a favourite afternoon spot to relax after exploring.
 The staff were full of smiles and always happy to help. I love my coffee in the morning and they were happy to oblige by bringing full boxes of nespresso pods. I'm just your average buy but the staff made you feel so welcome, full of smiles and making the effort to know your name. When i asked about things to do they really gave their attention and true opinions with necessarily trying to sell you a tour package or anything.They listened to the things that I though were important and tried to guide me ( successfully ) in the right direction without ever feeling hurried.

So, a great foundation of a clean, elegant place backed up with excellent staff. Oh and quite reasonably priced. The guide says I should say the thing I liked the least.. I would say if I had to that the food on the rooftop patio was just OK. But really you want to explore the city and try different restaurants rather than stick to one place.

The location is perfect just slightly off the beaten path so relatively quiet for street noise. A short walk to everything you need, great restaurants on quiet streets, short walk to the shopping district. Short walk to Gaudi exhibits or the Old Gothic areas, Cathedral etc. They also have the little electric scooters to rent in the lobby which I highly recommend as a great way to ride around the area and explore without wearing yourself out.

At the end of our stay in Spain we came back for one more night before our morning flight home. As a surprise they upgraded our room to a suite and had a bottle of Cava on ice waiting for us when we checked back in. Classy move.",5,2019,08,07
22,Incredible 5* Boutique Hotel with Outstanding  7* Service,"This was my second stay at this hotel and each time gets better and better. A home from home with the best service I've received. Probably now the only hotel I will stay in for my trips to Barcelona. 
The location in the city is perfect - 5 mins walk to the main shopping area and a stone throw to some incredible bars and restaurants. The rooms are of an amazing standard - the Attic rooms are well worth it with a great balcony. 
The hotel and team make you feel incredibly welcome from the moment you arrive and nothing is too much trouble. Thank you for making my holiday such an amazing experience. I can’t put into words how much I appreciate the hard work and dedication to ensure my stay at the hotel was out of this world. 
The Experience Team and Reception staff are the kindest, most friendly, helpful and efficient people at a hotel I’ve experienced. Nothing is ever too much trouble. 

David and Dave I can’t thank you enough. All the hard work, help and advice leading up to the stay was just great. The recommendations were amazing - Gatsby was one of the best places I’ve been!! You guys go above and beyond and each day was such a pleasure to see your happy smiley faces!! And of course Yeray and Pol on reception. 
A massive thank you to all of the team for making the trip the most memorable experience. We had so many laughs, great moments and made amazing new friends. My only issue is that it makes it harder to leave each time. But more excited to return!! 
I cant recommend this hotel enough. Great location, amazing rooms, cool roof top pool and outstanding 7* service.",5,2019,07,30
22,One of best boutique hotels we have stayed,"The hotel is very centrally located in a quiet street and is surrounded by wonderful restaurants.  It even has an in-house one-star Michelin restaurant.  You can walk to many of the attractions near Passeig de Gracia. The hotel rooms are fantastic with very comfortable bed, pillows and sheets. The gym was small but more than sufficient for a small boutique hotel.  Service was prompt and front desk staff were all very helpful.  ",5,2019,07,23
22,We were well looked after by a great group of staff.,"We were so warmly welcomed to the hotel which is based on minimalist principles and the room reflected this. It looked a bit basic, but as the week progressed we grew to appreciate the great facilities.The housekeeping team visited and serviced the room twice daily,making sure that we had bottled water, towels, refreshments and everything we needed to be happy. The comfortable bed had quality bedlinen. A bottle of cava in our room  too! On our first night,we were disturbed by noise from the room above and we mentioned this in the morning.We were immediately given another room and an upgrade.The occupant of the room above was unfortunately not well so it could not be avoided.
Breakfast was great everyday!The restaurant team were very professional and the open plan kitchen looked very well organised and clean. Breakfast was the highlight of each day.
 The rooftop bar and pool was a great place to relax after exploring the city.
The only bad thing that happened was an extremely loud and drunken private event in the rooftop bar and pool area on our final night which went on till about 1 am. I would suggest that the well being of guests staying in a 5* hotel should have been put above hosting such an event.I was very surprised that this happened.
 However, overall, we had a lovely visit to Barcelona and this hotel was a very good place to stay.We stayed for 7 nights and the staff were nothing but friendly, kind and helpful at all times.
Thank you Ohla for looking after us so well.",5,2019,07,20
22,Very friendly smiling staff ,"Really felt like home, very helpful, friendly and competent staff with a lot of positive energy. Very tasty food will a good professional service. Very clean comfortable rooms with a very nice smell. For sure a very good address to stay in Barcelona. ",5,2019,07,15
22,"Fantastic staff, lovely hotel. Slight issue with the pool","Absolutely loved the hotel, the staff were very welcoming, couldn't do enough for you. The room was very clean and very comfortable, maybe the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Rooftop pool was great to sit by and have a drink. The only one small downside was the quality of the water in the pool, it made me very ill as pigeons also swim in it, but great to be by, just don't go in. Other than that, perfect hotel, highly recommend.",4,2019,07,15
22,Great service oriented place for exploring Barcelona,"Stayed here for 4 nights in our first visit to Barcelona.   

The staff here from bell staff, to reception, to housekeeping to bartenders are so warm, friendly and proactively service oriented worthy of a 6 star luxury hotel.  The location is also fantastic being a block away from major metro and train stops and the hop on bus stop.  Also the Rambla Catalunya with its wide center pedestrian strip is a couple short blocks away and is a higher end and less
Touristic version of the Ramblas (to which it connects to at Plaza Catalunya).  We were able to walk to Casa Mila and also it’s about a 25 minute walk to the Gothic Quarter using the Rambla Catalunya and the Ramblas.   

The rooms were clean and our room facing the front was bright and airy and quiet, facing huge leafy trees that gave the room privacy.  

It’s location in Eixample means that there were tons of restaurants and retail stores close by.  

Highest recommendations for people coming to Barcelona to enjoy the sites, cuisine and night life.  

",5,2019,07,12
22,Solid stay in Barcelona,"We really enjoyed the location of the property, very helpful service and breakfast was great. 
Our suite had the best balcony over looking the streets and is super close to one of my favorite restaurant in Barcelona, La Pubilla Gracia!
I’d definitely stay here again when we return to Barcelona!!",5,2019,07,09
22,Great location,"Excellent staff! Front desk, reception and housekeeping were top notch. Great location to walk to major historic sites in 30 min and right in the middle of shopping and restaurants. Nice roof top views at pool/bar. The only things we didn’t like were the concrete floor in the room with chipped paint, some insects seen on room floor and seating issues. Almost fell off the desk stool. The breakfast was great if you went early. Later on they don’t replenish the buffet. I can’t say enough about the hotel staff. They really went above and beyond.",5,2019,07,06
22,A very good surprise in Barcelona ! ,"My wife and I spent 3 nights this past June at Ohla Eixample. This was not my first time in Barcelona, but was my wife’s. I looked for another hotel where I have a corporate rate, but they could not confirm the fare. So my travel agent suggested Ohla. And indeed was a very good surprise. It is a boutique hotel, with a nice atmosphere and design. Well located and close to several attractions. Very good restaurant, available for all meals. There is a rooftop with a pool, with beautiful views of the City. And the concierge is always there to help you through. It is worth staying there. ",4,2019,07,02
22,Ohla Eixample Hotel In Barcelona,"My wife and I were there for 2 nights
We loved it. Great location, restaurants and Transit all within walking distance.
Boutique hotel with a beautiful  rooftop infinity pool and bar for  food and drink",5,2019,07,02
22,Superb,"First let me say we booked this in error, not realising there are two Ohla hotels in BCN. We have stayed at the other one 3 times and really love it. 

But we both agreed that on our next visit (hopefully December ) we will choose this one. 

Firstly I really love Eixample. It’s less touristy has some great restaurants and architecture 

Secondly the rooms and the staff here were simply amazing. 

The welcome was fab. And the concierge team gave us some great restaurant recommendations which we wouldn’t not have chosen simply by using TA. Which I think is a good thing

Highly recommended ",5,2019,07,01
22,Disappointed,"We just returned from Barcelona and spent several nights before and after a cruise at this hotel.  We travel a lot internationally, and this hotel by far was the strangest one we have ever stayed in.  Yes, the location is very good,and  the room was clean.  However, our shower was basically in the middle of the room surrounded by glass, so unless one is traveling with a VERY close friend or partner, there is absolutely no privacy in showering (and no bath tub).  Also, the shower floor is slippery to the extent that I almost fell in it.  The toilet is basically in a dungeon or at best a very, very small closet.  Going in to it at night is not for the fearful.  The ""restaurant"" is ill-quipped to serve breakfast.  The staff seems irritated that you are there.  When I asked for an egg (which apparently you need to do as no eggs are served with the exception of some cold scrambled eggs, one has to ""report"" the order to the restaurant greeter, and you might (or might not) receive the egg before the rest of your breakfast is complete.  I am reporting this to our cruise company as I think it imprudent for them to use this hotel.  Very strange and would never stay there again.",3,2019,06,19
22,An all round winner,"My other half booked this as part of my 30th birthday present - I was sceptical as he has a “a hotel is just a place to lay your head attitude” - I need not have worried. 

Greeted with a drink and cool towel the hotel is cool clean and oh so stylish. 

The fab location meant it was only a 5 minute walk to the metro station but we could also walk to everywhere we wanted to go. Surrounded by good restaurants, bars and near to the great shop, it worked perfectly for us. 

The room was spacious and really lovely- they clearly thought about the design of this hotel well! 

Breakfast was great with a lovely selection.

We didn’t have a chance to try the in house restaurant.

Would definitely book again next time we come to Barcelona! ",5,2019,06,11
22,Great hotel,"Terrific hotel, good location and superb staff. What more do you need.  A little confused in the corridors after getting off the lift on the wrong floor but all added to the excitement of the first day.",5,2019,06,03
22,Great Place,"The staff was fantastic - very helpful and accommodating.  We stayed in an ""essential"" room for one night.  The room was high end industrial.  Not the most luxurious but clean and very modern.  Location is great.",5,2019,05,28
22,"Wow, Wow and Wow !!!!!!!!","We have just spent 4 days at this hotel and can't wait to return.
We have very high standards and this hotel met our expectations on every level.  It is so well located to enable us to access the main attractions in the centre of Barcelona, but just far enough away to allow us to explore a little more of the local amenities.  But having said all this the main reason for such a 5 star review is the staff at this hotel.  From the minute you walk in through the revolving door you are greeted with such hospitality and care.  The Reception staff and the Concierge, arranged dinner table bookings and taxis for us, with a smile and efficiency..  In fact one lady from Reception walked us round the corner so she could flag down a taxi and ensure we were safe crossing the road.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Checking in was streamless  and we were shown to our room with our suitcases  quickly following on behind.  The room was spacious and very very clean (thank you Betty).  A bottle of Cava was waiting for us, which was a lovely surprise.  The bathroom is split with the  walk in rainforest shower visible through a glazed screen (this could be a problem if sharing with a friend).  The sink is in the bedroom.  All very modern with high standard fitments. The toilet is in a separate private cubicle.  Breakfast is fabulous, with food cooked to order as well as fruits, cold meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries and even chocolate cake served with Cava if required.  Our lovely waitress worked very hard to ensure we enjoyed our breakfast. There is a bar on the roof terrace, by the pool, and a bar just off Reception.  The two Barmen do need a special mention.  I/we just could not find one negative, not that we were looking for one.  It is so reassuring that such hotels still exist and we cannot wait to return to Barcelona and in particular to the Ohla.  There are 2 Ohla's so please note the our review relates to the Ohla Eixample.  Our sincere thanks to you all (and see you soon)",5,2019,05,25
22,Great Hotel,Spent several nights here during a business conference and loved the funky decor of the hotel and the rooms.  Check in was smooth and staff were great throughout the stay.  Rooms were clean and well laid out.  Breakfast was good with a variety of options available. Great location within walking distance of Catalunya Square and surrounded by good restaurants and bars.  Highly recommend.,4,2019,05,24
22,Felt like a queen,"Omg what a nice hotel, not just the beauty of it, or the espectacular location, but the warmth of its personal and they way the treat you.
Can not wait to come back.
Thank you Ohla for making my trip a very nice experience",5,2019,05,22
22,Lovely hotel and staff,We stayed for 3 nights in mid-May and absolutely loved it. The rooms were spacious and the breakfast was great. Staff were attentive without being suffocating. Fantastic location. Thoroughly recommend!,5,2019,05,20
22,Excellent room ,We very much enjoyed our stay at Ohla. The decor is contemporary as well as comfortable. The front desk were very helpful with great recommendations for the area. The rooftop pool is a great addition if you need to cool down after a stroll around the city. We had a massage while we were there by Susana - it was the best massage I’ve ever had! Would absolutely stay again. ,5,2019,05,12
22,Delighted by a stunning customer experience.,"An incredibly helpful and gentle staff, always there to accommodate our requests. Especially reception team have delivered a great customer experience, absolutely spot on all duration of our stay at the Ohla Eixample. Breakfast, lunch, dinner always impeccable, tasty and classy experience. In regards to the hotel experience, the room was super clean, modern and really beautifully designed as well as other facilities offered (gym, rooftop swimming pool, a tapas bar and rooftop bar).  And finally, small classy touches like chocolates during afternoon breaks that were delivered to our room (sometimes in our absence) made a 5-star experience authentic and unique.",5,2019,05,08
22,WOW!,"What a beautiful hotel full with beautiful staff :) 
We had bubbles on arrival and the staff were incredibly helpful. 
Breakfast each morning was great. There was a good variety of food and again, there were bubbles. 
Each day the maid knocked on our door with chocolates (so many small touches that make it) 
The pool wasn't busy at all - which was good for our pictures! I think at most there were 2 other couples but they didn't stay on the rooftop for long. 
The rooms were incredibly clean. 

An all over amazing stay. Thank you Ohla!",5,2019,05,07
22,A night in Barca,"Had a nice stay at Ohla. Room was small but comfortable. Staff was excellent and accommodative. Breakfast was very good. Great location. Easy to and from airport, sites, etc. Overall I would recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,05,04
22,Stylish hotel in a great location,"Beautiful, spacious and quiet room.  The staff were attentive, friendly and helpful.  The location was fantastic - not overly touristy, amazing restaurants and bars close by, good access to public transport.  I can also highly recommend the onsite restaurant and tapas bar.",5,2019,05,02
22,Great wedding anniversary break ,"From the moment of our arrival to the moment we left the hospitality was amazing. We were welcomed with a glass of Cava and our suitcases were carried to our room. We were then nicely surprised with a bottle of champagne in celebration of our anniversary. We were only there for two nights but enjoyed a lovely breakfast on our first morning there, with customised omelettes made to order and lots of sweet treats available and fresh juices. The orange juice may just be the best orange juice we have ever tasted! 

It was a bit breezy when we were there but we still took a quick dip in the pool, which was heated to a nice temperature. Unfortunately the roof terrace bar was closed but the option of ordering up from the bar downstairs was available. The room itself was lovely, very industrial looking, very clean and the walk in shower was a particular highlight for us. We would like to say a special thank you to all the concierge, who were very helpful including organising a picnic breakfast for us when we were leaving due to a very early flight. We would definitely go back again. Location is about a 15 minute walk from most places to visit. The surrounding area around the hotel is generally busy with people, shops, bars and cafes.",5,2019,04,26
22,Lovely hotel,"Only stayed here for 1 night before switching to their other location Ohla Barcelona (work reasons) but this location is far more superior! I was on the 5th floor facing the front of the building. My room was airy and spacious. I especially loved the deep and extra long soaking tub. Great sunlight and appreciated the firm mattress. The master light switch by the bed was a plus. it is also not as busy as the other location so it is more chill and relaxing. Especially their rooftop pool. I didn't have an adapter for my US plugs and the front desk provided one. I'd come back here, but definitely stay away from the Barcelona location! I've had my money stolen and extra credit card charges days after returning home with no explanation! Still waiting for a response from them.",5,2019,04,22
22,The hospitality made the trip a 5* experience,"This hotel must be credited for their amazing hospitality. From the moment we walked in, they took care of us and made sure our every need was attended to. The staff would go out of their way to make sure we were looked after. The staff were really friendly, genuine and very welcoming (but they weren't ""in your face""). 

The rooms were clean and well presented. The room attendants were lovely and they cleaned and tidied our room so nicely before we arrived back to the room, adding little touches such as complimentary chocolate, water etc. and a note to let us know the weather forecast for the following day - we thought this was a lovely touch. 
 
As we weren't in the area for long, we had trouble trying to figure out the itinerary... The staff gave us ideas and booked tickets for us for Camp Nou and La Sagrada Familia. They also recommended some amazing vegetarian/vegan restaurants for us and booked a reservation to save us hassle. 

Though the weather wasn't the greatest, we truly enjoyed our getaway with the help of the amazing staff at Ohla Eixample.",5,2019,04,15
22,"Amazing hotel, must book!","Lovely hotel, rooms are clean, good sized and well-presented. Staff are all lovely, welcoming and always happy to help! Complimentary fizz and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival is just one example of how the hotel goes to extra mile in all aspects. Great, central location, we were able to walk to all the main attractions, including Park Güell and Montjuïc cable car (if you don't mind longer, up hill walks!) Rooftop pool/bar is a lovely touch (although pricy, but similar to London wine/cocktail prices, so can't complain too much). Amazing buffet breakfast with lots of choice, and then a fantastic array of restaurants close by for lunches and dinners (try to find 'local' style restaurants rather than eating in La Rambla or similar large restaurants, as the quality and value for money is much better in these). One downside is you couldn't open the window in our room (not sure if this is the same for all), not a huge issue because the A/C works perfectly, but I personally like a constant flow of fresh air! Overall, I can't recommend this hotel enough, a great experience and would definitely book again if visiting Barcelona!",5,2019,04,05
22,"Great couples hotel, great location ","Booked this hotel via Voyage Prive so paid a lot less than the rack rate for a design room (£456 for 3 nights) and it was totally worth the money. First things, check in was easy with fizz and hot towels provided. Rooms are a good size, though the totally see through glass panel is very open and if you are a large person (luckily we are not) it could be tight fitting round the toilet door. Coffee nachine anc turn down chocolates/extra water was a nice touch. Front desk was really helpful too, booking us Park Guell tickets. Breakfast was ok, poached eggs cold but good selection of pastries, meats and breads. Roof top area is really nice, pool is heated so can swim even if not that warm outside. I can imagine it gets packed in summer as even in March we couldn't get a bed to lie on on the afternoon of our second day. 
Location is easy, and nice places around it. Only niggle, we had to ask twice for our complimentary cava which was a little awkward but small thing really. Would recommend. ",4,2019,03,25
22,Outstanding place to stay,"The service, courtesy and attitude of the staff were excellent. There was no drama just genuine professionalism and desire to be of assistance to their guests.  We had to leave the hotel early in the morning and the staff ensured that we had a ‘picnic’ breakfast. The room was of an exceptional standard both in terms of comfort and facilities.  I can’t recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2019,03,21
22,A great Barcelona hotel experience!,"We spent 4 nights at the Ohla Eixample in early March. It was simply a terrific hotel experience in a perfect location just one block from the restaurant lined boulevard, La Rambla de Catalunya (i.e. the north end of Las Rambla,) and far, far away from the seedy, southern end of La Rambla that is overloaded with tourists and pickpockets.  The Ohla is also only a 10 minute walk from Passeig de Gracia, the tree covered boulevard that is lined on both sides of the street with breathtaking architecture that is not to be missed. Everything else in Barcelona seems to be only a 5 to 12 minute cab ride away. Although, we did not get to enjoy the Ohla's Michelin starred restaurant (Xerta), we did enjoy wonderful tapas dishes at the Xerta Tapas Bar located just off the main lobby. Also, the breakfast buffet provided many good choices including eggs cooked to order. The bar was equally outstanding with a wonderful, knowledgable bar tender serving up any concoction we desired. The architectural star of the Ohla is the roof terrace and infinity pool. Unfortunately, it was a bit too cool and too breezy for us to spend any more time up there than a a few minutes for a quick look-see visit. Not to be omitted from this 5 star review, was the Reception staff. Each one of them always had a cheerful disposition and each one was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when needed. Our ONLY complaint about the room at the Ohla is the difficulty getting into the privy area where the toilet is located. It is a tight squeeze getting around the door to the toilet  It's hard to explain - but it is a slight inconvenience issue. Nevertheless, the Ohla Eixample will be our top choice for any future visits to Barcelona.",5,2019,03,20
22,"Great service, Excellent location","I was extremely satisfied with my stay at Ohla Eixample. First of all the location is fantastic. It is a walking distance from many great restaurants, bars, cafes and shopping destinations. The room was very clean, and all the staff are really wonderful. Food is very good, though I did not have the chance to try the Michelin star restaurants as it closes Sunday, and Monday. Maybe that is my excuse to come back next time.",5,2019,03,11
22,The Best Eixample!!,"A belated review, I should have posted this some time ago - sorry Ohla Eixample, as the service in this hotel was the best I have ever experienced. 

The staff particularly the young apprentices were brilliant and couldn’t do enough for you.

Thank you so much, as you made our stay it was excellent and for me, there is no other hotel in Barca now. 

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to all.",5,2019,03,09
22,Only fault are the rock hard beds and lack of sound proofing,"Loved this hotel. Staff are friendly and helpful. The cleanliness is very high and the food is tasty. The only fault we have are the rock hard beds and the poor sound proofing between floors. We didn't manage to sleep whilst there due to this but despite this we still love the hotel and would recommend it to anyone, providing they like sleeping on concrete and they wear ear plugs.",4,2019,02,24
22,Enjoyable stay,"Very nice room, a bit (really a bit) of industrial design, modern, clean, functional. Staff was friendly and helpful, Breakfast ok, Lobby/ check in was bit too busy (probably bad luck and many guests arrived at the same time)
Restaurant recommendation was also good, Tapas in their Restaurant good as well (so I cannot say anything about the price as provided by company)
All in all felt good and was enjoyable!",4,2019,02,17
22,Barcelona Getaway Location,"This is an excellent hotel. Great staff , lovely rooms and an excellent location. I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona. They have an amazing restaurant and great breakfasts. Perfectly located !",5,2019,02,16
22,Great hotel with a perfect location!,"We have stayed in the Design room. Lovely, clean rooom with natural light. Everything has been outstanding with lots of attention to detail! On the rooftop they have a pool which is climatized all year round. Having a michelin experience on spot is very tempting, you just need to walk downstairs and enjoy! Very attentive and friendly staff! They have their own parking area which makes everything pretty comfortable. Would love to come back!",5,2019,02,14
22,Fantastic,"The hotel and the room was fantastic.
The location was perfect and concierge helped me find perfect restaurant nearby.

 Small problem with Bathroom but the hotel managed it well and followed up with Surprise Champange.

The reservation was quick and bar was amazing",5,2019,02,03
22,Excellent hotel and awesome Barcelona location,"I loved my stay here! My suite was superb, the staff was attentive and very friendly. They went out of their way to accommodate my requests during my stay. Simply a lovely stay here and I will definitely stay again!",5,2019,01,22
22,Modern and quirky,"I wanted to try this hotel because of it's bold modern architecture, but ultimately was not very impressed. The room decor is cool, mock industrial design. But I did not care for bare concrete floor and minimalist ascetic aesthetics. It's like opposite from giving you warm and fuzzy feeling. The bed was comfortable though, room clean, but very poor sound isolation. I could hear all activities of cleaning maids in the hall and on the next room.  And although the room size was adequate, the coffee/tea making section was tightly tacked in a wall unit and was not comfortable and easy to use. They have a mobile phone-like device in your room to take with you to the city, which is nice, but I did not try to use it.  Location is central and easy to get to. Overall a good property, but not my favorite in Barcelona.",3,2019,01,20
22,Dr.  and Mrs. Clark,"We had a wonderful stay at Ohla Eixample.  The Hotel is beautiful and spotless.  The pool outdoors was heated and perfect for swimming in.  Breakfast was very good and the service overall was excellent.  We were booked for another hotel when we came to Barcelona,  it was not what we wanted so we changed to a much better choice.. the Ohla Eixample!  We were so happy with our room and our stay.  We plan on coming back to this hotel each time we come to Barcelona,  it has been a great experience.  Great job with the manger Javier Navaza keeping a well run team and hotel.  Thank you!",5,2019,01,18
22,Happy New Year 2019 in Barcelona,"Excellent hotel to be used as starting point for visiting Barcelona located in a strategic point of the city. Rooms are luxury and comfortable in line with five stars hotel.
Staff is very gentle.
Great breakfast !!!",5,2019,01,14
22,100% 5 Star Hotel!,"Ohla Eixample is no doubt a 5 Star Hotel! The staff were extremely friendly, we had many bottles of complimentary champagne as we were celebrating an anniversary. When we were shown to our room, the staff member also demonstrated to us how the amenities work, which was a nice touch. We were given great recommendations for top Tapas bars in Barcelona and a map that the man amended with directions and sight-seeing locations. 

As soon as we walked in to the hotel you knew you were in a 5 Star. Absolutely immaculate, the rooms were exceptional. 

The rooftop pool is heated which was great and is lit up at night time so even if you want to relax on the rooftop in the evening you can!!

Breakfast was of a very high standard, they also have a Michelin star restaurant at the hotel. 

Definitely want to come and stay here again... this was the best hotel experience I have ever had and the expectation succeeded in every way possible!! ",5,2019,01,08
22,Christmas break,Lovely location with a good welcome. Room was excellent with a fantastic balcony. All amenities were amazing especially the walk in shower. Had a meal in the tapas bar which was really good. Would recommend this hotel to all,5,2019,01,01
22,"Ohlala! Location, Design, Service and staff staff staff!","We really enjoyed our stay in Barcelona and Ohla Eixample was the crown of our trip. The first impression was excellent: we arrived at 7:30am exhausted from an early morning flight and they were able to give us a room as soon as we arrived. We were warmly welcome by the receptionist and concierge they even offered us some complimentary welcome details that we took a bit later (too early for a glass of cava). That kind of helpfulness from the hotel really got our trip off to a good start. 

The location was very nice — we had a short walk to Passeo de Gracia (highly recommended) and to several nice restaurants, and a short walk to main attractions as Sagrada Familia.",5,2018,12,31
22,What more could you ask for?,"In the hotel business they say location is everything, but besides that, this place has also a Michelin-starred restaurant, attentive staff and comfortable, stylish rooms, so the only thing I could ask for more is an early opportunity to try also the rooftop swimming pool.",5,2018,12,27

I found a good deal for this hotel and I was really sursprised by the quality and experience that I had. I was in Barcelona for business and arrived early. There was no problem with checking in early. Staff was really attentive. The room is great and the bathroom is one of the best I have experienced in Europe. The location is great. Lots of shops, restaurants, easy to walk around and just around the corner from a subway station. I would definately stay here again for business and for private travel with my wife. Great roofpool area !",5,2018,12,15
22,Perfect stay,"Great stay at the Oha hotel! The location is great close to la ramblas and diagonal. Rooms are modern and really comfortable. It also hasa nice pool on the roof and the staff was really nice. Love to come again

22,Amazing hotel & really nice staff !,"I was there for a few days and I wanted to say that the hotel is stunning ! Furthermore, the staff is really nice and kind, always there to help you find your way through the city. A special thanks to the interns,ready to make your stay even more special ! (especially the one speaking french ;) )",5,2018,12,05
22,Beautiful Contemporary Hotel,"The most outstanding feature of this hotel was the service, from housekeeping right up to management. Xavier and David were very responsive to our needs including high speed internet which is required for our business. First rate.",5,2018,12,04
22,My wife and I loved this hotel,"We had a great 3-day visit to Barcelona. The hotel staff were gracious and friendly, and went out of their way to be helpful. Breakfasts were delicious, and the rooms were very pleasant. The location is great, within easy walking distance of restaurants and sights.",5,2018,11,28
22,Great experience with ohla,the people are very nice and helpful. the room is good. there was snack delivered to room everyday. the design of hotel is very modern. I got a very good price for three days' stay. Highly recommended.,5,2018,11,27
22,Nice post cruise stay,"Stayed here overnight after a Mediterranean cruise. Proved to be a great choice. Excellent neighbourhood, close to some of the Gaudí sites. Very helpful staff and we received a warm welcome. Modern facility and nice room. The hotel restaurant was a nice surprise.",5,2018,11,22
22,"Fantastic service, great  location","We really like this hotel and would stay here again for sure. It is in a great location ... yet quiet. From the second we arrived we received friendly attentive service one of the  best hotels as far as service goes I have experienced and I have stayed in some amazing hotels. The rooms are modern, minimal well designed, comfortable beds and everything first class. A few slightly unusual design features in our room like the large bathroom sink is located in the main room which acts as a bar feature but makes you want to keep your bathroom stuff tucked away and neat . the shower glass panel is open to the bedroom and has a light in the shower that stays on for the night light dimming sequence on the lights panel which is a little too bright to sleep by so we turned it off and then the room was maybe too dark given it's nice to have a little light in a room that new to you. I agree with the breakfast reviews I have read in previous reviews, definitely good but maybe not five star which is strange given the michelin star restaurant that is in the same space. Frankly we have had too many over the top breakfasts on this trip so this suits us fine although if this were my splurge hotel and I prepaid for breakfast I would be slightly disappointed.",5,2018,11,09
22,Nice (even expenisve)  hotel. I like it.   Clean  and  quiet.  And  great  swimming pool o  the roof-the best!!!!!,"Very expenisive but  very friendly and well  located,  about  25 minutes of walk to  the sea side  on one of main roads  .  I have to point out that the swiming pool   is  perfect on the roof !!!!!!!!!!!  100% clean  and   so quiet  like in Heaven !! I loved this sweeming pool  so much.     Comparing to  5 star  Bangok-  Bankgok is  .....rubbish  and joke  like !!!!!  I love  Barcelona   swimming pool ot the roof  of your hotel . Also very polite  service  on the reception !! Perfect English (no the same  as in BAngkok hahaha)  and very  freindly  persons , very proffesional.   Only  breakfest   menu .....not  to much  but  still   very good standard.    One  minus-  time of  deparutre. 12:00  is  not  good. in most of  5 *****   hotels is 2pm or   in some even  4 pm.      12:00  is not   good  to leave the room specially if you eat the breakfest at  let say  10:30..........",5,2018,11,08
22,Best stay and restaurant experience in Barcellona,"We’ve visit the Ohla Hotel probably 6 times in the last months and we’re really looking forward for our next stay!
We come to Barcellona often for business and work reasons and we’ve experienced a lot of hotels so far but after our first time at Ohla it’s kind we’ve finally found the perfect spot, it’s like home to us!
The Xerta restaurant, a two Michelin star restaurant located in the hotel and incredibly mastered by chef Lopez is an absolute must and perfect experience for food and wine lovers.
Rooms are exquisite, silent and beautifully organised with comfy and big beds.
The only complain I have, but it’s more a suggestion, is the check-in at the front desk that could be easier and more smooth for returning and loyal customers.",5,2018,11,08
22,Most comfortable stay,"We loved our stay in Ohla, the location is near city center but not in the noisy mess, many good restaurants around (we had twice dinner in the hotel's restaurant and it was very good too!) and the staff really friendly (like Edward giving us tips and helping us about moving around). Rooms are very comfortable and the swimming pool in the top is the icing on the cake!",5,2018,11,02
22,Will definitely come back!,"I stayed at the Ohla Eixample hotel in September and came back in October for another trip. Didn’t look no more: it’s the perfect hotel in my opinion, great location in Barcelona around the best shops and restaurants in the area, clean modern rooms where everything works perfectly! (The bed is delicious, the shower amazing and the A/C works!! And that’s a big thing for a hotel in Europe!) I couldn’t ask for more and on top of that the people at the front desk are super nice, Gerai and everyone for that matter were always ready to answer any questions I had or recommendations for dinner. 

I go often to Spain and Barcelona in particular and will definitely stay again at the Ohla Eixample hotel. Why it’s so difficult to find an hotel where everything really works I wonder..!",5,2018,10,29
22,The perfect hotel experience in Barcelona ,"Our visit was above our expectations. The hotel was spectacular, the service was unbelievable. Everything at this hotel is just perfect starting from the rooms to location, no doubt we will return here on our next visit in Barcelona.",5,2018,10,28
22,Superb hotel,Fantastic hotel in a very central location. Amazing customer service and delicious buffet breakfast. The bed in particular was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on. Small but nice gym facilities. Highly recommended!,5,2018,10,24
22,Very nice hotel in the center of Barcelona,"We've stayed here for 3 nights and it was all we could wish for. Starting with the location, we were able to walk to basically all the important sights in Barcelona. There are also a lot of good restaurants and bars around the hotel, so top marks all around.

We loved the design of the hotel and the theme from the reception/restaurant is continued in the rooms. Our room was quite large, extremely clean both in terms of design and in the traditional sense. A very nice touch was a smartphone that you can take with you to help during the day. It would be expecially handy if you're coming from outside the EU (because of the roaming charges) but it was good even when roaming data is not an issue because of the added battery. 

The breakfast was what you would expect from a 5* - excellent variety and quality. We'll definitely be back for our next visit in Barcelona.",5,2018,10,22
22,Great location in Barcelona,"Stayed here for four nights. Great location, attentive staff, very modern and new hotel. Very good breakfasts. Only complaint was the room was pretty small. Problem we had with mattress was remedied quickly. Again location was very central and close to great shopping and dining. ",5,2018,10,16
22,nightmare at the ohla example,"The hotel Ohla Eixample was the worst hotel I ever stayed.  I stayed on the first floor above the first level.  A subway runs underneath the hotel every 5 minutes 24 hrs. a day.  The rumbling continues all day and night that feels like a mini earth quake.  

Also, there are 6 rooms on the first floor one. The remainder of the first floor is a banquet room.  The hotel management scheduled a party the last night of my stay until 1am.  The 6 rooms open to a hallway that adjoins the banquet hall, the service elevator and stairwell.  The hotel leaves the banquet hall door open and moves all food and waste through the hallway into and out of the banquet hall.  This of course means the dishes, bottles and all other waste moves through the hallway down the stairs.  So, the vocal noise from the open banquet hall door filters into the hallway disturbing the residents of the 6 rooms and all the moving of dishes, bottles and other waste bangs and crashes all night long well after the party ends.  I don't think I slept until after 3am. 

Another disturbing event is the garbage trucks that show up at midnight and lift the 15 garbage cans and dump and rattle the cans overhead into the truck.  This is about the same level as the first floor and last at least a half hour.  

As I said, worst hotel experience of my life. Thank god it was only 2 nights.

22,ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!,"My husband and I were celebrating our Honeymoon in BCN and had the chance to spend four spectacular days at OHLA EIXAMPLE.   The staff was nothing short of extraordinary; their attention to detail and commitment to every want and need on our part was immaculate.  Manager Javier Navaza, Edouard and all the people working there made us feel at home and truly treated us as though we were part of their family.   They gave us a room upgrade without even asking, and had a bottle of fabulous Cava waiting for us in our room.   We are actually returning to OHLA this weekend after a few days in Costa Brava and we will stay there again.   The buffet breakfast was amazing; I am gluten allergic and the chef accommodated all of my needs with tremendous 
grace.  We've adopted OHLA EIXAMPLE as our home away from home in BCN.   Again, THANK YOU for an extraordinary experience.  This was hospitality at its best, all around!",5,2018,10,12
22,Our 25th Wedding Anniversary Stay,"Stayed at this wonderful hotel for a 3 night early September for our 25th Wedding Anniversary.  I picked the Hotel based on its star rating, trip adviser reviews and location.  We were not disappointed.  The Hotel is very stylish, modern and a perfect central location.  The staff are extremely helpful, professional and go out their way to help you.  The room was immaculate, modern and ideal for our stay.  Breakfast was lovely, with a great selection to choose from.  Would definitely come back to this Hotel and would highly recommend to others.  Well done to the management and staff at the Ohla Eixample.",5,2018,10,11
22,Outstanding service,"My girlfriend and I spent two nights here to celebrate her birthday. The hotel rooms are clean and modern and come with great amenities. Beds are a bit stiff for my taste, but the bedsheets were really soft. The hotel provided us with a complimentary room upgrade upon check-in since I made my booking through Expedia. On my girlfriend's birthday, the hotel staff were outstanding. We reserved a table on their sky terrace for celebratory drinks with some friends and the staff surprised us with complimentary bottles of cava and a nice gift for my girlfriend. They really went out of their way to make sure that we had a great evening. The hotel breakfast was good, but I wish it offered a greater selection of fruits, pastries, and warm dishes. They have a menu where you can order different dishes from, as well as a selection of coffees, but in general the breakfast was not as spectacular as the staff.",5,2018,09,28
22,Top notch,"Great staff. Very courteous. Went out of their way to print event tickets for me & arrange cabs. 

Hot showers with excellent pressure. An amazing bed. Very comfortable. 

Good location.  About the same 30 minute walk to major sights in all different directions. 

I would definitely return. ",5,2018,09,28
22,Fantastic hotel in Barcelona,"After years of traveling to Barcelona for business and pleasure, finally found a great hotel!

Most hotels in Barcelona disappoint, regardless of starts or cost - there is always something off like the service, the cleanliness, or even disappointing space/functionality in the hotel room.

Ohla Eixample was such a great find. They really put together great design and space in a very suitable location for both business and pleasure in the city - as well as being professional, courteous, and well appointed.

For the first time in Barcelona I had a nice rest, space to work and organize, as well as relax, shop, and unwind.  The service level of the staff was also consistent and pleasant, really enhancing the stay.

Fantastic experience for a boutique hotel and a really great job by all of the management and staff.

Looking forward to the next visit to Ohla!!",5,2018,09,25
22,Excellent Service and Facilities,"Lovely hotel, staff were all friendly and very helpful, great location. The pool terrace is beautiful. Extra shout out to Marty who really made a difference to my stay, big thank you! I highly recommend this hotel - I stayed here as part of a large group for a business conference, and I will be returning for leisure!",5,2018,09,18
22,Very good but for one small issue.,"We stayed 3 nights. Our friend booked a standard room and we treated ourselves to a junior suite. It’s a 5 Star Hotel, modern and very well laid out in a quiet location. Was we’re all very happy with our rooms. Very comfortable large bed and good pillows. Breakfast was part of our deal and a very good range of continental breakfast options - not many hot options but we’ve found that to be the case in other Spanish hotels. Our only compliant was that on Sunday afternoon we returned to find that our room had not been serviced by 4.00pm. The housekeeping staff were working in the room next to ours when we left at about 10.00am so we were surprised it wasn’t cleaned at that time. We waited about 45 minutes at Reception until they confirmed our room had been serviced. Given the 5 star rating of this hotel and fact that we had paid for a suite, we thought this was disappointing. There was no offer of recompense. A simple apology from the manager with a complimentary drink at the bar would have been a nice gesture and would have resulted in a higher rating for service",4,2018,09,17
22,50th Birthday Celebration,"This weekend has been planned for about 5 months, and in that time I had booked about 5 or 6 different hotels - to give me options ! Eventually decided to go with the Ohla - so glad we did - although not without a very small criticism. We had a Junior Suite which was perfect - very comfortable bed , good shower/bath amenities, lovely fluffy towels etc - nightly turndown service etc. In anticipation we were looking forward to breakfast - a hotel stay is all about the breakfast - right? Very disappointed, the hot items are stored in two big silver serving containers with no heat source - so the first morning had cold scrambled eggs and sausages. 2nd Morning I asked for 2 poached eggs - in anticipation I toasted a slice of bread..... waited patiently for about 15 minutes to be served 2 cold not cooked properly poached eggs.... this morning I opted for fruit & Yoghurt! Also, although the breakfast waiting staff are very polite, it takes an age for them to a) take a Tea/coffee order & b) deliver the order . Both yesterday and today we had actually finished eating before the drinks arrived. Everything else was perfect - Sky Bar lovely for a midnight nightcap, staff super attentive - even when the window in our room developed a leak and we had a pool of water on the floor . We had complimentary bottles of Cava delivered to the room on my birthday , and one on arrival - along with some chocolate. Rectify the breakfast situation and you will have a very good product. But, I would recommend and return to the hotel if ever in Barcelona again ",4,2018,09,08
22,Excellent stay,"I’m writing this review while I sit at the breakfast table of this hotel on my 5th and last day staying in it.
I’ve stayed at 5 star hotels before and they were good, but the quality of the service at the Ohla Eixample exceeded all my expectations. From the way they greet you every day at the front desk to the way they cater to your needs at the breakfast buffet is just remarkable. One time I wanted to get the lift to go down while the bell boy was already waiting with a suitcase carrier. The lift came and he chose to keep waiting for the next lift so I would get the comfort of having the lift to myself.
The hotel itself is also wonderful. If I had to mention a few things I really liked they would be the possibility to set the light in the room to “day, night or relax”, the comfort of the bed, the great quality of bottled water put into the room every day to be consumed for free and the overall feeling of tranquillity you get throughout the entire hotel.
A stay at the Ohla Eixample is an excellent one, and I can’t possibly imagine why anyone would say otherwise.",5,2018,09,01
22,Very pleasant place,"I recommend this hotel. We spent a very nice week with my family. Very good level of service and accomodation, ideal location given quick and easy access to main places in Barcelona - nice roof terrace with small swimming-pool.",5,2018,08,31
22,Fantastic modern hotel,"A great 3 night stay. In a great location, easily accessible with a car. The service and standard of accommodation was excellent and the roof top swimming pool is a great extra bonus. Reception and concierge  staff were very helpful and attentive.",5,2018,08,27
22,not a pleasant visit,I came to visit my family which are staying for 8 nights in the hotel ..after I recommend them the hotel .. and I came with my dog which is my emotional support animal ..and they didn't let me in! but really..the guard in the entrance jumped on us.. really unpleasant moment for us.. I wouldn't recommend this hotel any more!!! ,1,2018,08,23
22,Lovely hotel but very pricey!,"The staff were lovely and couldn't be more attentive and helpful if they tried. The room service and bar terrace serve really nice food and drinks (Although the drinks are a bit pricey). The breakfast is really nice, although they do only provide whole milk, meaning I couldn't have any cereal. Overall, a lovely stay but a little expensive. I would recommend staying here if you don't mind spending the money.",5,2018,08,22
22,One of THE BEST Hotels - Service Outstanding!,"I can honestly say this hotel surpassed all high expectations I had! it was outstanding!  The location, the hotel itself, the roof pool, the rooms were incredible.  However, if you are looking for out of this world service - this is the place to come! From the moment I booked my stay, David - the Experience Manager put everything into making sure my stay would be perfect. He booked all my restaurants and bars and made sure my birthday was very well celebrated. I cant thank him enough!  He makes you feel like you are the only guest in the hotel! 
From the moment you enter the hotel you are greeted by beautiful, smiley, friendly, efficient reception team. They are so helpful. 
The first room I stayed in Junior Suite was amazing. Loved the style and layout. its very open but all good! 
I then upgraded to the Attic Room to host my birthday drinks and this room is out of this world!  the terrace is awesome!  can highly recommend this room, even at the extra cost - very worth it! 
So many little touches make this hotel one of the best I have stayed in. Its a must for a stay in Barcelona and I will be returning again for sure!",5,2018,08,21
22,My go to hotel in Barcelona,"Loved love loved my first stay at Hotel Ohla Exiample. If you want to be close to the best shopping and dining this is it! We walked everywhere. But what I loved was the service, Michelin restaurant and pool! We upgraded to a junior suite. Loved the room and housekeeping was super attentive. They also have some of the beset bath amenities in any hotel you will find. We had great fun at the pool and the bartenders (Jaime) were fantastic! If you go during pool weather be sure to sit up there late afternoon and soak in the sights of the city. Service was great! David and Inu concierge will take care of any need!",5,2018,08,19
22,Excellent choice for Barcelona,"Not only the splendid location in Barcelona, the hotel is simply an excellent choice. David in charge for customer experience makes by the sense of the word a stay to a beautiful thing. The gastronomic offering is extraordinary, the rooms fantastic, the welcome warm and cheerful. 
A true recommendation for Barcelona!",5,2018,08,09
22,Wonderful hotel ,"We spent a week at the hotel in July my family and I. We had a fantastic stay ! Everything was beyond our expectations. We had 3 beautiful bedrooms. The pool area is perfect to refresh and relax while drinking a nice cocktail or eating a great snack. Without speaking of the location which is just perfect ! The staff was more than helpful, the concierges helped us in many ways. I will definitely go back next time I’ll stay in Barcelona. ",5,2018,08,09
22,A real find!,"I chose this hotel for a long weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. It’s expensive as you’d expect - a 5* boutique hotel but from check in to check out everything was perfect.  The staff are all polite and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble, they got us tickets at short notice for La Segrada when they were sold out online. Our room, an Attic room, was spotless, spacious and comfortable with a really big bed and a spacious private terrace to boot.  Included were a big bath and a fab walk-in shower. The rooftop pool and bar are great, perfect for sunbathing, drinking and cooling off - 5* hotel bar prices unfortunately!  The hotel restaurant is called Xerta complete with a Michelin Star, quite a nice vibe when eating the pretty good breakfast.  Book for dinner and have your socks blown off.  Finally, it’s 5 minutes walk from the tube station where you can get to everywhere it seemed and it’s surrounded by good restaurants. I’d come back in a heartbeat if there weren’t so many other great places to visit. ",5,2018,08,07
22,Amazing!!!,"This hotel exceeded all our expectations. Not only are the rooms perfect - the whole vibe is so clean and refreshing, the room smelled great and the beds were big and super comfortable. The breakfast buffet was very good, and the hotels restaurant is a MUST - the service and over all experience was unforgettable.
Last but not least we have to mention the hotels staff. Ive never encountered a staff more friendly, helpful and understanding. They did everything in their power to make our stay as enjoyable as possible, and because of them our stay in Barcelona is a trip to remember. Thank you Ohla Eixample!!!",5,2018,07,31
22,Ohla Exemplary,"Barcelona has to be one of Europe’s great cities.  It oozes style culture and creativity in everything from its food to architecture. Fitting then, that Ohla Eixample delivers in every respect and doesn’t disappoint. They’ve really thought about the detail such as your preferred weave of bed linen. And get the basics on point such as the temperature in your room - a cool retreat from the scorching sun and no hint of the sound of air conditioning. The rooms are stylish and incredibly well laid out. The staff are warm and welcoming - no suggestion of the “too cool for school” attitude of other trendy hotels. What’s more, as with the rest of Barcelona, the prices for food and drink make it astonishingly great value compared with other must-see cities. Location is superb too. Cabs were so affordable that everything was a quick and easy ride away. We loved this city and shall return. Why on earth would we choose to try anywhere other than the exemplary Ohla Eixample....",5,2018,07,26
22,Perfect Location and Good Service.,"We stayed in this hotel last February. Check in was smooth and they offered us a glass of Cava on arrival. Room was great with a huge balcony and a nice view. 

We had a small inconvenient with the room, but they sorted it out quickly. Breakfast was included and they offered a big variety; however, service could improve a bit in this area.

All in all a great stay, you can find some minor faults, but for sure they'll improve.

I would definitely comeback and would recommend it.",4,2018,07,22
22,"Unbelievably great service, food and room!","This is a truly outstanding destination hotel. I was able to check in my case and complete registration early. The room was brilliant and immaculately clean (big shout for housekeeping team) and with first class, we did not hear anything from the corridor or other rooms. Lovely touch and felt so at home with high quality furnishings, bed linen and superb bathroom. As was said in the review title, the service was exemplary at every point and we really can not recommend Ohla Eixample Hotel enough. This is a hip hotel in a neighbourhood that was central to lots of cool eateries, bars and shops. From the moment I made the enquiry I found that all staff were excellent and helpful! They go above and beyond. A big thank you to David from front desk for making sure my reservation was as I wish. 

I would like to make a special mention to a very nice young lady, she is on training at the front desk, so sorry I do not remember her name. She assisted me in every enquiry we had.  She is fantastic and adorable, SUPERB PROFESSIONAL! We drop off our case and had a relaxing drink at the cool roof bar with an amazing pool. 

We found the whole experience fantastic! From the time we walked into the hotel on the Friday afternoon to leaving on the Saturday afternoon, we found the facilities and staff superb!
We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others!

Big thank you!

22,"Cool hotel, nice vibe, friendly staff, good times!","Just got back from a 15 night stay at the Hotel Ohla Eixample in Barcelona for a business trip.

The hotel has a nice and relaxing vibe whilst upholding a 5* rating. All the staff were very friendly and pleasant all day and all night too.

There’s some breakout areas which were very welcomed to have, however the power outlets were minimal unfortunately.

The breakfast buffet was a little bit unimpressive overall. The options varied each day which was appreciated, but the scrambled eggs were often cold and dry by the time I got to them anyway. The food selection was pretty good, offering breads, pastries, fruit, cooked meats, cakes and even sweets if you fancy a gummy bear or two for breakfast. There’s also a lot of options for fruit juices, eaters and other drinks you may wish to start your day. If this could be reviewed/improved of then I’d have no reservations about upgrading my rating to a 5 too!

Thanks for your hospitality",4,2018,06,26
22,Good,"  This hotel has a nice location, close to many attractions and restaurants. The room is spacious and clean. Staff is helpful. 
   However, the housekeeping could be improved. For example, there’s no refill of toothbrush when there’s clearly none left. 
   After all, it is a good hotel. ",5,2018,06,26
22,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic service","My fiancé took me to Barcelona as a surprise for my 30th Birthday last month. He managed to book the hotel without my help (usually I’m the one who spends days searching for hotels) and to be honest I couldn’t have found a better place to stay! We stayed at the Ohla Eixample for 3 nights and we really enjoyed every minute of it. When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the charming front desk staff who were very welcoming and we were offered a glass of champagne while we waited to check in, which was a lovely touch. It’s a modern hotel which has mastered the perfect balance of being contemporary whilst also feeling homely. It’s clearly been very cleverly designed as every corner has something eye catching like the entrance where there are large wild flowers in vases, multi coloured pendant lights and wire figure sculptures.

Our room was just perfect for the two of us and we loved the open plan layout, the spacious walk-in shower which was almost spa-like and the large bed was super comfy! Although we were only there for a few days, it was certainly large enough to spend a week in or longer if need be. As there are so many fabulous restaurants in Barcelona we didn’t eat lunch or dinner at the hotel, but we did have breakfast which was pleasant but nothing to write home about – they do a good selection of cakes and biscuits but lacked cooked food. One restaurant we visited which you must try is Gallito which is just behind the W hotel, it has a wonderful terrace overlooking the sea and I had baked monkfish which was probably one of the most delicious things I’ve ever eaten!

The staff at the Ohla Eixample made it seem as if nothing was too much trouble. On our first evening at the hotel we went to the sky bar on the roof top for a drink before we went out for dinner but the bar was closed because it was pretty windy, so we asked the barman downstairs when it would next be open and he very kindly offered to send someone to open the bar especially for us! That night when we returned after dinner, the hotel had delivered a bottle of cava to our room for my birthday (the man on reception had realised it was my birthday when looking at my passport at check in) and I thought this was a really lovely gesture.

We spend most of the day wondering around Barcelona and as it’s a pretty big city, we didn’t get to see all we wanted to in just three days so I’d recommend staying for longer if possible. The hotel suggested doing a Segway tour which was a great way sightsee - it was our first time and I highly recommend it if you haven’t tried it… it’s really not as difficult or a frightening as it seems! We toured with BCN and Anka was our tour guide who was fab. After our Segway tour we visited a restaurant called Salamanca which was deceptive from the outside but inside it was a huge restaurant with tables that seemed to keep going and going and every one of them was full. The food was fantastic, especially the fresh fish and paella too.

As after a long day sightseeing, we loved returning to the Ohla Eixample as really is a little haven in the hustle and bustle of Barcelona. The roof top pool is small but it has lovely beanbag loungers to lay out on and look at the rooftops of the surrounding buildings. I’m sure one day we will be return to Barcelona and we certainly wouldn’t hesitate to stay at the Ohla Eixample again.",4,2018,06,20
22,Nice location and wonderful service,"This was our first trip to Barcelona.  My wife and I stayed at Hotel Ohla which is very nicely located.  The hotel staff made this hotel a special one.  Upon arrival at the reception, everyone gave you a warm smile and offered you a glass of water.  The room was spacious with a balcony and the design was stylish.  Marti of the concierge was absolutely first class.  All his restaurant recommendations were just spot on and we obtained from him all relevant and accurate travel information we needed.  Nicholas was also helpful and he tried his best to rectify the problem we had regarding the location of the pick-up point of a guided tour we joined.

I only have 2 suggestions:  1.  The sofa in the room, though very elegant, was a bit too low and did not have sufficient support for the back.  2. The selection of the food at breakfast was fabulous but it would be great if they could have some device to keep the temperature of the hot dishes (which turned cold easily).",4,2018,06,18
22,Olha Eixample Barcelona ,"My husband Wim and I have just left Barcelona staying at Olha Eixample hotel for a wonderful 8 nights. We were greeted so warmly on our first day, especially by David and Michelle,and every day after that. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful. The room was lovely, the sheets were incredibly soft and the mattress was firm and very comfortable. My husband kept saying that the shower was the best he’d ever been in. We were given a mobile phone to carry around with us and found this to be extremely helpful, especially whilst using google maps. 
Rui was excellent explaining what tours to take and how to get around the city. 
The breakfast was unreal. Unfortunately we did not find out the waitress’ name that we adored. She was a tall, slim, dark haired girl recently from Italy. We were sad when she had her day off and we couldn’t see her. 
Raul was also very helpful at the front counter, as they all were. Even the ones just greeting you as you walked through the door. 
We highly recommend this hotel. Location was superb but the friendliness of the staff was the best!! ",5,2018,06,08
22,A comedy of errors!,"We booked a twin room, but as it wasn't ready when we arrived early, we checked in and left our bags in our friends room next door and and went out. When we came back to the hotel later in the evening, our room had been given away to someone else???? We had already paid in full in advance, and demanded another room near our friends. There were no twin rooms, only double. We asked for a twin room, and were asked to wait while the room was made up for us.
We waited in reception and asked for a drink while we were waiting. The bar staff really didn't want to serve us and were most unhelpful. The Baileys was simply ice-cream with a shot of liquor added. We were then told our room was ready, so we went to look at it. They had simply folded over the double duvet and put it on 1 bed, and left the double sheets on, but had kicked the excess sheets under the bed. By this time we were understandably furious. We went back to reception and demanded that the beds be made up properly. Apparently there were no housekeeping staff on duty??? And this is a 5* hotel?????? 
We demanded to be given a room (yes, we were shouting by this time) and eventually were given a room each. The shower in my room flooded the floor, and I mean flooded, (it happened each time I showered, but was not fixed)
The Reception Manager was very apologetic the next morning, and said that he would not charge us for the night's accommodation. BUT when I checked out, I was given a bill for 440 Euro!!??!! I nearly had a fit, as I said that we had paid in full. When they checked my key card, they realised that they had given me the bill for the original room that we had booked, but which had been given away! The guy at reception obviously could not read the room number on my key card.
AND this is meant to be a 5* hotel. Most definitely not",1,2018,06,08
22,Amazing stay,We had the best time at Ohla Eixample. All of the staff was incredible and extremely accommodating and friendly. The rooms were beautiful and breakfast in the morning was delicious. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2018,06,07
22,Wonderful,"My boyfriend and I spent a fantastic week in Barcelona at Ohla Eixample. Great environment with an incredibly helpful and friendly staff. Perfect central location for shopping, eating and sightseeing. Great restaurant. Highly recommended.",5,2018,06,06
22,Wonderful stay,"I have just returned from a short break in Barcelona. I've been to the city plenty of times and have stayed at lots of different hotels throughout the years. 
We picked this hotel initially because of it's location and the rate. We got a very decent price for a 5* property. The hotel met and exceeded our exceptions. The design was beautiful, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, superb locations for sightseeing and shopping. Breakfast was amazing too. Rooms are quiet, spacious and very comfortable. 
I like trying out new places, but I really liked this hotel so much that instead of testing out something new, I've already made another booking for summer. 
I can really recommend this hotel.",5,2018,06,01
22,"Several good things, several bad things","Check-in was great. The front desk staff was wonderful and the complimentary bottle of cava was a very nice touch.  Booked a junior suite and thought it was supposed to have a balcony.  Our room didn't and the balcony option that they showed us was in the back of the hotel with a very unappealing view (there were many other balcony rooms with better views but we weren't offered these).  The décor was not my style- hallways and room very dimly lit, room had stucco ceiling and cement floor.  Size of room was fine.  Bathroom was nicely appointed BUT you walk into the room to an open bathroom so if you want any privacy in the bath, ain't happening.  Housekeeping did not make up our room until nearly 5PM though we had been out most of the day. Pool on roof  is very nice.  They did not give us the wake-up call that we placed on the day of departure.  Location is great for seeing L'Eixample sites- Gaudi, restaurants and shopping.",3,2018,05,31
22,Great Little Hotel,"My wife and I recently spent six nights at the Ohla Eixample and had a wonderful experience.  The staff of the hotel were extremely welcoming and pleasantly helpful throughout our stay.  We appreciated the room layout, especially the fact that the shower, sink and toilet are each in separate spaces. We also liked the hotel fitness center and skybar area by the rooftop pool.  In addition, we liked the location of the hotel, just off Rambla Catalunya near Av. Diagonal.  We enjoy walking, and this hotel is in a great central location for exploring the city.    It's an easy and enjoyable walk down to Placa de Catalunya.  This little hotel lives up to its five-star rating.  We will plan to stay here again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,05,31
22,Couldn't have asked for much more,"Celebrated our 2nd year anniversary here with a 6-night stay. We had a bath prepared for us for our 1st night and it included a bottle of cava. They provided a 2nd free bottle I guess because it was our anniversary. If it were a hotel that cut corners, that would have been an easy one to pull. We asked for a deluxe room and were surprised when we arrived with a junior suite waiting for us. The hotel room was prepared romantically and beautifully. The hotel in general is very smart and handsome looking. Would love to stay here again. The staff treated us with impeccable anticipation and quality. 

Every-other Thursday i think they have a feature a few local bartenders that prepare a cocktail menu with a couple specials each. These were delicious and if you're there when this happens, take advantage! They know what they're doing! Very creative! The location is great. We bought some transit tickets, but every time we'd check on Google Maps to see which line to take, it would have taken us just as long or a minute or two longer to walk there–so we did! Walking distance from the restaurant-dense Gracia neighborhood too!

Wish the gym was a little bigger and had larger free weights, but I just did slower reps.",5,2018,05,31
22,Fantastic hotel in a perfect location for a city Barcelona break,"We arrived at Ohla Eixample at midnight and were met with very friendly and polite staff who quickly checked us in, took our bags and showed us to the room.

The service was exceptional, anything we required was promptly taken care of. Every evening when we came back the room was cleaned to perfection and chocolates left on the bed along with a note of the next days weather. On our last night at the hotel they left us a lovely bottle of Cava in an ice bucket with 2 glasses.

The room we stayed in had a huge flat screen TV mounted on the wall and an extremely comfortable queen size bed. You also get your own personnel hand held device which you can take about with you, it has lots of information about Barcelona, which sights to see and restaurants to go to, very helpful for first time visitors.

Hotel is only a 8 minute walk away from La Pedrera or Casa Batllo and 25 minute walk to La Sagrada Familia, which are must see if visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,05,31
22,Excellent staff and facilities ,"Staff are polite and provided many useful info such as city guides with detailed marking on maps. Explained in detail for facilities in room. One of the most useful is the handy phone provided. We can take ot out with 4g data and free calls to local and international. Design of the hotel is good and unique. With this price range, it is the 1st choice of my future stays in BAR. ",5,2018,05,28
22,Great for a weekend break to chill out ,Great Hotel with everything handy and comfy . Helpful staff with warm welcoming speacially the housekeeping weee Great ! Good for weekend Break to Relax and chill out . You will get more than you pay for . ,5,2018,05,26
22,Excellent stay,"How delighted we are to have chosen this hotel for our 5 nights stay in Barcelona for our anniversary.
The location is perfect! The neighbourhood of Eixample is adorable, with many nice restaurants and very easy access to the metro station. 
The hotel is very charming and cosy, with a minimalist and modern design. 
We really want to highlight the excellent service provided by the staff from the second we arrived and throughout our stay. 
The staff in the entire hotel (from reception, to waiters at the restaurant and pool bar) are extremely welcoming and friendly, always with a smile to greet you.
A special thank you to the concierges (Dave, Nicolas and Federico) that couldn’t have done better to please us and recommend all the best places and restaurants to visit. And also, to Rui and Mimo for the services and kindness.

We couldn’t forget our housekeeper Yossi, thank you for looking after our room and making sure that everything was impeccable every time we came back to the room!

They all made this experience and date unforgettable!!!

We definitely recommend this hotel for who appreciates quality and has attention to details. 6 stars service!
",5,2018,05,23
22,Fabulous!!!,"This hotel was excellent, very central for walking and we also used the Metro close by.  Our room was lovely, very modern - the first time we have had the experience of a glass shower - very quaint!  The staff were very helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  The restaurant and bar area was lovely and the lobby was stunning.  We did try to book into the restaurant for a meal of the Saturday but unfortunately it was fully booked!  We were contacted as they had a cancellation but we had already eaten by then - a good idea to book ahead next time.  We would definitely return to this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone!",5,2018,05,21
22,Excellent hôtel!! Warmly recommended !,"All was really  fine !
Gorgeous room with very pleasant personal 
3 days very pleasant 15 minutes walk from huge famous Sagrada familia and we appreciated the area and the opportunity to walk to visit the city 
We will come back soonest in this nice hotel",5,2018,05,12
22,Great hospitable hotel..,"Came to this hotel on a business trip and as soon as the taxi driver pulled outside we were very warmly greeted by the door man. Inside a very welcoming staff reception checked us in and the rest was like coming home and relaxing. The hotels fine decor nice,clean and tidy rooms were just what we wanted after a long tiresome flight. Absolutely quiet and silent rooms relaxed us down for a few hours and for the remainder of our days. We had a 4 day stay and the beautiful ambience of Barcelona was so soothing and relaxing that I cannot wait to come back to Spain and back to the Ohla Exiample. I would recommend this hotel as far as one of the best hotels I have stayed in as being a frequent traveler and flier all over the world.. 5* all the way to the staff memebers and management.",5,2018,05,12
22,The breakfast lets them down - everything else perfect!,"I really wanted to give them a 5 star rating on here but unfortunately the breakfast was not all that for a 5 star hotel. Let’s start with the positives:

The hotel is perfect half situated. It’s central and walking distance from the main shopping street, a few Gaudi buildings and other things to see and do. The hotel is modern, new and clean which is great. The decor is minimalist and fabulous in my view. We stayed in a suite (704), which had amazing space and design. The rooftop pool and outdoor seating is really the differentiator here. Amazing!

The breakfast.. there are two things that didn’t work for us: the service and the food selection. Examples of the poor service: when we were seated on our first day no one explained to us what was available to order with the waiter and what was on the buffet. We only realised this when we saw other guests ordering other dishes with the waiter (different types of eggs mainly). Also, when ordering coffee, sometimes it never came and other times it arrived within 20minutes. The service was not consistent. The buffet does not cater for vegetarians and vegans. It has limited options for vegetarians and no options for vegans. They could at least have had some cooked mushrooms, hummus or something slightly more filling then just fruits and plain toast. Not having non diary milk and yoghurt products in this day and age is really poor form for a 5 star hotel. 

It really is a shame about the breakfast as the rest of the Hotel and the service at reception is truly 5 star!",4,2018,05,07
22,Stylish and tech savvy,"This hotel is incredibly stylish, even down to breakfast and how it is served. In the room I would say that style comes at the expense of comfort - I prefer carpet to concrete - but the room was stunning nonetheless. The staff on the front desk were friendly and perhaps the most helpful I have come across in Europe. The gadgetry in the room will keep tech fiends happy! A great stay in a great hotel!",4,2018,05,02
22,Lovely boutique hotel,"Great welcome which counts for such a lot after travelling, great room with all mod cons and free bottled water. Pool on roof and area for stting and catching the sun. Wonderful breakfast available for most of the morning. Best thing - the staff!",5,2018,04,30
22,Ohla Example to the Rescue in style,"The week of April 5-8 my husband and I were traveling from paris to Barcelona.We had battled the train strike and were coming via extra dollars spent and an early flight at unexpected cost. We asked out cab driver to take us to the hotel Ohla BARCELONA which we had booked. He took us to the wrong hotel. Actually he took us to the BEST hotel because our experience at the Hotel Ohla  Eixample was a true highlight. We travel extensively and frequently on both business and pleasure and we cannot recommend this establishment highly enough. Kudos to Javier and Laura and their staff who immediately greeted us with champagne, hot towels and a Choice-remain at that hotel and transfer our reservation or go over to the Ohla Barcelona. We were exhausted with lots of luggage and decided to stay. Nico and the entire staff of wonderful concierges and desk crew made our stay a true joy.There was nothing too big or too small. they recommended and made reservations for a fabulous Flamenco show. We had a room upgrade.Beautiful lilies in our room.  The hotel is gorgeous with a beautiful lobby to relax in that is both modern, elegant and homey.The bartender is friendly and gracious. The included breakfast is one of the best we have ever seen-possibly the best with extensive and elegant offerings in a beautiful glass setting surrounded by outdoor ferns and elegant lighting. The room was comfortable with ample storage.The rooftop pool was beautiful with nice chairs and even if you do not swim a spectacular view.The hotel is in easy walking distance of some spectacular restaurants  and shopping recommended by the highly talented concierge staff.  I know I am forgetting some names ALL were awesome we dealt with two gentlemen.  Anyone staying on business this is a MUST. If you are a tourist it will be your pleasure at the end of a busy tourist day to stay in this area only a $5.00-7.00 cab ride from anywhere in city one could wish to go.  STAY HERE-we loved it-spectacular and worth every penny-THANK YOU!!",5,2018,04,26
22,My go to in Barcelona,My second visit to this great hotel.  Stayed there for 10 days on my last visit and they do it right.  Great clean rooms with wonderful terraces.  Concierge always helpful and great breakfast.  Cannot go wrong if you want to stay in the Eixample neighborhood.  I will be back again and look forward to staying here!,5,2018,04,25
22,Truly a ‘Wow’ experience! Recommended.,"Me and my daugther stayed at this excellent hotel for her 40th birthday - wow experience with a truly amazing and helpfull staff. 

Can really recommend this wonderful hotel for a weekend especially the ATIC penthouse suite. 

Spacious rooms with amazing breakfast and a bed that you didnt want leave, so comfy. 

Really good and posh area. 

Thank you!",5,2018,04,23
22,Our 2nd time at this hotel - LOVED it again!,"I stayed at Ohla Eixample last year for five-nights (in the Suite) and have just returned from a three-night stay in one of the Junior Suites.  The hotel was excellent (again) in every way. It’s perfectly located near the top of Passeig de Gracia, with all the sites and popular things to do in the city within walking distance.

The room felt fresh and airy, and the bed was massive - My partner and I slept so well each night. The bathroom is beautifully designed and the toiletries are lovely.

The rooftop was great for sunbathing on after a morning of walking, I really liked the chilled out music by the pool too. 

The hotel breakfast was delicious - lots of choice, all fresh and tasty.

What makes the hotel extra special is that the staff were all fantastic - really warm and friendly. They were very welcoming and helpful from the moment we arrived.

I’ll definitely be back at the hotel again, Barcelona is a wonderful city and the hotel is the perfect base!

",5,2018,04,20
22,Lovely weekend at a great hotel,"We just came back from staying three nights at the Ohla Exiample and we are more than happy with the choice of hotel. We liked the room, spacious with a very nice bathroom (although open towards the room) and the rooftop pool was great and well heated which we appreciated. We had two rainy and cold days but could still enjoy a nice swin overlooking the roofstops of Barcelona. Breakfast was also nice with a combination of buffet and orders taken at the table. One evening we tried the 1-star restaurant Xerta. We choose the tasting menu which was very reasonably priced at 75 EUR together with the wine package. The food was good but a bit different to the taste compared to fine dining in Sweden. The wines was superb! We will definately book the same hotel again when returning to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,17
22,A great local five star hotel ,"This is conveniently located near Diagonal or Provenca Metro stations.

Staff was helpful. There is turndown service.

Gym is basic, treadmills and bicycles, with light dumbbells. Pool is nice with good views.

Breakfast is served in the same Michelin Star Xerta. Spread is small but good quality. Sparkling wine is served at breakfast.

Bellini as welcome drink at the lobby bar.

For a small boutique hotel the lobby is spacious and cosy.

I arrived at 9am and was impressed by free upgrade and early checkin.",5,2018,04,11
22,The perfect 5* star vacation with my husband!,"This hotel is nothing short of AMAZING! From the minute we arrived at the hotel - we were welcomed by friendly Concierge staff who assisted us with our luggage. We were offered a refreshing welcome drink Cava (Spanish sparkling wine) upon our arrival. Although our room was not ready when we arrived, we sat in the Lobby area which was very comfortable and cosy. There is a stunning bar as well, with a wide variety of wines and gins as well.  The location of the hotel is also really great, walking distance to almost all the tourist attractions and the main shopping districts. We stayed at the hotel for 7 days - the reception staff were very friendly and helpful, especially offering us tips and recommend places for us to go see or eat. We stayed in the Design Deluxe room - it was absolutely lovely, spacious and clean. We loved the shower with the glass door that looks into the room, the bed is also huge and was very comfortable. As per the other reviews, the mobile device you receive in the room is a wonderful touch and makes the experience of the hotel and your holiday that much better. 

The only downfall is the breakfast is the same EVERY DAY -  the buffet breakfast is a mix of cereals, cold fruit and cold meats, pastries such as croissants and muffins, scrambled eggs and mini sausages. So for our entire stay, we had the SAME BREAKFAST buffet every morning - so I would recommend they look at changing up the breakfast menu.

Other than that, this is an amazing hotel with such friendly staff - would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others as well. The modern and contemporary style of the hotel is what we loved the most - and the music played in the lobby and the hotel was really great as well.",4,2018,04,09
22,An example of how it should be,"It's pretty clear that this hotel has an amazing and extremely smart management. The working culture in this place (hotel and the restaurant) appears to be just wonderful. It is very, very hard to point out any flaws in this hotel. The most amazing thing is that the service is totally free of phoniness, while being the best possible kind of service. What is good for the customer? This is the question and it is answered here!

One very small defect: the disposable toothbrush provided has too rough brushes. One has to brush very gently to avoid gum damage. Of course this is not a problem if you have your own brush with you. And this is pretty much the only defect found on our stay!

Everything is top notch. The pool was warm and nice even on a slightly cold day. There is a cocktail night every second Thursday until 23:00, if I remember correctly (maybe 8 € for cocktails). We didn't have time to try it, but it was very popular.

There is so much for many other hotels to learn from Ohla Eixample. Hopefully the prices stay low enough even after reviews like this.",5,2018,04,06
22,Highly Recommended!,"Really great location and lovely modern hotel. The staff is very professional and friendly, the rooms are quiet even though it is on a busy street. I would highly recommend it especially for business trips.",5,2018,04,06
22,Easter Weekend in Bartcelona,"The hotel is situated in a very convenient location.  The hotel is on a road off The Top of The Ramblas.  There are restaurants and shops nearby, just not as busy.

The Staff cannot do enough for you, we were upgraded when we arrived.  We had a couple of issues with our room, there was no issue, they just moved us.  Rooms are spotless, service is top notch.

Would recommend.",4,2018,04,02
22,Highly recommended!,"We stayed at Ohla Eixample for four nights during long Easter weekend with our young adult daughters. The hotel is spacious, even a bit Scandinavian style and everything is very clean. The breakfast buffet with cava is great, the coffee fantastic ❤️ and you can order for example eggs and different kind of sandwiches from the kitchen too! The rooms are very modern and spacious - the glas wall by the bath tub is cool! 😉 They even have a rooftop pool, how fantastic is that! 👍🏼 The best part (and we really enjoyed a lot of everything at the hotel!) in this hotel is the staff. THE STAFF IS SO AWESOME AND FRIENDLY, A BIG THANK YOU TO YOU ALL, WE FELT VERY WELCOMED❣️",5,2018,04,02
22,GREAT STAFF and location,"We stayed only 2 nights and it was great. The staff was friendly and helpful, room modern, a bit bare but great neighborhood. The staff helped with dinner recommendation which were excellent. The rooftop was awesome! Beautiful pool, lounge chairs and view.",4,2018,03,21
22,"Outstanding service by courteous staff, walking distance to everywhere","I stayed for two weeks due to an unexpected family medical emergency. From the moment I arrived, the staff was extremely helpful--from lending me a phone adapter on the spot, to assisting with communicating with medical staff at the hospital, to arranging a courier for documents, to making  restaurant recommendations and reservation (for good restaurants),  researching for the best place to purchase artisanal turrons (traditional Almond candies).

My room was modern and sleek, yet very comfortable. The amenities are world-class. The roof is a perfect place to take a siesta and see the views of the city. The business center was architecturally splendid - cozy but quiet, with state of the art computing. You can concentrate. 

Though the circumstance of my trip was not pleasurable, the staff and the atmosphere in the hotel made my stay a very pleasurable one. I will return.",5,2018,03,20
22,Ohla - more a design hotel then a boutique hotel,"Overall a good experience - but call it a boutique hotel is overrated. Features, amenities, design, breakfast and the way of thinking are nothing you cant find in any design og high-end hotels around the world. 
You missing big time the personal and local touch!",3,2018,03,20
22,"Fantastic location, Fantastic service,","The staff really couldn't do enough for me, I stayed these on my own during a business trip and I couldn't have been made to feel more welcome.  I will definitely book to stay here again.  Very stylish and comfortable accommodation in a great central location.",5,2018,03,13
22,"Great service, stylish hotel in great location","Located close to Diagonal Metro Station with links to airport. Warm & Friendly welcome with all reception staff happy and approachable. We were checked in by Alba (trainee). She was excellent and very helpful. Our first impressions were of a stylish reception area with open plan bar and lounge. Stunningly beautiful. We received a complimentary glass of cava and a room upgrade to a Design room. The room was lovely, comfortable and well designed. The glass partition between wet room shower and bedroom was both novel and fun. A complimentary smart phone for use during our stay was great for getting directions and navigating the city of Barcelona. Breakfast was very good and the roof top heated infinity pool was excellent. Laura, Nicolas and Raul on the reception desk was so friendly and could not do enough to help us. Especially Nicolas who helped us with our itinerary, recommended restaurants and shows and booked them for us. Best hotel staff ever.",5,2018,03,05
22,Short Break In Barca (Ohla Eixample) 5*,"Stayed here with my girlfriend for 5 days and I've got to say if I visit Barceolna again, and I will have no hesitation in staying at Ohla Eixample!
The hotel is in a fantastic location, with easy access to public transport and most tourist attractions are within good walking distance.
The hotel itself was fantastic, from the moment we arrived, we were made to feel very welcome and I had a great feeling we were in good hands right away.
The staff's service was exceptional.  I can't fault one individual - Informative, polite and entertaining.
The Junior suite was superb - Clean, spacious and modern.  Very nice touch with a personal written note greeting us, with a bottle of Cava to top things off.
We used all the facilities, ie. gym, pool, bar etc... (Excellent btw)
Breakfast was brilliant too, with plenty options.
I can't recommend this hotel enough.  If you visit Barca, make sure to stay at Ohla Eixample.",5,2018,02,28
22,This is where you want to stay in Barcelona,"The location is excellent, the room exceptionally comfortable and the staff beyond comparison. We were treated like royalty.

22,Terrific boutique hotel in the heart of Eixample,A wonderful modern hotel with terrific service.  Dave Rodriguez at the front desk was especially terrific in giving advice to our daughter who recently moved to Barcelona.  Staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.  Hotel is in the heart of the Eixample neighborhood with great restaurants and fabulous shopping within walking distance.,5,2018,02,10
22,Impeccable service,"Best service.  Staff go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Great location, close to great restaurants and shopping, even to the old town. My daughter and I walked everywhere. Best to upgrade the room since the basic rooms are fairly small with no view",5,2018,02,10

Service is top notch - i got a free upgrade from a Junior Suite to one of the Atic rooms with a nice terrace. Room service was fast and the quality of the dishes good. Wha I like about the Junior Suites in this hotel is their size (approx. 40sqm) and the industrial like design in a cosy interpretation. Breakfast was superb, nothing to complain about and the restaurant where you have it is beautifully furnished. ",5,2018,02,04
22,Great location and wonderful service ,"Best part about the hotel is service. Staff is beyond friendly. They were kind and very helpful. My wife and i asked them to make us reservations at restaurants they recommended. They booked tickets for all of the tours we took in Barcelona. 
Room was very nice and spacious. They come with a private balcony. 
They have a heated pool on the roof. Beautiful view. ",5,2017,12,27
22,"Tries too hard, definitely not a 5 star hotel","This hotel ticks the boxes to claim its 5 star rating but from the moment you arrive it doesn't deliver the sort of experience that you would like to receive when you book a 5 star hotel.  The lobby has a low ceiling, the lift is wobbly and looks cheap and the mix of modern finishings and sprayed concrete in many places including the bedrooms creates a bizarre, unfinished look.  The shower is nice and spacious but has a floor to ceiling pane of glass into the bedroom - very revealing.",3,2017,12,20
22,A stunning gem this hotel is awesome,"No need to look further than this sophisticated and luxurious hotel in the Eixample.   Cava on arrival and an exemplary staff promptly facilitated checkin.  The room was trendy yet functional at every point.  Desk, large sink and open shower worked well in this space. 
Comfortable bed and complimentary water and coffee. Stunning bath products. 
Professional and warm staff at every corner. The rooftop pool looked exquisite for warmer days.  The lobby was inviting and cozy with a fireplace.  Great tapas places nearby, shopping and an amazing meat store with Iberica ham in the same block. This is a better service platform than Ritz or Four Seasons. Fair prices for standard rooms to more spacious suites. While some hotels think an email welcome and thank you is sufficient, this property offers actual notes throughout the stay.  Nice shopping bag and fitness center.  The restaurant is a one star Michelin too. Staff is five star spot on throughout check in and bell guys.  
Finally, a hotel that gets it all.  ",5,2017,12,10
22,Awesome,"Amazing helpful Staff, Prime hotel location & spacious room... 
Suggest to provide bidet or hand spray in toilets..

Wifi is provided for Free.,

Easily check in & check out procedures..
Breakfast is good as well..

Strongly Recommended..

22,Good hotel,"Stayed here for three nights Good hotel generally. Was given a room with a bad view however 

Bed is very firm and rather uncomfortable 
Food is average, and a bit expensive. Poor room service menu. Nothing extraordinary. 

Very friendly and helpful staff.",4,2017,12,03
22,Amazing hotel to stay in!,"We came to this hotel for our honeymoon and it is safe to say that we were not disappointed with our choice! First off the staff went to great lengths to ensure that everything was arranged and confirmed for our arrival. A telephone call to confirm all. The staff speak great English which made my life easier! We had a junior suite and it was spacious and had everything you would need. A huge shower which was a very welcome addition. The bed was very comfy and absolutely massive. Room service was prompt and they had a wide range of food on the menu. One of our favourite things was the rooftop pool. It was very nice to just relax up there and the pool was a great temperature!

The location is central and it is a 5-10 minutes walk to la ramblas which is ideal!

Overall, if we are to go back to Barcelona, we would stay here again!",5,2017,11,26
22,Wonderful hotel,"This is a new hotel with all modern comforts one could wish for.  Superb staff with a focus on customer needs. 
Food is first class.
Decor spanish modern 
The softest bedlinen.  Guest robes and slippers.   Even a smart phone free for our stay.    Location is central and the hotel has a hatted restaurant.  
This hotel provided us with exceptional service and made our stay a memorable experience.  Thank you so much.",5,2017,11,21
22,"Enjoyed our stay at Ohla, walking distance from Las Ramblas.","We were well looked after here and stayed in a stylish room with etched bathroom in the middle, funky to us but not to everyone's taste I'm sure.
Stunning neoclassical design, clean throughout and the place smelled divine.
Great breakfast and service during our stay, must try La Plassohla downstairs for high end tapas.
Walking distance from major historical sites including La Sagrada Familia, the Gothic Quarter, Las Rambla and El Nacional to name a few.

Overall highly recommend this place and would come back.",5,2017,11,16
22,Fabulous hotel!,"We really loved staying at Ohla Eixample! From the moment we arrived we were given a room upgrade! We were also offered cava or water and our bags were taken to our room! 
The staff are all so friendly & helpful! The hotel itself is very modern, clean and comfortable! The buffet breakfast was delicious as well as room service! The concierge service was very helpful and nothing was too much to ask! We love the little touches like a chocolate on our pillow the last night.
The roof terrace pool is gorgeous, we loved the cute tortoise statue next to it! We even had the pool to ourselves most of our last morning as it was out of season but still very sunny & warm! 
The location of the hotel is great, easy to get to restaurants and we even popped to the very local McDonald’s one evening! 
The bed we stayed in was so comfy and very neatly made each day by housekeeping, we loved the lighting system, were you could select ‘relax’ ‘night’ ‘day’ or switch of all electric to the room, we were also given 2 large glass bottles of cold water whenever we drunk them each day for free! Which was handy! 
The shower was the other side of a clear glass screen, parrelel to our bed which was nice and clever that the toilet is hidden in the wall! 
We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona! :D thank you so much for a beyond perfect experience!",5,2017,11,10
22,Lovely short holiday in Barcelona,"Friendly staff, unique junior suite, nice rooftop area with a small swimming pool. The breakfast was good, there was even Cava served every morning!
The hotel is located in a nice area, short walk to the main sights and shops. I would definetely go back to this hotel.",4,2017,11,04
22,4 days in Barcelona,"We had a wonderful 4 night break here, the hotel fell over backwards to give us a special break. Our room was lovely and the service we received was perfect.
The hotel is very near to the centre of the city so handy for all the places we wanted to visit.",5,2017,11,02
22,Beautiful contemporary hotel,We loved our stay at Ohla. The junior suite was spacious and well-appointed. The soaking tub was perfect after a long day of walking. We thought that this was a wonderful part of Barcelona; far from the touristy Ramblas but with plenty of great restaurants and cafes nearby. Breakfast was diverse and nicely served and we especially enjoyed our bath products.,5,2017,10,30
22,Perfect in every way!,"My wife and I decided to take a spur-of-the-moment trip to Barcelona and selected the Ohla Eixample as the hotel that appeared to best fit our requirements.  The location was perfect...close to all of the main attractions of Barcelona and on a side street right off the upper Ramblas but in a quieter, more upscale area with great shopping and restaurants (Eixample).  The facility was beautiful and decorated in a modernista style.  Our room was stylish, roomy, convenient, ""green"" and, most importantly, comfortable. I loved the shower's glass wall that looked into the bedroom...obviously more of a ""couples"" feature.  The breakfast was amazing...anything you could possibly want or imagine, including around 10 different Spanish cured meats and as much Cavas as you would want to drink at breakfast....we would eat a hearty breakfast in the morning and didn't get truly hungry until it was time to take a late evening meal...perfect for when you are on the go.  We also took advantage of the heated rooftop pool and the spa services while there.  Highly recommend the salt scrub followed by a massage.  I am leaving the best part of this great hotel for last...the service.  The staff there, from the Concierge to the masseuses, were all so nice and friendly and helpful...they really made our stay very special.  We plan on returning to Barcelona soon and when we do, we plan on staying at the Ohla Eixample agin, there really is no reason to stay anywhere else.",5,2017,10,30
22,"Great location, wonderful accommodations, cool hotel, great staff","Wonderfully located somewhat contemporary hotel (a change from our others) in cosmopolitan Barcelona.  Beautiful, comfortable.  Lovely breakfast, bar in center of lobby very convenient for any-time refreshment, and just right in every way.  Loved the super long bath tub in our room, as well as a separate shower.  Perfecto!",5,2017,10,30
22,"Fine Hotel great location, excellent staff","From the reception to the kind and professional service this was an excellent stay. The room I stayed in was nice but nothing special. Very nice for a romantic weekend but I was on my own and visiting not for tourism but to resolve documentation issues.
I just think that the staff were outstanding
I did not try the one star Michelin restaurant but the bar food was superb and reasonably priced. Jamon Ibérica and Catalan cheeses just perfect.
But the staff made the difference.",4,2017,10,30
22,Restful Stay in Barcelona,"The Ohla Eixample is THE place to stay in Barcelona. If you want a great hotel with modern amenities this is the place for you. All of the staff were very friendly, welcoming and full of information about the city. Everyone spoke excellent English.  Our room was on the top floor and fit our needs perfectly. The bedroom was very spacious with a comfortable bed, large, modern bathroom with walk in shower, and great pillows. They offer a pillow menu to customize your sleeping experience.  The breakfast buffet was generous with a great selection of sweet breads, fresh fruit, cereal, meats, cheeses, breads and eggs. In addition to the great buffet, the chefs in the kitchen were happy to make custom omelets. The concierge was very helpful and madet reservations to Casa Mila  and the Picasso Museum for us.  The Ohla Eixample is in a great location, very close to all the major sights, excellent shopping and a myriad of restaurants. We highly recommend Ohla Eixample and would stay there again.",5,2017,10,29
22,Incredible hotel. Perfect location. Great service!!,"100% satisfied. The location could not have been better. Very modern, clean rooms with superb service. Room was made up twice a day. I travel a lot and this hotel is in the top 3 best hotels ANYWHERE!! 
Great breakfast and helpful front desk staff. ",5,2017,10,29
22,Autumn journey with wife to Barcelona and Ohla Eixample,"Perfect stay from the beginning to the end. All from some welcoming Cava, fresh rooms, easy living feeling to ability to take a shower after checkout and lock our luggage in for some hours due to late flight home. Thanks for all. Note that the bar in the lobby is a high quality bar with high standard. 

We´ll be back!/Mikael and Erica",5,2017,10,29
22,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!!,"I would like to say a big thank you to all the team and management for making our stay worth while and truly amazing . You made our stay at your hotel such an incredible experience and we loved staying there so much, that we will be back again.

I arranged a trip away for my partner's birthday, but planned months in advanced. The hotel team were so patient and extremely helpful with all my emails, as I was arranging a surprise for when we arrived in the hotel. I asked for 30 balloons and a bottle of Cava with a birthday message. The hotel staff did exactly that and it was displayed so well, I was over the moon. Not only this but they also left treats each night on our pillow, which I thought was such a nice touch to our stay. Coming back to a little something just made our stay more special. It's the little things that go a long way.

The staff were so welcoming and friendly, its such a positive environment and you feel as though they really do care about your needs and want to make your stay as good as it can be. One staff member helped us located attractions on the map as soon as we checked in, there was no rush, i;d like to add, we checked in and then one member of staff kindly asked if we knew what we had planned, and then got a map out for us, and started to help us located key attractions and helps us how to get there, which came in handy when we left to explore the beautiful city! 

The whole aroma of the Reception area is fantastic, the vibes you get straight away are calming and relaxed. The welcome drink on arrival that we had was a nice touch, Cava was delicious, couldn't fault it. 

The restaurant decor, as well as the hotel decor, is very classy and modern, if you love architecture as much as my partner, then you'll be amazed! We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and it was delicious, you can even ask how you want your eggs to be cooked and they will do it for you. The buffet had a variety to chose from - all of it was very good quality and the coffee, was delicious!

The roof top is luxurious, you have your own towels, changed daily, ready for you to collect and use. The layout is beautiful. The infinity pool is a great touch, we spent the afternoon up there before the FCBarcelona match and what a relaxation. There is a phone for you to use, and if you require anything, you can call Reception and they will be at your service.
 
We wish the team and the hotel a very successful future. Please keep the positive energy you all have, it's what every hotel needs! We wish we didn't have to leave. Their hospitality is by far the best we've ever had! 

A huge thank you to David Rodríguez, he kept great communication with me and made sure, myself and my partner, had the best experience and was very well looked after. Also, a huge thank you to all the other staff we encountered whilst we stayed at Ohla Eiamxple, you all had such a positive vibe and friendly face, we felt so at home whilst staying there. 

Thank you for the room service and taking our bags up to our room. The taxi ride from the airport was no stress, the driver was on time, ready and waiting.  The bottle of water was brilliant, I wasn't expecting that, but was needed after getting of the plane and I was so grateful. Thank you for keeping our room spotless and listening to our requirements.

I recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone. If you want to book a romantic trip away.a trip to relax and explore or for a special occasion, then please book here and you will be looked after.

22,Beautiful hotel with great amenities,"The hotel is beautiful and the decor was very modern. From check-in to check-out, the staff there were very attentive and helpful. They also all spoke great English. The pool on the rooftop was very nice. The hotel was also centrally located, with many great tapas restaurants nearby.",5,2017,10,16
22,Great Hotel and Location,We choose the hotel based on a recommendation from our travel consultant and we were not disappointed.  The hotel is in a great location in the Eixample district.  There are many great restaurants and shopping near the hotel.  It is also located near the metro and also has easy access to taxi’s to explore the rest of the city.  It is about a 20 minute walk to the Gothic Quarter or Sagrada Familia.  It’s about 30 minutes to the airport and 15 minutes from the train station.  The staff very polite and willing to address any questions we had.  They were very helpful making reservations for restaurants each evening. Since we don’t speak Spanish fluently we were pleased that the staff were all able to speak very good English.  I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,10,15
22,Absolutely Stunning,"We couldn't have picked a better hotel for our stay in Barcelona.

Everything screams quality and class. The beautiful rooms, bars and restaurant are superb.
The food in the restaurant was hands down the best meal I have eaten in years and the service excellent.

All of the staff are friendly, knowledgeable and happy to help.
Can't wait to return. ",5,2017,10,06
22,Gorgeous Hotel 5*,"Great Hotel, great location few minutes walk to all the attractions and surrounded by lots of great places to eat, very friendly helpful staff, breakfast was amazing. 

Couldn't fault it! 

Really enjoyed the roof top pool, would stay there again.  

Downside, our room had a rubbish view, so we kept the blind shut, but I guess its 50/50 chance in a town centre",5,2017,10,04
22,4 night break with friends,"This is a really lovely hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough to help. It was my friend's birthday while we were there and they sent a bottle of bubbly to her room. The rooms are nice and a good size with nice comfortable beds. There are some nice touches, like a chocolate left on your pillow every night and free bubbly on arrival. The pool is nice and the waitress made us some nice tapas which were free of charge. I would definitely choose this hotel again.",5,2017,10,04
22,❤️,"I was in the hotel in July 2017, everything is new and modern , especially the cosmetics relaxion massage line in the room. Beautiful roof with a pool and the opportunity to sunbathe or relax at nihjt with a glass of something tasty;)",5,2017,10,02
22,One night stay,"The hotel is stunning, especially the rooftop bar and pool. The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. The only slight downside was the time it took for hot food to arrive at breakfast. But otherwise, a faultless stay.",5,2017,10,02
22,"Service, Service, Service!","The Hotel itself is worth its stars. My partner and I stayed for 7 days in August 2017. The rooms are nice (although my balcony was not worth the price increase from the standard rate) - greatly decorated and with top quality showers and bathtubs. The bed was comfortable, large and with smooth clean sheets. Lighting was a plus, given the room has pre-programmed options to dim lights from your bed-side switches. Cool touch for a relaxing environment.

The hotel is located at a great place in Barcelona. The neighbourhood is more suitable for people wanting to be a little bit off the crowd, but yet in the heart of the Barcelona style. I personally prefer Passeig de Gracia and Ramblas de Catalunya to the more famous The Ramblas. It was great to be able to move away from the site-seeing spots into a more calm place to rest and sleep. And yet there were countless options for charming restaurants and places for Tapas. The rooftop itself is nice, but I preferred the Rooftop at the other Ohla Hotel in the Gothic Quarter - worth visiting for drinks while walking the Gothic Quarter on a sunny day!

We didn`t try the MIchelin-star restaurant of the Hotel, but it seemed fairly priced for the tasting Menu. 

The Staff was really what made this stay so enjoyable for us. The staff at check in was super helpful in indicating the basics of the city for us. Front Desk and Concierge services helped purchase the tickets online, rented bikes for us and had them delivered at the hotel, got us VIP tickets for the club and generally were very friendly.

If I could make a suggestion: please make the air conditioning light turn off at night - that blinking light seems to be a detail, but details matter in a 5-star hotel where everything else seems se perfect.

All in all, I would recommend this hotel for older couples or families (generally people wanting peace and quiet).",5,2017,10,01
22,Luxurious hotel with very friendly staff!,"We spent our honeymoon in Ohla Eixample. Our room (deluxe room) was spacious and cosy with a big balcony in 8th floor. Hotel staff remembered us with sparkling bottle which was a nice gesture. Staff was also very helpful to find us good restaurants and things to do in Barcelona. Rooftop swimming pool is small but it's enough for a city holiday. Location is really good and there are lot of great restaurants nearby. We also had Fall in love package which inluded romantic bath, sparkling, chocolate and breakfast in bed. Bath was really nice and relaxing. I can highly recommend this package. We really enjoyed our stay in Ohla Eixample and definitely we'll return here one day. We want to thank the hotel staff for making our honeymoon in Barcelona unforgettable. ",5,2017,10,01
22,Great Hotel Experience,"This is a 5-star hotel providing a 5-star experience.  The hotel is in a great location, plenty of restaurants and shopping but away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla and the surrounding areas so it's quiet.  The hotel staff, to a man and woman, were outstanding.  Anything we needed or asked of them they willingly provided with helpful tips on the best places to eat and spend time.  Nightly turn down service a plus for us.  Breakfast was super as well; plenty of choices and everything was fresh and well prepared.  We would stay here again next time in Barcelona and highly recommend.",5,2017,09,29
22,"Five Stars, Two Thumbs Up","I have been traveling in Spain in the last two weeks, and have stayed in a number of so-called five-star hotels. I am afraid none of these deserve to be called five-star establishments, until I found Ohla Eixample In Barcelona. This is a boutique hotel that is cozy, friendly and attentive. The room we have is spacious. Service is excellent without being intrusive.  It is located on a quiet section of Carrer Còrsega, yet  it is very convenient, only minutes away on foot from Avinguda Diagonal and Passeig de Gràcia where one can do some serious shopping and where two of the main Gaudi buildings are. The hotel operates a Michelin one-star restaurant Xerta, making it convenient for the foodies. (Xerta is the subject of another review). 

The staff at the front desk is all very helpful. Deserving a special mention is Marti who answers all our questions about tourist attractions and helps us get the required tickets. He is knowledgeable and patient and speaks very good English. 

Richard is another staff who goes out of his way to help us. He accompanies us to the corner of the road to get a taxi and ensures that the driver knows where we want to go. 

Ohla Eixample will definitely be our hotel when we next visit Barcelona. ",5,2017,09,29
22,Best Trip Ever!,"If my wife and I could give this hotel a higher rating, we would do so in a heartbeat.  From the moment we arrived at Ohla, we experienced a level of customer service that should be an example to their peers.  The property itself was quite nice.  The rooms were modern and well appointed. The bars, pool and restaurant were exceptional as well.  Furthermore, the local is difficult to beat.  We were within walking distance of many landmarks and great shopping.  However, what really made our experience unforgettable was the staff.  I cannot say enough about how attentive they were.  Cesar, Aitor, Laura and Stefano were simply outstanding.  My only regret is that we cannot recognize everyone who helped us by name.  We relied heavily on the concierge/front desk and they did not hesitate to provide restaurant and activity recommendations.  They even helped arrange a rental car for us to drive to Costa Brava.  It is difficult to overstate how wonderful our time was at Ohla and we will certainly be back!",5,2017,09,28
22,30th birthday weekend break,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is nice, a little modern for me (glass shower wall) but the thing that makes this hotel 5* is the staff! They are amazing, they couldn’t do enough for us! From front of desk to room service staff, they are second to none!!thanks for an amazing weekend 

Only thing,in my opinion,they could improve is the breakfast buffet",5,2017,09,27
22,Honeymoon Hotel,"We stayed here for our last night of our honeymoon as we were traveling through Barcelona back home. We wanted to splurge on a nice last night and could not be happier with Ohla Eixample! We enjoyed spending some time by the pool and the breeze, water temperature, and music made it such a relaxing afternoon. Our room was incredible and the bed was the most comfortable bed either of us have ever slept on. I don't know what kind of pillows they have but I want to go by one for ourselves now! Staff was so incredibly friendly and helpful, from checking in, to providing excellent restaurant recommendations, to delivering our bags to our rooms while we layout by the pool, they could not have been more helpful and accommodating. My only complaint is that we couldn't stay here for longer!",5,2017,09,25
22,Exceptional!,"My husband and I stayed here and we can't say enough about this place! From the reception staff to the cleaning staff. Everyone was great. They were always accommodating. The breakfast was good as well. A la Carte and buffet style. Pastries, drinks, fruit, toast and cereal.  They also have a bar in the lobby with great drinks, although pricy. They even had umbrellas ready for all their guests when it was raining outside. On the last day they made sure we got our bags to the side road and hailed down a taxi. Great location for us. We would definitely recommend this hotel!
",5,2017,09,24
22,Perfect Hotel!,"We've spent the most perfect long weekend in this hotel! I couldn't of picked a better place to stay on Barcelona. 
We arrived in the rain but the concierge was friendly and cheerful and so helpful, lots of advice on where to visit and where to eat. The bar was comfortable and homely but still super stylish and modern. We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing there after travelling for several hours! The Barman Alex was so friendly and chatty, making us feel at ease straight away. 
The room was modern and clean and having the balcony made the room feel so much bigger. We loved the open plan style of the room and I must admit, I loved having a chat with my partner while I was in the bath and he sat on the bed! 
The food was truly scrumptious and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. 
We sat by the infinity pool all day, enjoying the gorgeous view and cocktails too! 
I can't express enough, how much we loved this hotel and we will certainly be back again in the future! 
Thank you to everyone at Ohla Eixample! ",5,2017,09,21
22,Really great hotel!,"My partner and I stayed at Ohla Eixample during our holiday to Spain in April. This hotel was one of our favourites on our entire trip. Modern, clean, attentive and thoughtful staff, great restaurant, nothing to fault. Would be happy to stay there again on my next visit to Barcelona. Thoroughly recommend!",5,2017,09,20
22,An excellent hotel with excellent service in an excellent neighborhood,"We just came back from a week at Ohla Eixample. It was great. The staff is simply amazing. The pool was big enough to swim laps and get reenergized before heading out again after a day of walking all over. The hotel is only two years old so it's in excellent shape. We had their smallest room which was sufficient for two of us. The bedding was wonderful. We had the greatest breakfasts there, again with amazing service. Definitely get the option with breakfast included if you can. We were sorely tempted to have dinner there, but just didn't have time. It is in a wonderful neighborhood; we enjoyed walking around there as much as any other part of the city. We were treated like royalty from day one. We will come back for sure. The concierge service was spot on",5,2017,09,13
22,Perfect choice for a city break,"A five star hotel with five star service. The staff are professional, well trained, cheerful and friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. The hotel is ideally located and the rooms are comfortable and clean with a great choice of complimentary items as well as a well stocked minibar and snacks that are chargeable. I had read reviews that some people didn't like the fact that the shower is visible form the bed and the basin is in the room. It didn't bother us as it is a design feature and didn't detract from a fabulous shower.
Communication between us and the hotel was friendly and of a high standard and the responses were prompt. 
On the first evening, the concierge recommended a restaurant for us which was situated a short distance from the hotel and the meal was delicious with fresh ingredients. 
We had treated ourselves to the car service to and from the airport and it didn't disappoint with friendly, helpful drivers who were very punctual.
We would definitely return to Hotel Ohla on any future visits to this fascinating city.
Thank you to everyone at the hotel.",5,2017,09,12
22,Great example of a hotel at Eixample,I chose this hotel because of its name 'Ohla' as I thought any hotel who names itself hello better live up to its name and be welcoming. I was not disappointed. The location is brilliant - you're in the Eixample district near the shopping and the sights but not in the midst of the hecticness that can be Passeig de Gracia. Loved the Scandinavian look and feel of the hotel as it was a good aesthetic break from the modernisme theme that can assault your senses during the day but something you wouldn't want to be still be surrounded by while sleeping at night. The staff were helpful but also vibrant which helps elevate the overall energy of the place (especially appreciated when you're coming from a flight or a long day of walking). Our only regret is not being able to try the in-house Michelin star restaurant Xerta as it is closed on Sunday and Mondays which were the days we were there... perfect excuse for us to come back. ,5,2017,09,11
22,Spotless rooms and friendly reliable service,"This was our third visit to this super hotel.  We return because of it's quiet but very well placed location, lovely and immaculate rooms and the incredibly friendly and very helpful service we receive each time from all of the very professional  and welcoming staff.",5,2017,09,10
22,What a good choice!,"When you fell welcome, really welcome (not the standard ""hello, nice to have you staying with us"" sort of thing) it a good start. Our room was not ready and, believe it or not, it was not a great deal. Staff was super nice, helpful. While we waited, they gave us a lot of tips about places around the hotel and how to get there in the next days. We went to the bar and the guys were so nice that after we had our keys we finished our (very cold) biers and glasses of wine in no hurry.
The hotel is superbly located; lota to see at walking distance.
The room is just the way we like them: comfortable, cool/clean design yet cozy and spacious. We chose a courtyard room since were told that rooms facing the street can be noisy.
Very happy with our choice and a fan of Ohla!!!",5,2017,09,09
22,Best Service,"This is the first time I have stayed in a hotel and not been able to fault the service. The staff were fantastic. The front desk staff, the security guard, the bag assistant, the cleaners, the bar staff - all of them were polite and friendly. They were extremely helpful with everything I needed. They offered us a complimentary glass of Cava on arrival, they assisted with our bags, they gave us a tour of our room and showed us how to use everything. When requested they assisted us with booking a tour. When I booked something myself they were happy to print the tickets for me. They were happy to change my money to smaller notes. The room was cleaned each day between 10am and 1pm. The cleaners would then return in the evening to check if we needed anything and kindly give us a chocolate each. The hotel arranged for our breakfast to be put in a take away bag and delivered to our room on a day where we were too busy to eat at a table. They would always greet us kindly when passing the front desk, in the lifts or hallways etc. They were even happy to assist with taking our photo outside of the hotel. We were very impressed. 

The hotel itself was lovely, the rooftop is adorable. The room was suitable to our needs and if there was something we needed that wasn't there (such as a plate) the staff were more than happy to provide this to us. The entry is simply beautiful, I love the lights. The location was very convenient to everything we needed, including supermarket, train station, bus, and shopping mall. We didn't want to leave.",5,2017,09,09
22,Beautiful Terrace,"Not a bad word to say about this hotel.  All staff were amazing.  Lovely decor,  we had a mid range room with a terrace which was a really nice size, cava on arrival and chocolates on the pillow each night!  Slightly quieter part of town but some lovely bars and restaurants nearby and close to Diagonal metro where you can get to pretty much anywhere in town.  The pool and roof terrace was lovely for a dip and cocktail or two after a hard days sightseeing! ",5,2017,09,08
22,A very good hotel ,"We booked on this hotel with my wife and we are gratified with our choice.
What I liked more was the position of the Ohla in the heart of eixample, the beautiful king size bed and the  friendly staff whose by the way service was excellent.
What I didn't like was the building which looks more like a four star hotel than a five star.
The breakfast variety was good but not perfect.
",4,2017,08,31
22,Fantastic 5* Boutique Hotel,"A gem of a hotel situated on a side street just off the Passeige de Gracia and within easy walking distance of all the main sights. We chose a junior suite with an amazingly large bed and open plan bath and shower (with an opaque screen and a seperate enclosed loo). No problem for us but not ideal if sharing with a friend and if a little modest! The room was large,  light and airy and very modern. Exceptional standard of toiletries, coffee machine and mini bar.

From the moment we arrived until check out the service was professional, attentive and very  friendly. We were treated as valued customers and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was excellent, the Sky bar and pool was fantastic - a really relaxing and friendly atmosphere.

I can't recommend this hotel enough - definitely worth every penny for the extremely high standard of rooms, facilities, location and customer service. ",5,2017,08,31
22,Cava on the arrival and extremely friendly staff,"We have a quiet and nice room, but I didn't know before I arrived that there would be an open bathroom in the room and a shower just separated by glass screen from the room. Not to everyone's taste. No privacy, only in the toilet. 
The decoration inside the room is styled rough and a bit industrial. Maybe appeals to a younger generation.",4,2017,08,28
22,Amazing stay,My experience at the Ohla Example hotel was exceptional.  I was staying for a week and stayed in the hotel with my best friend.  We had the most wonderful time at the hotel and the rooftop pool.  The staff is more than happy to help you with anything.  They printed out directions for us. They brought us extra waters and coffee at all times of the day.  They also helped us hail cabs late at night.  We felt so comfortable staying there and the friendly staff made this trip so memorable and fun.,5,2017,08,21
22,The perfect stay ,"This is quiet a hotel , by all means what a service and what a venue . Loved everything about it . The location is exceptional and the food is above and beyond . It would be great for couples who want to explore Barcelona and feel very relaxed and enjoy a cozy stay at the end of the day ",5,2017,08,21
22,A Truly Memorable Stay! ,"My girlfriend and I had a mini break in Barcelona for my birthday, we'd chosen Ohla Eixample based on such outstanding reviews from other travellers and how central it was to the main strip. From the moment we arrived at Ohla Eixample we couldn't fault our stay, the staff were 5 star; they were so welcoming and informative, greeting us with a glass of chilled Cava (perfect after a hot and sticky journey!), lots of smiles and greetings by everyone we came into contact with. The hotel itself has been done beautifully, such a classic but fresh feel throughout, the room we had was so open and airy, and despite being at the front of the hotel on a busy street, it was super quiet! The rooftop bar and pool was an absolute luxury, we went up every night during our stay for a late night drink before bed, it was like another world up there, so tranquil, and may I say the soft music playing topped it off wonderfully. We were lucky enough to go up when they had a live jazz singer on which made my girlfriend's stay, and they very thoughtfully brought a bottle of Cava on ice as a birthday surprise for me! They really do go above and beyond for their guests, we will definitely be staying here again during our next visit to this stunning city! ",5,2017,08,18
22,Modern central hotel,"Lovely hotel in a good location close to main shopping areas and a decent walk to all parts of central Barcelona.

Very modern, clean and well furnished hotel. Room was a good size but we had a twin room and the rooms are not really ideal for two friends sharing. The bathroom area is open to the room and the shower is visible to the room with a frosted ""privacy"" strip. It works but as friends travelling together it's nice to have a little more privacy.

Pool area and the pool is lovely and better than other hotels I've stayed at in Barcelona. Great sized pool with attentive and friendly bar staff. Good food and drinks served.

Breakfast was a little strange as it's laid out in what is clearly a meeting room and not the restaurant. It works fine and the food selection is OK, just doesn't feel very 5 star hotel.

Overall a great hotel for a few nights in the city.

",5,2017,08,17
22,NOT a five star.,"Being used to choose 5 star hotels in my travels around the world I picked the Ohla Eixample amongst the luxury ones available in Barcelona. I regret the choice (and the 1250 euros for the 3 nights) as Ohla is far away from a 5 star hotel. My room was even a Junior Suite, and it was small, very basic and looked more a nice room in a 3 star hotel.
It was disappointing, when you spend such money is because apart from the city you want to enjoy a high standard room and service. We had to ask multiple times for a room cleaning (how is possible having to ask for such a basic thing like doing the room?!?).
The rooftop pool is tiny and not as good as it looks in the pictures, and the bar charges you 5 euros FOR A GLASS OF WATER. The breakfast is super simple and definitely not a 5 star standard. The staff is mildly friendly and average attentive. 
Sorry Ohla: your hotel is worthy half the money that I paid.
Not recommended.",2,2017,08,14
22,Lovely!,"The hotel was lovely, modern, clean and had everything you need. 
The staff were extremely helpful too. 
Would definitely recommend staying here; it is in a great location within walking distance of restaurants and bars.",5,2017,08,14
22,Great hotel for a city trip,"We stayed in this hotel for a city trip, to explore barcelona. That was definitetly the best choice we could do. The hotel is near the city center and you can walk (or you take the metro) Everything was quite new, modern and very stylish. 
The room was awesome, with a nice bathroom included. We enjoyed the daily brekafast.
The staff is helpfull and friendly and they give good advices what to do.",5,2017,08,12
22,An absolute gem in the Eixample area!,"We visited the Ohla Eixample for a three night stay and could not have been happier with our choice. The hotel is perfectly located away from the craziness of La Rambla yet extremely convenient for all the shops and restaurants you could want.

Check in staff were absolutely excellent. We were made to feel immediately welcome and their English was superb. Every person who checked in was being shown a map and given personal recommendations. We were fortunate enough to be checked in by the lovely Terry who went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and catered for as we still had a few hours to check in. We were able to freshen up in a courtesy area before spending a few hours having an initial explore. Details like this really made a difference.

The room was exceptionally clean and the bed was large and comfortable. Plug points were by the bed both sides and there were also USB style chargers (very important for us travellers who like our devices!) The bathroom was modern and there was a plentiful supply of toiletries. Toothbrushes were even provided should you forget yours! Coffee and tea facilities were available in the rooms, as were robes and slippers. Towels were lovely and huge which always creates the home from home feeling. Complimentary water was provided on the desk every day and turn down service was provided. 

Breakfast is a particularly strong point in this hotel. There was a plentiful supply of both hot and cold items and breakfast staff were extremely efficient and friendly. There was a range of juices available and even a glass of bubbles should you wish! 

We did not use the rooftop pool or the gym but these were both very well-maintained and the cocktails at the rooftop pool looked lovely! 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, both for the modern, clean and extremely comfortable luxury it provides and the fabulous staff. We will definitely return!

22,Awesome hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. We had a junior suite which was stylish, well designed with everything we needed. Excellent central location near to shopping, restaurants and metro. Fantastic bar in the lobby and roof top pool/bar is stunning. Try the g&t with rosemary and tasty tapas for a relaxed evening.",5,2017,08,12
22,Overnight in Barcelona.,"Last night in a month long trip to Spain and Portugal so we stayed at Ohla Eixample after sampling Ohla Barcelona earlier in our visit. The Eixample Ohla was truly outstanding. The room was great. The staff were friendly and professional. And the Xerta resaurant was sensational. This is an excellent hotel.
",5,2017,08,11
22,Great hotel,"Spent two nights at this hotel
In Barcelona great hotel very good service infinity pool on the top of the building very good breakfast amazing coffee We where welcomed with cava as a welcome will be back",5,2017,08,09
22,Pleasantly impressed,"Our stay at Ohla Eixample was an absolute delight. Spacious rooms and bathrooms with all essential amenities. Great service as well with an extremely helpful concierge that helped us with reservations, tapas recommendations, ticket bookings et all... The hotel is brilliantly located with plenty of nearby shopping and eating options. Highly recommended and will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,08,05
22,Modern boutique hotel ,"The hotel is extremely professionally run and modern. Staff are very attentive and we loved the fact it's not a chain or a huge hotel. The pool is on the rooftop and quite large in comparison to other Barcelona hotels. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here! The only down side would be it's a tiny bit further out, this may not be ideal for those who like to be Central.",5,2017,08,04
22,"Great rooms, excellent receptionists","We spent 6 nights in Barcelona, stayed in ohla exiample hotel. It starts with a perfect opening, by offering cava to us when we walked in on a hot day! The staff were really helpful and friendly. Rooms are clean，room service was multiple times a day to keep it very clean. This is the perfect place to stay short or long in Barcelona. Surrounded by multiple shops, cafe, closer to many place of interests. The roof swimming pool was really great, I enjoyed quiet and sunny morning swimming 🏊 a lot. ",5,2017,08,02
22,Truly 5*,"I stayed here with a friend for 3 nights this summer. I have previously stayed at the Serras which is also an exceptional hotel nearer the marina but I would say the Ohla in Eixample is very much in the same league. The property, service and location are all 5*. The hotel is modern, clean and the room design excellent. The pool on the top floor is also a great feature- never feeling too crowded and again, attentive service. The concierge assisted us with bookings/taxis/restaurants etc with ease. The location is great - far enough away from the too-crowded bottom end of Las Ramblas but instead situated at the top of the more chic shopping district. I would recommend this hotel without exception.",5,2017,08,01
22,One night in Barcelona ,"Excellent small 5 star hotel in Eixample. Away from the bustle of Las Ramblas but still close to great shopping and restaurants. We had a twin and a double room which were very modern, beds really comfortable. The pool area on the 9th floor is great but can get quite busy with limited number of lounge beds. Nice bar adjacent to pool which serves cocktails and simple snacks and bar food. Staff were excellent, late checkout for one room at 2pm was no trouble. Would definitely come back. ",5,2017,07,30
22,Great stay for a short city break,We chose this hotel over many others given the great reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. Location was fab - a short walk from the main centre attractions. Travelled from the airport using the train and metro which cost 5Euros pp. Received a warm greeting with a cold glass of cava. Room was clean and tidy and very modern. Pool area is small but what we expected given city centre location. Staff were excellent and keen to help with area to sunbathe if beds were taken. Concierge service excellent. My only criticism would be the the cost of the drinks - 4Euros for a small glass of Coke and 12Euros for cocktails. Would certainly stay again! ,4,2017,07,28
22,"Excellent Hotel,  the 5* reviews are correct.  book this hotel you wont be dissapointed.","Well what can I say,  the reviews of this hotel dont lie. its great,  from start to finish,  Ahhh be warned the taxi from El Prat Airport to the Ohla is about EUR 25.00 however,  the Taxi drivers add on a EUR 5.10 to EUR 7.20 TIP or Charge on top...be warned...factor in. 
Ok back to the hotel,  we stayed in a junior Suite, however it was effortless, the reception staff are excellent, on the ball,  when entering the room,  is clean,  spacious,  and the bed was ernomous.  However,  be warned there is a huge bit of glass separating the room from the bathroom,  so if you're not comfortable in being erhum...in the nude in front of your loved one,  then this hotel might not be the one for you....also in the bathroom,  you have a walking in wet room shower,  and a bath....wheres the toilet....well its behind or adjacent to the front door,  took me 20 minutes to find it,  I thought we'd been burgled and some strange weirdo had nicked the karzee.  It had everything, be warned the air con is Fresh...it works,  really well. Flat screen tv is temperamental but the late night bed fold down service is great too. my girlfriend loved the chocolates they popped on the pillow as we returned from our night out. 

Overall you'll be hard pushed to find a better hotel,  The Pool area on the 9th Floor,  get there early, to avoid disappointment,  there are only 9-10 bean bag sun loungers which is a shame,  The bar opens at 11am till midnight so any drinks you would like to drink prior to this time you have to go to the lobby and bring back up to the 9th. Pool area.  The photo of the pool area makes that area look larger than it is.  The food is great,  the club sandwich is a must between meals and the breakfast caters for all,  Pancake Rolls and Chicken Wings for breakfast.....ermmm maybe not but they are on offer, as well as Spanish Cold Meats and Cheese,  Hot food,  breads and marmaldes/jams.   Ok a cab to the Ramblas area costs EUR 6.00 form the hotel or a 30 minute walk at a leisurely pace down Carrer Blames....just outside the hotels.  Overall a pleasant experience and we will happily return.  9 out of 10.  Well done Ohla.",5,2017,07,26
22,""" Average hotel""","The room was clean, nothing like the picture.  The pool is small, what you see isn't what you get for a 5 star hotel.  We made reservation for hotels pick-up $100.00 bucks, they were going to give us a discount for $89.00 to return to the airport.  I ask a cab driver what he charged to get to the airport $29.00 ""tourist trap""
I had the garden view, which overlooked plants that people grew on their patio, renovation for apartments and workers looking in the window.  Thanks  Booking .com",2,2017,07,24
22,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights for my wife's birthday. Had a junior suite which was lovely. Very nice hotel in a great location, nice and quiet but still near the shops etc. Great breakfast and friendly attentive staff. Will definitely be going back.",5,2017,07,23
22,Good hotel ,"Great hotel, only negatives were they lost a bag and failed to put it in the taxi or find it. Imagine the cleaners binned it. And that the blinds didn't work. Other than that great food and rooftop bar would stay again",4,2017,07,23
22,"A wonderful hotel, perfect for a city break.","My wife and I stayed two nights at the Ohla Eixample - 20th and 21st July 2017.
We took the Aerobus from the airport to Placa de Catalunya and from there the hotel is a pleasant 15 minute walk straight up Rambla de Catalunya before taking the last left onto Carrer de Corsega before you hit Avinguda Diagonal - you can get there on public transport as well but if you don't have a lot of luggage I'd recommend the walk.
Check-in was a breeze and while we were there I heard the staff speaking to guests in German and Italian as well as English and Spanish.
The rooms, the whole hotel in fact, is tastefully decorated to a very high standard with lots of nice little touches, like built in USB chargers beside the desk, a discreet built-in room safe with an integral power socket (so you can leave your ipad or laptop in the safe and charge it at the same time) and room lights with pre-set levels that you can control from either side of the bed. The hotel offers free (but not terribly fast) wi-fi as well as an ethernet connection in the rooms.
We didn't make use of the lobby bar or the restaurant but we did spend the last couple of hours before our flight home on the roof terrace where they really have made the most of the space available with a pool and sun loungers, cafe seating and a fully stocked bar. We ordered a burger and a club sandwich while we were here and both were freshly prepared and delicious.
From the roof terrace you can also see the spires of La Sagrada Familia, which is just a short walk away from the hotel.
The thing that really makes this hotel exceptional though is the staff. Every member of staff we encountered was impeccably presented and polite, friendly and helpful to a fault. Whether you're visiting Barcelona for business or on a city break I would thoroughly recommend Ohla Eixample.",5,2017,07,23
22,great accomodation with exceptional service,"I have been travelling several times to Barcelona for work and stayed at the Ohla Eixample Hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated, bright, clean and provide everything needed for a comfortable stay like daily changed water bottles, bathroom accessories,etc.
The service is exceptional and welcoming providing a nice environment when working abroad. The level of service is important to me due to the numerous business trips. The hotel offers as well two bars and a restaurant with tasty food or even an alternative working spot for long working days. The common areas as the gym and outdoor pool enable all needed facilities under one roof.
I really recommend this hotel and lloking forward to continue being its guest.",5,2017,07,17
22,Very nice stay in Barcelona ,"Very nice Boutique Hotel with 5 Stars.
Super friendly Staff and GM.
Very good Breakfast and Pool area on the roof top.

Too bad we didn't have a room facing the Street with a big Terrace.
Probably next time.

We liked our stay a lot.",5,2017,07,17
22,"Nice hotell, with Greta location","We stayed at the Hotel for five days with our two teenage kids. The rooms were a bit ""cold"" and the beds not that comfertable that we would expect in a 5 star hotel. Anyway, we loved the area and the location was perfekt.

Good breakfast and excellent service performed by the staff.",4,2017,07,15
22,Barcelona visit,Ohla Eixample is very well located and close to the shopping district. The decor is very modern and interesting. The rooms had all the amenities and very comfortable beds. The breakfast options could be improved as they were quite repetitive after a few days.,4,2017,07,12
22,"GREAT HOTEL, AMAZING SERVICE AND GOOD LOCATION","We had a wonderful time at the Ohla Eixample, the service was outstanding. Our room was spacious, the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was large and the shower was awesome. We loved the rooftop pool and how peaceful it was. Great location, would definitely return!",5,2017,07,11
22,The most welcoming of luxury hotels,"We booked a double and a superior twin room for four nights at this hotel for our first trip to Barcelona as a family. Our flight times meant we arrived early on the first day and left late on the last, but the hotel staff were v obliging on storing our bags and letting us know when the rooms were available - as well as letting us enjoy the hotel facilities while we waited. 

The whole hotel feels luxurious, with such attention to detail there's nothing to want for. There're plenty of toiletries in the rooms, with a list shown of additional items you can request. The mini bar similarly has a wide range of choice, and although this did not include the local cava (Moët et Chandon the only fizzy option) since this was available in the lobby , we couldn't complain. The staff must've been briefed that ""anything is possible"" as nothing was too difficult or too much trouble. There were plenty of staff to help at all times and the spread at the buffet breakfast was second to none - a good mix of local specialities and the fresh fruit and cooked options expected by international guests. Several of the items had been carefully hand-prepared and were a visual delight. Even the range of juices, teas and coffees were exceptional. Staff in the lobby, the lobby bar, the pool terrace and the breakfast area  were all equally welcoming and took the trouble to get to know your wants and likes so you really felt at home. 

This hotel is not in the hustle and bustle of the tourist area - it's set just a little back. And this is part of its appeal. We could set off on foot in the morning and reach some of the main attractions (la pedrera and casa battlo) within minutes, then wander down further to la rambla etc and reach any area you fancied within 45 minutes' stroll - then when we tired or the heat became too much, a 7-8 euro taxi ride had us back in the tranquility of the hotel, where we were welcomed like old friends and nothing was too much trouble.

Although the main hotel restaurant had an amazing menu, we felt it was a little too sophisticated to justify the price on our daughter's less refined palate, so we explored the restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Within a few minutes walk of the hotel we found fantastic tapas, upmarket burgers, and amazing seafood options, which we all (slightly fussy daughter included) enjoyed.  We did lunch in the hotel lobby bar, and snacked on tapas by the pool, which was all lovely. 

We've had an amazing few days and will definitely return. Thank you ohla exiample.

",5,2017,07,07
22,Nice boutique hotel in good location,We came here for my 30th birthday and we messaged the staff through Booking.com to ask whether they could provide anything additional for this event and they sent us a big bottle of bubbly which was incredibly sweet!,3,2017,07,07
22,Fabulous hotel in lovely area,"Having never been in Barcelona, we had no idea where to stay but were pleasantly surprised by Eixample and even more so by this fantastic hotel. We were met by a lovely young man who took our bags and offered us a glass of cava while we waited to check in. Our room wasn't ready but we went up to the rooftop pool and when we were ready, the bags were already waiting in our room. The rooftop pool was much welcomed in the heat and the drinks in the bar were great! The rooms were spacious and modern. As it was my birthday, Ohla sent up a bottle of cava to the room - a very nice gesture. The staff was lovely all over the hotel and recommended some lovely cocktail bars close by. The bed was great and I'm still dreaming of the pillows! When we come back to Barcelona, we'll definitely stay at Ohla Eixample again. ",5,2017,07,01
22,Boutique hotel in swish suburb,"I visit Barcelona 1-2 times a year for business (and just a little leisure) and have learned to favour Eixample as a really good choice of Suburb.  Close to downtown, on the edge of the upmarket Passeig de Gracia and with a wonderful pedestrianised area, Passeig de Catalunya on hand for cafes and restaurants.  I usually stay at HC Taber but unfort this was full so stretched financially to try Ohla Eixample.  No Regrets though it is a little more expensive.  Highlights are very friendly and efficient staff - they came to my rescue with a safe that couldn't be accessed without any fuss or bother.  Very nice comfortable avant garde rooms which are tastefully presented.  The Breakfast is excellent and in a really nice calming back room which makes a perfect start to the day.  Be advised however that by night this turns into a very swish and expensive 1 star Michelin restaurant - too expensive for everyday eating, so i took to the bar food instead, which is fine.  Didnt really linger in the rooftop area as i travel solo and its full of mooching couples on honeymoon... lovely for them.  One suggestion?  a little more light in the corridors - the decor is a heavy dark brown and with 20 watt light bulbs it call feel a little ""boudoir"" for my tastes.  But thats a minor issue, and all in all this definitely a hotel to check out.",4,2017,06,30
22,Excellent boutique hotel,"A lovely hotel in a great location.
Friendly and helpful staff. Room was excellent with a rainfall shower and separate bath. 
Our package was room only so did not eat there at all and therefore cannot comment but we were offered a discount breakfast at around 18? Euros a day each which was a bit pricey. 
Rooftop pool and bar was a dream with great service. Drinks pricey but you are paying for the location and the view. 
Would be even better if they put a coffee machine in the rooms instead of instant coffee. Not to worry as there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants very close by. 
Would definitely recommend and return. 
",5,2017,06,29
22,Service with a small s,Nicely situated and nice modern style rooms. The style you have to look but the service can be (extremely) slow which is unacceptable for a so-called 5 star hotel where you pay indeed a lot and should be receiving 5 star service rather than hostel attention.,3,2017,06,27
22,Fabulous hotel,"I stayed here for two nights at the start of my trip. 
There wasn't anything too difficult for them. They found me a great restaurant one night which was just perfect. They helped with a running route for the morning and were really helpful.

The pool is excellent. One night they had some chill music play playing upstairs. Really nice way to start my evening.
I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.
The room was perfect for recovering from my jet lag.

22,AMAZING HOTEL,"We have not been to Barcelona for over 20 years but decided to return . We found this hotel via the internet as we wanted a hotel in the city with a pool.  We could not have made a better choice. From the minute we arrived until the day we left , we were treated like royalty. The room was absolutely magnificent providing  comfortable beds,  ,spacious  walk in shower and bathroom , with the most beautiful toiletries. The reception staff were just incredibly helpful ,charming and could not do enough for you. This hotel is close to a metro [Diagonal] where trains are very frequent and its oly a  short journey to  the old city. . This hotel is blessed with a relaxing roof terrace providing a wonderful swimming where you can enjoy a drink of your choice . The Hotel OHLA EIXAMPLE is a must",5,2017,06,22
22,"Not cheap, but a great rooftop pool","This hotel is located nicely, with a 10 minutes’ walk down to the Playa Cataluña. The design is very nice and staff friendly.

The most positive thing about the hotel is the rooftop pool, the pool is not to big but it's excellent to end a long day walking the city. The rooftop bar serves nice cocktails (not cheap, but good).",4,2017,06,22
22,Well Done!,"This is a great property well located in Barcelona. Very new and mod feeling. Very spacious rooms and great air con!
The Concierge staff was amazing and helped us with many things. Front desk staff were also friendly and helpful.
A big win in Barcelona. Also... fabulous breakfast!
Would most definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,06,22
22,Perfect city break,"The hotel is situated (in my opinion) in one of the best areas in Barcelona, it's quite an upmarket area. Hotel was modern and clean, check in process was quick and as we arrived early the room wasn't ready.  They took us upstairs to the pool area where they have changing rooms so we could change before heading out of the hotel to explore.  Walking distance from most attractions, plenty of restaurants, bars etc. around the hotel, breakfast in the hotel was good although a little expensive per person!  The pool area was small but lovely for a few hours at the end of the day to chill after a busy day in the city. Would definitely return when in Barcelona in the future.",5,2017,06,21
22,Pampered and Pleasant,"Staff at the Ohla Eixample were enthusiastically helpful and friendly.  During our one-week stay we developed the habit of checking in with our concierge every morning to help us select the activities that matched our interests (which he took time to understand); he figured out how best to get there and helped us cross the language barrier where needed; he was honest in letting us know what was not worth our time.  After spending the day in the bright, active, busy city that Barcelona is, the ultra-quiet, super-clean, comfortable and beautiful interior of the hotel let us rest and feel pampered every evening.  The on-site restaurant is a bit expensive but well worth the price, and is a destination in itself.  The rooftop lounge is very low-key, you will want to speak in whispers so as not to disturb the tranquil mood. 

The location of the hotel in the Eixample is perfect, it is near everything you want to see but upscale, safe, and quiet in the evenings.",5,2017,06,20
22,Our close to perfect Barcelona trip,"Ohla Eixample is a beautyful Hotel, located perfectly in Barcelona. From the romantic pool and Bar area on the Roof, you have a view of the sea, Sagrada Familia and the great mountain Tibidabo. The Hotel is located in walking distance to great restaurants, bar life and shopping, and for the sporty couple, a lovely jog from the Hotel to the top og Tibidabo (bring water). Sagrada Familia is about 20 min away. 
The staff at the Hotel could not have been nicer, and was at our service the entire time. Great Bar by the pool area, and awesome food.  We had  our best meals, and our best drinks at the Hotel. 
The room was at a high standard, with everything you need to have a good and relaxing time. Big and clean, and with a sexy twist to the bathtub solution. 
I only have one negative thing to comment, and that is that when you are waiting for your wife to finish up her “going out” preparations, it would be nice to have a TV channel where they spoke English (News channels does not count).",5,2017,06,13
22,Nice city hotel,"Good size design hotel in a good location. 

Pros:

Location
Room size & bed
Rooftop pool
Friendly staff 

Cons:

Windows cannot be open, a/c only

Breakfast - after our breakfast experience we were not tempted to try the Michelin awarded restaurant at night. Eggs should have been better (fried, boiled, scrambled), soggy pastries, low quality coffee, limited choice of vegetables & fruits, natural oats or muesli. 

Limited alcohol free choice at the rooftop pool bar - eg smoothies would be nice.

Room design may be too cold and modern for some people. Especially the concrete ceiling in the room & the glass wall between shower and bed. 

Overall very nice week stay, but would recommend the management to work on details, not just design and it would be a 5* review.",4,2017,06,08
22,Great Birthday Weekend,"Stayed here for my partners birthday. Couldn't fault the place! Service was great, breakfast was really good, rooms were very modern/contemporary and smart. They were always clean. They left a birthday cake and champagne in the room on my partners birthday as i requested. There are some great views from the rooftop and the lunch menu was excellent. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. ",5,2017,06,07
22,Lovely boutique hotel,"Ohla Eixample is a recently open 5 star hotel in a very central area of Barcelona. Everything is very modern and trendy, including the set up of the room with the shower and the bed speared by a glass wall. Excellent breakfast and staff very friendly and professional. I am very happy to have chosen this hotel for our week-end in Barcelona.",5,2017,06,07
22,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"This is a chic, sleek, classy boutique hotel in a beautiful area of town. The rooms are very modern and cool with all the amenities you expect from this level of hotel. The breakfast buffet was amazing with a great variety. The location is in a high end part of town, but you will need a taxi to get to La Sagrada Familia and the Barcelonetta area. About a 10 minute ride which is not that bad. Las Ramblas is also a nice walk away but it can be done. The only thing that might be an issue for some people is the modern design of the bathroom is open so the glass shower is next to the bedroom, therefore you will have no privacy in the shower. Again it was not an issue for me, but if traveling with a friend and sharing a room it might be weird. Otherwise, I loved it!!!!",5,2017,06,06
22,"Excelent experience! Great location, friendly service and very good room","This hotel was a great surprise in Barcelona. It is 2 blocks from Paseig de Gracia, a street with lots of stores and attractions. It is also close (10 min walking) from  las Ramblas. Breakfast is very good with tipical flavours from Catalunia. The restaurant is also excelente with a generous selection of local wines. At the rooftop there is a pool with a beautiful view to the city. Finally, I really liked the room. Everything is very well decorated and clean. Could not be any better. I will definetely go back.",5,2017,06,06
22,Cool hotel,"Had a great stay in a Design room; decent enough size, ‘modern’ gimmicky see-through shower design, good bed, quiet enough (room was not facing the street).  Given a tour of the room by the bellman.  Great breakfast with local specialities and usually a dish of the day (unfortunately, didn’t get to try their Michelin star restaurant; Xerta).   Various fruit & veg juices (and Cava) available. Front desk staff helpful.  Great location in the Eixample district; 5 minute walk to Provenca or Diagonal metro stations.  Gym was ok; upright bike x 1, elliptical x 2 (but the electronics of these two machines didn’t seem to work), treadmill x 2 and free-weights.  I didn’t use the rooftop pool or bar, but looked ‘cool’ enough.",5,2017,06,05
22,Great hotel ,"Looking for a place to stay in Barcelona we found this gem. 

From checkin to departure the service was faultless, from the reception desk to the roof top drinks.

The hotel is quiet and when there was a noise issue it was dealt with quickly.   

Facilities 
Roof top pool
Gym
Bar on roof and ground floor 
Restaurant

Any help for the stay in Barcelona the reception  were a great

The most significant contribution was a note left on our bed notifying us over a planned taxi strike the following day. If we had not had the note we would have missed our excursion 

Summary 

Service - excellent 
Facilities - excellent 
Cost - reasonable 
Location - 5 mins drive from centre 

If I come here again I will stay here ",5,2017,06,02
22,Perfect choice for first time visit to Barcelona!,"I had such an amazing time in Barcelona & this hotel was the perfect blend of old world meets new! A perfectly located & very comfy room! We were upgraded to a larger suite overlooking the beautiful avenue .. it was a decent size for Europe ' the shower was a dream come true after a long day roaming the streets!

If your traveling to Barcelona I'd pick this as your landing pad! We didn't eat at the hotel &I could almost take off a star for the lack of atmosphere the restaurant provided. It didn't seem to flow w the rest of the city!

The pool on the roof was a deal sealer for me & it didn't disappoint! The views were magical!

Thank you Ohla!",5,2017,05,31
22,Excellent ,"I stayed at the Ohla Eixample in mid May with two friends. We stayed in a large room, where they provided us with a bed on wheels (a real bed, not a cot). Even with the extra bed, the room was spacious, with a sitting area and large dressing area. The rooftop pool was both beautiful and functional,as I was able to swim laps. The breakfast was quite good, and the dining room was lovely. The staff could not be nicer or more helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,31
22,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is so amazing, it's in a fantastic location, there lots of lovely restaurants around as well!! It's Very clean, the staff are very attentive and the breakfast is lovely. I will definitely be returning.",5,2017,05,30
22,Nice hotel but expected more for a five star,"Nice building and welcoming reception. Rooms are lovely and clean with a great lay out.

Pool area is basic but nice table service. 
Room service is limited
Service info is non existent e.g. apparently this place has a restaurant and fitness/spa but have no idea where in the building.

Asked for HDMI cable to watch personal media as tv option is also basic (for a five star hotel) but had to go and get it from reception rather than it being delivered.

I feel slightly upsold by all sites but nonetheless I'd stay again.
",4,2017,05,29
22,What more could one want!!!,"This is an extraordinary hotel with unbelievable service and gorgeous rooms. We always looked forward to returning from being out. as there was always champagne waiting for us at the door. Every one of the waitstaff, no matter what their job was, seemed to take a personal interest in all of our needs. A perfect hotel for travelers as well as the business world.",5,2017,05,23
22,A Gem In Barcelona's Residential Area,"I cancelled my original booking for Ohla Eixample's sister hotel Ohla Barcelona after reading critical reviews of its dark bathrooms and leaking showers. It turned out that my three-night stay in early May at the Ohla Eixample Hotel was a very pleasant surprise. I booked directly through the hotel's website because they had a junior suite promotion - great value for money at less than CAD$400 per night including a welcome alcoholic beverage in the lobby bar, a buffet breakfast and in-suite complimentary bottled water.

The boutique hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood and is close to a Barcelona Jump On/Off Bus Tour route on Passeig De Gracia, one of the city's main avenues. Gaudi's renowned architectural building, Casa Mila or La Pedrera - a UNESCO World Heritage site - is only five blocks away if you make the correct turn on Passeig De Gracia. My initial concerns about the hotel's location not being downtown near Las Ramblas were alleviated by its proximity to all the restaurants I went to, with an average taxi ride at approximately 10 Euros one way. In fact, I've discovered that it's best to stay away from hotels in the Las Ramblas district because of the huge crowds, tourists and pick-pockets downtown.

The hotel lobby is understated but beautiful with fresh, stunning floral arrangements every day. The junior suite assigned to me faces a residential apartment building, so I had to keep my curtains closed most of the time to ensure privacy. The suite was spacious with ample closet space and nicely-designed double vanity sinks. The bathroom designs for both the Ohla Barcelona and the Ohla Eixample share a common feature - the bath tub and shower stall are separated by only a glass panel and are, therefore, transparent from the bedroom. The idea is, perhaps, for couples to share a romantic bath together or to watch each other bathing/showering while the other partner is resting in bed or watching TV. Should there be two people who are not couples sharing the room, there will be a major privacy issue. As I was travelling alone, this was not a problem for me and I quite enjoyed the space. Unfortunately, there were two issues that made my nightly shower less enjoyable - the water in the shower stall was not hot enough even when you pressed the hot water button and turned it to its maximum. Moreover, there's also a slight water leakage problem from its door which made it slippery once you stepped out of the shower. Beginning the second night, I shifted to using the shower in the bath tub instead but the absence of any grab bars, railings or sticky tub floor made it extremely dangerous and slippery. When I asked the reception for a plastic floor mat, they said there was no such thing. The toilet was located in a separate room with no windows and no ventilation making it very claustrophobic.

I was very impressed by an email from the hotel about a week prior to my arrival asking me for my preferences of the type of pillows. I thought that this must be a hotel that is definitely ahead of its clients. However, with my high expectations, I was slightly disappointed when I found inconsistent service throughout the hotel, particularly with the housekeeping department. On the first night, the following day's weather and complimentary bottled water came with the bed turndown service. Then all these nice features suddenly disappeared on the second night and I had to call reception to ask for the water. The turndown service was also missing for two of the three nights I was there. Upon check-in, I had specified to the bell boy who escorted me to my room that I would like additional boxes of Kleenex and small facial towels. One would have thought that after the specific instructions the first night, these would have been carried out on the second and third nights as well. As it turned out, I had to repeat the same request every night!

Barcelona is world renowned now as a culinary capital of the world. I was pleased with the complimentary continental breakfast and the service at the hotel's lobby restaurant, Xerta. While the food was acceptable and fresh, it was not outstanding in
any way. I was, therefore, quite surprised to hear that the Xerta is actually a one-star Michelin restaurant. Due to the Labour Day public holiday, the restaurant was not open for dinner on the Sunday and Monday that I was staying in the hotel. But the dinner must far exceed the quality of the breakfast as there's really nothing to write home about the latter.

I was impressed by the service of the hotel's reception, concierge and bell service staff. Hotel concierge Frederico was particularly helpful and all of them speak good English. The room was very quiet; the King bed was heavenly; the free wi-fi was fast and efficient; and the TV was huge and easy to operate.

Overall, I rated my experience with this property four stars because I thought it's great value for money and I liked the location. Should they improve the consistency of the housekeeping service, the condition of the bath and shower, and the attention to detail, I would have rated it higher!",4,2017,05,21
22,Maravilloso!,"For my husband's birthday, I wanted to treat him to an evening at a great hotel. He is native to the city, so I wanted our visit to feel special. I chose Ohla Eixample and it was perfect. The ambience, decor and service were amazingly considerate and we felt very well taken care of! Special thanks to David who helped me arrange a surprise birthday package (delicious cake, chilled cava and a fun balloon!) that was waiting for us when we checked in. We had a room with a terrace and it felt luxurious but also not pretentious. We loved it all! Thank you so much to the staff at Ohla Eixample! Gracies a tots! ",5,2017,05,19
22,Great stay,"From start to finish, we had a superb time.  Our enjoyment was probably enhanced by the fact that we were in the suite, so benefited from a huge room with quite funky design along with an enormous terrace - and at the top of the building, so well clear of the street noise.  Staff were friendly, courteous and helpful.  The problems around breakfast 'protocol' described in other reviews have clearly been addressed.  The pool area isn't huge (but this isn't a resort, so I wouldn't really expect it to be) but if you can grab a lounger then it's a great place to laze away a few hours in the sun.

Immediate area is packed with shops, interesting architecture and nice places to eat, and very easy to get to Gothic Quarter and all other areas by metro, which is about five mins walk away, foot or some combination of the two.  On balance, pleased we stayed here as opposed to in the old town, which was fun to visit but struck me as a bit of a tourist trap.  

Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,17
22,Not a 5-star hotel,"Do not be fooled by the ratings. This is not a 5-star hotel. While it is very contemporary and located in a relatively quiet location, the hotel rooms are not quiet. The rooms have no sounds insulation as the floors are concrete and the ceilings are exposed. So you can hear every noise coming from rooms above and the subway below. (We stayed on the 5th floor). 

The staff are all very professional but do not provide the same level of attentiveness you would expect at a 5-star hotel. 

In the US or Paris, this would be considered a 4-star hotel. 

We had what was represented to be a junior suite plus an adjoining 2 double bed room. The junior suite was not a suite at all: it was a regular size room with a small couch in it. 

Rooms were relatively clean but very little storage areas so plan to live out of your suitcase. 

Here is some positive: The roof top is lovely and the breakfast buffet is quite good. The location is very good located in an upscale neighborhood in the center of town. It is not in a high tourist area. ",3,2017,05,16
22,A delightful surprise,"I had no idea what to expect from the Ohla and it was lovely.  The rooms are great - simple, great design, everything one could need.  The staff were fantastic and breakfast was great.  I would definitely return.",5,2017,05,16
22,Excellent Hotel,"Very friendly and helpful staff, room clean and stilish. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent, breakfast buffet also very good. Service has to be highlighted: after our Barcelona visit we stayed another 4 days at the Costa Brava (also at an excellent hotel) and went then back to Barcelona for our returning flight. As the flight was very late we had about 4h for Barcelona city tour again. Because we told this the staff at the checkout, they offered us to store the luggage at our departure day (4 days after checkout!) and this also without any account - brilliant! If we will visit Barcelona again, we surely will stay at the Ohla Eixample again.

The only little minus (but only personally for us) is that the window at the room could not be opened. Due to the very quiet (not hearable) air condition, temperature was ok, but for us fresh air is even more comfortable in the night.",5,2017,05,11
22,Great boutique hotel--chic but low-key in lively part of the city,"Loved the location in the Eixample neighborhood; it was our second time in Barcelona so didn't want to stay in the more touristy center. It's close to the metro in the heart of the lively Eixample area which is filled with shops, restaurants and Gaudi architecture, a few minute's walk to great tapas and outdoor eating spots on broad, tree lined avenues. 

We stayed four nights toward the end of April -- great weather for roaming the city, then coming back to enjoy the outdoor rooftop with its heated pool, comfortable chaises, bar and panoramic views. Staff and service were great -- friendly and helpful but not overly gushy. Being greeted with a glass of cava in the lobby sets the warm tone for this wonderful hotel. 

The rooms were comfortable, very clean and minimalist. Very cool shower set-up that is space efficient but takes a little getting used to, as the glass wall faces the bedroom--interesting design. 

Highly recommend the buffet breakfast! Huge, huge selection of meats, egg dishes, local specialties of cakes and omelettes, juices and other things, overlooking a nice courtyard.

Overall, a great experience staying at the Ohla. We'll be back.",5,2017,05,07
22,Another relaxing stay at the Ohla,"This was my second visit to this lovely hotel, and like the first, very comfortable bed, soft linen, big thick towels and a very simple minimalist design. 

Service - very helpful and friendly staff.

Perfect location for us with 2 metros close by and only a stones throw away from Rambla de Catalunya. 

One concern, there's was a fire alarm during our stay, hotel didn't seem very full as there wasn't many people making their way to the lobby. Heading down to the ground floor there was no visible exit to the lobby, there was another couple coming back up saying that they could not locate how to get out. There was a staff member from the kitchen coming up to the 1st level, one of the other guest asked where we had to go, and he just pointed down, so not helpful at all. If there was a real fire i don't think this hotel will pass its health and safety. Aside from the useless kitchen hand, there was no hotel staff in sight at the stairwell ensuring guest safety.

Anyway, we still had an enjoyable stay here.

22,Ohla .... oh oh!,"The location of this Ohla hotel (there are two) is excellent.  The staff were incredibly helpful and efficient.  Breakfast was also excellent.  
The architecture and layout of the hotel is very modern, and not necessarily to our taste.  We had a junior suite and were quite surprised to find wash basins within the bedroom area, and a glass wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom - providing a clear view of the bath and shower!  Fortunately, the loo was separate, and private!
Perhaps the design would appeal more to the younger generation - but we, and the friends we travelled with, are past our first flush of youth, and would have enjoyed having a little more privacy when bathing! 
There was a very attractive roof pool and bar, with a view over Barcelona, and I am sure in the summer months would be a great place for sunbathing, or evening drinks.",4,2017,05,02
22,Just wonderful!!,"We found Ohla on TripAdvisor and if the great reviews weren't already enough, a friend who had stayed there couldn't have recommended it. We were welcomed warmly with a refreshing glass of cava which was so appreciated after a harrowing lost -luggage incident at the airport. The staff tried to assure us that the bag would be found and would do everything possible to help us in the morning as it was already late at night. Check-in was seamless, we were shown to our room and all the features were clearly explained. The suite was well laid out with lots of storage for clothing, bath with separate shower, mini bar, wifi, cable TV, snacks and tea/coffee making facilities. We would like to give a special shout-out to Rui at the front desk for his persistence with the airline which ultimately resulted in a retrieved bag two days later--we were thrilled!

We loved everything about the hotel, its location, the rooftop pool/bar, great restaurants in the neighborhood, and the service. We would definitely recommend this hotel without any reservation and hope to stay here again the next time we're in beautiful Barcelona.",5,2017,05,01
22,Excellent hotel! Go for it!,"Room was very nice. Staff were extremely friendly and always willing to help. We traveled with our young son, so they always offered to keep our stroller behind the front desk, call a taxi for us, etc. to help make it just a little easier. The buffet breakfast is AMAZING! So good. Also excellent location. I needed access to a computer daily, and they had a business center which was very helpful for me. When we visit Barcelona we will definitely be going to this hotel again. Thanks again for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,04,30
22,Greaaaaat hotel in Barcelona ,Cant get any better.... the best hotel we stayed in the while in Barcelona. Service exceeds any expectations.... Simply love it! The hotel is new and the atmosphere and design is simply amazing! Ohla is another reason to fall in love with Barcelona! ,5,2017,04,26
22,The personal touch,"We found this hotel on Trip advisor and booked a junior suite for four nights. 
On arrival we were greeted by Yeray on reception. From the first words of introduction he made us both feel very welcome. This may be a small boutique hotel but it is big on customer service. We were introduced by Yeray to Dave the concierge who along with Yeray spoke perfect English and had a real warmth of affection. It was clear we had made an excellent choice. We were shown to our room by Dani, who spoke very good English and showed us all the features of the room. 
The suite was well laid out with lots of storage for clothing, bath with separate shower, mini bar, wifi, cable TV, snacks and tea/coffee making facilities. 
There is a great pool and bar on the roof of the hotel, we spent a very pleasant afternoon there enjoying very good food and one or two G&T's. 
Location is excellent if you want to look around the Gothic quarter. The Gaudi cathedral (Sagrada Familia) and the old Barcelona cathedral are 30 minute walk. The Rambla is 20 minutes walk. However, I would recommend taking a taxi to save time and they are inexpensive. 
We had breakfast included in our room rate which is served in the XERTA restaurant which was awarded a Michelin star last year.  The food is well presented, surroundings are pleasant with plenty of space between tables and the staff are very attentive. 
When ever we went past the reception we were always greeted and asked if they could help in any way. Dave in particular is a credit to the hotel, he arranged tickets for the Sagrada Familiar at the last minute and gave us great advise about what to see and where to go during our stay. 
Checking out was a breeze, WEN was very efficient making sure all our paperwork was correct. 
I cannot give this hotel and its staff enough praise. My job takes me to many countries and many 5 star hotels.  And this hotel for me has made me feel the most welcome, the staff gave us both a genuine feeling of warmth. 
Would I stay here again ? DEFINITELY 
Hope you find this helpful. ",5,2017,04,23
22,Family weekend in Barcelona,"Just got back from three fantastic nights in Barcelona and wanted to give this hotel a review it really deserves. Website looked very good and the reality didn't disappoint. 

We arrived at 2pm and rooms were ready for us to occupy even though check-in not until 3pm. Friendly welcome with a complimentary glass of cava whilst we were quickly checked in. Our rooms were great, spacious and modern. Nice shower and separate bath. Mini bar, kettle, iron/ironing board and all the usual facilities you'd expect.

Initially the location worried me but you're really only a few streets away from the Pedrera and just a little further away is the Placa Catalunya and all the main shopping areas. 
Close to the hotel are numerous cafes, restaurants and bars. Also several convenience stores close by.

Do check out the pool on the roof terrace. It's not massive but had a lovely last couple of hours in the sun before checkout, waiting for our taxi to take us to the airport.

Mustn't forget the fantastic breakfast buffet too. Amazing fresh choice with a couple of cook to order options too.

Friendly staff too. Happy to ring taxis, print boarding passes and offer general guidance and advice. Particular mention to Jori who showed us our rooms and helped us with a restaurant choice one evening.

All in all a really great hotel.",5,2017,04,17
22,Visitor,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel following a two week cruise, beginning in Miami and ending in Barcelona.  The Ohla Eixample proved to be a great choice for unwinding after the two weeks at sea.  The hotel is staffed by people who were obviously chosen for their friendly personalities, attitudes toward work and above all, their ability to get things done.  

We had asked for an early check in because we were leaving the ship at about 9am and check in time is normally at 3pm.  Imagine the pleasant surprise when we arrived at the hotel, to be told that our room was ready and we had been upgraded to their largest suite.  What a nice thing to do for strangers, who might never come their way again.

The building is apparently brand new, since nothing seems to be worn or even used very much.  The decor is minimalist, even rather Spartan but everything is really first class.  From the oversized king bed to the modern and functional bath, the room was very well done.

When we arrived at our room, the bellman took the time to explain how everything worked (and there was a lot to explain).  This particular employee was Portuguese, rather than Spanish and spoke English very, very well.  Actually, everyone who works here seems to speak very good English.  Very, very nice young man.

The breakfast buffet is outstanding, for both quality and variety.  It seems to get somewhat crowded after 9am but until around 8:30, it is not very busy.  In addition to the offerings on the buffet line, one may place special orders .  Service is a bit slow at times and Americans will be a little frustrated at the time involved in just getting a refill on coffee.  As elsewhere in Europe, coffee occupies a special place in the culture and is not to be rushed!

Overall, the Ohla Eixample is a great choice for a stay in Barcelona.   ",5,2017,04,14
22,What a hotel!,"When you reserve a 5 star hotel, expectations are always high and this hotel definitely did not disappoint.  We reserved 2 connecting rooms, that are actually connected by a small hall way.  The rooms are enormous and modern with every amenity you can think of, In case something is missing you can just ask for it and without any extra cost.

This is a type of hotel where your bed gets turned back and you will find 2 chocolates on your pillow when you get back in the evening.  

What surprised me most was the size of the rooms, and I have to confess, that this is the hotel where I slept best, both mattress and pillow were very comfortable. 

Breakfast was not bad, with fresh juices, but also doesn't rank between the best breakfasts I have ever eaten in a hotel.

There is a public parking just a few metres before the hotel but if you wish the doorman will park your car in the private garage of the hotel for 35 euros a night.

Definitely recommend it, we spend 450 euros for 2 rooms including breakfast, which is quite accepatable for a 5 star.",5,2017,04,13
22,Perfect contemporary hotel,"This is fabulous hotel in a really good location. Very clean, modern with well equipped rooms. The bar and restaurant are great, I recommend dinning there. The rooftop pool is a great addition, very relaxing spot. Overall the hotel has a calm and relaxed feel and the staff are very attentive and helpful. The location is central yet still peaceful and close enough to shops, restaurants and metro but far away enough from Barcelona's more touristy/tacky locations. I recommend and will be going back.",5,2017,04,13
22,Excellent boutique hotel superb staff,"Arrived here a few days ago via taxi from the airport. Excellent check in,concierge was knowledgable and friendly. We were given a glass of cava whilst checking in. We had booked connecting rooms, a junior suite and twin room which they got housekeeping to make the twin beds into a double which was very nice. Rooms spacious designed well and very clean. The junior suite has a street view and the bed was a super king, the street noise can be heard.  Tv channels very limited only one English news channel. Shower very good although the lights needs to be brighter in the bathroom. We had breakfast included which was amazing, lovely surroundings and staff very helpful. Great choices of hams, cheeses, eggs and pastries. The rooftop pool was gorgeous it was really warm and guests were sunbathing in the morning on the lovely beds. Definitely a plus point to return to this hotel. Overall staff were very attentive and friendly and very customer focused, staff go out of their way to order taxis etc. Would definately return. Wifi is good. Air con is excellent.",5,2017,04,13
22,"Contemporary Hotel, Central Location","Wonderful Contemporary hotel in central position. We chose a Junior Suite which was very big & amazingly clean. Every facility you would expect, with the exception of a Nespresso machine. Only instant coffee sachets provided & no English breakfast tea. This would be a great extra, perhaps in suites?
Lots of lights & sockets but please put higher wattage lights above basins for doing make up.
Huge comfy bed & bedding. 
Excellent welcome at reception & concierge.
Beautiful roof top infinity, heated pool.
Friendly staff.
Breakfast was not great. Plenty of staff, but we weren't told what the system was, having stayed at many hotels each have their own system. Eventually we worked out that we order eggs from the staff & when my poached egg came I was mystified to find that it was perfectly cooked, i.e. not hard, but absolutely cold, as in fridge temperature cold?!
We booked a table in the 1 Michelin star Xerta restaurant to celebrate our anniversary & were again very disappointed with the food. We have eaten in many restaurants, including Michelin starred restaurants, but not sure what had happened this evening. We were served bread which was still slightly frozen in the centre, then replaced with bread which was toasted. One course on the Taster Menu wasn't available. Prawn wasn't cooked. Without going into too much detail, we decided to leave half way through the meal which we have never done before in our lives.
Overall, the hotel is excellent. Restaurant?? Was the Head Chef on leave, were we unlucky, or was it just a bad couple of days??",4,2017,04,11
22,Lovely with some wacky design,"A smart upscale boutique hotel in central Barcelona. Trendy and modern yet slightly odd, I just didn’t get why a beautifully equipped room with super classy bathroom sinks, basin and wonderful rain shower, should somewhat oddly sit adjacent to half a ceiling of raw sprayed on concrete and an raw pillar running through the room.  It’s not poor workmanship but has been carefully designed – however, I would rather the ceiling was finished and the rawness covered up. This could have been an really head turning room, but regrettably the unfinished look didn’t do it for me. The rest of the hotel is tastefully furnished and has a look and feel of quality about it. Regrettably I was only here for a single night so didn’t really sample all its attributes nor its top floor swimming pool.",4,2017,04,08
22,Excellent Experience,"Everything exceeded expectations. Staff extremely professional and friendly, service was excellent, hotel facilities were good with the highlight being rooftop pool. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you David and team for making our stay wonderful.",5,2017,03,31

22,a wonderful place to stay,"The design of the hotel was very sophisticated and the service was very attentive.  The lobby lounge and bar was enjoyable morning, noon and night; multiple settings let you shift from work to play and large to small groups fluidly.

good location
We loved our huge bed in junior suite

22,Perfect Hotel to visit Barcelona,"We enjoyed the stay at Ohla Example. The reception, the breakfast, the friendliness and the service of the staff as well as the atmosphere in the hotel we liked. The location within Barcelona is also good. We can highly recommend the Ohla Example.",4,2017,03,19
22,Good - but major service flaws!,"We chose this property over the Mandarin Oriental because of the year round rooftop heated swimming pool. Let me start by saying the design of the hotel is stunning and we received a very warm welcome with a glass of Cava on arrival (and a room upgrade). The rooftop pool is an oasis of calm to escape the madness of the city below - very impressive. There are however some significant flaws that the team here need to address (which will send me running back to the Mandarin for future visits) all relating to service delivery which I will try and summarise: 

 - Breakfast - total disaster and if they are not careful I'm sure would put many guests off wanting to try their restaurant on an evening (which has a Michelin Star). Trying to get someones attention for a coffee is practically a military exercise resulting in us most mornings getting coffee well after I had finished eating breakfast. They had 2 staff members to meet/greet, explain the service and provide coffee orders for every table in the restaurant - woefully inadequate. The first day no one explained to us at all that you could order fresh eggs/ omelettes etc... we just had to work it out by watching other guests. The second day was slightly better but only because we were late and there were only 2 other tables - although they still managed to get the coffee order totally wrong. 
 - Room service - we are still at the hotel and I have just returned to the room for the 2nd day running to find dirty glasses scattered around and not replaced - not sure why. 
 - We have had an ongoing issue with a patio door in the suite - leaving the hotel one morning I politely asked reception if they could send someone to have a look as I was concerned as we couldn't lock the door - the request was met with a blank look and a comment about 'don't worry no one can get in anyway' not exactly the response I was hoping for but was assured that someone would take a look. I returned to the room 5 hours later - door was open and no mention or record of anyone having attended the room from maintenance - reception staff had no idea of any issues so the request on the morning had been completely ignored. Maintenance team attended promptly after this second request and issue was resolved - we were also provided with a bottle of Cava for our 'trouble' which I did appreciate as at least someone had acknowledged their was an issue.  
 - Room Service - the rooftop bar was closed whilst we were there - despite the website claiming its all year round (only the pool is) so if you need refreshments you have to call room service. We ordered a Club Sandwich for lunch - calling from the pool side phone and clearly stating we were in the pool area. 45 mins later no sandwich had arrived and we called again to be told rather curtly 'we left it in your room' - I have no idea why they assumed to just leave it in empty room without telling us - its these basic mistakes that are frustrating and fundamentally effect the perception many guests will have of the experience. 

The hotel and suite really is beautiful but if service is important to you (even the most basic requests) then choose the Mandarin Oriental. If access to an outdoor pool is important in the winter/spring months then this hotel would be the choice - in fact I'm sat by the pool now and its truly delightful.",4,2017,03,19
22,Sophistication in the heart of Barcelona. ,"Stayed at Ohla Eixample for a few nights when in Barcelona.  The hotel was perfectly located near the Rambla and Diagonal Metro stop.  Attention to detail is evident throughout the stay. 

Upon entering to check in you are welcomed with a glass of champagne.  The staff are extremely welcoming and hospitable.  The contemporary lobby is tastefully designed. 

The rooms were spacious modern and classicly designed.  Large walk in shower, different light settings made the room a great place to retreat to each evening.  

A breakfast is included.  It's your typical hotel breakfast.  It included hot dishes such as eggs as well as fruit, pastries and a wide variety of fresh juices.  

I will recommend anyone coming to Barcelona to consider staying at Ohla Eixample. ",5,2017,03,17
22,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff. 
Love the breakfast with a wide selection of breada, cheeses, meats, even jamon iberico. Also a wide variety real fresh juices, wine and even cava. The perfect way to start your day! 
Great location near Passeig de Gràcia.
I would defintely stay here again!",5,2017,03,17
22,Amazing birthday city trip,"Four of us visited this hotel for 5 days during the February school half term.  Upon our arrival we were immediately met by a porter who took control of our luggage so that we could check in which was a professional and seamless affair.   All the staff in reception were very friendly and extremely helpful. We were staying in a junior suite which was truly fantastic - very modern but sympathetic to the existing structure. We absolutely loved it.  We had all the usual toiletries supplied along with fresh towels everyday - we even could choose the smell of our bed sheets!! Hairdryer, iron/ironing board, tea and coffee facilities and complimentary water all provided as well as a payable mini bar.  A turn down service was also provided which was a nice touch.  The breakfast was nice but we did find the attentiveness of staff was a bit hit and miss - several days there were not enough people around so you were left looking for people to serve coffee but this was only a minor niggle and certainly did not affect our enjoyment of this wonderful hotel.  Location was great and we were within walking distance to most areas although sometimes after a long day sightseeing we would taxi it back to the hotel if we were by the beach - save our feet!!

Loads of wonderful places to drink and eat especially in the Gothic area.  One great bar which is close to the hotel is the Dry Martini Bar - it is a must visit for cocktails.....

I would highly recommend the bus tours - we bought a two day pass which was really worth it.  You can get on and off at numerous tourist attractions and the busses tend to arrive every 15-20 minutes and run all day until about 19.00 winter and much later in the summer.

This was our fist time in Barcelona and we had read a lot about pick pockets but can honestly say we never saw any sign of this or indeed and trouble.  The city was so clean and the people ever so friendly.

I would definitely return without hesitation and also stay at the Ohla Eixample or their sister hotel Ohla Barcelona.",5,2017,03,13
22,Perfect destination!!,"We stayed here for my birthday and found the staff/location and amenities to be more ideal than we could of hoped for. The morning swim in the rooftop pool is an amazing way to dust off the cobwebs from the night before. We will definitely visit here again, as the main walk to the beach is right next door and when you stroll down it, you stumble along all the attractions on the way (this walk could take some time!!). It's also on trivago to get you the best deal. Perfect trip, aided with the perfect, helpful staff!!",5,2017,03,12
22,Good hotel in an excellent location ,Good hotel with an excellent location as it is away from the tourist trap spots in Ramblas yet has some excellent bars and restaurants nearby. The concierge is very knowledgable and helpful and guided us to some excellent spots for drinks and dinner. The 5 star rating is definitely a little off the mark and I found it to be more in the 4 star range. Rooms are small but modern with a very comfortable bed but the wash basin in the room and the glass shower wall overlooking the room were real drawbacks. ,4,2017,03,10
22,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff",Top class experience from beginning to end. Design hotel with homey and warm feeling. Concierge and staff are so friendly and helpfull.

22,Great Hotel with a genuine welcome,"First class experience from the arrival to leaving. Nothing is too much trouble to ensure the stay is above expectations. The staff really did care, and made the welcome special. we will definitely visit again.
Location is very good so easy to explore the city.",5,2017,02,26
22,Amazing hotel and service!!!,"The hotel design is very modern and nice. I would like to point out from my trip the special attentive service I received while there. From reception, to housekeepers to the restaurant's staff. The concierge team was very helpful in giving detailed information about what to do in Barcelona and of course the hidden gems... I would definitely recommend this hotel not only for the amazing service but also for its location because it is just 2 min from the main streets in Barcelona!! (Rambla de Catalunya & Passeig de Gracia). Shopping lovers will be so happy. Not to forget the breathtaking terrace they have on the 9th floor where you can enjoy delicious cocktails with a superb view of Barcelona, including the Montjuic Castle and La Sagrada Familia.",5,2017,02,26
22,Excellent hotel with great service,"We stayed 4 nights, great location to explore Barcelona , subway in walking distance ,spacious room,  very personalised service  and  friendly staff, excellent breakfast buffet. Very good value for money .Oha Example will be our hotel again at our next visit in Barcelona!",5,2017,02,20
22,Perfect hotel for a city trip...,"We stayed at the hotel for a long weekend to explore Barcelona.

Staff was very friendly, the room was minimalisticaly furnished, clean and felt very comfortable.
The location is great, close enough to all major sights to be able to walk there (we covered quite some distance on foot in the days there, though!), but still feeling like a nice and safe neighborhood.

The breakfast in the hotel was absolutely perfect. Fresh fruit and bakeries, plenty of choice of cooked breakfast, as well as local ham and cheese.

Would love to stay there again for our next visit to the city!",5,2017,02,19
22,Excellent Hotel with a Great Location in Barcelona,"From check in to check out Ohla Eixample was a great choice.  It was a $28euro taxi ride from the airport, when we arrived at 9:30 a.m. our room was ready, unbelievable! We were close to shopping, good restaurants, the Gothic Quarter and  the hop on hop off bus lines.  The concierge was helpful with any of our questions and the offer of champagne was a nice touch.  The room was outstanding, comfortable, clean and organized with products you wanted to use daily. In room coffee and tea flavors were great choices and a nice way to start the day. The rooftop infinity pool and deck area is beautiful with tables, chairs, candles and lounges. What a great way to spend the evening with a drink and a view. 
The champagne breakfast buffet served until 11 a.m. was a wonderful way to begin our day of sightseeing, it gave us the fuel to see the beautiful city and not worry about eating until dinner. 
Thank you to the staff of Ohla Eixample you were nothing but exemplary and always ready with a smile and a ""have a good day"".",5,2017,02,19
22,Great stay in Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel in a great part of Barcelona. Close enough to the downtown area that we walked everywhere, including Sagrada, the Gothic quarter, Park Guell etc; plenty of shops and restaurants close by.

22,Perfect place to stay in Barcelona,"Fantastic hotel with lovely staff, comfortable modern rooms with plush linens, great bath products, lovely bathtub.  Breakfast was a beautiful Spanish spread and absolutely delicious. We loved this location near the Perdrera and Casa Batllo, wonderful restaurants in the neighborhood  which is very walkable.  Would highly recommend, particularly over staying in more touristy areas such as Las Ramblas.",5,2017,02,04
22,Good location ,"Only location is good for this hotel, but unfortunately it's not a 5 star hotel as I expected because of the following:
1- poor English language at checking in and no helping for luggage 

2- breakfast so limited we are eating every day same dishes no variety of food available 
3- small enterance for a 5 star hotel
4- at checkout I called reception for luggage assistance and they said with 2 seconds will be in your room, but no one came more than 15 minutes and also the receptionist was not helpful and no one help us for luggage at least asking to help????? I really surprised this hotel is a 5 star??",2,2017,02,04
22,Perfect for a week in Barcelona,"I stayed at Ohla Eixample from 28 December 2016 - 2 January 2017.   I had originally wanted to stay at Mercer Barcelona because that is where I had stayed the previous time I was in Barcelona and it was lovely, however, Ohla Eixample was equally amazing and I had a fantastic stay!  Location-wise, the hotel is close to all the shops and about a 20-25 minute walk from the Gothic Quarter. 

We were booked into the Suite at Ohla Eixample, which is big and spacious with a private sun terrace.  The room was clean and bright, and even though it was winter, when the sun was out, we were able to lounge on the terrace in just our t-shirts and jeans.  The bed was super-comfortable and the room was quiet, ensuring we had 5 nights of great sleep.

The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful.  The reception desk staff recommended and booked some great restaurants for us including Carlota Akaneya, Restaurant Windsor, Arcano, Le Bouchon, Robata.  I even had time to use the gym and book a massage - both nice ways to stay healthy, considering the trip revolved around eating!  The hotel restaurant, Xerta, is excellent and has a Michelin star.  We ate dinner at the restaurant on New Year's Eve, which was a delicious 7-course tasting menu. 

I have no complaints about the hotel whatsoever and would happily return :)",5,2017,01,31
22,Good Hotel & Location,"I stayed for business and the hotel is very comfortable and in a good location. It's modern with good amenities and the rooms and beds were a very good standard. The staff are also pleasant and helpful.

22,This is how every hotel should be,"Great location in the heart of Barcelona. Modern building. Rooms are comfortable with giant TV. 
Word of warning. The toilet door is a flat panel. If you arrive to your room desperate to use the facilities, it may take a moment or two to find it. 
Great service from the staff. 
They make it look easy. 
If only all hotels were this comfortable.
",5,2017,01,17
22,very friendly staff,"We  have visite this hotel many times and are regular customers now. The staff gives us a feeling of ""coming home"".

22,"OveraGood Hotel, Well Located, Clean and Friendly.","Overall, a good hotel, well located, clean and friendly. I can 100% recommend this hotel, and will return when visiting Barcelona. 

Having booked a stay over the Christmas / New Year period, the hotel provided a complimentary bottle of champagne NYE, and welcomed us to the party in the hotel bar / lobby. 

We stayed in the Double Deluxe room which was fantastic, and one of the nicest hotel rooms we have stayed in. Very clean and modern.

I can't praise the staff enough. We had a drink the bar most nights, and the staff made conversation, helped us select tourist attractions to see and recommended good local restaurants to try. On a personal recommendation, try the hotel restaurant. We had a fantastic meal, with provided excellent service both during breakfast and in the evening. 

However, we struggled to get any English TV channels - other than the news, and would like to see a few more machines in the gym. Minor details which we would have liked to have had, but did not affect the Holiday or the standard of the hotel or the staff.",5,2017,01,07
22,"Excellent location,  Excellent customer service but not a family friendly design","This hotel had excellent customer service from concierge to housekeeping.  Newer property two blocks from iconic Gaudi building, major shopping and a metro station.

My only issue was that the configuration is a little too hip for its own good...and not family friendly:
1) room lights have four settings that cannot be adjusted - ""night setting""  illuminates two reading lights that can be turned off, but also illuminates two flood lights over the foot of the bed.
2) ""family room"" door configuration is very difficult in that  you open a room door that puts you in a small foyer with two more room doors -  all doors are very heavy fire doors that children cannot open or stub their toes horribly trying.
3) Bathrooms have heavy obscured doors while one of the showers and the bath tub have no doors.
Overall, this is an excellent design for couples, but not a good design for families with kids younger than 10 years old.",4,2016,12,30
22,Great Hotel!!,"Hotel is in a great location. Staff upon arrival were exceptionally helpful and polite. Check in was efficient and my colleague and I were upgraded without requesting.

The hotel was immaculate and maid service excellent throughout our stay.

All other hotel staff were polite, chatty, genuine and always willing to help without being over the top.

Overall a great hotel which I will 100% return to and would recommend without hesitation.",5,2016,12,07

22,Nice hotel good central area,"The service from the minute we arrived till the minute we left was first class 
Our room was a suite with an adjoining room both were first class though I had read some negative comments re the showering/bathing facilities prior to arriving we found that they had a real uplifting feeling to the suite The location was first class we were only there for four days and found eveything we were looking for within walking distance and the tour buses/underground easy to use The only fault that we found was the breakfast was really slow with attending to replacement tea or coffees and the ordering of cooked eggs took so long that we didnt order on the last day we thought the first day was just a bad day but sadly the next day was no different",5,2016,12,07
22,Following the high quality feel of Barcelona,"Very comfortable, large room (deluxe), great breakfast, customer oriented staff and a good location for having a short walk to the city center on the great streets of Barcelona.

22,"Convenient location, good service ","Hotel is located conveniently, close to metro station and also within walking distance of lots of restaurants and, if you're wearing comfy shoes, La Rambla. 

Service at the hotel is good, staff were attentive and happy to help with any requests we had. 

Gym was closed when we stayed, but we got access to an alternative just a few minutes' walk away. 

We would gladly stay here again next time we're in Barcelona. ",5,2016,12,05
22,Quiet at the right spot!,"This is a gem of a hotel. Well designed , good coulors .Reception friendly and helpful.The rooms are well designed. We do not love the view to the bathroom. Would be better covered! The restaurant is of high quality.Breakfast good. Is included.
The roof terrace is a good place just to sit and to relax.The good rambla is just around the corner. The location",4,2016,11,26
22,"Central, modern, comfortable, great service","Hotel Ohla Eixample is around the corner from Rambla de Catalunya (Ramblas) and 1 street away from Passeig de Gracia, possibly THE shopping street in Barcelona.
It opened in March 2016 and truly deserves their 5-star rating.
Great rooms with a wonderful bathroom, great cleaning service and excellent quality beds. Our room didn't offer a great view but the hotel is in the centre of Barcelona so you can't have (good) views on all sides. The staff is wonderful: very helpful, arranging taxis, take care of your restaurant reservations and not to mention all the tourist information they are able and willing to give. Furthermore you can eat in the hotel restaurant which is just as great as the hotel itself. Before I forget to mention: their rooftop swimming pool and the gym!",4,2016,11,23
22,Pleasant stay,"Although we usually stay in the old town when in Barcelona, this time we chose Ohla in Eixample based on the availability of parking and the rooftop terrace with pool. Overall we were very pleased with our stay.

Pros:
- We stayed in a Junior suite, which was spacious, well equipped and cosy.
- Excellent rooftop terrace with pool and bar (serviced from morning until late at night).
- Great breakfast selection.
- Close to the metro and Passeig de Gracia, with many restaurants and bars in the vicinity.
- Staff at reception was excellent.

Cons:
- Although we did not hear any street noise, there was a lot of noise from other hotel guests (banging doors and shouting throughout the night)
- Service, especially during breakfast, is inconsistent, and not really up to 5 star standards
- The rooftop pool is always crowded, we were never able to get a sunlounger. Also there are no parasols, so no shade at all around the pool.
- During our stay the gym was still under construction, and the area around the hotel is not exactly suited for running.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Ohla Eixample, although I would classify it as a good four star hotel rather than five stars.",4,2016,11,21
22,"Nice hotel, Great location","We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The location is excellent only a few minutes walk from the Diagonal Metro. Very nice neighborhood away from the hustle of the La Rambla and the old town. Only 15 minutes walk will get you there if you do not want to use the metro. Good Restaurants are nearby. The breakfast was very very good. Lots of choices. Fresh fruits, yougurts, croissants, eggs made to order, iberican ham etc. They even had gluten free choices.",5,2016,11,18
22,Short but WONDERFUL stay,"My husband and I only had 24 hours in Barcelona, and we were absolutely thrilled with the service, location, room, lovely breakfast and overall ambience of Ohla Eixample.  David at the front desk (and the entire staff) were truly outstanding.  Highly recommend!",5,2016,11,17
22,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, great beds","I've had a nice 3 night stay at the Ohla Eixample. The hotel is very well located, near the Diagonal metro station. The staff is very friendly, always there to help. The breakfast is very good, though I missed some smoked salmon. The beds are the best feature for me in this hotel, never had such a good night sleep in a hotel before. The hotel-bar is a bit overpriced, €4 for a coca-cola is not what you call cheap. The gym and pool are a nice extra, though the pool could have used a bit more heating.",4,2016,11,15
22,"Friendly service, civilised location, extraordinary restaurant.","Like a lot of city five star hotels, this doesn't quite have the opulent feel of an equivalent beach resort: the little pool on the roof is barely more than a plunge pool, and like some of the other facilities is appears designed to meet the minimum specifications for a five star rating.  The room service menu is limited, the free TV channels only have news in English, etc.  For those reasons I've rated this as ""very good"" rather than ""excellent"".

And, it was very good.  The hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant.  Even the most junior employees have a basic standard of English, and we felt that they made a genuine effort to be helpful.  Service really defines the ""feel"" of a hotel stay, and this left us feeling very positive about the Ohla Eixample.

The highlight for us was the ""Xerta"" restaurant: according to our host, the restaurant was established in a small village of the same name, specialising in fresh local food from the Elbe Delta.  They received a Michelin star, and relocated into the hotel.  We took a tasting menu of eight courses for 70 Euros a head (excluding wine, but including water, bread) - about half the price of Barcelona's other Michelin-starred restaurants.  It was outstanding as the Michelin star would suggest: from well-executed staples like fried bass, to innovative delights like the ""garden"" dessert (I won't spoil it with details!), to more challenging exotica like the tiny elvers served with a coddled duck egg.  We will be remembering and talking about it for years.  It is worth noting that the Xerta is closed on Sunday and Monday - we were fortunate that we arrived on Saturday night just in time for dinner.

The hotel is located close to the ""Diagonal"" avenue the runs through the city, and the ""Diagonal"" metro station is five minutes' walk too, so transport from the Ohla is very easy.  Get a map unless you're sure of your phone data plan (I like a paper map anyway), and it's a great place to get around from.  The Eixample area has some good shopping for clothes and shoes, from international brands and some of Spain's best - Carmina Shoemaker, on Diagonal next to the Metro station, is the standout.

To get to tourist sites, the Sagrida Familia is a ten minute walk, the Guell Park, the Gothic Quarter and the marina area all require a short metro ride.  Taxis are reasonably priced compared to London, but we used the metro most of the time.

Overall, we found the Ohla a clean, professional and comfortable base for a delightful couple of days in Barcelona, and the restaurant was a memorable highlight.",4,2016,11,13
22,Barcelona Visit,"Ohla Eixample was one of the best experiences I have ever encounter during my trip to Spain. I wanted my stay to be somehow special, and they made it very special and enjoyable. I even requested a package to be arranged prior of my arrival, and they had it ready before my arrival , and had me check in early. I strongly recommend couples to book in this perfect hotel. Not mentioning that it is near the center and everything is nearby the hotel.
     ",5,2016,11,08
22,Excellent hotel,"We were planning to stay for 3 nights after a cruise that ended in Barcelona.  This hotel was recommended, although when we arrived I wondered if the other Ohla might have been the one recommended.  It turned out this hotel had been open only about two months, so the driver initially took us to the wrong one, even though I showed him the address.  Once we finally got there, we enjoyed our stay very much.  The rooms are modern and the toilet is in its own room with a shower that is glassed in so open to the room.  They make that clear in their ads, though.  The hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle, but walking distance to some of the Gaudi sites and the Gothic Quarter.  The staff was particularly accommodating and the restaurant was excellent.  Such a treat as a celiac to have delicious gluten free rolls included with breakfast!  The restaurant was always gluten free friendly.",4,2016,11,01
22,Nissan ,"I enjoy very much the stay at your hotel 
The location is great the service was great.
Very recommended.The room was very convenient.And very clean 
The atmosphere is cool 
I also enjoy the parking 
Need I say More?!",5,2016,10,30
22,A four star hotel operating under the guise of a five star,"The Ohla Eixample is well located in the Eixample area of Barcelona, minutes from Passeig de Gracia and a 20 minute walk from the Sagrada Familia (though it is to the North of Eixample, so you end up having to take metros or walk longer distances to get to the tourist spots). The property puts a lot of effort into describing itself as a five star hotel, however, compared to five star hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental, down the road, it is no where near. 
The rooms are modern, though more cold and sleek than warm and welcoming. The walk in shower overlooks the room, through a frosted glass pane, meaning that the bathroom sink and vanity area has to be located in the room itself - nothing convenient about that for a gentleman or lady hoping to prepare for a night out with some privacy. The floors are polished resin, with exposed industrial ceilings, again nothing very warm about that. 
The hotel rooftop is lacklustre, a small bar, limited service and seating area with an infinity pool, with pretty all-round unattractive views of rooftops and random neightbourhood buildings (again the Mandarin Oriental rooftop is breathtaking in comparison). 
Front-desk staff are functional, i.e. they do their job, but don't exactly exceed that, which ties back into the comment about it being a four star hotel. Don't hope for any upgrades or special treatment, you won't get it. We were told our room had been incorrectly assigned, asked to move, then when we'd gone all the way down to the front desk, it turns out it was all a mistake.
I think if I'd stayed here on a business trip then I would have been happy, though being a weekend break with some added comfort, the Ohla Eixample in no way delivered. Best spend your money elsewhere, so many other nice hotels in the same area, or splash out on the W/ Mandarin if you can.",3,2016,10,28
22,Roof top pool,"We had a wonderful time staying at the Ohla Eixample. The staff were helpful & friendly, the hotel was spotless and within walking distance of shops and restaurants, whilst being located in a quiet street. The rooftop, all season pool, was a bonus. We visited in October, which was still warm enough for us to swim, and the pool was usually empty. However, in the warmer months it could become rather crowded. The only small criticism is that the 'hot food' at breakfast was not hot! Apart from this, breakfast had a wide range of foods to choose from.",4,2016,10,27

22,Modern Hotel in a very convenient location,"I was here on a business trip for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. By no means was it perfect, but it ticked most of the boxes for me. 

Pros:
* Design is very modern & minimalist
* Standard Toiletries provided
* Shower and Shampoo had a lovely scent 
* Super King bed and sheets was incredibly comfortable and super soft!!!! I wish I could take it home with me. 
* There was a built-in mediahub which connects to a huge TV screen. Allowed me to also extend my laptop screen 
* Supermarket was nearby if you were craving for any snacks 
* 2 metro stations in close proximity - Provenca and Diagonal
* I was in the Jr Suite, so bathtub & shower facilities
* Spacious Room
* Big comfortable sofa to lounge on
* Choice of pillows offered before my stay

Cons
* being a new hotel, the service needs a bit more polishing, in fact it was probably a little too laid back for what a five star hotel should be providing
* My coffee cup that I used the night before was JUST rinsed and placed back!!! Not GOOD!!!
* Breakfast, like another recent review, CRAP. I skipped the 3rd day and ate out. Management should really look into this. Generally, choices in Europe are limited, but the variety here is just abysmal. One option I thought was standard in Spain was their popular bread with garlic and tomatoes, it wasn't offered here!!!!!!   

To be honest, I should be giving this hotel a 3 out of 5 stars, but being new, it needs time to settle in.

Will I come back... yes, but I'll be expecting those little touches sorted out.",4,2016,10,20
22,Weekend break,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel in a design room with breakfast, the room was really comfortable and well decorated and a great bathroom/shower too.
Breakfast was nice and they would cook omelettes on demand, the roof bar and pool was nice although it was a bit cold for a swim and the drinks were expensive as were the restaurant.
Staff very helpful and Barcelona is a great city with a lot to see.",5,2016,10,20
22,As good as you can get ,"Only one thing to say - get a junior suite which are the x10 rooms on each floor they are nice, and the breakfast is fine, just check that you have it! Location is fine, at the very top of the Ramblas and everything else is as promised ",5,2016,10,18
22,expensive for what it is,"I stayed here on a business trip and wouldn't stay here on a personal trip. Hotel is nice but I dont think its worth the price they charge. 
Rooms are OK. very simple design. 
Breakfast is very poor - especially in Spain with all its delicious food. 
Asked the staff for some of the complimentary toiletries and they didn't have any of them...",3,2016,10,18
22,Fantastic Hotel (Highly Recommended),"This is a new hotel provides tidy, simple design and comfortable room.  Hotel staff provided good services and prepared excellent welcome surprise as per my order.  Hotel restaurant is elegant and serving with excellent breakfast.  This hotel located at the center of Barcelona and very convenient with metro nearby and tourist can have just 15 minutes walk to Mira Casa.  Highly Recommended!! : )",5,2016,10,16
22,Amazing hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights for my husbands 40th birthday and booked the junior suite.  When we arrived we were upgraded to the attic room with a balcony and had bubbly waiting on ice for us, which was a lovely touch.  The room was beautiful very modern and the bed was comfy and the latex pillows were amazing.  The staff were so friendly and helpful, and couldn't do enough for us.  Had some lovely cocktails on the roof top bar and breakfast was good!! Would definitely recommend and we can't wait to go back and the area was great 👍",5,2016,10,14
22,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"We loved our stay at the Ohla Hotel. The room was a great size with a mix of industrial and new design. The location is fantastic, close enough to everything, with a little distance to enjoy some peace and quiet. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I will stay here again.",5,2016,10,13
22,"Fine hotel, very good service level, but ....","Very fine hotel where all the staff were very service minded and very helpful.
The room layout is also very fine, if you like these new ""designs"", where the entire room is kind of ""linked"" together (open view to the shower, sink close to the bed ...)
The biggest (and maybe only) problem is that you can hear every metro train that passes. You might get used to it, on a longer stay. But during our two night visit, we heard this every time.
We also stayed at another hotel in Eixample, where there was no problem with passing metro trains. So take that into consideration, when looking for a hotel in this area.",4,2016,10,09
22,Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of September and thoroughly enjoyed it.,"The hotel is in a great location; far enough from the main touristy areas of the city but still within an easy walk of some key attractions and close to underground rail stations too.  The hotel is modern and contemporary with a high quality finish inside and out.  The roof top pool isn't very wide but is a good length if you like doing laps and the water was the perfect temperature.  The rest of the roof top area is nicely appointed.  The views aren't anything to write home about but it is a relaxing place to have a drink or just chill.  Our room was very well appointed and we loved the open plan layout where the bathroom felt like part of the main room.  The bed was huge and quite possibly the most comfortable I've ever slept in!  We were offered a choice of pillows before even arriving at the Hotel too which I thought was a nice touch and though I can't recall the type of pillow I chose, I chose well because it was blissfully comfortable.  Breakfast was top notch, delicious, quality food and good coffee too. And finally, the service was excellent.  Friendly staff and very helpful.  The only issues we had were with our room.  We were on the top floor immediately beneath the pool and there was a damp smell in our room.  It wasn't too bad but worth mentioning.  Also, when we sat on our balcony we found we got splashed from above if people were swimming.  It was lovely and sunny so we didn't mind too much but some might find it annoying.  Finally, and it is another trivial gripe but there was only one bedside table.  However,  I would definitely return to the Ohla and would highly recommend it to others.",5,2016,10,06
22,Nice boutique hotel on prime location,"My experiences in this lovely boutique hotel are as following:

Positive:

+ prime location close to both metro (Diagonal) and train station (Provença) with a lot of bars and restaurants in the area
+ wonderful constructed boutique hotel with warm colours
+ swift check-in and check-out
+ free wifi
+ great room (essential room)
+ daily free bottled water
+ daily turndown service
+ pillow and bed aroma menu
+ great breakfast
+ all is superclean
+ discrete staff but they are there if you need them (I don't need to hear ""is all ok with you"" 10 times a day)

The few negatives, however quite important for me as this is a 5 star property so they really need to work on this:

- during the 3 breakfast sessions I had, the only once came to me and ask if I would like to have a coffee or something else...this is not acceptable for a 5 star hotel! I don't drink coffee, but this is a pro-active question they should ask each morning
- no welcome drink? Is this because I did not book it straight via the hotel website? Come on...I know many 4 star hotels in Barcelona that offer a welcome drink as a standard feature...no matter via which way you booked...

Still to be recommended off course but might try another hotel next time",4,2016,10,04
22,Great Boutique Hotel - Recommend to Everyone!,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights for business, and will stay there again. It was absolutely wonderful - the staff went above and beyond to make my stay memorable. 

Customer Service: Everyone at the hotel was so personable, kind, and helpful which was fantastic. I arrived early at the hotel without telling them (around 10am), and just wanted to drop my bag off so I could go explore. Instead, they gave me early check in, so I didn't have to deal with the hassle later on. I also was able to go to a Barcelona football game - the front desk helped get us a taxi, gave advise for leaving the game, and asked about the game when we got back! They made an effort to remember us, and it was really nice

Breakfast - the breakfast is delicious! Recommend for everyone to get - it is so easy to get, and they have a wonderful selection. The fresh juices are amazing, and they are so creative (I had a pear, kiwi, apple combo, which was great)

Room - the room is absolutely wonderful. They asked for a pillow preference, and a scent to be used. They really just want people to be happy and enjoy their stay, and they go above and beyond. The only thing is the shower (at least in my room) looked directly out at the bed, so if you travel with anyone else, just an FYI.  The whole hotel is really clean and well kept. It was new when I went, but it was great.

Location - it is a bit of a walk to the beach (~20 minutes?), but very central to all touristy things, and I loved the area. I loved the walk to the beach (all down hill!), and then took a cab back, which was only €10. The rooftop is also amazing, and was really nice to check out during sunset. I didn't take advantage of the pool, but I wish I did! It's a pretty nice size, not big enough to swim laps (unless you are the only one), but it looked lovely.",5,2016,10,03
22,Weekend away Barcelona ,"Watch out for 2 ohla hotels in Barcelona . This is classed as a five star which is really 4 star at best. Rooms are average size. 
Staff were very friendly and helpful. Roof top pool looked nice not sure if it's big enough to swim in. Overall disappointing as I was expected a lot better. However we found some great tapas bars and enjoyed the sites to see - what a great city. We will be back in Barcelona again ",3,2016,10,03
22,stylish and incredible staff.,"I love the design of the rooms - a wheelchair accessible room is still a well designed room.  The staff is always elegant, helpful, warm and responsive. the location is fantastic and I enjoy myself whenever I stay here.",5,2016,10,03
22,Simply Amazing,"If you want alternative luxury .. Coming to this place . Even before we arrived, we were asked about our pillow menu choice and our room aroma, I had a feeling we were in for something special . The team were amazing especially the concierge Pablo ! Every recommendation he made for us in terms of restaurants was spot on. The room was fantastic, once we got our heads round the modern aspects of it .. But the best .. has to be the roof top bar and pool . So come here if you want a central location, amazing hospitality and a great please chillax.",5,2016,10,03
22,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Stylish hotel with the added bonus of a roof top pool and sun terrace. We upgraded to a deluxe room which was spacious but the outside terrace was small and shaded with an unattractive view. Probably more of a smoking area than a terrace to sit out on. Even on the second floor we were aware of the metro rumbling beneath the hotel. But none of these things should put anyone off from staying here. The staff, amenities and position are all 5 star.",5,2016,10,02
22,Great potential to become even better,"We stayed 4 nights in junior suite. Without any further talk this is what we like about this hotel: location, although abt 2 km from LaRambla, it is withing walking distance to Garcia street which is full of high end shops. Also bit north from the center is very vibrant scene for small restaurants and coffee shops.
Staff very good and professional across the board.
Hotel it self is very clean and tidy, layout is good for visitors any age.

Things to improve:
In 5 star hotel, toillette brush is a no-no.
Small disposal hygiene bags to make available.
Windows can not be open, though I understand safety aspect, it can be solved to make them to open top side only for air exchange.
Linen duvet goes all the way down touching the floor.
Breakfast, one of the days smoked ham plate was filled with very small particuls of ham looked like leftover, this cannot happen to hotel of this level.

I would give 4,5 for total experience
",5,2016,10,01
22,Great Hotel,"Very clean, extremly handy personnel, great shower and excelent breakfast.
Did not like the price for a half bottle of champagne almost Euros 50,00 and also a very very  simple dinner  with no wine, no desert for  Euros 100,00.
       ",5,2016,09,29
22,Amazing Hotel in the perfect location,"I booked this hotel well before it opened, and hoped that it would offer everything that was promised.  Before arriving to the hotel, I received emails from the Experience team asking if there was anything that I would need for my stay.  I let them know that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and that I wanted to have something special set up in the room upon our arrival.  The team help to set up a birthday surprise with 30 balloons.  We booked the Junior Suite.  When we arrived, not only did they have the 30 balloons, but they also left a bottle of cava with two champagne flutes.  My boyfriend was so happy and excited.  

The room was very clean and modern.  The staff was nothing short of amazing.  

We decided to return back to hotel after a short trip to Ibiza, and when we came back we received a note from the staff thanking us for coming back, and another bottle of cava!  

The hotel is located blocks from Las Ramblas.

I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for luxury in a great location!

Thanks Ohla Eixample team and management...you made our vacation really special!!!! We can't wait to come back again!!  Jennifer and Ramon",5,2016,09,20
22,Extremely disappointed and shocked,"At the outset i must say that our three night stay at the hotel was very pleasant and the location and service etc were very good too. 
However the hotel lacks the basic security that every guest expects from a hotel of that standard. A shocking incident happened with my husband and me as we were sitting in the lobby of the hotel after checking out. My husband was sitting with my bag as we were waiting for our pick up car to come and we suddenly realise much to our horror that my hand bag with all my belongings including my passport was missing! A person had come up to my husband asking him to take his photograph and when he got up to do that his accomplice took away the bag. This was later confirmed by the security camera. Needless to say our trip took a drastic turn with flight cancellations, trips to Madrid to get a new passport made etc etc. 
The hotel lobby is totally unmanned and has no security or safety standards whatsoever which to me is one of the most basic requirements which we take for granted when we check into such hotels.
Please stay here at your own risk!",1,2016,09,19
22,Perfect location,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights with my teenage daughter to visit the signs of Barcelona.  the location of the hotel was perfect, close enough to walk to the majority of the sights, and then the roof top pool for relaxing at when we had had enough sight-seeing.",5,2016,09,11
22,A true jem in the city,"Absolutely fantastic hotell with very good service from every single employee. The rooms are stunning and quiet with beautiful bathroom facilities and excellent housekeeping. The staff are all very helpfull and serviceminded with a true desire to make your stay with them as pleasant as possible. 
The location is perfect in the city, on a quiet strees with walking distances to both public transport such as busses and metro, as well as the city sightseeing coaches, and a short walk from the shopping streets with several lovely restaurants. 
Will definetly recomend this hotell to anyone travelling to Barcelona.",5,2016,09,11
22,Stylish boutique hotel ,"A contemporary yet cosy hotel in the well-positioned Exiample district of Barcelona -  only 2 minutes walk from the Rambla de Catylonia which is lined with lovely outdoor cafes and leads you down to La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter. There's a wonderful, relaxing rooftop terrace with pool and the food in the hotel is excellent. The real strength of this stylish and spotless hotel are the staff who are warm, friendly and extremely helpful.  They'll advise on the best places to eat nearby and where to go.  They also make the best pina colada in town! I can't recommend this lovely place enough and I can't wait to return. Thanks to all the staff who made my stay in this beautiful city so pleasurable especially as I was travelling on my own. ",5,2016,09,11
22,"Great place , excellent staff","Very nice hotel , close to central Barcelona , with lots of Tapas bars and resataurants located within walking distance. Great breakfast and breakfast service
Staff went above and beyond helping us get around Barcelona and booking tours etc.",5,2016,09,08
22,Lovely weekend ,"Girlfriend too me away to barcelona for my birthday I couldn't have been more spoilt the hotel was amazing beautifully presented, friendly staff who had amazing knowledge of the city and were really helpful with where to eat and what to do and see, rooftop bar is a must and try the local cava available ",5,2016,09,04
22,SUPERB STAFF.,"Pleasant decor. Excellent location. Charming rooftop bar. Outstanding breakfast.

My airline lost my luggage - enormously annoying - and the hotel did everything intro power to try to assist.

Would not hesitate to recommend.",5,2016,09,01
22,Excellent stay.,"I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Ohla. Our stay was superb. The staff are so helpful but not in your face. Rooms - spacious, comfortable and very clean. Breakfast was fantastic. Pool terrace area and bar a lovely place to sunbathe and read. As with all hotel pools our only niggle was people saving pool side loungers but not using them until midday causing morning swimmers to have to sit on chairs whilst loungers lay empty. But it certainly didn't ruin our stay. The location is great but it is definitely the staff that make the place. We will hopefully return soon.",5,2016,08,28
22,A romantic week in Barcelona,"The staff on this hotel are very very kind and serviceminded. The room was perfect, and the rooftop bar with a pool was relaxing and joyfull after a hot day. The breakfast was also very good! I can recomend this to everyone. Thank you for a delightful stay. ",5,2016,08,28
22,Absoultely Perfect!!,"My wife and I stayed here during a short birthday break in Barcelona. This is an exceptional 5* Hotel. We stayed in one of the Junior Suites, which I must say I would definitely recommend. All of the staff were friendly, polite and nothing was ever to much trouble. The Hotel is beautiful, stylish with modern rooms and is situated in a great location. I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,22
22,5 Star Hotel with 6 Star service and 7 star Personnel. ,"A hotel made by its team.

Undoubtedly Ohla Eixample hotel is a beautiful, stylish hotel well worth its 5 stars. However, the most precious asset of this hotel is the personnel - all of them highly skilled and true professionals in the hospitality industry with true dedication to helping their guests feel as comfortable and happy as possible.
From the the moment we were greeted until our last goodbyes we were met with stellar service and genuine smiles. 

The rooms are beautifully designed, with high quality materials and kept sparkling clean. The bed is the most comfortable we've ever slept in and woke up fully rested every day. Amenities include pretty much everything you might need and if you need anything more the reception will do everything to help you get it.
Housekeeping visit twice daily if you allow and they are VERY thorough. 

Breakfast buffet is very good and tasty. 
We also had dinner at the restaurant, had the large tasting menu. Oh wow! Everything was delicious and beautifully presented.

There is a swimming pool with a bar on the roof, great for chilling out and cooling off. 

WiFi connection is impressively consistent and internet speed is very good, never had any problems streaming full HD video and music. 

Very convenient location, pretty close to everywhere we wanted to go.

Till we visit them again in our gorgeous 806 attic room, we HIGHLY recommend this gem to anyone looking for a romantic experience. ☺️
Simantiras. ",5,2016,08,21
22,Awesomely awesome ,"Location is great; its near to everything. Rooms are very modern and stylish, mini bar included, beds are extremely comfortable and clean. Breakfast buffet delicious; there's churros, doughnuts, cake, toast, various types of jams,cheese and ham, scrambled eggs, bacon, salami, salad.....
Churros were finished and my two daughters really wanted them so we asked for some more. After a few minutes, the waitress brought us a whole tray of churros  that the chef has only made for us. The staff is very friendly and polite.
The lobby was well decorated and friendly.
On the last floor there is also a pool! Perfect for relaxing in a hot day. On the terrace there is also a bar and you can ask for everything you want at any time.
Me and my family are having a great time for now and hope that every day gets even better than it is.",5,2016,08,15
22,What a fabulous hotel !!,"My fiancé and I came stayed here during a short break in Barcelona. I can honestly say from the moment we arrived our stay was first class. The location , the rooms, the roof top pool all excellent. What made our stay extra special was the treatment we received from the staff, everyone was so polite and friendly, I work in hospitality and the staff were a credit to the hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to stay here again at some point in the future. ",5,2016,08,07
22,Brilliant would highly recommend,"We stayed for a long weekend. It's well situated off of a lively pedestrian street. The staff were excellent, helpful and gave great advice about  places to eat and how to make the most out of our time.The room was lovely, comfortable bed. Roof top swimming pool also worth a visit too.",5,2016,08,06
22,Customer service down to a fine art...,"From the minute we arrived at the Ohla, we were treated like VIP's. The reception staff were all excellent, with three staff all giving us their undivided attention , taking our luggage, checking us in and running us through the map of Barcelona simultaneously. Our room on the 6th floor was modern and immaculate, with the best bed I've ever slept in. The rooftop terrace was a gem also, a great place to chill and enjoy one of Iwan's mean mojitos. It was the staff that made our stay so enjoyable though, always on hand for whatever we needed, or even just to shoot the breeze. My one criticism would be that the housekeeping staff are so good and eager that they knock fairly early in the morning, but once you leave your sign out the night before there's no problem. All in all, it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in, and will be my first choice when I return to Barcelona. ",5,2016,08,02
22,Excellent base for a long weekend sightseeing,"My girlfriend (28 years old) and I (33 years old) have just returned from a 4 night stay at Ohla Eixample. I should mention that I have worked in the travel industry for 8 years and often have to inspect 5 star hotels for my clients. Ohla Eixample really impressed me. The hotel is perfectly located in a relatively quiet, tree-lined street within easy walking distance or a quick metro/taxi ride from all of the main sights. We had a deluxe design room on the 3rd floor. That was a good choice as it has two sinks, a separate seating area and a small terrace with a view onto some private apartments to the back of the hotel. The hotel was pretty faultless apart from a lack of natural light in the room although that is well managed through day, relax and night lighting options. Also, from the lobby, reception, restaurant and even as high as our third floor room you could hear the faint rumbling of the metro every ten minutes. I am very particular about this kind of annoyance but, to be honest, it didn't really cause a problem and was more amusing to think that a 5 star hotel has this kind of minor issue. If you book this hotel you won't regret it but you should opt for a high floor room and ideally street facing for a better view. It would be good if the pool opened earlier than 8am but when it is open its a beautiful place to relax before and after sightseeing. We enjoyed chatting the night away with a variety of other guests of all ages and nationalities. The staff were really welcoming and even gave us a complimentary bottle of cava on our last night and a 4pm check out free of charge on our last day. Their help in planning and booking our sightseeing really took away the pain of joining queues at each site. The included breakfast was as varied as it was excellent. Free wifi was fast and reliable all over the hotel. We will definitely choose this hotel again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,08,02
22,Nice place to stay,"A nice place to stay, just few minutes walk from the fountain and Sagrada Familia. Staff is friendly and helpful, sometimes not very good in English though :) that is why we had few difficulties while staying. Pay attention to swimming pool opening hours, as we did not manage to get there because they were moving gym equipment through the roof. ",4,2016,08,01
22,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody coming to Barcelona - fantastic hotel, outstanding service","My boyfriend and I just came back from a long weekend at Ohla Eixample which is a fantastic hotel: modern, clean, and the most comfortable bed I've slept on in a long time. The rooftop pool is great, the pool a good size, and the location of the hotel is fantastic. What really made it for us was the faultless staff. Everybody was friendly and incredibly accommodating and made us feel very welcome. They were able to let us stay in our room till 5pm as we had a late flight and we felt that they really went the extra mile to make the stay as great as possible. Amina was particularly lovely!",5,2016,08,01
22,Our unfogetable 25th marriage anniversary,"We were looking for a unique hotel to spend a week in Barcelona celebrating our 25th marriage anniversary. We had found almost brand new (opened in March ‘16) 5 stars hotel in the good district (Eixample) and very good location (perfect place to start visiting the city). What we had received was even better than we expected. Wonderful apartment (Junior  Site with great bad, superior bathroom, modern design, big TV), fantastic breakfasts (big choice of fine food and drinks), swimming pool with a bar and view to Sagrada Familia and Montjuïc and most of all the best personnel in the world. Not only always ready to help you but also making our celebration even more unforgettable …. This place is worth every Euro you pay, specially that you cannot buy real hospitality. There is only one terrible thing with Ohla Eixample: it is very difficult to leave … We are already missing it! I hope that we will visit Barcelona and This Hotel sooner that in next 25 years!

22,5 star hotel 6 star staff,"My wife and l have just returned from a four day break, where l celebrated my 65th birthday and all the staff made our stay special.Nothing was too trouble for them they even decorated the breakfast table on my birthday with balloons and banners.What great people!! l would to say a big thank you!! Great Hotel.",5,2016,07,27
22,Good quality and service,"Good rooms, food, quality and service. For a family with one child be ready to pay 50 euro extra per night for additional bed in a double room. Be ready to pay 36 euro for hotel parking per day, which is better than the public parking nearby (36 euro per day = 8 hours, or 3.60 per hour). Might be coincidence, but after we payed they started to clean the room 1 a day instead of twice a day. Breakfast is of good quality. Location is very good  - in the city centre.",5,2016,07,26
22,Hip Hip Ohla,"A great location at the top of Las Ramblas within walking distance of Sagrada Familia. A fresh new hotel with a hip, buzzy atmosphere. Rooms are modern and the beds have to be amongst the most comfortable I have experienced. A great roof top pool bar add to the fun, and a great on site restaurant all add to the modern fresh luxury. The hotel service was excellent, a real delight to stay here.",5,2016,07,26
22,Nice atmosphere ,"The first thing who comes to mind is the kindness of every single one members of staff. The check-in process, the warm welcome, and the smiling friendly face of everyone making eye contact. 

We had the 704 junior suite. This hotel is of recent build, very good quality material. Nicely decorated and good acoustic proofing. The bed was absolutely perfect. The bathroom is partially opened towards the room. A separate shower room in the back. 

It was pristine clean. Very discrete and efficient room staff. We had 3 shirts ironed 25 min after our call. 

The breakfast is comparable to the other high end hotels around but again the staff makes a difference. Andrea, Pablo and Dave made our stay a very good souvenir. 

The rooftop got a nice pool, not a big one but enough to spend an afternoon relaxing on your first day. 

This hotel will be our Barcelona base from now on ! ",5,2016,07,25

22,Best hotel staff I've ever seen,"My wife and I recently stayed several days at the Ohla Eixample for a business/tourist combination trip.  The Ohla Eixample is the single most enjoyable hotel I've ever stayed in and it's largely due to one factor:  the staff.  Every member of the staff--from the front desk, to the restaurant and bar, to the pool, to the concierge--is absolutely fantastic.  They are friendly.  They are helpful.  They are knowledgeable.  I simply can't say enough positive things about the staff. They are what every first rate hotel staff should strive to be.  Of course, the hotel itself is wonderful as well.  Good location.  The pool is a nice play to relax at the end of the day.  The room is well appointed and very functional.  And the breakfast has a good variety of food.  Overall, this is very nearly a perfect hotel.  I would recommend anyone looking for a Barcelona hotel to stay here.",5,2016,07,18
22,"Superb boutique hotel in an amazingly central, yet quiet location","When thinking of Barcelona, think of the Rambla Avenue - the most important central street with many tourists. Why is this hotel great - it's located just one block off Rambla de Catalunya - you can enjoy the quietness and yet be only within 5 minutes from most important sites. Additional two supermarkets nearby will for sure help you.

The hotel itself is very properly arranged - the spaces are discreet to one another, the swimming pool on the rooftop will certainly add to your travel portfolio. The design is very contemporary both in rooms and main areas.

The staff is extremely helpful - especially Federico and Alba at the concierge desk - will help you make most of your trip.

In one sentence: It's a stylish boutique hotel located one block from Rambla and enjoys the quietness, while being close to everything.",5,2016,07,18
22,Very nice hotel ,"Had a great stay. There hotel was very modern. Breakfast was very good. The best part was the roof top pool.

22,Exemplary Hotel !!!,"Ohla Eixample... I am in awwww with this hotel and its service quality.
I visited Barcelona in June which is supposedly a heavy touristic month.
One would clearly notice the usual service quality going down in the biggest of the places when they have higher volumes of guests coming in.
But this hotel deserves all the applauses for maintaining the best Service standards that can be offered in the industry.
The stand out point is ""Personalised"" touch given to each and every thing that they offer.
Whether it's calling for a Taxi or guiding you to the city , whether it's room service/maintenance or the quality of sanitary items !!  

Staff is extremely friendly and fluent in English. Each individual go out of the way to help at any hour of the day.
My room was spacious enough for us to spend 4 quality days .

Hotel's location is great with all the right connectivity to public transport and walkable distances to cities main attractions. 

Taxis are available even late nights .Carry the hotel's card in your pocket all the time for providing reference to cab drivers but that is what we do for every hotel we visit.

I recommend this otel to anyone visiting Barcelona with a Big Thumbs Up!!",5,2016,07,11
22,What a pleasure!!,"My family stayed for 3 days before departing for a cruise. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with smiling faces, kindness and recommendations for restaurants and events around the city. The rooms were beautifully maintained, the restaurant outstanding and what a view from the pool! Will definitely return!",5,2016,07,10
22,"Amazing stay, totally perfect","We spent three nights at the Ohla Eixample & our stay at this hotel made the holiday. On arriving we were told we had been upgraded & were shown to our room - which was beautiful. We were mostly impressed by the decor & design of the room as well as the hotel itself. The bed made for a fantastic nights sleep & the aircon, lighting options & sound system in our room were a great feature. 
The staff were helpful, room service was not to be faulted & the pool on the terrace was possibly the best feature.
Amazing tranquil stay & we will be returning!",5,2016,07,10
22,"Very good, but not excellent","First thing to be aware of is that there are 2 Ohla hotels, in totally different locations - which isn't very clear online.
""Good"" but not ""Excellent"" rating due to some of the staff, who weren't as switched on as you'd expect. Tea delivered to our room was cold, breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was luke warm so we ordered eggs 3 times which finally arrived 45 minutes later.
Suggest the other / original Ohla could be a better choice in terms of location, better view from the rooftop pool (which on the website is from the original Ohla hotel).",4,2016,07,06
22,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Very impressive hotel rooms, loved the ambiance in the hallways and rooms. Very modern rooms with mood light settings and air conditioning. The staff were very helpful, providing local tips and hints to avoid the usual tourist traps and really get to experience the best of the city. The rooftop bar is a nice small, intimate size with an infinity pool and soft seating. They had an amazing bartender who could make an amazing cocktail based on only your preferences for tastes. I would highly recommend this hotel for those who don't mind spending a few extra euros per night.",5,2016,07,05
22,Fantastic hotel in an amazing city!,"We spent three nights at this hotel and had a fantastic stay. We arrived late on a Friday night and reception staff was extremely helpful. Hotel had also arranged for a bottle of cava in our room to celebrate a birthday - we drank that beside the stunning rooftop pool. Rooms were modern, bright and airy and well planned out (bed is extremely comfortable and you can choose from a range of scents for your pillows). The shower was wonderful and had the quirk of having a window into the main bedroom (something to consider if you are travelling with a friend and not a partner).

Concierge and ""Experience"" staff was extremely helpful both at the hotel and before we even arrived. They arranged tickets for attractions, gave great restaurant suggestions and arranged for taxis etc. whenever needed. The location was also great, very close to the designer shops of the Paseig de Gracia and very close to Diagonal metro station.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again!",5,2016,06,30
22,Great new hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"This is a new hotel by the Ohla group, who I was already a big fan of. The location is excellent, on Corsega street, right in the center of the city and so close to everything you'd want to do and see. The rooms were perfect, so comfortable and nicely designed. The staff...really amazing staff - so helpful, polite, genuine and pay great attention to detail. They have a charming rooftop pool and bar. If you're a fan of Bloody Mary's have Nuria make one for you. Best BM I've had in a long time. I've been visiting Barcelona since 2004 and this was one of my best stays thanks to the hotel experience. I highly recommend Ohla Eixample and I will definitely be staying there on my next trip.",5,2016,06,27
22,Our first trip to barcelona and we werent disappointed,"The Ohla Hotel was the perfect location to explore Barcelona and surrounds. Walking distance to shops, restaurants and bars. Even close to one of the city tour bus stops. Fantastic hotel. Everything you could want from a city hotel. Superb comfort, friendly attentive staff and a wonderful atmosphere. Such a comfy bed!! Loved every minute of our stay.",5,2016,06,27
22,"Brilliant hotel, fantastic location! ","We stayed four nights at ohla eixample and loved every minute. Hotel rooms and bathrooms are perfect-huge bed, tv and shower! The rooftop pool is a great place to relax. The staff are all very friendly and really helpful. The location is really good too loads of restaurants/bar/shops on your door step and close to metro station if you want to go further. Would defiantly go back to this hotel and would recommend this hotel to everyone. ",5,2016,06,26
22,Brand New Hotel,"Just back from staying at this hotel and we had such a great time. The hotel itself is very modern with friendly and helpful staff. They were all very approachable and even gave us a late check out room for 20 euros which I thought for a 5 star hotel was very reasonable. 
Perfect central location and the area itself is very upmarket with wonderful restaurants on the streets only a few minutes walk away. The nearest metro station less than 5 minutes walk and  La Ramblas about 15 minutes. Supermarket a few yards away where you can pick up bottle water for around 25cents, very convenient on the hot summer days. 

Small area of development for me would be the Breakfast. Be nice if they had a fully menu to see what all the options are. 

Highly recommended hotel",5,2016,06,26
22,Beautiful brand new hotel,"We had a great stay at Ohla Example.  Very good size room, very comfortable bed, and nice modern decor.  Service was great from front desk, concierge, housekeeping, restaurant and bar.  Breakfast was delicious.  Location is perfect -- upscale part of Barcelona and away from the crowd.",5,2016,06,24
22,Beautiful hotel with a few flaws,"The staff are very welcoming and helpful. We stayed in a basic room which was quite small and very noisy. I think the hotel have gone for style over insulation. We could hear the metro vibrating, doors banging day and night, people having a shower upstairs and  it sounded like they were moving furniture. There was only one bedside cabinet and the other side of the bed had a tiny table. The glass screen between the shower and bedroom had a large crack in it.  You expect more from a five star hotel. There are various setting on the lights for us the relax setting was somewhat bright and we feel needs adjusting. Not enough coffee, tea or milk just 2 of each for 2 people!

The good things about the hotel are the bathroom the shower was amazing, the bath towels are so big and fluffy and the bath products are lovely.  The black out blinds are very effective so if you plan to be somewhere early set your alarm.  The hotel is very clean.  There is a good mini bar and choice of snacks in your room if you wish to pay for them. A nice extra touch is the turn down service in the evening where they leave a chocolate on your pillow. We loved the rooftop terrace the views are great, the bar staff are lovely,  the pool is small but we always managed to find a spot to relax in the afternoon. Concierge was very helpful in terms of giving ideas on where to eat he asks what food you like then makes his recommendations he could make reservations for us but we chose not to do this but he wasn't pushy. We would recommend this hotel and would visit again ",4,2016,06,23
22,Lovely stay in Lovely hotel,"Just back from staying at this hotel and wanted to say a few things.  The hotel itself is lovely, clean, spacious and with the most wonderful friendly and helpful staff.  They were all very approachable, from reception, to the girls on the Sky bar nothing was too much trouble - Thank you.
Hotel is perfect central location with a straight 7 min walk to La Ramblas, although more like a 40 min walk if you stroll and take in all the amazing shops, architecture and cafe's along the way.  Supermarket a few yards away, very convenient..  Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,23
22,"We had a nice stay at this very good, but not quite 5* hotel","Overall, my wife and I enjoyed our 5-night stay here in a Jr. Suite on the 7th floor and rated it 5 out of 5 despite many disappointments.  It's well priced for what you get relative to other hotel offerings, but it’s more of a 4* hotel with 5* service, dinner restaurant and bar prices.  

Delights:
-	Room: Nice and big, with very comfortable king-sized bed.  The furniture is OK (IKEA looking).  
-	Location: The hotel is in a quiet spot and no more than a 30 minute walk from almost everything.  Plenty of restaurants, convenience stores and shopping near by.
-	Service: Very friendly and attentive staff.  Mark at breakfast deserves special mention.
-	XERTA Restaurant: Dined here one night and the food and service were pricey but excellent, and they throw in a few unexpected freebies that made the bill more palatable.
-	Pool: Very nice relaxing setup.  

Disappointments:
-	Breakfast: The spread was reasonable but no 5* and it remained exactly the same all 5 days, except for a possible small change in juice, fruits and pastries.  It lacked your typical breakfast smoked fish and just had poor looking canned tuna.  It lacked waffles or pancakes, despite their presence on the room service menu.  It lacked porridge or oatmeal.  And then the “HOT” items were always cold to lukewarm, especially the baked beans.  The scramble eggs appeared very processed and inedible, so special order your eggs.
-	Pool: You may not be able to get much use of the beautiful pool area.  As to be expected at a boutique hotel, the pool is small with limited seating.  To make matters worse, the hotel closes the pool most evenings at 6:30 or 7:00pm (despite a 9:30pm sunset) for use of the bar by the public.  Management limiting my amenities for regular public use, while reducing the security of the building does not sit well with me.
-	Turn Down Service: We were tired on our first day and decided to deadbolt lock door and take a nap before dinner.  Ignored the first knock.  Sometime later, went to the door and said ‘No Thank You” to the second knock.  Sometime later, went to the door to the third knock and just accepted the turndown chocolates.  Made a special request at the front desk for no future turn-down service or mini-bar service during our stay which somehow did not get processed.  So we had more knocking and even a phone call from the front desk asking about turn-down service.  
-	Sounds: Because of the limited sound dampening materials, the sounds of doors closing, housekeeping knocking on doors, cleaning and moving furniture really carries.
-	Toilet: The toilet in the room is like a very private stall in a public bathroom and for some will be claustrophobic.  Pictures/mirrors may help.
-	Bar: Decided to relax in the lobby on our way to the room after a long day and my wife ordered a virgin Pina Colada thinking even here it would be 10 Euro at the most.  Try 16 Euro and it wasn't very good.  Wow!

Tips:
•	To get a hot shower, you have to depress the button under the shower water temperature knob in order to move the knob counter-clockwise past the mid/warm setting
•	Set your alarm: The blinds are very effective and you will likely sleep later than planned
•	Leave your “Do Not Disturb” sign on your door except for when you need service
•	Special order omelet/eggs at breakfast rather than eat the scrambled eggs",5,2016,06,16
22,"New, stylish - and wonderfully relaxed","We had a four-day weekend planned to re-discover Barcelona, and the Ohla Eixample hotel was to be our home-base. The hotel had just opened its doors, and I could not have been more pleased with our choice. First: the location is great, a few steps from Metro Diagonal and the upper end of the Ramblas, the neighborhood offers a vast choice of restaurants and it feels central, yet not overly hectic or noisy.
We had booked a junior suite, and it turned out to be a nice, spacious, clean, and comfortable room. The furniture looks simple, but it is very comfortable and made from high-quality materials - and most importantly: the bed is great. 
There is a lot of thought that went into the deceptively simple-looking choice of materials for floor, furniture, and tiles: it creates a nice flow from area to area within the room.
The junior suite has a large ""rainforest"" shower, and a separate bathtub. Oh, and the towels are amongst the fluffiest and softest I ever had during my travels (!).
Light switches aren't just ""on"" or ""off"" but you can chose between several settings. Bathroom products are awesome, and you can chose additional items from a list.
Since the Ohla Eixample just opened, there were minor things that we brought to the attention of the hotel:
- The open shower really floods a vast area of the bathroom floor
- The ""Night"" setting for the lights is still quite bright

The rooftop pool was a great spot to relax on the first day, after having walked around for several hours - it was wonderfully relaxing to simply lay poolside and sip a drink.
Staff was present, friendly, and readily available to help. A special mention should go to the concierge, who really made our trip memorable - and who got us tables wherever we wanted to eat, but not just by pushing standard staples, but by finding out what we liked and making thought-through and smart recommendations.

Would I stay there again: absolutely YES, and with pleasure.",5,2016,06,15
22,Birthday weekend ,"This was the perfect place to spend a 4 day birthday weekend for my husband. We stayed a in a junior suite which was a wonderful room. All the staff were helpful and terrific and made our stay comfortable, fun and effortless. The neighborhood is perfect, and the hotel is well located to see the Gaudi highlights and really walk all of Barcelona. The rooftop pool and bar are lovely. The gym is not completed, but my husband loved the 5 floor complementary gym he was able to access. 

I can't imagine a better place to stay, and I can't wait to return.",5,2016,06,13
22,very good acommodation,"i stayed for 4 nights and everything was fine , kind and helpful staff. For me the great advantage was location , near the tube station , a lots of good restauratnts nearby , very ease to start visiting Barcelona every day.Everything was clean, the breakfast looked  good(i m eating breakfast very seldom,and i didn t eat here ), the coffee was good",5,2016,06,13
22,Perfect stay,"Staying at Ohla Eixample has been a dream from the beginning to the end with polite and efficient staff, beautiful rooms and furnitures and always a small attention/surprise. Breakfast buffet is qualitative and the rooftop is just amazing. ",5,2016,06,11
22,Brilliant,"Stayed at the Ohla Eixample for four nights / five days and had an excellent time.
I booked the Junior Suite and it is probably the biggest room I have every stayed in. The walk-in shower was amazing and it had the biggest bed I have every slept in! Breakfast was very good and the juices were very fresh. Staff were more than helpful and the concierge / reception are the best around helping us with restaurant bookings and advising us on attractions. The rooftop bar / pool is nice a relaxing during the day and great for topping up your tan.
I was quite nervous booking this hotel as it is very new but I am very happy I did and had a wonderful stay!
A few improvements could be made on the breakfast though with personally more choices but still very good!
A coffee machine would be handy in the room too!",5,2016,06,09
22,New and nice,"If you're travelling into Barcelona by train, this hotel is really easy to get to. Take the L5 metro line three stops towards Vall d'Hebron, get off at Diagonal, exit station on Balmes, it's 100m up street. It's located in a modern part of the city that is busy but we didn't notice too much noise, 5th floor, just the usual city day traffic noise. There a number of eating places around and plenty of supermarkets. Shops are top €€ end. Wonderful staff, really nice and helpful. The hotel is new, so the gym isn't finished but we got to use one up the road, they even offered a taxi ride to get us there, but it's less than 10mins walk away, an ideal warmup. The top floor has a pool, comfy loungers, but there is NO SHADE. Not even an umbrella (wind issues?).
Our standard room was a good size. It had a huge bed which was a little hard for me, but I am Goldilocks when it comes to beds! The linen was gorgeous though. The bath towels were the largest I've ever had, awesome. The internet speed was very fast. Don't book one of these rooms if you're travelling with your Aunty! The shower is open viewing. Love the lighting, especially the different settings by the bed, top job! Night bed turn down, excellent.
TV (huge) had 120 channels but very little sport so missed Roland Garros, shame.
Breakfast was pretty good, what I consider a business hotel breakfast, sufficiently filling. They make you a real coffee which seems to take ages if they're busy, but tastes nice, so worth the wait. We had issues two out of three mornings with breakfast. The first morning we didn't get an omelette we ordered despite asking twice for it. They apologised. The next morning was very busy and they had insufficient staff numbers to cope and new staff who moved at snail pace when clearing tables and taking orders. The last morning we went down early 8am and as it wasn't busy we were treated like kings.
This hotel is close to the metro so getting anywhere in Barcelona is easy. It was expensive but pleasant and very boutique. Recommend at the right price.
",5,2016,06,08
22,Great Hotel; Near enough yet far away!,"Nice clean cut hotel with no fuss service.  Everything and everyone in the hotel is professional and know their jobs.  Overall I was a wee bit disappointed with Barcelona as a city, the impression I got of the entire city was as if it was set up to be a huge tourist trap.  This hotel though was a great choice close enough to crappy Las Ramblas and the awesome Sagrada Familia yet in a quieter more residential part of town.  A big bonus was the Michelin starred restaurant where we enjoyed a superb dinner.

Their concierge knew his stuff and got us place at the ever popular Butafiero restaurant in nearby Gracias a nice neighborhood a bit further away from Las Ramblas which I hated.  The room was a nice large size though the bathroom design was a bit impractical and too much space was wasted.  The complimentary Champagne breakfast is a nice touch. Loved their rooftop pool and overall the service at the hotel was outstanding.  I strongly recommend this hotel when you visit Barcelona.",4,2016,06,06
22,All round good experience ,"Stayed 3 nights beginning of June. Swift & efficient check in by friendly staff late at night. Once in the room didn't have enough hangers and no iron but one phone call down to reception this was rectified within 5 mins. 

One night we could not get cold water but staff did supply us with bottled water and the next morning the problem was resolved. House keeping left us a bottle of bubbly in room with a letter of apology which was a nice touch. 

Roof terrace very nice and not very busy when we were there so  nice area to relax and catch a few rays. 

Can't comment on breakfast/dinner as we ate out at other restaurants in the evening. We thought the price of breakfast (€36 per person) was over priced. 

Overall good experience and would return next time I visit the city. ",5,2016,06,06
22,Excellent customer service,"From the moment our taxi arrived until the morning we left all of the staff were so friendly and accommodating, they would do anything to help! Rooms quite big and as pictured on the website. Lovely beds I could of slept for a week! I would def stay again if I was back in Barcelona ",5,2016,06,06
22,5 Star Hotel with Great Staff,"Spent 3 nights on a quick vacation and we could not ask for a better hotel. Beautiful rooms and amenities, extremely friendly and helpful staff (including great concierge), and good location for most of the city attractions, restaurants, etc. 5 Stars well deserved.",5,2016,06,05
22,Lovely! ,"It was the 4th week it had been open, but it was lovely. Staff falling over themselves to help, rooms spotless and really clean and well laid out! Plenty of storage, and the most comfortable bed and gorgeous bed linen! 
Shower was to die for and products smelt great and full of all you needed. The lighting and plugs were great. Only thing I disliked was not being able to open the doors! A little frustrating and unnessacary. 
Breakfast needs to be looked at though. No one really knew what was going on and things took ages to come to you. Very basic and uninspiring choices on the buffet for a 5* hotel. No menus given for extras, and I'm sure eggs were offered but we weren't told. Really things made to order for the price of the hotel must be factored in. Toaster kept jamming, so I gave up with it on our second morning. It was ok though as a glass of fizz helped to get over it. 
The pool was stunning and really was relaxing. The bar wasn't open for a while and seemed to unmanned at times. I'm sure with time it will get better, maybe more loungers too, as 8 really won't be enough in the height of the season. It was so quiet when we went up we didn't mind though. It was very comfy! 
Because it was so new, we let a few things go, but hope if we return or send friends to you, it would have sorted itself out! ",5,2016,06,05
22,Amazing hotel,"I visit the hotel with my wife for 2 nights, the service of the staff was great from the second we entered the hotel.
The room is new and well equipped.
The food is very good but above all the staff and the service.
Very very recommended.
Very good neighborhood close to everything.",5,2016,06,04
22,Fantastic New Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and had a wonderful time.  The hotel is very modern and sleek in design and absolutely spotless.  Our room was spacious with very comfortable bed and pillows, walk-in shower, good tea and coffee making facilities and large flat screen TVs, again very sleek modern design.  In a great location for us away from the hustle bustle but in walking distance to everything we needed and all the main sights and attractions.  The roof top area was fabulous, great bar and seating area along with a cool pool area - perfect place for a pre-dinner drink.  All the staff we encountered on our visit from front desk, bar staff, porters and cleaners were very professional and friendly and always had time to say hello and assist us if needed.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on my next visit to Barcelona - Highly recommend!",5,2016,05,31
22,"Beautiful, Comfortable, Great Location","After two weeks of cycle touring in the Costa Brava region my wife and I decided to splurge and stay here (we got one of 4 rooms with the outdoor patio). The rooms are clean, comfortable and very luxurious. The best of all were the concierge service. They pointed us in all the right directions and helped arrange bus tours, museum tours, restaurants, etc. The only complaint I would have is the expense - we paid 150 Euros for a wee bit of laundry and drinks were very expensive. Overall, wonderful.",4,2016,05,31
22,Muy Bueno,"Stayed here for an extended long weekend and was not sure what to expect based on the fact that it was only a month old. The hotel's location is great, away from most touristy areas yet very convenient to get around the city. The staff were very professional and helpful. After the first night, I requested for a different pillow type and a mattress topper and it was all in place upon my return at the end of the day. The room is clean and well equipped (I would recommend placing a Nespresso or a french press, rather than just a Nescafe instant) and as mentioned by others, there are some quirks in the room layout (i.e. the sink right by the front door and the peek-a-boo shower, which seems to be common in many hotels in this city). They also provide an evening turn down service. There are still some growing pains, given the newness of the hotel, like one time they forgot to replace the hand towels (but was quickly replaced when I requested for it). One could hear the rumbling of the metro, but it is not a big deal. I requested for a quiet room away from the elevators and it was generally quiet. But because of the design and materials used in the hallways, there is an echo when doors are opened or shut. In addition, due to the concrete floors in the room, one can hear the footsteps and moving of chairs (and cleaning) of the room above.",4,2016,05,29
22,"sweet hotel, very nice staff","The staff was very helpful, helped us checking in early and took care of our luggage 
between our checkout and our flight which was very accomodating. Their location is very nice, central but quiet and they had a very nice atmosphere in the lobby.",5,2016,05,29
22,Truly Excellent,"We usually select 4-star boutique hotels but this latest addition to the Ohla group was tempting, mainly because of its price and location. The hotel is indeed beautiful and right up the Rambla de Catalunya, away from the hustle and bustle of this busy street.
Despite its 5 stars, it truly feels like a boutique hotel, with its cool personalized design, the warm friendly staff and the attention to detail. We were also pleasantly surprised upon our arrival to discover that we had been upgraded to a junior suite! The room was indeed large and beautiful and so is the bathroom, with its open shower and bathtub separated from the rest of the room by a transparent glass wall. Although beauty does not always rhyme with functionality, we loved our stay. The lack of functionality is mainly due to the fact that if one person needs to take a shower while the other is asleep, there is no way except to put the lights on and light the bedroom (although there are a few options for day, night, intermediate lighting). The same thing applies to the double sinks, which are part of the main bedroom. The towels are huge and beautiful, the bed has too many pillows (can't just fall asleep, need to remove at least some of them to be truly comfortable). All in all, though, it really is a great hotel and I would definitely recommend it",5,2016,05,27
22,Getting there,"Modern property in a good location. Not sure if I would go back. Not because they were bad - just because I'm sure I can get better for that price. 

Pros: amazingly nice staff, very helpful with recommendations and if you need help - they'll go out of their way to support. 
Location is amazing, rooms are very clean and the pool is small but cute. 

Cons: room service got every single order wrong. They tried to make it up (they were very nice about it) but they got it wrong again. So I gave up on complaining. 

Depends on your priority really if you want to stay here or not. ",4,2016,05,23
22,A new star is born. ,"We recently had the pleasure of visiting this new hotel in Barcelona, and was amazed by the hospitality of the staff from the very second we stepped out of the cab. So serviceminded and helpfull making our stay very pleasant. 
The new hotel is located in a great area packed with cozy restaurants and shops some og which you'll find in the Barcelona Traveller book located in your room. Hence if you're a techie, do yourself a favor and "" read the manual"", allowing you time and opportunity to enjoying the tapas and Michelin recommended restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel. 
My girlfriend is a light sleeper, and the nearby subway apparently disturbed her beauty sleep the first night, leaving me in complete bliss in the comfy bed. The next morning post our breakfeast feast, she aired her concern at the reception, and before I even realized what had happened, we found ourselves complimentary upgraded in a junior suite on the 7th floor close to the rooftop pool area. 
We love this place and it's ambience with the everso friendly staff. 
Go see for yourself. ",4,2016,05,21
22,Great new hotel,Brand new hotel in a nice location. Very helpful staff. Great service. Good breakfast. Nice rooftop area with pool. Bluetooth in the room enabled music from my iphone. Very modern decor. Would stay again...,5,2016,05,17
22,Excellent new hotel,"My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 3 days in May. We booked for the junior suite. The hotel was new and in perfect location, close to restaurants and shops. The room was spacious, with modern design and big windows. But the best part was the service! The staffs were very attentive and professional, which what five star hotel should be. The first room that we had didn't have the sheer curtain which could be a little uncomfortable during sunny day if you want to leave your window uncovered to have the view. However, upon request we were given another room which was excellent. The best rooms were those facing the main street. The hotel also gave us 5 hours of late check out without charge while we were waiting for our flight. We definitely recommend this hotel and will be happy to stay here again whenever we return to Barcelona. ",5,2016,05,12
22,"Nice potential, but not quite there... Yet....","We were there the 1st week, and naturally were expecting some teething problems, and we got them.
In advance we were made aware that the restaurant and roof-top bar would not be up and running, but one unexpected disappointment was that parking was not available in-house. 
Location: Very central, particularly for shopping. 
Service: The staff do try hard, but service is haphazardous, spotty and partly absent-minded, particularly at breakfast.
Standard: IMHO it will be a while before it approaches a 5* level. Interesting deisgn in the common rooms and bedrooms, but the finishing is half-hearted; paint not applied properly, lack of certain in-room amenities, fixtures not affixed properly etc.. Having a simple Nescafe instant coffee as an inhouse amenity only belongs in a 3* UK facility. I do believe that it'll take a lot of continous maintenance to keep the rooms looking sharp. 
Breakfast: Orders were forgotten, omelettes never arrived, the cook literally could not handle more than one task at a time and just stood there nursing the eggs. Coffee was cold and orders mixed up. Poor selection (as mentioned above), but cudos for having ""pa' de Cristal""! THAT made it bearable for our pa' tomaquet. 
Rooftop area: Great potential once it's established and will become a strong selling-point. 
Had a look at the restaurant's menu, and it looks promising, and great wine-selection, but ah so pricey.. 
We had some minor problems with our particular room that were an one-off and these were proactively solved by the Manager in a professional manner. 
Will I be back? I DO have another booking within the next month, but am still contemplating honoring or cancelling it. Lots will have to change....",3,2016,05,11
22,"Nice hotel, hardly five star value","This newly opened five-star hotel has a good location, a short walk to the city centre nice rooms with lovely modern minimalist interiors. The staff was very nice and professional and always helpful. The only extravagant item in the room was a water boiler with 2 sachets with Nescafe and 4 tea-bags. It was not possible to lock the sliding door towards the terrace (even after noticing the staff). The breakfast was very modest, not much to choose from. Al in all a nice hotel, but hardly good value for money.",3,2016,05,05
22,Experience,"Where to start… 

The personal - the family of people who let you feel at home,
Take care of the experience
The bits and bytes of your trip, smile and try to overlook what you need in every second.. amazing!

The way of professional crew of 5 stars hotel should look like :)!

From the rooms, to the scents, the lightings, the bar, the top floor with the pool at night

The people that make sure you have a nice trip and sending great recommendations 

The atmosphere and the chemistry between them is great and help them to induce the warm feeling on you.

They all share the same thing – how to enrich our journey and make an amazing experience

Thank you guys!! You made us really happy and we will see you again
All the Best!

22,Excellent,"We have stayed in the hotel on the first week of its opening. Of course there were some ""teething"" problems. But the place looks great, it's a design hotel if you can appreciate the style, and it has all the potential to become a reference point in Barcelona.
The staff is wonderful from a very helpful consierge to a very keen dinner waiter.
We had lunch on our first evening. The kitchen was open although we were definitely the only ones around. Nevertheless they served us excellent food - really high quality - and with a smile. The rooms are comfortable, although particular in design ( layout). It is a five star hotel and very soon it will become a five star plus hotel, if the team keeps up,the good work.",5,2016,04,29
22,To be improved,"In August my wife and I stayed two days in this property which has the great advantage of being in a beautiful and quiet semi-central area of the city, from which you can reach the center in a 15/20 minute walk.
Upon arrival the receptionist a bit 'too hasty on explanations, nothing has illustrated the city but thought well to make us pay in advance the tourist tax that is usually paid at check out.
The small room on the second floor did not fully satisfy us: the shower and tub practically exposed without any respect for privacy; tiny balcony with two chair and table (cute I would say) but overlooking a technical room (perhaps engine room of the air conditioners) that despite the window closed at night emitted noise that disturbed sleep; good breakfast but not up to a 5 star. Architecturally the hotel did not satisfy me (but they are personal tastes) as the common areas (even the breakfast room and lobby) very dark and cramped. Appreciable the complimentary fresh water in the room.",3,2024,09,07
22,Definitely not 5*****,"I had booked 2 double rooms. BOTH smelled musty, the windows couldn't be opened (for whatever reason they build something like that). The hotel is a 4 star hotel, but actually only 3. There are better located, cheaper hotels. I cannot recommend this one. I don't even know where all the good reviews come from. The hotel does not reflect that in any way.",1,2024,05,21
22,Centrally located top hotel,The room was very nice and spacious with a simple and tasteful design. The two restaurants are good. The food in the Japanese restaurant is top. The service and reception staff are extremely friendly and competent.,5,2024,03,22
22,Charming details,"I didn't love the upgrade and the detail they had in leaving a congratulatory note because it celebrated my anniversary. Very good breakfast, spacious room with complimentary water, coffee and tea, comfortable bed and pillows and very friendly and attentive staff. Highly recommended.",5,2024,03,18
22,"Location, comfort, service and excellent breakfast.","The hotel is very nice and pleasant. The spacious room, the very comfortable bed, soft pillows and ideal for a good night's sleep. One of the highest quality breakfasts I have ever tried and the distribution of sweet and savory foods in different spaces (there is a space where there is only cheese), makes it fabulous to be able to choose what you want. Super friendly staff.",5,2024,03,11
22,Excellent.,"A very pleasant experience, the room, the beds, the location, the staff, we liked everything. The breakfast is spectacular, and for lunch there are 2 Michelin star restaurants, one Japanese and the other with Mediterranean cuisine. We ate at the Mediterranean cuisine restaurant, Xerta, which we really liked.
In conclusion, recommended.",5,2024,01,31
22,Unforgettable,"We went on the recommendation of a friend and it was wonderful. The staff was very attentive, a girl at reception with a very nice long ponytail helped us and gave us very good advice about Barcelona. The room very clean and comfortable. 100% recommendable.",5,2023,11,28
22,Excelencia estuve alojada en el de la calle Córcega 289,"Todo me pareció súper la habitación minimalista todos los detalles cuentan en ese hotel. Tiene Parking y fue gratuito. Destacó la atención del personal y tiene un restaurante Japonés con estrella Michelin, Hotel 5 estrellas esta en el barrio L’ Esquerra , cerca de todo",5,2023,06,27
22,Weekend a Barcelona,"Fine settimana di relax. hotel accogliente e personale disponibile e super gentile 
Plus la colazione, piatti cucinati al momento. Piscina con vista sulla città e acqua calda. Incantevole poter fare aperitivo ammirando il tramonto su Barcelona",5,2023,04,03
22,Maravilloso,"El hotel tiene un personal con un trato impecable. 

El diseño es moderno y mínimalista.

La habitación es muy comfortable.

La comida es muy buena (el desayuno perfecto y la comida/cena tienes un restaurante con 1* Michelin dentro del hotel).

La localización es perfecta.",5,2023,03,21
22,Una opción muy buena para visitar Barcelona,"La experiencia fantástica. El personal del hotel magnífico, amables y atentos , sin excepción. Las habitaciones modernas y silenciosas. El gym y la piscina muy bueno. Todo cerca del centro de Barcelona pero sin el agobia del centro. La sala de reuniones principal estupenda, buena luz y ambiente. Volveré seguro",5,2023,02,08
22,Lindo y bien ubicado,Muy buena ubicación en un barrio comercial muy entretenido de caminar. Los recepcionistas son eficientes y atentos. La cama es buena y cómoda. Lastima que nos asignaron una habitación un poco extraña que tenía unos pilares al medio que rompían un poco la visual.,4,2023,01,07
22,Perfecto,"La estancia de fin de semana  fue perfecta, el trato de todo el personal impecable, y con varios detalles  que tuvieron con nosotros, que son de agradecer.
Si volvemos a Barcelona repetiremos , sin dudarlo.",5,2022,11,28
22,Cómodo y céntrico,"Hotel moderno y pequeño” en pleno eixample muy bien ubicado, trato agradable y cercano.
Parking propio (de pago).
Bonita terraza en el último piso con piscina climatizada (descubierta).
Habitación amplia, funcional y cómoda (Junior suite). 
Cama cómoda y sábanas de calidad. Una lástima que no nos subieran el cava y fresas que supuestamente incluye las Junior suites y suites.
En ese aspecto; se echan en falta detalles de un 5* (minibar con agua únicamente; amenities justos…), teniendo en cuenta el precio medio de la habitación.
Desayuno muy recomendable, zumo natural, café de calidad y productos de primera con cocina al momento.
Una buena opción en el centro de Barcelona!",4,2022,10,31
22,Erholsamer Aufenthalt,"Wir wurden vor Ort sehr nett und höflich von Valentina empfangen. Vielen Dank für das Upgrade und den tollen Service vom gesamten Personal! 
Das Frühstück war sehr lecker. 
Wir hatten eine schöne Zeit und freuen uns auf den nächsten Aufenthalt!",5,2022,09,28
22,Excelente hotel,"El hotel es moderno, acogedor, hermoso. Los servicios estupendos. La habitación amplia, las camas super cómodas. La limpieza impecable. Destaco la excelente atención del personal, todos muy amables y serviciales. La piscina es grande y la terraza excelente. Volveremos.",5,2022,08,10

22,Experiencia inolvidable en el Ohla Hotel Eixample!!,"Nuestra estancia en este hotel ha sido toda una experiencia. 
La ubicación es ideal. 
El servicio es maravilloso, sobre todo, el de la recepción y el del restaurante para el desayuno.
La piscina es un plus extraordinario, sobre todo, en verano.
Los alimentos del desayuno, calidad suprema.
Todo ha ido genial! 10 sobre 10 👏🏻👏🏻",5,2022,08,07
22,Tolles City Hotel in Barcelona,"Das Hotel liegt im Stadtteil Eixample. Die Lage ist super zentral und man erreicht alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in kürze mit der U-Bahn. Es ist ein super schönes entspanntes Viertel mit hübschen Geschäften die alle nicht so überlaufen sind wie die an der La Rambla. Das Hotel ist bis jetzt das beste an Serviceleistung was ich je gesehen habe. Die Mitarbeiter sind super freundlichen und versuchen einem jeden Wunsch zu erfüllen. Wir kamen bereits vor 10:00 im Hotel an da unser Flug umgebucht wurde, dies teilten wir vorher mit und es war tatsächlich möglich das wir gleich in das Zimmer durften. Das Zimmer war schön ruhig in der 8. Etage gelegen und obwohl am letzten Abend ein DJ an der Poolbar auflegte hörten wir keinen Ton. Das Zimmer war schön ausgestattet mit einem tollen Balkon und es gab jeden Tag morgens und abends 2 gratis Wasserflaschen was einem das schleppen aus dem Supermarkt erspart. Die Auswahl am Frühstück war auch toll, vor allem das a la Carte Menü aus dem man wählen konnte. Alles in allem einfach gelungen. Wir waren bereits in einigen 5-Sterne Hotels aber in keinem fühlten wir uns bis jetzt so herzlich willkommen wie hier.",5,2022,07,23
22,Tolles Boutique Hotel,Tolles Boutique Hotel von dem aus viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreichbar sind. Das Rooftop Pool hat leider nur sehr wenige Liegen die meist schon seit dem frühen Morgen belegt sind. Erwähnenswert ist das ausgezeichnete Frühstück und die freundliche Bedienung.,5,2022,06,05
22,UN PARA REPETIR,"Estuve con mi hermano a principios de abril y cogimos dos habitaciones a cual más bonita y sobre todo cómodas y súper limpias, sin duda será mi hotel cuando viaje a Barcelona.No me quiero olvidar del servicio y del personal de recepción un 10 la verdad. El desayuno sin ser demasiado extenso pero todo de calidad.",5,2022,05,01
22,Muy buen hotel,"Elegimos este hotel para celebrar San Valentín. Personal muy agradable y atento. La habitación muy bonita, sin grandes decoraciones, una buena TV, minimalista pero con todo lo necesario, la bañera fantástica, la cama impresionante. Dormí genial!! Atendieron a las peticiones que les hicimos antes de llegar al hotel.
El desayuno super completo y los camareros correctos.
Estuvimos genial. Hotel recomendable 100% y un 5 estrellas como tiene que ser. 
Gracias por una gran estancia de San Valentín.",5,2022,02,15
22,Muy buena situación.,"Habitaciones espaciosas. 
Un hotel pequeño y acogedor estupendamente situado dentro de Barcelona, pero más en la línea de un hotel de 4 estrellas que uno de 5. El desayuno muy pobre (poca variedad y nada del otro mundo). El parking pequeño y difícil.
Por lo demás el servicio muy atento.y amable.",4,2021,11,01
22,"Excelente hotel, es como estar en casa!","La ubicación del hotel es perfecta para moverse por toda la ciudad 
Desde el momento del check in te hacen sentir como en casa, todos los integrantes del staff, recepción, bar, room service, fueron súper serviciales en todo momento!
La piscina es súper cool y tiene vista al mar! 
Lo súper recomiendo!",5,2021,09,11
22,Enttäuschung!,"Wir haben im August 2021 5 Tage ein Zimmer in diesem Hotel gebucht.
Die Vorfreude wurde uns allerdings gleich bei Ankunft genommen. Im Rahmen der Buchung hatten wir einen Tiefgaragenstellplatz für unser Auto gebucht, der bei Ankunft plötzlich doch nicht verfügbar war. Wir wurden in einer Nachbargarage geparkt. Auch unsere beiden - telefonisch angekündigten - Fahrräder fanden in der Garage keinen Platz und mussten anderweitig untergebracht werden. Die Flure des Hotels sind super dunkel und geschmacklos gestaltet. Gleiches gilt für die Zimmer. Minimalistisches Design ok, aber das ist wirklich traurig. Die Größte Enttäuschung war allerdings der Pool. Ganze 9 Liegen bietet das Hotel an, von denen 8 Stück ab dem frühen Morgen durch Hotelgäste via Handtuch reserviert waren. Geht gar nicht! Wenn man also die Absicht hatte, sich erst Nachmittags an den Pool zu legen sah es schlecht aus. Auch die Kulisse dort oben ist nicht vergleichbar mit den Bildern der Booking-Portale. Der Frühstücksbereich ist soweit ganz schön gestaltet und das Essen war ok. Allerdings mussten wir an 2 Tagen bis zu 15 min. auf einen freien Tisch warten. Zusammengefasst finde ich den Preis für dieses Hotel unverschämt und werde es nicht noch einmal buchen.",1,2021,08,23
22,Highlight Rooftop! Toller Aufenthalt!,"Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut. Der Rooftop-Pool ist ein echtes Highlight! 
Die Zimmer sind modern und die Ausstattung gehoben. Das Badezimmer ist ein echter Hingucker. Das Personal ist zuvorkommend und sehr hilfsbereit ( vor allem an der Rezeption). 
Die Preise für Getränke und für das Frühstück sind etwas überteuert. Bei dem Frühstück geht es leider auch etwas hektisch zu.

Wir hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt und können das Hotel weiterempfehlen.",4,2021,07,26
22,Maravilloso hotel en el centro de Barcelona,"Servicio excelente, tanto por el personal de recepción como el personal de restauración, super amables. Desayuno muy completo. Habitaciones muy limpias, la cama es comodísima y la ducha tiene efecto lluvia muy agradable. Si vienes en verano podrás disfrutar de la piscina del rooftop con servicio de cocktelería y vistas a toda Barcelona, a un lado verás Montjuic y al otro lado la Sagrada familia. Muy centrico, en pleno de Barcelona. Deseando volver pronto!",5,2021,07,18
22,Fantástico,"La habitación no estaba dispuesta tal y como ellos deseaban. Immediatamente, upgrade a suite junior, con botella de cava para dos. No pudimos disfrutar de la piscina ni el desayuno, pero nos preprararon un pícnic. Fue todo genial. Increible para volver a repetir!",5,2020,08,28
22,Muy buena experiencia,"Una noche en este espectacular hotel como regalo de mi 40 cumpleaños. Sitio acogedor, comodo, linpio y cuidado hasta el detalle.
Agradezco el trato tan amable de su personal, y el gran detalle que tuvieron con sus productos.
Sin duda 100%recomendable. 
Gracias!!",5,2020,02,02
22,Compleanno ben riuscito ,"Siamo state in questo albergo per festeggiare il compleanno della mia fidanzata. Abbiamo alloggiato in una Attic Room all’ottavo piano con un balcone spettacolare. 
Pulizia impeccabile e colazione al top! 
Piscina all’ultimo piano riscaldata.
Uniche pecche per essere un 5 stelle: il servizio del bar è molto lento mentre il check out è stato lungo e confusionario.
Se dovessimo passare di nuovo per Barcellona sicuramente torneremo.",4,2020,01,16
22,"Stilvolles modernes Boutique-Hotel mit gutem Service, zentral gelegen","Wir haben 1 Woche hier gewohnt und waren sehr zufrieden. Als 4-Sterne-Hotel würde das Ohla besser eingestuft sein, für 5 Sterne war einiges nicht perfekt genug und das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis auch nur bei dem gebuchten Sonderangebot o.k. 
Positives:
.die Einrichtung und die Zimmergröße, Doppelwaschbecken und große bodengleich begehbare Dusche
.das Frühstück - keine Massen, aber hohe Qualität und immer frisch nachgelegt vom Sekt über diverse Säfte, .Wurst, Käse, iberischen Schinken bis zu Gemüse, Körner Joghurt  und Obst sowie täglich 4 Brotsorten
.nachmittäglicher Zimmerservice mit Schokoladen-Betthupferl
. als Schnäppchen würden wir es sofort wieder buchen, zum vollen Preis wahrscheinlich  nicht
Negatives:
. wenigstens ein kleiner Teppich oder Bettvorleger wäre angenehmer gewesen als der wie polierter Beton wirkende Fußboden.
. für 5 Sterne fehlten Nähzeug, Schuhlöffel, Shoe-polish
. 8x das gleiche Frühstück bis auf den Wechsel zwischen Rührei und gebackenen Pilzen
. Am Weihnachtstag fiel der nachm. Zimmerservice aus (nicht so tragisch)
. der Service Auto wegfahren und bringen klappte nicht so gut. Dann auch noch eine Schramme am Auto.
. Die nachberechneten € 35 City tax waren vorher in keinem Angebot / Preis oder sonstwo aufgetaucht
",4,2020,01,06
22,Ottimo hotel,"Albergo felicemente collocato, molto comodo, e anche bello.
Un plus la piscina sul terrazzo e l'ottima colazione.
Da velocizzare il servizio a colazione: gentile, ma davvero troppo lento (motivo della quinta pallina).
Comunque, raccomandato.",4,2019,10,04
22,Empfehlenswertes City Hotel,"Ohla Eixample kann man guten Herzens empfehlen. Gut gestyltes und gepflegtes Boutique Hotel in sehr guter Stadtlage, ausnehmend freundliches Personal. Schöne und für BCN Verhältnisse große Zimmer (Juniorsuite) zum angemessenen Preis. Alles in allem und um es mit den Spanieren zu sagen: Perfecto!",4,2019,09,09
22,Impecable,"Servicio impecable. Super agradable piscina en azotea. Gran bar de tapas; todo muy muy bien.
Recomiendo escoger una suite como hicimos nosotros y dejarse aconsejar por el personal. No perderse el bañito en la piscina!!",4,2019,07,17
22,"El muy buen diseño y comodidades, son altamente superadas por la atención del personal.","Un hotel en zona jerarquizada rodeada de restaurantes, boutiques y algo tan apreciado como los negocios de cercanía barrial. Desde la farmacia a la rotisería. 
El hotel tiene un diseño moderno y confortable donde se visualiza ya desde el lobby.
Lo más interesante es que a medida que se ingresa al Bar de tapas, al restaurante, a la zona de desayuno, a retirar monopatines para recorrer la Ciudad, siempre va in crescendo la calidad.
En el room se facilita todo lo necesario a un hotel de categoría, percibiendo más que en otros lugares el diseño en beneficio del confort y no solo como una expresión distintiva.
El juego de luces que cada huésped puede comandar, está muy original y muy atractivo.
La ubicación de la bañera independiente de la  ducha y un espacio íntimo para el inodoro, demuestran otra característica poco común.
Al personal lo destaco por su amabilidad.
Desde saludar diariamente con la mejor gentlleza, orientar y aconsejar al visitante, que si no fuera por sus correctos uniformes, uno los confundiría con un familiar.
No destacaré los nombres de ellos, quienes provienen de varias nacionalidadees, porque no tengo su autorización, pero las recuerdo perfectamente.
Y esto no sucede, cuando uno viaja de hotel en hotel. 
Conclusión, es que ha existido una excelente captación y capacitación del mismo, por parte de la dirección del Hotel.
Claro que Barcelona está encantadora. En el Ohla Eixample, la encontrarás aún mejor.",5,2019,06,05
22,aceptable,Un hotel aceptable. Esperaba un poco más de esmero en los detalles y la limpieza por ser un hotel 5 estrellas. En relación calidad precio no lo recomendaría. Lo mejor es la ubicación y la amabilidad de los empleados. ,3,2019,05,07
22,Semana Santa activa,"Muy cómodo, personal muy atento, desayuno muy completo e instalaciones muy interesantes, buen ambiente y tranquilo. La piscina es lo mejor, vistas increíbles y con una temperatura ideal, porque estaba caliente como un jacuzzi mientras hacía frío fuera.",4,2019,04,25
22,5 stelle meritatissime,"Ci torno spesso per lavoro e sempre con grande piacere. sono tutti gentilissimi, l'hotel è pulitissimo, stanze grandi e moderne. nulla da dire in contrario. Dispone anche di un ottimo ristorante stellato.
Consigliatissimo",5,2019,04,18
22,Sehr schöner Aufenthalt im Ohla Eixample *****,"PRO
- Exzellenter Service im gesamten Hotel mit zuvorkommenden, freundlichen und mitdenkenden Mitarbeitern (nur das Team, welches für den Service beim Frühstück zuständig ist, sollte sich dies bezgl. verbessern).
- Wir hatten eine schöne, geräumige Junior Suite mit Dusche + Badewanne, zwei Waschbecken, abgetrenntes WC und sehr gutem, großen King Size Bett
- Täglich stilles Wasser (mind. 2 Flaschen) kostenfrei auf dem Zimmer

- Einwandfrei funktionierendes WLAN im gesamten Hotel
- Ausgezeichnete Lage des Hotels für Erkundungen dieser überragenden und abwechslungsreichen Stadt

CONTRA
- Servicepersonal beim Frühstück, siehe Anmerkung oben
- Leider war es in unserem Zimmer hellhörig. Wir haben morgens stets die fleißigen Putzfrauen nebenan beim Reinigen der anderen Zimmer sowie das Öffnen/ Schließen der Zimmertüren gehört",4,2019,03,27
22,Todo fantastico,"Bien estuvimos con mi pareja en Barcelona y decidimos alojarnos en este hotel ya que sabemos que la gastronomía desde hotel la gestionan los hermanos lopez ,pues bien el hotel esta de fabula acogedor ,agradable habitación con todo lo que necesitas cómoda ,limpia todo perfecto ,y por la mañana el desayuno con tartas ,bizcochos ,huevos ,quesos ,embutidos etc. la verdad donde escoger todo de calidad y el personal amable ,atento y profesional Muchas gracias por todo .
Gestión hermanos lopez no falla .

Del restaurante del hotel y el bar de tapas se merecen  una critica a parte ,pero solo os diré ESPECTACULARRRRRRRR",5,2019,03,19
22,"Una maravilla, si no fuera por el desayuno!","Acabo de pasar 2 noches en fin de semana en este hotel, y he de decir que es un magnifico hotel, excepto el desayuno, que te dan ganas de irte a otro lugar! 
Os cuento;
Llegamos el viernes 15 por la noche, y nada mas llegar nos recibieron con una sonrisa y una amabilidad, solo comparable con autenticos hoteles de lujo. Geray y su equipo, nos atendierón muy muy bien. 
La habitación estupenda, grande y acogedora, es cierto que nos hicierón un up grade a Junior Suite, con lo que muy bien.
El horro llega al despertarte e ir a desayunar. Que mal! Que horror! 
Para empezar, no te sientan si no que te dicen, “esa esta libre” y allá te las compongas. Ya ves que el buffet, por llamarlo algo, es, escaso, casi inapreciable por que de verdad, que tristeza! Cortes frios de carnes o fiambres, una pieza o ninguna, unos cortes de queso, seco y mal dispuestos. Fijaros como es la cosa, que el segundo día pedimos un poco de  Jamón Serrano que se había acabado, lo pedí yo al cocinero, y no se percato que mi pareja estaba detras. Pues cuando llamo a la camarera para ponerlo, el cocinero dijo que no, que me llevara un poco a la mesa a mi, pero que poner mas nada, la camarera pregunto si es que no había y el cocinero dijo que si que claro que había pero que así no se gastaba! Osea, de verdad!!! Nos quedamos totalmente locos!!!
Tienes una carta de huevos para pedir al momento, pero, no hice uso, se me quitarón las ganas cuando vi como los sacaban en la mesa de al lado. 
Había 4 staff trabajando y era como si no hubiera nadie, todos parecen super ocupados pero no hacen nada, van de un lado al otro sin recoger mesas, sin sentar a clientes...una cosa muy rara! Y todas las mesas sucias y ellos, como si no fuera la cosa con ellos! 
Si no fuera por una chica llamada Esther que era la única que veias, poniendo cubiertos, limpiando mesas, no se qué sería del desayuno.
Y gracias a ella pudimos tomar café en nuestro desayuno, si no hubiera sido imposible.",4,2019,02,21
22,Comodo,"Sono stato a barcellona per un weekend e ho soggiornato in questo hotel molto comodo e ben collegato ai siti più importanti della città. È un palazzo vecchio ristrutturato e rimodernato. La struttura è ottima, molto curato e pulito. Le camere ampie e moderne. Bagno molto particolare. Bar, terrazza con piccola piscina panoramica sul tetto. Parcheggio disponibile ma piccolo. Tuttavia il servizio nom è soddisfacente. I camerieri per la colazione non sono da 5 stelle.  Ristorante è troppo sofisticato e consiglio di riconsiderare il menù che non ha nulla della cucina spagnola. Inoltre è esageratamente caro. Lo consiglio per affari e viaggi brevi.",3,2018,12,11
22,Excelente estancia,"Elegimos este hotel por su fantástica ubicación, dado que se encuentra cerca del centro, donde puedes ir a cenar o a tomar algo. Al entrar, nos encantó la decoración y el ambiente. Nos ofrecieron un cóctel de bienvenida y nos acompañaron a nuestra habitación, a la que no le faltaba detalle. El trato durante nuestra estancia fue excelente en todo momento, cabe destacar la amabilidad y profesionalidad de uno de ellos, Yeray, que se mostró atento en todo momento y nos hizo sentir como en casa; con trabajadores así da gusto llegar a un hotel. Recomendable 100%. Nosotros volveremos sin ninguna duda. ",5,2018,11,18
22,No es un 5 estrellas,"me gusta probar hoteles y encontre una oferta para probarlo, pero realmente he probado 5 estrellas mucho mejores

22,OHLA...MI QUERIDA BARCELONA !,"OHLA EIXAMPLE
Hotel Boutique

OHLA...MI QUERIDA BARCELONA !

Estábamos en la ciudad de Barcelona, tierra de mis antepasados, después de 8 horas de vuelo desde Santo Domingo, mas casi 6 horas adicionales entre el Aeropuerto de Barajas y nuestro vuelo de conexión Madrid-Barcelona. Aquí, en esta fantástica ciudad, llena de arte y cultura, comenzaba nuestro largo tiempo planeado y acariciado “Gastrotour”, de-cuasi- (prácticamente), todas las Regiones vinícolas y de cierta importancia gastronómica en España...mas el norte de Portugal
Nuestro vuelo desde Madrid fué placentero en contenido, pero- nuestro “contenedor”...era un viejo avión, de la flota de Air Europa, digno de un museo. 
Esta sensación de estar en un viejo “contenedor” cambió al momento que entramos al modernísimo y bello Aeropuerto de Barcelona....la verdad es que mis colegas Catalanes se las traen en sus propuestas de diseño ! 
En Barcelona, después de sopesar muchas opciones, nuestra selección y “base”, para nuestros primeros días de estadía de nuestro Gastrotour, lo fué el “OHLA EIXAMPLE”...un hotel boutique, perfectamente localizado para nuestras aventuras gastronómicas , culturales y de las multiples atracciones de esta ciudad. Ciudad que-lamentablemente- no visitamos desde hace 30 años. 
Este boutique hotel, esta diseñado en un edificio de “época”, perfecta y magistralmente “reciclado”, en su perfecta ubicación, en la histórica Area o Barri de “Eixample” con su atractivo trazado de calles y clásicas esquinas en diagonal, ofreciendo atractivas visuales y otras muchas ventajas urbanisticas. 
Palabras de un viejo arquitecto y diseñador urbano ! 
Este distrito de la ciudad esta lleno de hermosas avenidas, como el Passeig de Gracia y, obras de arquitectura del maestro y colega- mas grande que sus tiempos- Antoni Gaudi. Como las casas “Batllo” y “Mila” (la Pedrera”...y-ni hablar- “La Catedral de La Sagrada Familia”.  Obra que considero (...es considerada) una de las grandes obras maestras de la arquitectura del mundo. 
Ademas, Eixample, esta a poca distancia (unos 15-20 minutos caminando) de otras areas de gran interés, como lo es el “Barri Gotic”, las Ramblas etc etc 
Aquí, en el Ohla...se puede encontrar; modernismo y novedosas tendencias de diseño en sus generosas areas y acomodaciones con “fancy images”, pero trasmitidas con una atrevida version de conceptos clásicos para beneficio del resultado de -obra arquitectónica- como un TODO !   
De nuevo; en mis propias palabras, como Arquitecto diseñador de Hoteles y largo tiempo empresario Hotelero, este hotel...
tiene todo lo necesario para ser un gran hotel en su estilo:
UBICACION, Ubicación, Ubicación...tan buena como el mejor. No en el medio del “ajetreo cotidiano”, pero cerca de todo lo que le gustaría visitar en esta ciudad tan hermosa, limpia y llena de historias a ser contadas...con gracia ! 
IMAGEN...su ubicación de esquina “eixamplar” es perfecta y ofrece una imagen fresca de su fachada hotelera. Pero, mas importante, una vez dentro se realiza que se está en un lugar muy especial...un hotel que, sin dudas de ningun tipo, me siento obligado a calificar de “Hotel Boutique” 
El Lobby y Recepción, con sus modernas areas anexas, bien decoradas-en estilo “ecléctico”, pero comfy “estilo lounge”. Con el Bar y conexión inmediata (como debe ser) al restaurant “Xerta” que-con su merecida estrella Michelin- es uno de de sus grandes atractivos y logros de diseños bien programados. 
El Front Desk, areas de Recepción y concierge is servido y atendido por un staff joven, educado, amistoso y bien entrenado...ofreciendo, todos,  una imagen “nítida” e impecable. Destacamos la profesionalidad de su jefe de recepción, el Señor Javier Navaza, quien junto a su staff atendió puntualmente todas nuestras necesidades. 
Desde el Lobby areas el acceso a sus modernas habitaciones es fácil y fuido, similarmente a las bellas y atractivas areas de Terrazas y piscinas que-aunque limitadas en espacio- ofrecen vistas fantásticas sobre la Ciudad  
Las Habitaciones son amplias y con un interiorismo de atractivo diseño, donde se hizo espléndido uso arquitectónico de la renovación espacial y de reciclaje (expuesto) de los viejos elementos estructurales del edificio. En total; una imagen acertada y placentera...con muy buena calidad de los “beddings”. 
Quizás el area de Baño (limitada en espacio) y la disposición mas funcional de muebles (falta una mesa alta y mas area de Ubicación de equipaje, etc)...podría ser mejorada. Esto nos llevó a pensar (por nuestras multiples maletas) a solicitar una Habitación mas amplia que-lamentablemente- no estaba disponible...nada de esto fué obice para disfrutar nuestra estadía. 
A la llegada...los huéspedes son ofrecidos de una copa de burbujeante Cava ...para armonizar y  “sentar” el “mood” catalán.    
Tal y como también lo solicité, a nuestra llegada, una botella de una buena Cava también nos esperaba en la Habitation...marcando el comienzo de nuestra fantástica “primera parada” en este; nuestro acariciado Gastrotour que-apenas-comenzaba...con satisfacciones y con muy “buen pié” !
Como dato importante, para alojarse en cualquier gran ciudad europea; el Hotel tiene su parking anexo...al cual le daríamos muy buen uso desde el penúltimo día de nuestra estadía al recoger-junto a mi hijo Anton- nuestro BMW, previamente reservado en AVIS...Coche que nos llevaría-perfecta e impecablemente- por todo nuestro Road-Trip...
en esos 5,000 kms por...”casi” toda España y el norte de Portugal  ! 
En general; el “Ohla Eixample”, boutique hotel, es altamente recomendado por nosotros...tanto como profesional, como muy exigentes huéspedes, de gran experiencia  en viajes gastronómicos, por el Caribe, los USA y toda Europa",5,2018,06,11
22,Sencillamente perfecto,"Todo muy bien preparado en una muy buena ubicación. Magnífico trato por parte de los empleados del hotel.
Repetiremos seguro en una próxima visita a Barcelona.
Hotel sin ruidos, con piscina y parking. 
Mencionar que su cocina cuenta con una estrella michelín ",5,2018,06,11
22,Increible!,"Increible! Muy bien ubicado, con cafes, restaurantes, bares y tiendas cerca, el area es perfecta, el hotel es muy bonito me gusto mucho el diseño y la habitacion, el servicio fue excelente,  todos resolvieron nuestras dudas y muy amables y profesionales! 

Definitivamente volveremos!",5,2018,05,20
22,Viaggio di nozze,"Sono stato in questo hotel stupendo dal 9 al 13 maggio 2018 per il nostro viaggio di nozze, posizione stupenda per poter visitare la città.
In realtà mi viene tristezza perchè vorrei ancora essere lì.
Cercherò di essere conciso: hotel di assoluto livello, 5 stelle super meritate, staff davvero pronto ad esaudire ogni singolo desiderio (chiamata di un taxi, consiglio per un ristorante, consiglio su cosa visitare, prenotazioni per visitare musei). Quindi tutto parte da un ottimo staff.
Continuando non si può non citare la colazione: da mille e una notte.... Tutto e dico tutto il cibo preparato fresco e differente tutti i giorni. Dal prosciutto crudo alle uova, dal bacon croccante allo yogurth!
La camera era stupenda: molto particolare l’open space del lavabo vicino al letto e della doccia visibile dal letto perchè collegata da un vetro trasparente. Camera rifatta una volta ma la seconda volta venivano lasciati cioccolatini nel pomeriggio ed il meteo della giornata successiva. Letto king size stra comodo; caffe nespresso in cialde!
Terrazza panoramica mozzafiato al piano 8^ o 9^, non ricordo, con piscina che purtroppo non ho potuto usare per condizioni meteo avverse, a strapiombo...
Infine come non citare il ristorante interno stellato???? Veramente vale la pena trascorrere una cena lì, non ve ne pentirete!
Quando tornerò a Barça avró un unico indirizzo dove andare: OHLA EIXAMPLE!

22,"Laut, ungemütlich und überteuert.","Wir haben 2 Zimmer à 5 Nächte gebucht für knapp 2000 Euro und haben uns auf das 5 Sterne Hotel gefreut.
Die Zimmer waren ok aber keine 5 Sterne wert. Die Badezimmertür, welche ebenfalls die Toilettentüre war, ging immer auf da diese nicht verschliessbar war und ebenfalls nur zu gestossen werden kann.
Fenster lassen sich im 3. Stock ebenfalls nicht öffen. Das Beste ist aber die U-Bahn welche alle 4 Minuten doppelt unter dem Gebäude durch fährt und absolut hör-/spürbar ist. Dies in der Lobby, Restaurant, ZIMMER und auch auf dem Rooftop der Fall. Am 2. Tag wurde uns das Zimmer, welches ab 10 Uhr leer war, weder gereinigt noch die Handtücher gewechselt. Als wir dies bemerkten um 16.00 Uhr und den Desk informierten, musste ich allerdings trotzdem 20 Minuten später selbst runter und reklamieren damit endlich frische Tücher geliefert wurden. Dafür gabs aber 1 Flasche Cava als Entschuldigung.
Frühstück ist ok aber auch kein wirklicher Traum. Rührei im Trog permanent kalt, Kaffe bestellt und 20 Minuten darauf warten war auch normal. Immerhin waren die Leute am Desk immer freundlich und zuvorkommend. Leider war das Hotel zu KEINEM Zeitpunkt 5 Sterne wert und wir werden in Barcelona nicht mehr in diesem Hotel übernachten.",2,2018,04,27
22,Excelente opcion,"Es de destacar la predisposición del personal, como asi tambien la ubicacion, vista de la terraza y comodidad de las habitaciones.  Si lugar a dudas volvere a elegir el hotel en mi proxima visita a Barcelona.

22,Cinque stelle e meritate,"Da un hotel 5 stelle si è sicuri di ricevere un ottimo servizio. La differenza fra i diversi hotel li fanno i dettagli e qui sono veramente curati, niente sembra lasciato al caso. Le camere sono spaziose, molto pulite e con armadi capienti, ma soprattutto funzionali. Lo smart phone disponibile per l'utilizzo in modo gratuito è stata una gradita sorpresa. Inoltre la piscina sul tetto con acqua calda, fornita di sdraio e salvettioni, è stata la ciliegina sulla torta. Il personale gentile e disponibile in modo particolare il responsabile alla reception, attento alle esigenze del cliente anche quelle non richieste espressamente. La location è a tre minuti dalla stazione del metrò.",5,2018,04,04

22,Cumple las expectativas ,"Viaje por trabajo, muy amables en la recepción, atentos a cualquier necesidad.
Desayuno muy correcto, instalaciones muy nuevas y completas, buenas vistas desde la terraza.

Hotel céntrico, bien comunicado y muy buena opción para volver",4,2017,11,08

El hotel cuenta con un restaurante galardonado con una estrella Micheline así que no puedo decirles más, es delicioso! Reservamos una mesa y degústanos el Menú con maridaje y quedamos fascinados.

22,Buena ubicación,"sin dudas la ubicación de hotel es extraordinario, estéticamente es muy chulo su decoración,las habitaciones impecables, los cocteles de la piscina muy buenos, la piscina tiene muy buen ambiente,es un hotel de ciudad pequeño pero  acogedor, nunca cenamos ,su restaurante tiene una estrella Michelin.
el único pero...... era el desayuno pobre para un hotel 5 estrellas faltaba variedad .",4,2017,10,30
22,Habitación muy confortable en el corazón de Barcelona.,"Ubicación extraordinaria en el Eixample. Cama supercómoda con enorme pantalla TV frontal. Servicios impecables; personal atentísimo. Piscina en terraza, con vistas de toda la ciudad. (Perfecto para la ultima copa antes de dormir)",4,2017,10,03
22,Il dettaglio fa la differenza...,"...nel bene e nel male. L'impatto è sicuramente positivo: la struttura è molto bella e il receptionist professionale e gentile. Altrettanto posso dire di un simpatico ragazzo italiano che dopo averci offerto un drink ci ha accompagnati in camera. Una junior suite molto spaziosa, confortevole ed elegantemente arredata. Primo dettaglio (male): manca il bidet. In Spagna si trova abbastanza facilmente ma qui non esiste in nessun tipo di camera. Secondo dettaglio(bene) ottimi prodotti da bagno e asciugacapelli di livello alto. Il ristorante è bellissimo e la cena sarebbe stata strepitosa se, terzo dettaglio(malissimo)la temperatura del locale fosse stata ""umana"": faceva un freddo polare, c'era un flusso d'aria che muoveva le foglie delle piante posizionate sui tavoli. Nonostante la nostra richiesta/supplica di attenuare il disagio nulla è stato fatto per migliorare la situazione. Davvero un peccato perché il menù era delizioso e accompagnato da un Bollinger rose all'altezza. Altro dettaglio(male) avrei gradito la colazione in camera ma ho rinunciato perché il servizio sarebbe costato 20 euro...praticamente come la colazione stessa, inclusa nella mia tariffa ma dal costo standard di 26 euro...una sproporzione davvero inspiegabile. Mi hanno detto che se non avessi avuto la colazione inclusa avrei potuto averla in camera a 26 euro ma poiché era inclusa ""a buffet"" chiedendo di farmela portare in camera l'avrei pagata praticamente due volte...quindi sono scesa al ristorante(stesso freddo della sera precedente)...comunque buona e varia. Nel complesso un buon hotel, lo consiglierei.

22,Terraza Hotel Ohla,Bonita terraza para tomar algo en el centro de Barcelona al atardecer/noche hasta la 01:00. Musica chillout agradable y personal amable. Precios excesivos en los cocktailes y mojitos. Recomendable para visitarlo una vez.,3,2017,08,20
22,Ohla! Hola!!!,"Nella zona eixample di Barcellona questo hotel a cinque stelle se le merita tutte. Di recente ristrutturazione con materiali e finiture di pregio. Hotel con annesso ristorante una stella michelin, la colazione sia dolce che salata era abbondante e di qualita'. Il massimo era rientrare in hotel dopo una giornata passata a visitare la città e trovare nella hall due bottiglie di brut  immerse dentro un secchiello pieno di ghiaccio! Un saluto a Fabio e Stefano, rispettivamente responsabile di sala e responsabile barman che ci hanno fatto sentire a casa. La piscina sul tetto fantastica con la possibilita' di mangiare e sorseggiare un buon drink a tutte le ore. Consigliatissimo e......Hola!!!",5,2017,08,12

Súper súper amables.
No le doy 5 puntos porque es un ""5 estrellas"" SIN BIDET!!! WTF?!!!???  No podía creerlo y porque vi dos cucarachas.
Para todo lo demás súper predispuestos en todo. Hace el hotel la atención del personal.
El parking aunque podría estar incluido cuesta $36 euros por noche... el desayuno variado mejor que otros.

Das Hotel ist sehr gepflegt, die Zimmer sauber und puristisch. Hier hat Jemand mal von Anfang bis Ende gedacht und die Zimmer sehr funktionell gestaltet. Keine losen Regale oder schlecht gepflegte Armaturen. Die Betten sind hervorragend. Das Personal ist für spanische Verhältnisse sehr aufmerksam und zuvorkommend.",5,2017,06,26

22,Lo justo,"Nos autoregalamos con mi pareja una noche para volver a la ciudad en que vivimos muchos años y quisimos conocer este nuevo hotel. Nos pareció que todo tenía lo justo para conseguir las 5 estrellas bajo el paraguas del minimalismo. Ningún detalle que nos causara una gran sorpresa. La habitación lo mejor, para mi gusto personal una decoración super fría pero elegante, la cama especialmente excelente!!!!!! La ducha también me ha gustado mucho. La terraza no está mal pero está desaprovechada (para mí lo peor planteado del hotel), pareciera que cuando llegaron a la azotea ya no había presupuesto. Tiene mucho potencial si se redecora, aunque las vistas no sean de lo mejor. El hall, quizás pensado para reuniones de negocios, si no, no resulta de interés... muy frío también y no invita a tomarse algo. La limpieza absoluta, café de sobre en la habitación, atenciones las justas, desayuno correcto sin ser gran cosa, recepcionistas muy jóvenes, algo desorganizados, perdidos, se notaba la falta de profesionalidad de quien lleva décadas en el servicio, pero amables. La ubicación también es excelente, pegado a 2 importantes avenidas, no está en pleno bullicio y a su vez tampoco alejado. Quito un punto porque para ser un 5 me pareció muy básico, y otro punto porque conversando con un empleado al que le veíamos mala cara nos dijo que a pesar de que hay un comedor para personal, no había podido comer porque ya no había comida y que les descuentan el dinero aunque no quieran comer allí. Creo que hoy en día debemos exigir a las empresas compromiso con 2 cosas extras muy importantes como son su plantilla y el medio ambiente. En resumen, un hotel al que le falta pero que habría que ver como evoluciona en un tiempo.",3,2017,06,10

22,Magnífico,"Sólo nos quedamos una noche pero fue genial. El consierge nos recomendó un restaurante que nos encantó, ya que el suyo propio, El Xerta, estaba cerrado.

Die Zimmer (wir sind das dritte Mal in diesem Hotel gewesen und kennen alle Kategorien) sind sehr sauber und geräumig! Das Personal in der Lobby sowie das Management machen einen Top-Job. Individuelle Wünsche werden sehr gut umgesetzt. Ein Highlight bildet die Dachterrasse mit Pool und integrierter Bar. Ein idealer Ort zum Entspannen nach einem turbulenten Tag in Barcelona. Die Lage ist für Foodlovers perfekt! Viele der neuen Restaurants liegen in unmittelbarer Fussdistanz.

Wir hatten eine Junior Suite, was ein großes Zimmer mit offenem Bad ist.
Es gibt einen kleinen Pool auf dem Dach und eine Bar im Erdgeschoss.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist nicht überwältigend, aber gut.
Nicht so zufrieden waren wir mit dem Housekeeping. Klopf klopf und schon geht die Türe auf und das Mädchen steht im Zimmer. Das kann peinlich werden.
Daß sie uns dann am nächsten Tag der Voucher für den Welcomedrink entfernt hat topt das noch. An der Rezeptions gab es anstandslos einen neuen.",4,2016,11,21

22,"PERSONAL EXCEPCIONAL, Hotel cómodo, localización IDEAL.","Por una ampliación de un día de estancia y un comentario y recomendación de un cliente probé este hotel de forma improvisada, sin haber oído hablar nunca de él. Viajo a Barcelona cada 15 días hace muchos años y mínimo paso una noche cada vez, siendo cliente habitual del Casa Fuster los últimos años después de haberlo sido anteriormente del Arts otros muchos.
Debo decir que el comentario y recomendación fue erróneo pero porque se refería según me enteré ya en el hotel a otro que tiene la misma cadena cerca de Plaza Urquinaona, donde las Suites son mucho más grandes y acordes a priori a lo que utilizo para recibir visitas... PERO, sinceramente me sorprendió muy gratamente la EXCEPCIONAL profesionalidad y formación del personal que me atendió... ( y esta localización para mí es la óptima por temas profesionales ).
El hotel es contemporáneo, un concepto no GL pero sin duda ha pasado con nota alta las expectativas de un cliente frecuente en este segmento. Reitero, por el equipo humano sin duda. El hotel es pequeño pero interesante.
La localización es ideal, para mí por temas profesionales, pero para cualquier visitante de Barcelona la recomiendo 100%.
No pude visitar la Suite principal, creo que la Penthouse, por estar ocupada, pero miraré de repetir y reservarla la próxima ocasión.
Gracias a todo el personal, y mi enhorabuena a la dirección por esa formación e importancia del trato y profesionalidad del equipo humano, ya que al menos para viajeros frecuentes le damos mucha importancia. Al fin y al cabo no te quedas con las paredes y decoraciones de los 100 hoteles que visitas al año, y sí en como te han tratado.
Muchas gracias.",5,2016,11,17

Habitacion impresionante, con todos los detalles y comodidades. Desayuno nada acorde al precio que se paga, falto de muchos productos, muy mejorable. Comida con tempo de servicio muy muy lento, desesperante. Presentacion de platos muy basica, nada original y con una calidad muy mejorable.

Estuvieron muy pendientes ante, durante y después.
Fue maravillosa celebración de nuestro segundo aniversario. 
Se portaron de lujo todos y cada uno de los trabajadores, muy atentos, amables. Una calidad del personal a la altura del
Hotel.
Ya les dijimos que siguieran igual para seguir creciendo como están haciendo, y el estar haciendo el Gym, es un valor más añadido a este gran hotel.
Un pero... por poner algo: añadir más clases diferentes de panes en el desayuno y en las raciones en los platos algo más completos.
Un saludo y volveremos.

22,Weekend ,"Una muy buena ubicación para visitar Barcelona, y poder descansar después. Cama muy cómoda, todo el hotel es nuevo. Personal joven y muy atento, te aparcan ellos el coche, la única pega quizás es que a las 11 termina el desayuno si llegas tarde no hay opción de pedir más.",4,2016,08,23
22,Neu und schick ,"Das Hotel ist sehr schön und sehr modern. Highlight ist die Dachterrasse mit Pool. Das Personal in der Lobby ist ausgesprochen freundlich, gibt Empfehlungen oder führt Reservation für Restaurants oder Ausflüge durch. Der ältere Kellner der rooftopbar ist etwas arrogant. 

Die Lage des Hotels ist zentral und nah am Szeneviertel Gracia. Die üblichen Sehenswürdigkeiten sind ebenfalls gut zu erreichen. ",5,2016,08,23
22,Fabuloso,"Ubicado en una excelente y tranquila zona. El personal muy amable, amistoso y atento. Aconsejo cenar en su restaurante ya que sus deliciosos platos son preparados por un Top Chef con estrella Michelin. El Roof Top Bar es muy atractivo para relajarse con una buena sangría y la vista mientras los niños disfrutan de la piscina. Las suites son muy amplias y cómodas.",5,2016,08,18
22,Einfach toll!,"Super Lage, motiviertes Personal, sehr schönes Design, alles neu und qualitativ hochwertig. Frühstück war sehr gut und abwechslungsreich. Hotelbar und Musik niveauvoll.

22,Tolles Hotel,"Schickes Hotel mit sehr schönen modernen Zimmern. Badezimmer in den Raum integriert.

Die Sehenswürdigkeiten von Barcelona sind vom Hotel aus gut zu erreichen wir kommen gerne wieder.",5,2016,07,08
22,CARISIMO PARA LO QUE OFRECE,"Mala experiencia, me alojaron en la tercera planta y se sentía el metro cada vez que pasaba, el personal amable aunque en general poco profesional, television grande y moderna pero se reinicaba cada 10 minutos, buffet de desayuno nada especial, te cobran el aparcamiento por días completos aunque no lo agotes, carísimo para lo que es.",1,2016,07,05
22,Complimenti!,"Complimenti vivissimi a chi ha avuto l'idea di ideare un hotel del genere. Ottima location, ma soprattutto molto rilassante ed originale l'atmosfera che si respira al suo interno. Ricercati i piatti del nuovo ristorante e molto varia la colazione al mattino. Il personale è stato davvero molto cordiale.",5,2016,05,11
22,Gran hotel,"Llegamos a este hotel y tuvimos la sorpresa de ser los primeros clientes ya que se inauguraba ese dia, nos hicieron gran recibimiento con un ramo de flores y un libro de la ciudad de barcelona . Disfrutamos mucho con la acogida tan calida que nos mostraron .El hotel tiene una decoracion muy vanguardista y esta situado en una zona espectacular cerca del paseo de gracia y tiendas, restaurantes....volveremos sin duda ",5,2016,05,01
22,"Un hotel de 5 estrellas, céntrico y a buen precio.","Hemos estrenado esta semana este estupendo hotel recién inaugurado.
Super céntrico, cerca de buenos restaurantes, locales de copas, tiendas fantásticas de decoración, de ropa, etc.
Todo es nuevo, decoración exquisita, el desayuno muy bien (el café con leche con la leche emulsionada buenísimo), la cama super cómoda, flores frescas en la habitación, el personal muy atento, ...
La limpieza un 10.
Además tiene muy buena relación calidad-precio.
