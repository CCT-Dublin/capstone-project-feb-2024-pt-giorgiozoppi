138,"Amazing Staff, Fabulous Hotel - Highly recommended","I stayed at The Mayfair Townhouse Hotel for my birthday celebration - the hotel was absolutely magnificent, the staff were so welcoming and helpful and went out of their way to make my birthday celebration a memorable one, from personalised birthday message and card in my room and delicious macarons wishing me a happy birthday! I was just so wonderful! 

The cocktails in the Dandy bar were incredible! The bartender was brilliant and recommended cocktails and made speciality cocktails just from what flavours I said I liked! They were fabulous!

The concierge was very helpful to they hailed taxis for us saving time and we didn’t have to wait - it was great! 

A big thank you to all the staff for making my birthday stay memorable!
You have such a wonderful hotel I wish I found it sooner!
I will most definitely be back! And for anyone thinking of booking this hotel I would highly recommend it!",5,2024,10,20

138,"Location, delicious drinks and overall, the best staff around!","We stayed here for a week. The first few days we stayed in a deluxe room and the last few days we upgraded to an executive suite. Both rooms were lovely and the snacks and drinks in the minibar were free- which is great when you’re trying to get through jet lag. Everyone from the door man, to the reception, to the bartenders were exceptional.

Speaking of the bartender and jet lag…. Duane at The Dandy Bar made me one of the best espresso martinis I’ve ever had (and that says a lot)! He put so much TLC in it and dazzled it with a little bit of Bailey’s and cinnamon - and shook it up so it had the perfect bit of froth on top. 

I highly recommend this hotel for its perfect location, the quality of the rooms and the smiles on everyone who works here. We look forward to staying here again on our next visit.",5,2024,10,11
138,Terrible room,Avoid basement rooms (level 0) - window opens up straight into concrete wall with NO view. Claustrophobic. Should not be used as hotel room.,3,2024,10,09
138,100% Recommend,"Fantastic location, beautiful rooms and fabulous service.  Close to Euston Station and the tube station you can get anywhere.  I stayed for business but will definitely be back for a personal stay",5,2024,10,07
138,The Concierge made all the difference.,"We had a spectacular experience staying at The Mayfair Townhouse.   The hotel was lovely, the service, impeccable, but what differentiated the hotel was their world class concierge service.  

It started two months before we arrived as I wanted to purchase Chelsea Football tickets. I was ready to pull the trigger with an online broker when I decided I should check with the hotel. I got an immediate response from the concierge, Riyas Kallam who emphatically suggested not to  buy those tickets as the vendor was less than reliable.  His advice led us to getting great seats at a fraction of what we were going to spend.  I shudder to think what I would have had to pay if I bought them at the stadium because the ticket broker never sent me a link. . 

The great concierge service did not stop there.  Riyas booked our restaurants (fabulous choices) as well as our tours and travel.  What would have been a great vacation turned into a really special event.  We are so appreciative for Riyas Kaplan as well as the entire staff at The Mayfair Townhouse.",5,2024,10,06
138,"it was an elegant and awesome expierence, toppd with the friendly and warmth since arriving at the reception.","The hotel and the staff as a whole is outstanding. The location of the hotel is superb.
Buckingham Palace, steps away, shooping close by and a vareiety of exquisite restaurants. It is half a block from Green Park and as you cross the park, inmediately in front is Buckingham Palace.",5,2024,10,03
138,Another Excellent Stay at the Mayfair Townhouse,"Excellent hotel in a prime location; close to the park; shopping, and all attractions in Mayfair. Stayed here multiple times and each time was perfect. Special shoutout to Nebih at the door who remembered us, made sure to make us feel welcome and assisted us with out checkin. Highly recommend this gem of a property.",5,2024,10,01
138,"Good hotel, but unfriendly staff","I would say it was a very good stay. I really liked room, linens, bath products. Nice water pressure in a shower, no bath tub in our room.  Drinking Water and milk in a room refrigerator. Location is excellent , easy walk to many touristy locations. Good breakfast, could use some fresh vegetables. 
What i was surprised by is not a very friendly staff at the front desk or breakfast area. This is not something I am used to.",4,2024,09,30
138,A gem in London!,"This small boutique hotel is very well centered in London. Very close to shops, restaurants and theatres. We love to walk so we walked pretty much everywhere except the day we had tickets to see Hamilton at the Victoria theater because it was raining in and off. The staff were always very helpful and so were the concierges with arranging our transportation from Gatwick to the hotel, giving us restaurant suggestions and so on.  We loved the hotel and for sure we will be back.",5,2024,09,28
138,Awesome,"Amazing stay. The hotel is so luxurious and the beds are amazing. The staff is so friendly. We loved our night caps with “T” in the restaurant - he truly made our stay something special. We have a new friend. When we were leaving Nebim was very helpful with the bags and finding my Uber driver! 

Absolutely coming back",5,2024,09,24
138,Wonderful hotel bar.,"My friend and I didn’t stay here but went to the hotel bar two nights in a row.  We had excellent service from Tom, the bartender. The atmosphere is lovely and the location in Mayfair is fantastic! It was a wonderful way to end our evenings. Thank you!",5,2024,09,21
138,Great place to Stay in Mayfair,"My Wife and I recently stayed at the Mayfair Townhouses.  Overall, we loved our stay, The Rooms are modern and clean.  The Staff are very positive and helpful and the location worked well for us.  We would be happy to recommend this Hotel to anyone.  (If you are looking for a large Bathroom, this may not work for you).",5,2024,09,19
138,Special Espresso!,Duane at the Dandy bar made the BEST espresso martini I have had to date! It was his special with Baileys and cinnamon— smelled like fall! Great transitional season cocktail! 10/10 would recommend to anyone for a high end cocktail and a beautiful restaurant!,5,2024,09,18
138,The best cocktail,"This place is the perfect place to chill after a day of work.
The music is not too loud, the temperature is just perfect!
I arrived and Danilo, the bar manager, has been so welcoming. After I had a quick chat with T and his energy made me smile and Duane, made me The Perfect Cocktail. I had the “Royal blood martini”, probably the best cocktail ever. Not too sweet, not too sour and so refreshing.
Thank you for the beautiful experience.
See you soon!",5,2024,09,17
138,Wonderful stay,"I had a lovely time at the MT. Everyone was so kind, attentive and welcoming. My room was perfect and perfectly maintained. All staff I dealt with were friendly and very helpful. I travel a great deal and this is not always the case. Well done!

From the time I arrived (early) until check out the staff at Mayflower Townhouse could not have been lovelier. They kindly accommodated my request for an early check in. During my stay they provided information and useful tips for enjoying my London stay. The gentlemen at the door fetched taxis for me from blocks away. The waitstaff in the hotel’s Dandy bar were so friendly and accommodating with menu suggestions, friendly chat, and careful attention. Housekeeping was impeccable and unintrusive. The complimentary mini bar was stocked daily with snacks, water and non alcoholic beverages. The front desk and concierge could not have been more helpful, answering questions and even offering to mail some postcards for me when I checked out and had no time to find a postal box. If you’re headed to London, you can do no better than the Mayflower Townhouse. 

I look forward to returning to London and the Mayfair Townhouse.",5,2024,09,17
138,Overall an okay place - great location - quirky rooms - average warmth / welcoming,"Overall it's not bad, it just seems to lack in a few things. 

Rooms were clean, spacious and nice, albeit quirky - we were on the second floor and had a very low ceiling - seems like a lot of the rooms are quirky.

Location is great - it's very walkable to many food and attractions - a definite positive. 

People weren't overly warm or welcoming - and I really hate it when you have a do not disturb sign on the door and housekeeping tries to come in - always a little weird in my mind.

The bar and drinks were good - but not sure how Conde Nast ever gave them an award for their bar.

Fitness center was pretty good with a decent number of machines and options.",4,2024,09,17
138,Amazing customer service,Terreak and Nebih and Messan are fantastically helpful and cared for us so well.  Appreciate their help! Everyone at the hotel was thoughtful and considerate.  The breakfast is lovely and the bar is such a nice place to relax.  Loved it here and will be back,5,2024,09,17
138,A Must Stay in London,"The Mayfair Townhouse exceeded every expectation I had for my first stay in London! I am a solo female traveler and I wanted a place that was safe, clean and located centrally to all the things I wanted to see. It was a 5 minute walk from the tube station and in a very nice neighborhood near many restaurants & shops. It's located on a side street right off a busy busy road, but you would never know, it was extremely quiet. The staff was beyond excellent. Every single staff member from the second you walk up to the entry doors, is warm, welcoming and ready to help. They were very accommodating when it came to any questions I had or even adding an additional night to my stay. I have let all my friends & family know this is where they must stay when they visit!",5,2024,09,15
138,Posh and friendly!,"Great location and walking distance to so much. Walk to theater district, Oxford St and Designer shopping. So convenient but not commercial. More of a neighborhood feel. Service is outstanding and decor is very posh, very British and lovely. Interesting people staying there so fun to chat up others in the bar. Check out the downstairs room with all the dandy fox portraits. Great food right around the corner especially the tiny Japanese restaurant!, 8 tables and fantastic food. Hotel breakfast was vast and delicious.  I will definitely stay there when I am back in London. ",5,2024,09,15
138,"Fine hotel, excellent staff, good food and location. Comfortable and large beds","Spacious and clean rooms, large and comfortable beds, excellent staff, always willing to help. Good location.

138,Perfect Stay at The Mayfair Townhouse,"I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. A beautiful experience from start to finish. It was our daughter's birthday and the team made it so special for her and decorated the room. Fabulous welcoming and efficient staff, beautiful rooms and bathrooms products. Insanely comfortable bed which prompted us to plan a change of mattress at home. Delicious food and drinks and a perfect Mayfair location minutes walk from so many fabulous London experiences. 10/10",5,2024,09,08

138,The “Little” Hotel Where Everything Is Grand !,"Perfectly situated in the heart of London, and a 10-minute walk to Buckingham Palace. Moreover, from London Heathrow a reasonably priced train/tube direct line. It’s a 50-minute ride on the piccadilly line and you stop at Green Park. From there a 5-minute walk to get to the Mayfair Townhouse Hotel. Service is professional and always cordial. Clean as a whistle too ! You must stop at the bar and have a drink from some of the best “mixologists” we’ve ever encountered. Understanding that when we reserved this hotel, we knew that this was not a low-cost venue. However, one thing that did not sit so well was the price of breakfasts… rather “steep” we would say. Otherwise, a perfect hotel for its price range.",5,2024,09,07
138,Love it all 😍,"Beautiful property, amazing staff, delicious food and great location within walking distance of everything.",5,2024,09,07
138,"Enjoyed the hotel, bar and restaurant",The hotel was centrally located and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was great and I used the gym which i appreciated having access to. I had a drink in the bar and Tom was my bartender. His wine recommendation was stellar and I enjoyed talking to him as well. I will definitely return to the hotel and the bar.,5,2024,09,06
138,Excellent experience,"Duane was great, he made the most amazing Espresso Martini and was delightful company, while I sat at the bar. Vinnie was also very entertaining, it’s too bad he’s leaving. What a wonderful experience. Love the hotel, and the neighborhood.",5,2024,09,04
138,Great bartender staff,The bartenders vinnie and duane made amazing drinks it honestly blew my expectations away!!!!! Best espresso martini ever. They were also really really funny and entertaining to talk to. Sad vinnie is leaving but Tom seems cool too so not too upset! Great service very happy,5,2024,09,04
138,Walking Tourist Retreat To Relaxing Haven,"Comfortable, welcoming & well appointed. Shower was divine. Room amenities & cleaning superb. Requests met quickly. Room service food excellent. With construction outside our window, as early risers, we were only awakened once having stayed out late night before. Happy workers didn’t begin until after 8 am thankfully. We slept deeply & well. Thank you.",5,2024,09,03
138,Very enjoyable hotel.,"We had a great time at the Mayfair Townhouse. The hotel’s location and the staff were excellent. They were very kind and helpful. Although the room was smaller than those in other London hotels we’ve stayed in, it was very clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. There are many restaurants near the hotel, and it’s also within walking distance of the shopping areas highly recommend the Mayfair Townhouse.",5,2024,08,30
138,Mixed feelings. Nice location but with issues.,The hotel is at excellent location but the rooms’ size is very uncomfortable and not enough space in the closet to unpack and you keep bumping into things. I had to remove some towels from the bathroom to just be able to wash my face and brush my teeth.,3,2024,08,29
138,Lovely from top to bottom,"Well, if you want to have the quintessential London experience I highly recommend staying here. From the first time you walk in the door until the moment you check out you do not want for anything. The space is gorgeous, the rooms are unbelievably comfortable, and the staff are as personable as they are professional. A massive shout to Terreak for all of his assistance and conversation. These small touches truly made the stay special.",5,2024,08,28
138,Mayfair Townhouse Visit No.3...with many more to come!,"Pleasant, comfortable, safe, relaxing, indulgent, iconic and exclusive...just some of the words to describe this London landmark hotel. We will be back again and again and again!",5,2024,08,26

138,Perfect central city stay,"Stayed at The Mayfair Townhouse for a couple of nights on a business trip to London and was very pleasantly surprised to see what has become of the previously dated and scruffy Hilton on Half Moon Street. The Mayfair Townhouse really delivers on expectations raised by the stylish appearance and quality finishes, but also the friendly and always very helpful staff who do an amazing job! Thank you :)",5,2024,08,22
138,Beautiful Hotel with Warm and Friendly Staff,"Gorgeous hotel right in the heart of Mayfair and close to the Tube.  Really enjoyed my stay here - the hotel and rooms are beautiful and the staff was so warm, friendly and helpful.  My only comment is that my room, while beautiful, was a bit cramped.  That would not stop me from staying again however.  ",5,2024,08,21
138,The best time!,Go to the Dandy Bar!! Duane and T provided the best service we could imagine and whipped us up some AMAZING espresso martinis. It was clear the staff were great friends and they brought us into their circle. Will most definitely be back to continue the good times.,5,2024,08,21
138,Fantastic Location for Central London with a Touch of Luxury,"If you want an absolutely amazing location in London, to be able to walk everywhere, and we did. This is the hotel for you. And what a great hotel. The service was faultless. The customer who checked in before us was a returning customer. And I see why. 
The hotel was larger than we were expecting. Not a classic boutique hotel but had the feel of one. The staff from the desk, to the concierge to room service did everything with a smile on their faces and couldn’t help us enough. And you have to love the doormen, they were excellent.
As for the room, we had a great room, although the bathroom was small, the shower made up for it (see note below).
Would I stay again, yes. If I was staying in Central London.

Otherwise, these are my other thoughts

Staff – faultless, and every single member of staff was helpful and wanted to help. 5/5. 

Room – it felt like a room between boutique and corporate but really liked it. 5/5

Shower – without doubt the best hotel shower I have ever experienced you just didn’t want to get out. I think the hotels water bill maybe better since we left 5/5 – if I could give 6 it would be.

Kitchen – non. This is a hotel not an apartment.

Bed – the bed sheets were a dream. And the bed and pillows very comfortable 5/5

Cleanliness –5/5

Location – for Piccadilly, Oxford Street, Knightsbridge, Soho fabulous location. It was perfect 5/5

Facilities – we didn’t try them out. There was ironing facilities in the room and that was greatly appreciated.

TV – there was one, it did have a habit of losing connection at times, particularly during the News for some bizarre reason.",5,2024,08,21
138,Who needs to go out??,"Stayed here for a midweek overnight catch up with my lovely friend - cocktails and dinner. Usually we will go for a wander but on this occasion we stayed put in the Dandy Bar for the whole evening, thanks mainly to the warm and friendly welcome from our waiter T, and the bar tending expertise of Simon and Randy. 

The room itself was small but stylish and the bed was really comfy. Breakfast was included and was of a high standard with plenty of choice. Highly recommend.",5,2024,08,19
138,Mayfair experience,"Went to Mayfair Townhouse, for my Husband's 70th birthday, we were not disappointed! Enjoyed the daytime in the area, went for a lovely lunches etc. Also had a wonderful experience in the Dorchester Hotel, for my Husbands Birthday surprise.
",5,2024,08,18
138,Disappointed,I don't think you want me to write a review. Why didn't the young man at the reception desk tell us that the room assigned to us was tiny with no furnishings. Items that would normally been found in your average room for two guests.  Drawers for clothing.  A desk or writing table.  ,2,2024,08,18
138,Highly Recommend’,"The hotel and bar were wonderful! The hotel has great vibes and is close to literally everything! Walking distance to the best sights, restaurants, pubs, and anything you could want. The bar staff at Dandy Bar in the hotel provided wonderful service and entrainment. The food is delicious! The drinks are wonderful!  T, Randy, Duane are THE best!!",5,2024,08,16
138,Another Great Stay!,"Our second stay and it was fabulous.  Great location, property and people.  A special thank you to Dwayne and T in the bar, superstar Gents. ",5,2024,08,16

138,Wonderful cocktail lounge,"This was my third visit to the townhouse and, specifically, the Dandy Bar. The bar is my favorite cocktail lounge in London. The atmosphere and drinks are fantastic, and the team does an amazing job. This last visit I was served by Vinnie and Duané and had a wonderful experience. A classy and enjoyable experience.",5,2024,08,12
138,Great Place to stay,"The hotel is cosy, chic and the personnel is amazing. Very professional and helpful.

138,The Mayfair Townhouse is a friendly boutique hotel. The team provided personalised attentive service.  We felt welcome!,We had a wonderful time staying at the Mayfair Townhouse. I appreciated the  attentive crew at the entrance and lobby. We also spent some enjoyable time at the Dandy Bar.  Duane and Randy were professional and friendly and made the evening very relaxing and fun.,5,2024,08,11
138,Great location!,"Very nice two night stay! Good location for London sightseeing, just 2 blocks from Piccadilly Street where you can catch hop on/off buses to get around town.  Within walking distance (1-2 mi) of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, the London Eye and more! 
Motel is nice, has efficient staff, helpful concierge desk and has a restaurant that has a wonderful breakfast buffet.
The room was comfortable - plush bedding & robes, shower has powerful spray, keurig coffee with biscuits provided in room. Only problem we had in the room was the pocket door to the bathroom is made of heavy wood and was hard to slide open & closed.",4,2024,08,09
138,Highly recommended - a must-visit,"Beautiful place , lovely rooms , fantastic location, but the best thing for us were two particular employees - Duane and Vinnie in The Dandy Bar - so professional, so friendly and so brilliant at their jobs. Thank you for making our experience even more memorable. We’ll be back.",5,2024,08,08
138,Amazing property in a prime location,Great property with outstanding service in the heart of Mayfair. The staff was always taking care of us,5,2024,08,06
138,"Great hotel, small rooms","Everything was great, attention to detail, location, staff, service.

The room was lovely too but was a bit small- stayed in a deluxe room so was expecting a bit more space, can only imagine how small the standard room is. This aside, great hotel and had a nice stay ",4,2024,08,06
138,Still waiting on a refund,On arrival I was charged the full amount again. Because I didn’t have the original card I made the booking with. Still haven’t received my refund ,2,2024,08,06
138,Perfection,"My family is visiting me in London and had them stay at the hotel. We have been hanging out playing cards and Duane was excellent. Best martini I’ve had so far in London. The service is perfect, always ready for the next drink and it’s always perfection. Can’t wait to come back!",5,2024,08,04
138,"Loud, uncomfortable hotel with closet sized rooms and a distinct smell of mildew and perfume in the air.",The hotel is in a great location and that’s where it ends. It’s loud because of a few things - the windows are single pain and don’t close properly allowing the loud street noise in. Expect the 2 am trash man and 4 am deliveries to wake you along with the occasional loud auto. But if that wasn’t enough the uneven floors outside in the hallways make it loud with the noise of clunking feet and noisy suitcases being dragged up and down. Why would you even hear that? Because the rooms are so small your bed is literally right next to the door. To make matters worse there’s construction in the back so if that’s where you’re facing good luck. And then there’s that distinct mildew smell throughout the place with some sort of scent they use to try and cover it. The location is prime but the property leaves a lot to be desired. I would never stay there again even if it was free. So many good choices in the area.,1,2024,08,03
138,Dandy Bar Mayfair Townhouse experience.,"Duane the gentleman working the Dandy has always provided my wife and I with great service. We look forward to seeing him at the Dandy  because we are guaranteed professional personable attentive service.The management and entire staff are 5 star quality.

138,Charming London gem,"Felt like I was so at home and comfortable at this hotel. 
Would recommend and return definitely 
Loved the area ",5,2024,07,28
138,Little gem,"Small but extremely well appointed rooms, comfy beds, lovely toiletries, every detail well thought through.  The location is perfect - walking distance to tourist attractions, business district, parks and shops but tucked away in a quiet street.  Very efficient and friendly staff.  I stayed in a Cabin room - small double bed but large shower and all the convenience for a single traveler.  Definitely would stay here again if I'm in that part of London again.",5,2024,07,26
138,Very nice stay already for the second time,The hotel is situated in the center. A lot of things you can reach by food. The area is very safe also for women. It is calm during the night even the rooms overlooking the street. The staff is very friendly and helpful especially the concierges and doormen. The reception staff I would say is professional. Last time I stayed at the hotel they were friendlier to everybody. ,5,2024,07,24
138,"Great location, friendly staffed, very small rooms",Overall we enjoyed our stay. We really liked its convenient location and staff were helpful and friendly. What we didn't enjoy was the minuscule size of the room,4,2024,07,22
138,Amazing food and service,"Didn't stay at the hotel, just went for a meal. The food was superb and the unique cocktail was incredible. T was a lovely, friendly, welcoming face and an attentive waiter (and we had a great chat about books!). Very reasonably priced for what you get. Would highly recommend.",5,2024,07,22
138,London visit,Lovely hotel and close proximity to the Ritz and Buckingham Palace. Lovely rooms and facilities. Warm welcome as you approach. ,4,2024,07,21
138,Excellent hotel and great staff at the Dandy Bar,"What a great hotel! Excellent location. The staff at the Dandy Bar are simply spectacular. Shout out to Randy and Duane. Excellent energy and they are a riot. And do order an espresso martini. It's the best in London. Only drawback was a delay at check-in...which of course, led to an initial visit to the Dandy Bar...clever 😉.",5,2024,07,20
138,Perfect bar to decompress,"We had an amazing time here, loved it!
For my first time visiting London they this hotel has truly made my experience Expectacular!! ❤️

My favorite part was the bar, after all day of site seeing coming to join a drink and olives were for sure my favorite and thanks to “Danilo” the bar manager he always went beyond to make sure we had a great time
Even getting me olives after the bar was beyond close.",5,2024,07,20
138,Fantastic Hotel and we LOVED DUANE!,"Our stay at he Mayfair was one of the highlights on our trip. The people that work there were lovely.  Duane, who worked in the bar has a special light around him.  His energy and positivity were infectious.  He was fun and attentive. The hotel is in the BEST location, very close to Hyde Park and edging SOHO.  The bed was very comfortable and the rooms were very nice. They had treats and non-alcoholic drinks in the room at no extra charge.  Ironing board, Iron and Steamer in the closet.  We stayed in the Junior suite the first night.  If you can splurge on that, it's worth it. The other room we stayed in was still nice, but obviously had less space.
There's a special alley around the corner that had 4 pubs and 3 restaurants.",5,2024,07,16
138,Great exerience,"The hotel is a boutique hotel with a nice and lively bar/restaurant area
Rooms are well appointed although bathroom was small making it difficult for multiple people to get ready at the same time
Staff was excellent and prompt
The rooms weren't as quiet as I expected from road/street noise, but not awful",5,2024,07,15
138,Thanks for the upgrade,"We were pleasantly surprised to receive an unprompted upgrade to a suite upon check in. Courteous staff, beautiful room, comfortable bed. Their location is top notch next to the parks. Both dinner and breakfast at the hotel were delicious. ",5,2024,07,15
138,Let's get serious - service is appalling,"Arrived at the Hotel: Reception to the left (a your gentleman) scrolling through reels on TikTok, leaning against the wall. Concierge on the desk looking at the screen, did not bother to raise his head and acknowledge the presence of a human being right in front of him. Walked across the bar - no one even said hello. Miserable. Room is claustrophobic. Couldn't sleep because the bar had loud music. I asked to change room due to a restless night they said they were fully booked (which I can understand) but then they said I needed to pay extras. Ridiculous. Great location, but that's all you got.",1,2024,07,14
138,Excellent Vacation,"Awesome vacation at the beautiful Mayfair Townhouse...excellent location, accommodation and food.  And the head concierge, Riyas Kallan is the best!!!  He helped us get tickets for Wimbledon and arranged for travel to St Andrews & Paris.",5,2024,07,13
138,Cool,"Very nice hotel in a central location. Greeted to a high standard at check in, staff are very welcoming. The hotel bar is very nice and Danilo was great host / bar manager with a wonderful attitude plus the last round that we have was amazing. Looking forward to coming back soon.",5,2024,07,12
138,A Sophisticated and Beautiful Room,"I'd like to thank The Mayfair Townhouse for a delightful stay.  Everything in the room is well-designed.  The shower is top notch, the toiletries are lux, the hair dryer is a really good one, there are conveniently located outlets to charge your phone, the mini-bar is complimentary and has a thoughtful array of items you'll be glad you tried, the bed, sheets and comforter are high-end, beautiful as well as comfortable.  The room itself is intimate and beautifully decorated. You couldn't ask for a more comfortable base in London.   ",5,2024,07,09
138,Amazing Service,Had an amazing time at the Mayfair Townhouse Hotel. The ambiance is amazing staff are super friendly and helpful best part is the bar the bar man Duanew was super friendly and witty made me the best Apple Martini even though it was not a regular on the menu definitely become my regular hotel,5,2024,06,30
138,Must visit,"Second visit to the Townhouse, the setting and the team are the best you could ask for. At the bar, I had the pleasure of dealing with T, Dwayne, and bartender Randy. In addition to top class cocktails, the service and interactions were amazing and fun. Made us feel welcome and comfortable, whilst providing best in class service. Look forward to returning and seeing the team again soon.",5,2024,06,29
138,"10/10 service from T, Duane, and Randy","T, Duane, and Randy were the most amazing servers. Randy had excellent recommendations at the bar. Duane was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. And lastly, where do I even begin with T. T had contagious energy & took fantastic care of us. He has the most positive and outgoing personality. We could not have asked for a better dinner, and it was all because of the three of them. Thank you!",5,2024,06,25
138,Our first choice hotel when visiting London.,"We have just stayed once again at The Mayfair Townhouse due to the excellent service and it’s location.
The reception staff were pleasant and attentive & the bedrooms are luxurious. 
Breakfast is always very special. 
Couldn’t ask for more !",5,2024,06,24
138,Terrible experience with the management,"The worst experience I ever had with a Hotel... the management is non-responsive to requests and they are not compassionate with the traveler's circumstances. Recommend The Athenaeum Hotel which is close-by.... same price, professional staff and bigger rooms!",1,2024,06,21
138,5 Stars,"The bar is a distinct highlight. Our bar mistress, Judy, was presented with a substantial amendment to a  classic cocktail that was handled with  supreme artistry, candor, and expertise. And that was round one!  Quite  the experience! 5 stars!",5,2024,06,16
138,Zero customer service on reception,"The attitude of the staff at this establishment is appalling. Zero customer service after my husband fell extremely ill in the night from food poisoning and could not breathe they refused to help or even call an ambulance to our room 101 which i has to do myself in the end from google. We were not from london and had no idea what to do. 

I check out at 12pm after being refused a late check out of 3pm. And it was not even logged that my husband had been taken in ambulance that morning from our room. Hence, why i requested a late checkout so unhelpful and uninterested. 

Which i believed to be a legal requirement to record these things in hotels. Clearly no medical book at The Mayfair Townhouse.

Sadly will not be returning terrible terrible experience mainly from reception. We booked another hotel and had a much better service and stay in 24 hours than 2 nights here.",1,2024,06,14
138,Cozy room next to buckingham palace,"Excellent service and amenities. Highly recommended going to the bar for a bite and/or a drink. The bar tenders were the highlight for me. Great conversations, especially if it is your first time in London. There is a short 5 minute walk to Buckingham palace.",5,2024,06,06
138,Amazing !,"The Mayfair Townhouse is becoming a London tradition for us.

We keep coming back time and time again for the great location, services and of course the staff.

The Dandy Bar is our home away from home. The guys there (Danilo, Vinnie, Randy, Tee, Hanny, Giudy and Duane) are very welcoming and hospitable.

If you want the best drinks in town with great banter, you definitely need to give this place a try! 

HABIBI COME TO MYFAIR TOWNHOUSE !",5,2024,06,04
138,Excellent choice in London,"Great location, beautifully decorated boutique hotel. The staff and very welcoming and kind. Excellent customer service. The bar/restaurant is chic and cozy. Very good food. We were very happy with our choice!! Stayed in the garden suite. Room was fantastic!!",5,2024,06,04
138,Incredible 5 star luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"Such a wonderful stay at a quirky beautiful, wonderfully run property!  The front desk team recognized my Expedia Platinum status with an upgrade to a deluxe room, which is beautiful and perfectly appointed. Rooms come stocked with beverages and treats complimentary and I have to say, best shower I have ever had, with incredible bath products and industry leading towels! Seriously, your towels are better than Langham, Corinthia, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, St Regis, Montage and all other luxury brands I have stayed at… Every interaction, from bellman, to concierge, to front desk, to bartender, to the restaurant staff was flawless!  The team really cares about the guest experience and they go out of their way to show it, thank you!  After paying more than double to stay at the Langham hotel and treated like a third class citizen there, your hotel restored my faith in London hospitality!  Looking forward to a return next year…",5,2024,06,02
138,Amazing,"Amazing experience my friends at the bar/restaurant are amazing Giendy, Duane and all are great, the espresso martini and the food was great please visit the bar and ask for one of their amazing drinks and fresh food!!! Definitely coming back 🩷",5,2024,06,01
138,Incredible location and stunning hotel!,"We absolutely loved our stay at The Mayfair Townhouse and we'd love to return during another trip to London in the future! Gorgeous decor, helpful staff, and an absolutely wonderful location. We enjoyed drinks at the Dandy Bar on more than one occasion, even as they were trying to close; we tried to just grab a drink to take back to our room, but both times they were very accommodating. The bartender Daniél (spelling?) from Italy was extremely kind and gave me a lovely wine recommendation. I very much recommend a stay at this property and we'll be back!",5,2024,05,26
138,Average,"Ought to be good but compared to similar hotels in that part of London is average.

Check-in was difficult. Had paid in advance. Then told by hotel they had not taken payment, subsequent phone calls resolved the issue but this is pretty basic for the front office.

One lift not working during my stay did not help the overall experience.

Was told I was upgraded to a better room. The better room was tiny, the gap between the end of the bed and the wall was barely big enough to walk through without banging into the TV on the wall. The wardrobe was an old cupboard into which you had to walk to hang your clothes and with a very low ceiling and an extremely low beam across the cupboard. At six feet plus tall cue much banging of head. I was relieved I was upgraded as I assume the original room must have been tiny.

There was building going on next door during my stay, which the hotel cannot do anything about, so be aware.

At breakfast three staff struggled to deal with eight guests.

The staff seem to wander around in a semi-conscious state.

There is nothing wrong with the hotel, it is just thoroughly average, if you have to stay there OK but otherwise there are better local choices.

The property just needs some real focus from management, it should be good but is not.",3,2024,05,23
138,"Outstanding hospitality, and location","Long time visitor to London, first time at this property. Great location and staff.

Riyas in particular (concierge): knows the city very well (sites, dining, shows) and a big help arranging activities for the whole family.

A great spot - my new favourite!!",5,2024,05,22
138,Danielo the comic,"Danielo was fantastic, had us in stitches. The guy should do stand-up. The chicken yakitori skewers were next level, I’ll be back for those as much as I can. This final sentence is to get to the 200 characters required to submit this review (I wish I knew how many characters I’ve typed, this is the third time I’ve tried to submit it)",5,2024,05,15
138,This bar is great…,"Danielo was taking care of us at the bar and he was the BEST! Definitely recommend, 5* for him! He tells jokes, gives you recommendations and is genuinely hillarious. Definitely go here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2024,05,15
138,Excellent,Excellent hotel in a great location. Management team led by Paul are on the ball delivering great service. Dandy bar is relaxing with a good range of drinks. Rooms are not the biggest but perfectly formed! Bath room was excellent. Service overall is excellent.,5,2024,05,14
138,10/10 - Highly Recommend,"Beautiful hotel in an amazing location. The Dandy bar is outstanding and each drink is better than the next. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. The hotel and rooms are well maintained. Lots of coffee shops, restaurants and stores in walking distance.",5,2024,05,08
138,Lovely place ideally located at Green Park with friendly staff..,"The location was great (Green Park), the room good (if a little small), very clean.
The breakfast buffet excellent. 
All staff very very friendly: the doormen especially and the breakfast staff too.
The breakfast manager, Phyo (from Myanmar) ,was wonderful: very attentive, never rushed, and always had time to talk with us whilst not neglecting other guests. He looked after us so well, made our stay very special. His colleague, from Kelice in Poland (I forgot her name...) was also very good to us.

The only notable bad experience was the usual 'discretionary'  service charge of 12.5%. This is typical for England, especially in London: adding this item to your bill, forcing you, the customer, to request it's removal. In my case, it will always result in NOT leaving a gratuity for the wait-staff, room cleaner etc., something otherwise I would do as a matter of course.",4,2024,05,08
138,Our Go-To Favorite London Hotel,"For years we enjoyed the Green Park Hilton hotel, now the Mayfair Townhouse Hotel.  

The location is superb, and the hotel has been updated to a wonderful boutique, modern, comfortable, London hotel with a wonderful “edge”. 

Superb in every part, the rooms, quiet, comfortable, with every amenity. 

Front desk, welcoming, when we needed an extra night, accommodating. 

Concierge, front door, thank you Nippie!  Super great in greeting you, finding a cab even when it’s raining

The bar, The Dandy Bar, excellent food and drink!  The three amigos, Duane, Vinny and T not only are excellent cocktail mixers, but welcoming, and make you feel like you are part of the hotel family.  

The staff, all the staff, make this hotel very special.  Because of the staff, the location, hotel itself, this  is our London “ home”. 

A joy to stay here!",5,2024,05,07
138,Amazing,Amazing staff! Super friendly and inviting and made the experience incredible. Looking forward to the rest of our stay!,5,2024,05,06

138,London,LOVED this hotel. It is the coziest hotel and friendliest staff I have ever experienced. The room is clean and comfortable. Just everything about this hotel is 5 stars. T and Vinny at the Dandy Bar are amazing too! ,5,2024,04,29
138,Modern hotel but with a classic feel.,"Beautifully appointed hotel, the rooms and common areas are excellently designed. The location could not be better for walking, and it is very close to the underground as well. The Dandy Bar is a must, the cocktails are a bit on the pricy side but are of the upmost quality.",5,2024,04,28
138,Highly recommended!! 10/10!!!,"Highly recommend this hotel. Thoroughly enjoy our stay. Room is roomy, bed is so comfortable, towels feel luxurious and provide quality products. Service is immaculate. Big Shout out to Hany and team who made us feel so welcomed. You have gone above and beyond to ensure your guests are being looked after. Great location. It is So convenient. 
We booked  through luxury escapes which has daily breakfast, mini bars and cocktails on arrival included! Thus by far the best cocktail I’ve had. Must try the Michelin!! Breakfast is amazing. Great selections and fresh!! Will definitely recommend to our families and friends and will be back on our next visit! Please keep up the great work.",5,2024,04,22
138,Great bar for drinks!!!,"Dwayne and Vinnie looked after the entire marathon team all night, it was AMAZING!!!!. Custom cocktails and great vibes from both of them, if I was feeling a bit cheekier I could’ve stayed for a few more nice cocky t’s, great place for a few drinks.",5,2024,04,21
138,Cocktail Masterclass,"The best espresso I’ve ever had from Dwayne and Vinnie. Outstanding service from the barmen, will be back soon for more!",5,2024,04,21
138,Excellent,"Excellent service from everyone in the team, special shout to Terreak who took our bags the length of street to get us a cab. Everyone in the hotels team were excellent. Again! Fantastic location too and the hotel is really well fitted, very clean, comfortable and has that distinctive Mayfair feel.",5,2024,04,15
138,"Excellent Townhouse, perfect location","My husband and I stayed overnight and found Mayfair Townhouse to be excellent.
It had been fully refurbished a couple of years ago, so unlike other older properties in Mayfair, it was very new inside.
The service was excellent with a great selection of breakfast from the buffet or a la carte.
The location is fantastic and 2 minutes from Green Park tube station, yet extremely quiet inside.
Definitely can recommend this Townhouse for excellent value, remembering you are in Mayfair.",5,2024,04,02
138,A great first experience.,This review is very belated as I just realized that I never posted it.  I was in London for the first time back in July.  It was midway through our trip and we were about to relocate hotels for the last part of our stay.  I was walking by the Mayfair Townhouse when I decided to pop in.  Antonia at the front desk was so informative and even let me see some different room types which immediately made me decide to book the Mayfair Townhouse for our last 3 nights.  We loved the location of the hotel and the location of our room.  It was walkable to much of what we wanted to go to.  The room itself was a little cramped with luggage but the bed was comfortable and the room clean.  The staff was all fantastic and the manager Paul very helpful.  We only had snacks and drinks in the bar but those did not disappoint.   I would definitely return to the Mayfair Townhouse.,4,2024,04,02
138,Great location and staff BUT.....,"The staff were outstanding, friendly yet professional and I cannot fault their service. The location is great, very close to the tube and walkable distance to many things.  But, and it's a big but, I feel the hotel itself does rely on it's location to make up for the very small rooms with awful views from the window!   As a few previous reviews have mentioned the rooms really are incredibly small.  We had a suitcase stand but literally nowhere to put it that wouldn't have blocked a door so we ended up putting our suitcase on the table. The bathroom had no room for a shelf so nowhere to put your wash bag and it was very tight getting in and out of the shower, would be no good for anyone with limited mobility at all. There is very little hanging space.  Also we were a couple and were only provided with one cup.  We called housekeeping and they brought one but the next day the cleaners replaced with only one again.  I know this sounds petty but when you are paying to stay in a luxury hotel these details matter.  We wouldn't stay again as there are better alternatives in good locations.",3,2024,04,01
138,Professionally run and friendly hotel,"We keep returning because it is such a friendly and well-run hotel. Saying the staff are always friendly is a bit of cliche, but it is true. From the welcome when checking in to the friendly greeting from Phyo at breakfast. With so much choice in London it is the small things that make the difference.",5,2024,03,29
138,Great place to stay and Gary the door man is exceptional!,"Stayed here for the first time March 20-26,2024. The beds and pillows and rooms are amazing. Gary the front door man was exceptional as was the rest of the staff. We upgraded our room to a slightly larger one and that was better. The location is perfect.",5,2024,03,28
138,Meh!,"This hotel is in a great location and they leverage that to provide acceptable accommodation at a high price. Our room was tiny…not that we needed much space, but this was really cramped. One had to be careful navigating the path from bedside to WC….several shin- bangs on the chair stuck in the space. For location it would be hard to beat the Mayfair Townhouses however that is its best attribute. There are hundreds of this sort of spot in London. Shop around. If location is not critical you can do much better elsewhere on both the room and the price.",3,2024,03,28
138,Excellent all around,"This gorgeous hotel has everything you could want. Perfect location next to a tube stop, great restaurants, shopping and parks. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food great. I recommend, including the breakfast in your room charge, as the buffet was wonderful. I hope to be back soon!",5,2024,03,25
138,Charming Hotel in a Great Location,"The Mayfair Townhouse is a charming, sophisticated hotel in a great location. All staff members provided excellent service. Our room was thoughtfully updated with modern amenities but still retains its Old World character and ambience. We definitely would stay here again when we're in London.",5,2024,03,16
138,Mayfair location location location,"I was in London  to have a few meetings and this was a  Great location
There were small rooms abut everything you need for a night or 2. Bigger rooms for longer stays ! Service was very good 
I would stay again. I did not add breakfast but it looked great. I walked to near by coffee shops on the way to my meetings. 
Walking distance to everything  and you could get much better. Rooms were very clean and just a little on the small side but I was only there for a few nights. I would stay there again. 
My experience as a owner of a few companies is that service is sometimes lacking and sometimes we need to remind people about this and even though I stayed there and would stay there again I would have expected the hotel to give me the same room rate as it was a Tuesday not a Saturday at 9 pm at night. I was surprised they would not do that but I guess they just didn’t care enough to check previous booking. I also understand we have challenges in the service world ! 
But I would recommend this hotel. I will stay there again.",4,2024,03,14
138,Great,"The bartender, Duane, is one of the best people I’ve met in a long time. Friendly, genuine, and always looking out for whomever is around him. The restaurant would clearly be nothing without him. Please give him a sizable bonus. He deserves it.",5,2024,03,12
138,Lovely first time visit,"I visited Mayfair Townhouse for an event and was really impressed. 
Decor and employees were lovely however the stand out was an employee named T who have excellent service to all the ladies present. T ensured we had drinks and were taken care of during the event. In addition he was friendly and helpful",4,2024,03,10
138,Central London quite stay,"Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a bigger room on the ground floor. I was afraid that it would be too noisy, but it was quite fine.
Lovely staff with attention to detail (I had a personalized card with chocolates in the room upon arrival).
Great location",5,2024,03,07

138,Fantastic stay.,The staff were so welcoming and attentive at all times. I will definitely be staying there again. I’m arrival in the bar drinks were served quickly and the room was made ready quickly even though we were early. ,5,2024,02,19
138,The Mayfair Townhouse,We had a lovely time at the Mayfair Townhouse. The staff were so accommodating and nothing was too much. The beautiful decor coupled with the idyllic location made it the perfect stay. Would definitely recommend visiting this hotel.,5,2024,02,18
138,Faultless ! Extremely elegant hotel.,"Wonderful hotel. It is extremely comfortable & the staff are attentive. 
The decor is beautiful. 
Breakfast was excellent too. Perfect location in the heart of the West End. 
We will definitely stay there again. No negatives at all.
Faultless !",5,2024,02,17
138,MrB,"very nice Hotel, with a busy atmosphere at the Bar area. Rooms were the expected standard. overall a highly recommended Hotel, within a central London location and easy walking distance to good shopping districts.",4,2024,02,12
138,The Mayfair Townhouse,"We booked a weekend in London, in the mayfair townhouse.
We were early in the morning in London and it was already possible to check in at nine o clock
The room was very nice and clean, there were chocolates and a card to welcome a person who we don’t know :)))
The reception is very kind and helpfull like all the employees of the hotel
In the evening we had dinner from the all day menu in the dandy bar, we had pumpkin soup, Mayfair town burger with potato, glas of wine and a beer for £100,- 😱 we realized we were in the most exspensive part of London 
The hotel looks exclusive and clean
They are very friendly, the breakfast I do not find it 5 star worth, but thats my opinion 
We were at breakfast at 10:30 and I find the buffet very simple and there was empty trays and were not accurate refilled
The noise from the hall way came easily in the room, I find that for a 5 star hotel also not good
The room we had, had a window, but the view from that was also not 5 star worth
(Also not my impression what I booked for, park view or street vieuw, this was tunnel vieuw looking at construction site from the building next to the hotel)

Resume we enjoyed London, for one night what we spend for the hotel is overpriced ! £390,- for 17m2 room with a bad vieuw and one night is not worthit ",4,2024,02,05
138,Sitting at the bar is the best night,Stayed here as surprise for my husband’s birthday and he loved it. The cocktail bar is every bit as good as the reviews suggest. The bar and the team there had such an infectious happy vibe which was just delightful to watch. Also the shower and the room snacks were great!,5,2024,02,03
138,This hotel charged me 3 times,"I was given a disabled room rather than a regular room. The champagne requested was not there on arrival. Then room service forgot items from my food order but charged me £12 for tray charge. 

When I checked out I discovered that they had charged me 3 times… yes THREE. So in total they took £1,500 from my accounts. When I got in touch they sent me proof of payment reversal. Well, it’s been 10 days since me visit and I am still waiting.

This is disgraceful and I cannot believe a hotel like this would be so poor. The police will have to be contacted.",1,2024,02,01
138,Annual London treat,"Superb location, excellent service and lovely rooms with quality beds ensuring great comfort are all reasons that make The Mayfair Townhouse a perfect choice for a mini break in London.  This was our second visit and we will be back for sure.",5,2024,01,29
138,So nice and so central!,"We had such a great weekend at the Mayfair Townhouse! Reception when arriving, gym, room, drinks and especially the great advice from the concierges was nothing but stellar from start to end. We are bound to come back next time! Thanks so much!",5,2024,01,28

138,Amazing hospitality and great vibe!,We stayed here for a wedding nearby and we loved the hotel! The room was very clean and comfortable. The Dandy Bar was a great vibe. Best of all- the staff was so lovely. Dean and Terreak were especially helpful! The evening doorman and others helped tie my fiancé’s bow tie for the wedding and everyone was super friendly and accommodating.,5,2024,01,22
138,Family stay at The Mayfair Townhouse.,"Our family (5 adults) had a week London, three rooms and all felt like a home away from home with the relaxing Dandy lounge and breakfast room. The staff were great, helpful and very friendly. The Mayfair Townhouse was easy to find, close to Green Park station, central and within walking distance of many attractions and great restaurants.",5,2024,01,18
138,Poor service and management,"Booked a drinks table in the Dandy bar. Drinks took nearly 30 minutes to arrive, when we complained they said sorry they were really busy, bad management. We’ve found far better service elsewhere in London, they could take a lesson from One Aldwych. We’ll help them be less busy in future by not returning.",2,2024,01,14
138,Best hotels,"Convivial atmosphere, very comfortable beds, amazing breakfast. I recommend this hotel for business, couples and family. It's close to the best shopping streets, department stores and the best restaurants",5,2024,01,14

138,Unhelpful Staff and Drab Room,"we had just spent 10 days in Iceland, and stopped through London for the night, and we’re very excited to stay at the Mayfair, but greatly disappointed. The hotel was OK, dated and in dire need of some updates, but the most disappointing part was the service. Definitely not what we would expect from a hotel of the stature. ",2,2024,01,07
138,Amazing New Year’s Eve in London!,"My friends and I spent New Year’s Eve in London and stayed at the Mayfair Townhouse for three nights. It was a great experience. The hotel is centrally located near Buckingham Palace so it was easy to get around. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. The best part, however, was the hotel staff. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, and they were always willing to assist with any questions or concerns. The concierge was great helping us take the Tube. I’d like to give a special shout out to the bar staff, especially T, Randy, Duane, Milad, Sami, and Dani.",5,2024,01,01
138,How it should be done.,"Excellent service,food,room plus every member of staff could not be more helpful without imposing.Its a little pricey but considering where it is and the overall experience,worth it.Please keep it up so we can visit whenever we want.",5,2023,12,29
138,"Welcoming, personalised and friendly","I can't speak too highly of the service at the Mayfair Townhouse, in every aspect from reception to check-out.

138,Not Quite 5*,"We had 2 Deluxe Rooms on 4th floor.  Great location and beautiful hotel.  Staff friendly and location is perfect.  The rooms were lovely, super comfy beds and great shower.  Big downside was very little storage in bedroom or bathroom even for a 2 night stay!  Breakfast was very average, sadly.  Dandy bar was great,  attentive staff and fabulous cocktails. Overall a lovely hotel but not quite perfect.",4,2023,12,17
138," The Mayfair town is a such a nice to stay at and the people there are very kind and helpful especially ANDRE ","Love the people who work there

138,Below par,"I booked the Mayfair Townhouse after seeing PR trips being gifted on instagram. It looked amazing. However the reality was so different. The staff were all lovely - absolutely cannot fault them. The rooms however are not great. We have a “luxury” garden room which looked lovely online. However, when I went in to the “garden” it was a bare courtyard with scaffolding towering over it. The room itself was just ok, which at just under £500 a night was disappointing. Absolutely nothing luxury about it and it didn’t have a boutique feel like I thought it would. It looked a bit tired and the bathroom was absolutely tiny. We wanted a pre-dinner drink at the bar but we were told it was fully booked - the bar isn’t nearly big enough for a hotel with over 170 rooms, so that was disappointing. Room service was really average - for the price I’ve had much better. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean (but again, not absolutely pristine - eg fingerprints on doors). So overall, I wouldn’t recommend it, but for £500 a night maybe this is all you get now. I know it can’t compare to The Langham or Firmdale, but I did expect it to be much more luxurious than it was. I don’t think I’d stay again and perhaps it’s a lesson to me in not believing what I see on Instagram! ",3,2023,12,16
138,Good option to stay in Mayfair if you want a small boutique hotel,"Well decorated, good service, great location. Rooms are small but comfortable and have all required amenities. The restaurant is appropriate for a small hotel. Service is good, all staff well trained.",4,2023,12,16
138,Disappointing,"As a company CEO traveling frequently, I was disappointed at the contrast between the excellent restaurant service at the Mayfair Townhouse and my residential stay. In contrast the reception staff were, with one exception, disingenuous, haughty and unhelpful. An upgrade was not an upgrade - look closely and it's a way to give you a terrible room whilst offering better to regular clients. Booking months in advance made no difference.",1,2023,12,11
138,Excellent New Boutique Hotel,"An excellent boutique hotel with a fabulous location in Mayfair, London. You can tell this is a new hotel as the rooms are still pristine. The hotel concierge and bar are fantastic. The staff are very nice. The only minor thing I would call out is that if your room is near the bar area, it can get noisy. There is a door that can be closed to keep the noise out, but guests don’t always close it when they pass through it. Overall we enjoyed our stay and we will be back!",4,2023,12,10
138,My favourite hotel,I love this hotel. I stay everytime I go to London. The staff is super friendly and professional. The rooms are small and some are better than others but each one I've been is comfortable . The breakfast buffet is delicious and there are many options to choose from. I definitely recommend !,5,2023,12,09
138,So So - Glorified Z Hotel,"I stayed 5 nights in a Classic Room and didn’t love it. (1) The good: the room fixtures and hardware were nice - I appreciated the mood lighting, the very comfortable bedding, and the marble bathroom and powerful shower. (2) The bad: my room faced the back, caddy-cornered  by two brick walls, and was over a pub, with a tiny window - you couldn’t tell whether it was day or night. Honestly, it was a bit depressing. The size of the room itself would have been OK but it felt cramped with an unnecessarily large king size bed - a queen bed and more space to move around would have been much better. (3) The hotel - it lacks elegance - in some ways it felt like a glorified Z Hotel - the hallways are narrow and claustrophobic -  the lobby is tiny and taken up by a bar that’s not as posh as the write-ups make it sound - it was often very crowded with people arriving and departing with large amounts of luggage coming and going - the weekend felt like a madhouse. The staff were pleasant but it’s not five-star service. Breakfast: a $22 avocado toast was the most expensive and least satisfying I’ve ever had. (4) Housekeeping started knocking at the door very early - two mornings close to 9am, while I was still in bed! And in general you can hear the banging of doors early morning. My room must have been near a housekeeping closet, because ai often arrived to see bags of trash and/or vacuums on the hallway floor next to my door. (5) In total, the price paid, it felt merely adequate for an exhortant amount of money.",3,2023,12,09
138,Bad Service,"First night of our stay, Room heater was not working. While going out we informed the Front desk about the problem. When we got back, it was still showing 19C on the panel, outside was -2C and the room was freezing. The only solution they could find was to provide tiny heater. Which didnt help much at all! When you stay in most luxurious locations in London, you dont expext to have such major problems. They said that there were no other rooms available. Which was surprising when booking showing multiple options. Also, same night they said that they will send a technician. We agreed to welcome technician at 9 am. But nobody came till we left the hotel for breakfast. We wanted things to be fixed before having shower in freezing room. But we couldn’t!! The other day, we needed to go to front desk again, first they issued deposit twice, second to discuss heating problem. They didn’t even said sorry about the problem, like we are causing it. It was really disappointing to see such service in such place. We were there for small vacation, and we were about to get sick! Which was unexpectedly disappointing.",2,2023,12,06
138,Cosy with highest standards,"The living proof that size doesn’t matter - quality does! We had a very cosy time, enjoyed our room just as breakfast. Stuff was impeccable and professional, especially Sareed at the front desk who let us check in hours in advance when he learned I was not feeling too well. We’ll be back.",5,2023,12,03
138,Nice hotel but limited dining options for a 5 star hotel,A nice hotel with good quality accommodation offering an interesting Townhouse experience in London. I would have given a higher rating to the hotel had it not been for a problem i had dining in the hotel in the evening. The only option is to eat in the very busy and noisy Dandy bar where the service was rather to slow for dining.  My rating is in the context of this being a 5 star hotel and in the context of other 5 star hotels.,3,2023,12,01
138,Amazing!,Great hotel in great location! Stayed in deluxe room. Super comfortable bed. Quiet street though in the center of London. Very welcoming personnel and nice X-mas decoration and atmosphere! Recommended 100% I will be back! ,5,2023,11,24
138,Outstanding Hotel,"I had a wonderful stay, again, at the Townhouse on 22nd November. It’s a brilliant location and a wonderful conversation of a number of townhouses. The interiors are elegant, the rooms very well appointed but most importantly the team makes it feel like home from home. I would highly recommend a stay here.",5,2023,11,24
138,Perfect Location and everything else,This is the type of place that hotels should aspire to.  Everything about it was perfect. I loved the cabin room as I was traveling alone. The bar area is beautiful and the staff is superb. Would love to keep this secret to myself but it's too good not to share.,5,2023,11,21
138,Exceptional experience ,"It's my first time staying at The Mayfair Townhouse but I will definitely come back!
The rooms are nice and extreamly clean, the hotel itself is lovely and the location is perfect for exploring London. Last but not least the staff is extremely helpful and friendly, great professionals! At the bar ask for Randy-I can guarantee that he is making the best cocktails in the city!",5,2023,11,18
138,Fantastic hotel,"Excellent hotel with outstanding service, Duane at the Bar/restaurant was extremely friendly and helpful 
I would definitely stay here again. It made my stay in London much more pleasurable, the staff  were really friendly from the start ",5,2023,11,15
138,Small but perfectly formed.,"Generous and complimentary drinks and snacks, a nice touch. Room was small but perfectly formed with lovely decor. Very comfortable bed and amazingly quiet sleep for central London. Great staff. Excellent location.",5,2023,11,13
138,Unpretentious luxury in the heart of Mayfair!,"What a lovely hotel, greatly located just in the very centre of Mayfair. Modern and very unique design, cozy and super comfortable throughout. Great personnel, starting from the very welcoming Doorman’s to super accommodating Bar/Restaurant staff. We had a great dinner experience with Sam, most probably Senior Member of Team, being greatly informative and carrying without being too imposing or forward. He truly made a difference and allow us to feel extremely comfortable without unnecessary fuss. Food was delicious with some of the dishes as pork terrine or duck really stands out. Super clean and comfy rooms as well as the entire establishment - very well maintained. Overall, super hotel with new, less ceremonial type of luxury which, in my view, better suits a proper relaxation and true enjoyment. Very much recommended!!!",5,2023,11,12
138,Perfect stay,"We stayed in Nov 2023 for 4 days.  We had our 8 and 6 year old.    2 rooms adjoining.    Showers and rooms are very nice. Overall the stay was absolutely perfect.    From the staff to the room, I couldn’t ask for a better stay 
Downside:  a little expensive, but worth it IMO.   You get what you pay for.
Prob not an ideal hotel for very little kids but 6 onward would be ok.   Lots of cute cafe’s and restaurants around the area to walk to.

Would definitely stay again.  ",5,2023,11,08
138,All the Fun of the Mayfair,"As a first time visitor to the Mayfair Townhouse and in fact Mayfair, I  felt drawn to staying here and was charmed by the unique and unusual aspects of the Townhouse. The Dandy Bar was a delight, the cocktail Mixer was able to recommend a cocktail to suit my requirements. I  stayed in the Deluxe Room, and the reviews truly are correct it was the most comfortable bed I have ever experienced. The Breakfast really was the icing on an already incredible cake. With a vast range of options, including Chia Seed, Coconut Greek Yoghurt and the best raspberry muffins ever, they bake everything on site.  I would urge you to stay at this Hotel as I initially read the bad reviews, which in my experience are not a true reflection at all. I enjoyed my 2 nights stay so much I am already planning returning as soon as possible! ",5,2023,11,06
138,Clean and Excellent Location,Safe location and very clean hotel. Hotel staff is very friendly and most importantly the beds are sooo comfortable. Steps to Buckingham Palace to view the changing of the guards in the am was a treat. Within walking distance to cafe's and stores. Close to the Underground. Great spot!,5,2023,10,16
138,London Cocktail Week must stop destination,"Stopped by the Dandy Bar at The Mayfair Townhouse to sample their London Cocktail Week selection. T & Duane suggested I try the Out of Many. One cocktail (specifically crafted for L.C.W.) and it did not disappoint! Gorgeous, subtle citrus gin cocktail with a surprising herbal kick. Loved it. Great bar. Great service. 10/10!",5,2023,10,16
138,Great Stay/Great Bar,"My stay was most enjoyable, but what really made it great was the bar/restaurant staff. Holly, Duane, T, Randy, and Simon were all very friendly and accommodating.  They all instantly made me feel welcome and comfortable.

Wholeheartedly recommend 15 out of 10.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🖤🖤",5,2023,10,08
138,A delight,"Small,  personal and absolutely delightful.  The room is just beautiful,  the bed linen is honestly the nicest I've ever slept in.  The toiletry products are really lovely,  so much so that I brought them home with me (something I never do!)  Honestly I couldn't recommend the Mayfair Townhouse enough.  Nicest hotel I've stayed in for a long time.  Just treat yourself and stay there!",5,2023,10,08
138,London experience,"Fabulous hotel, great staff and in an excellent area for getting about.
The breakfast was varied and plentiful and the club sandwich we sampled between us in the bar was unbelievable. We could not have managed one each.
When we checked out, my husband left his laptop in the room. Riyas phoned to inform us before we even reached Kings Cross. He then arranged its return and it was back with us the next day, Quality of service that you don't find often.
Can't wait to return.

 ",5,2023,10,06
138,Great staff! ,Riyas and Simon have made out stay so enjoyable! They have been so helpful with our requests and have recommended some great places. Nabih the luggage porter handled all of our large luggage multiple times and did it with a smile. He has been so nice during our stay here. This hotel is great and the staff are amazing!! ,5,2023,10,05
138,Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair,We loved staying at this hotel for a 5 day break. We booked an Executive Room which was a nice size given the length of our trip. The room was extremely cozy and well appointed. Loved the free mini drinks and snacks bar! The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Mayfair where some of the best shopping and restaurants are nearby. ,5,2023,09,29
138,Hot and noisy tube trains,"We were only staying in London for a family birthday so we’re not going to be in the room much.
We had a classic room. 
Bijou is an understatement. 
Limited aircon so hot in a sealed box. Constantly able to hear tube trains all night.
Wouldn’t bother staying again",2,2023,09,24
138,A luxury stay,"We had a two night stay (Thurs to Sat). We arrived before 12 and were surprised (but pleased) that our room was ready, and we’d been upgraded. The mini bar was free and stocked with juices, water, fresh milk and a few snacks. There was also tea and a coffee machine. The room was very clean and comfortable, the bathroom was gorgeous and mood lighting was a nice touch. We made use of the Dandy bar and had room service for breakfast one morning, which was delicious. We stayed as a special birthday occasion and there were some special touches in the room which were appreciated. This is a lovely hotel and ideally situated for tube connections around London (Green Park station is a 5 minute walk and is served by the Victoria, Piccadilly and Jubilee lines). A pleasant stroll through the park itself is Buckingham Palace.",5,2023,09,23
138,Great boutique hotel across from Green Park,Wonderful small hotel with great bar situated 5 minute walk from Green Park subway. Park is 1/2 block away with Hyde Park nearby. Get the executive room as the Deluxe room has very little closet space.  Great restaurants and pubs are an easy walk from the hotel.,5,2023,09,19
138,The Mayfair Townhouse,I've stayed in many 5 star hotels in many countries and the experience my wife and I had at this property was exceptional.  The property is squeaqy clean and the staff is exceptional. This was our first stay at the Mayfair Townhouse it has become our favourite hotel hands down.,5,2023,09,19
138,Disappointed for a 5 star hotel,"Room was very small.  Very loud housekeepers slamming doors.  King bed was two twins pushed together with a crack in the middle, not comfortable.  TV did not work half the time.  As someone who is here frequently, there are much better hotels in the area at the same price point.",3,2023,09,18
138,Excellent - a rare find,"Excellent hotel with friendly, professional staff who provided a rare find of quality customer service.  Rooms were small but beautifully appointed.  A heated towel rail would have been useful and good for the environment to save extra towel changes.   Breakfast was also excellent. ",5,2023,09,17
138,"Amazing hotel, great location with incredible staff!","This hotel was the highlight of our stay in the UK. The staff was the difference maker! Incredibly nice, accommodating and worked to ensure our stay was great. Hotel itself is very clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable with a nice restaurant and lounge. Breakfast was very good. Wish all hotels had this level of service.",5,2023,09,16
138,Top-notch stay and ideal location ,"Absolutely loved this hotel. We stayed for four nights and start to finish cannot say enough good things. The location very close to Green Park tube was convenient, and walking distance to Piccadilly, Hyde park, Trafalgar Square and more. The hotel itself is stunning. Clean, stylishly decorated with so much attention to detail. Kudos to the team for accommodating an early check in after an international overnight flight. The room was small but functional. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had the best sleeps! The mini bar was definitely a highlight, with snacks and drinks galore to keep us going. We did not eat at the hotel but the menu and the bar looked terrific. Located just behind the hotel is shepherds market, with tons of great pubs and restaurants and steps away from Mayfair and soho area hotspots. That said, a quick sandwich from Pret a Manger to enjoy in James park across the street was a lovely experience. All in all this hotel was a highlight of trip, we’ve moved on from London, and no hotel has come close to this (wish we had finished with it, everything else is disappointing!!) we would absolutely return!",5,2023,09,10
138,Extrodinary Professionalism,"We were assigned a room that was smaller than advertised, had a view of a mechanical chase and had a two step rise to the bathroom.  The managerial staff went out of their way to assign us a different room that was satisfactory in all respects.  Further, we observed a very difficult guest in the Dandy Bar arguing with the Service Staff.  The guest was clearly at fault.  The Staff handled the situation with both extraordinary patience and professionalism.  This is our 5th stay on property and we will definitely be back.",5,2023,09,10
138,Perfect location ,"Lovely stay and perfect location. Very clean and high standard rooms. Mini bar well equipped. very comfortable bed. 
Would certainly stay here again! Gary the doorman was such a pleasure and helpful man he went above and beyond to help us and gave us lots of good advice! Will visit in the future",5,2023,09,06
138,The FABULOUS Mayfair Townhouse,"Just love this Hotel!
Part of the Iconic Luxury Hotel Group and sisters to Cliveden, Lygon Arms, Chewtonglen, and 11 Cadogan Gardens (also in London) and run under the watchful eye of Executive Director, Andrew Stembridge. 

This must be the fifth time that we chosen to  stay for various reasons: Coporate events, romantic get away, shopping, with friends, etc. 
We like go try different hotels however The Mayfair Townhouse, is a wonderfully versatile hotel -  conveniently located in Mayfair (with  safe reduced rate parking facilities minutes walk away!

The Hotel decor is fabulous and rooms well appointed, with the most fabulously comfortable beds adorned with crisp white sumptuous linen.
The breakfasts are delicious, and one is spoilt for choice – nothing is too much trouble and all catered for.

The Dandy Bar is, well, Dandy! Fabulous choice of cocktails and great service.

On the whole, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for all the reasons above and many more. The staff are wonderfully attentive and an eye for detail.",5,2023,09,05
138,Superb Stay,"Just returned from a 2 night stay and absolutely loved it. Was super impressed by breakfast offering, an excellent variety and buffet style hot options, which were excellent quality. Room was a little too hot but other than that, I can’t wait to return here.",5,2023,08,31
138,Exceptional Experience,"This was not our first trip to the hotel but it was the one that will make us keep coming back to this lovely hotel. 

Everything about our stay was exceptional from our welcome, room standard and cleanliness, breakfast - everything was outstanding. It was so nice to have some outside space in the centre of London, I was slightly worried about the construction next door but it was all well managed and I have to say we didn't experience any kind of disruption as a result of it. I think construction work in London is somewhat inevitable. 

Will definitely be returning to the hotel and would recommend to family and friends. ",5,2023,08,31
138,Fantastic! Duane for prime minister.,The Mayfair Townhouse was the last hotel we stayed at for our 6 week trip. Where do I start! This 5 star establishment has everything from the comfiest beds to the best staff! If you want to be treated like royalty do yourself a favour and book in. Better yet head down to the bar and you will get serviced by the wonderful Valeria and Duane. Have a chat to Duane and ask to try his special Yuzu Margarita. This gentleman is the life of the downstairs bar with his huge positive energy and vibe. Not to mention the service. You will not be disappointed staying at this Hotel. ,5,2023,08,29
138,Extremely noisy,"I spent 9 night in a large and clean room but right in front of the road and from 4.30am to 5.30am everyday there was some sort of delivery happening which felt like it was happening in my room!
The room Windows don't provide any sort of noise isolation. Terrible for a room facing the street...",1,2023,08,27
138,Great place to stay in the heart of London,"Comfortable rooms, a bit smaller than expected,  a/c excellent, great cleaning staff,  friendly reception staff,  efficient dining staff,  great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the concierge, Dean, was extremely helpful in a pinch!   Do I sound enthused?  I am.  Perhaps a wider selection of beer in the bar!",5,2023,08,17
138,Fantastic stay,"We loved staying at the Mayfair Townhouse!  Excellent staff, good food, fun bar and walking distance to everything.  Great suggestions for walking tours and also suggested fantastic restaurants. Can't wait to return!",5,2023,08,17
138,Nice stay except for the view…,"This was a little bit of a splurge for me and I was excited to stay here during my last three days in London. I arrived early so my room wasn’t ready but they called about an hour later to let me know I could check in. The room itself was very cozy (I stayed in a cabin room) and the bathroom was luxurious. The biggest disappointment was that I faced the back of the building and only had one small window which faced a construction zone with cranes. If I came again, I’d request a room facing Half Moon St. The food was good and the service was even better.",4,2023,08,16
138,Loved this perfect boutique hotel!,"We carefully selected the perfect accommodations for our trip to London for three nights. We were greeted by a very friendly staff assisting with luggage, check-in and recommendations for dinner in Mayfair around the corner.  Our room was on the third floor and nicely appointed with everting we needed including great AC, beverages, snacks, and plenty of sub ports. Umbrellas were in the lobby and the restaurant bar was cozy with attentive bar service. The concierge and doormen were always helpful and did a great job hailing cabs when needed. The location was great to get to the tube in a few
Minutes, stroll the park, see Buckingham Palace/changing of the guards, and have close meals in the energetic square three minutes away and near Nero Coffee for a quick hot morning beverage.  Convenient neighborhood and great service in a well kept property!  I’d come back in a heartbeat!!",5,2023,08,15
138,Great stay ,"Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. Staff really great, special mention to the concierge Gary, really lovely and very helpful during our 4 night stay. 
We didn't eat at the hotel but had some lovely cocktails in Dandy's bar. 
Room serviced really well each day even replacing fresh robes which was a nice touch. Rooms a little on the small size, but we it's what you pay for central London. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2023,08,14
138,Best concierge! Best food,Loved my stay! Loved the INCREDIBLE recommendations from Ruyas! Went to restaurants he recommended and was tremendously hospitable. Can’t wait to stay again! The gentlemen working the bar were phenomenal as well,5,2023,08,14

138,5 Stars!,"My family and I’s experience at the Mayfair Townhouse was amazing. From Gary’s warm greeting upon our arrival to the gentleman at Reception helping me with our reservation, we have a marvelous time. The staff at the Dandy Bar were so much fun that we ate there for dinner multiple nights. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back to visit this lovely establishment.",5,2023,08,12
138,Wonderful Head Concierge and team !,My daughter and all of the family are very happy with the  excellent service provided by Concierge Riyas.  The location and the breakfast is amazing!! we will surely come back. All the staff are very helpful!!,5,2023,08,12

138,5* stay in the heart of London,"Absolutely beautiful, luxury hotel. Even the entry rooms have plenty of space and complimentary mini bars for a stay to remember. Concierge team were very knowledgable of the area, with some great recommendations. Both breakfast and late night bar team were very friendly and attentive. ",5,2023,08,11
138,We will return often.,"A wonderfully tasteful and quintessentially English hotel perfectly located on a quiet street but within walking distance of nearly everything. Our room was on the ground level, which was a little different. Our room was small but designed so well that it didn't impact us. It had loads of closet space and a lovely sitting area. The king bed was sublime. Wonderful bedding. The bathroom was also small, but first-rate in all respects. The shower and water pressure were a real treat. The bar and restaurant were lovely. Our only complaint was the noise outside our room of the laundry being sent off around 4:30 AM. I needed earplugs to overcome this. The hotel should offer these. Still, the staff was helpful and responsive. We will absolutely make this our go-to hotel in London.",5,2023,08,01
138,Not great..,"Stayed with a friend here last week. Service by the reception manager Antonina was no good at all she was rude and unhelpful on phone when we asked to change rooms. The doorman was just standing there playing with his phone. 

Service by Duane in the Dandy Bar was fantastic as well as the concierge Simone. 

Would we return? Not to stay because of the service we received but, we would visit the Dandy bar because of the service.",2,2023,07,30
138,Dandyland,Very smart male staff on reception and door . Room very comfortable especially the bed was.wonderful and comfy. Nobody told us how to get to our room so we worked it out. The room had everything I needed for a good night and the morning tea and shower.,5,2023,07,29

The hotel staff were really accommodating, our room was well furnished , the view was a bit poor , but the quality of the place was great . Ample room for us and very well appointed.. even a free minibar .. ! The bar on site is well stocked , we had a nightcap there before bed , and the staff really make the difference .. every person we interacted with was kind and helpful  and professional .. a lovely stay and we will definitely be back",5,2023,07,25

138,fantastic service and location in london,the best and most convenient location with 5 star service- was here for business and with family the hotel is terrific- everyone at the front desk i nice and it feels like a small luxury hotel-  the mayfair has shopping cloise to green park and buckingha palace also super convenient to the west end!,5,2023,07,17
138,Great for work or pleasure,"Exceptional service at this desirably located Mayfair hotel.  The lobby bar is spectacular led by Duane's impeccable service.  He made our 3 night stay there very memorable.  The hotel reception worked diligently to accommodate an early check-in and overall our experience would lead us to visit again.  Thanks, Duane!!!",5,2023,07,14
138,Six Nights at the Mayfair Townhouse,"We enjoyed our stay at the Mayfair Townhouse. The location was perfect for us and the staff was engaging and very helpful. we used the hotel as our base for six days of events including one day at Wimbledon, multiple museum visits, lunches and dinners scattered around London and long treks throughout the city. The proximity to the Green Park Underground station was a big plus.",5,2023,07,11
138,superb,"Another fabulous stay at The Mayfair Townhouse for me. This time for a week as my home base while I ran the London Marathon and then back after that for the Coronation. Could not have chosen a better spot for both of these events. Every single staff member is top rate, so friendly and helpful.",5,2023,07,11
138,I'll be back...,"Awww I miss this hotel already. had a brilliant vibe and great crew running it. from lazying in my room with great selection of mini bar treats to being in the dandy bar and devouring a great burger and some bubbles, my whole 8 night experience made coming back to work worth it.
thanks all and see you next time!",5,2023,07,10
138,Popped in for cocktails,"Having stayed here several times we were in the area and decided to pop in for cocktails Saturday lunchtime. The service is good. There were tables available. The cocktails were good. This is a lovely hotel in a great location, we will definitely be back.",4,2023,07,09
138,Really friendly and professional team,"I booked direct from Australia, the booking process was great. The hotel is in a perfect location for The West End, when we checked in we were treated like individuals, and made welcome,room was perfectly adequate and immaculate with great shower. Breakfasts were just right, strongly recommended ",5,2023,07,08
138,I wish we had booked a different hotel,"Breakfast was good from a food perspective but the service was non existent. The room smelt lovely and was ready ahead of check in time which was a nice surprise. Our anniversary was also noted and mentioned and followed up in the room with a message and sweet treats.  The bathroom and shower was fantastic.

Whilst checking in for our anniversary, the lady next to us was very loudly told how they had upgraded her. We were then given what must have been the smallest room in the place! It had stairs in and had approximately 1square meter of floor space. This room was just too small for two people and due to the unusual lay out quite annoying. There wasn't even room to walk around the bed, you had to climb over the other person, and the wardrobe had no long hanging space at all despite being a double, so if you had dresses to hang (I did) you were unlucky! 

There was also no turn down service, which we hadn't appreciated and had thought fresh towels would be provided. There was a free mini bar which was nice but it wasn't replenished daily, which when you only have one small bottle of still water between two of you to last two days wasn't great. 

When I mentioned the room on check out I was told it was because it was a converted town house. I have stayed in this type of hotel before and never have I experienced such a small room. Given it was a two night stay for a special occasion we wished we had booked a different hotel.

138,Townhouse luxury. Just what we needed.,"We have wanted to stay here for a while now but never had an opportunity until our 2nd wedding anniversary weekend just gone when my wife and I had tickets for P!nk in Hyde Park. The choice was obvious and such a fabulous, central location but perfectly peaceful at the same time. You can see why it is now part of the Iconic Hotel Group. Approaching the building it is stunning in design. Walking in through the entrance to clean, cool and classic colours, a real vibe to the place. Super friendly and polite staff making you feel already like a VIP (a true Iconic hotels thing… making you feel special from the moment of check in). Our room was on the third floor and to our absolute delight when we walked in, spacious, huge bed (very very comfortable!) gorgeous bathroom and all in total keeping of the townhouse style. Beautifully clean! Duane in the Dandy Bar downstairs made us a delicious, refreshing cocktail after our long journey (try the Satin Sheets cocktail). He was so lovely, chatting to us to see what we might like. I think he could probably make you anything you’d like the cocktail list was just a guide. Very relaxing in the bar area, gorgeous decor. We only stayed the one night and breakfast the following morning was delicious (lots of choice). We will be back! Thank you so much everyone for making our wedding anniversary so so special xxx ",5,2023,06,27
138,Must stay,"The hotel is outstanding. Professional front desk, super clean room, location perfect for proximity to important sites.  You get what you pay for. Can’t wait to go back to this hotel in the future. You will love it at this hotel. ",5,2023,06,27
138,Brilliant London Hotel!,"Wonderful location, wonderful room, fantastic breakfast and amazing staff. Would highly recommend. The team seemed to really love their job and all get along which was lovely to see.

The rooms are well set out and the beds are so comfy! 

Ideally placed for getting around London.

Staff simply fab!",5,2023,06,26
138,Mayfair Gem,The Mayfair Townhouse is a delightful gem accessible to everything- but tucked away on a quiet street across from Green Park. The service from the second you are at the door is impeccable- and the quality of all furnishings and amenities - top notch. However- the real gem is the Dandy Bar. Our first night we stopped for a glass of wine - tired and ready for bed. However we met Valeria and her talented friends behind the bar. Two hours later we were all laughing and the best of friends. Our last evening we chose to stay in and just eat in the Dandy Bar after a full day out. And there was Valeria full of smiles and laughter along with the rest of the crew. People are what make things memorable. The Mayfair will always hold a special place for us! Thanks Valeria!,5,2023,06,24
138,Best Hotel Experience,The hotel was absolutely amazing! Perfect location to everything. The staff is incredibly helpful and nice. The Dandy Bar is also amazing and great for drinks! They were very helpful in helping us get to our tour destinations and had a great breakfast. We highly recommend!,5,2023,06,24
138,Not a 5 star experience,"Pros: The location of the hotel is excellent.
Cons: Tiny and often noisy rooms, although this is not uncommon in London. The main problem with the Mayfair Townhouse is that while is considered a 5 star hotel it does not provide 5 star service. Depending on which staff you interact with you may be met with either politeness or dismissive borderline rudeness. It is simply unacceptable for a hotel in this class.",3,2023,06,22
138,Excellent hotel and perfect location,"The Mayfair hotel is well worth the stay. It's in an excellent location and close to all the major locations (perfect for first timers). Extremely attentive and friendly staff, well sized, cool rooms all make it worth while.

One minor recommendation is to assist with early check-in options / related service. Other than that, this is an outstanding hotel!",5,2023,06,21
138,Incredible hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"I have never stayed at a hotel with a more charming bar. The drinks are superb, the service is excellent, but more than anything it's the men who work in the bar (The Dandy Bar) that made the experience what it was. The BEST hotel bar I have ever been to, all thanks to the wonderful staff. I highly highly recommend staying at The Mayfair Townhouse and going to the bar right inside the lobby.",5,2023,06,21
138,Welcoming and accommodating,Staff was so welcoming and accommodating of my large family of 11.  Food was excellent and very family friendly.  Location was perfect and transportation was a breeze…also great restaurants within walking distance.,5,2023,06,19

The front desk, doormen and each of the staff there make you feel appreciated and are eager to make your stay pleasant.  The restaurant and bar have wonderful food and drinks.  The rooms are quaint and just what one would need after a busy day in London.  Just a beautiful place to stay!",5,2023,06,11
138,Fantastic Mayfair Hotel,"Absolutely brilliant hotel. From the concierge and reception to the bar staff. The interior of the hotel is very chic and modern whilst being intimate at the same time. 

We were upgraded to a deluxe room which has a fantastic large and comfy bed. Particularly enjoyed the complementary mini bar and snack.

Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2023,06,10
138,"Great hotel, better service by T",T  is an unbelievable asset to the Mayfair. This is my third trip here and he’s made the experience that much more enjoyable. He’s welcoming and engages with you. It seems like everyone around the hotel enjoys his company. Do not let him go. ,5,2023,06,07
138,Great service by T,"T is amazing. Got me dessert after hours. So amazing. Great service we love all of the workers here. So sweet and kind. And very entertaining, a great small boutique hotel with fantastic people that make you feel at home. ",5,2023,06,07
138,Best Drinks & Company @ The Dandy Bar,"I cannot say enough good things about my experience at The Mayfair Townhouse! The piece that set it apart was The Dandy Bar.  D-Money and Cup of T we re beyond gracious and made sure I had good company while sitting solo.  Thomas (Casanova) made one of the best Mezcal drinks (the KDizzy) I’ve ever had! 
The 2nd night I had the pleasure of also meeting Duane the Pain, Vamshi, Sam,  & Pierre. Another evening full of great drinks and impeccable company!  Service was perfect both nights!
You have one top notch group working for you over at The Mayfair Townhouse!  My only regret is that I only stayed 2 nights",5,2023,06,07

138,Perfect Boutique Hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Lovely stay at this hotel, with a great location! I felt welcomed and the staff was very friendly and warm. It is in the middle of the nice area Mayfair and easy to get to the Underground.Bus as well as right across from Green park and close to all of the sights. The bed is super comfortable. The only issue I had (if it is really an issue) is that the hair dryer or shower never got hot enough.",5,2023,05,30
138,Great location. ,"Great location very central for shopping, theatres and dining out.
We had a deluxe room which had a super comfy bed that was really big. There was a table and 2 chairs that were squeezed in and meant to get round the bed you banged your leg as the gap between bed and chair was very small. Also if you squeezed into the corner you banged your head on the light!!
Complimentary snacks, juices and water was very nice.
The bathroom was very small with only a shower and the shower door opened directly onto the corner of the marble sink, so you couldn’t get the door fully open and had to squeeze past the loo. A sliding door would have worked better.
The staff were all friendly and welcoming, Tom the porter was super helpful and went above and beyond to get us a cab for our dinner booking.
We were disappointed at how early the car closed, I expected it to be open beyond 10.30pm for residents. The only
Option is a fairly limited room service menu & the receptionist at night seemed very unsure of the menu.
Breakfast was good with a good selection of hot and cold options but you felt like you were pushed through, as tables were cleared before you finished without being asked!
Perhaps some more experienced staff are needed.",4,2023,05,29
138,Valeria and Duane made our evening!,"Excellent service and a really lovely space. The wonderful Valeria and Duane really helped us find our alter-egos. Best drinks, amazing menu and a lovely welcoming team. Would recommend to anyone looking for a charming drink after dinner in Mayfair. We'll be back for sure.",5,2023,05,28
138,Looking forward to returning!,We loved our stay!  Staff was superb from start to finish. Concierge did a great job of guiding us around London and at the end of the day we looked forward to having wonderful cocktails at the Dandy Bar with our great waiter Duane and the entire staff!  Duane should be working at Buckingham Palace but the King’s loss was our gain. ,5,2023,05,27
138,Great for Business dinner!,"Went for a business dinner last week and loved it. The atmosphere was great, the food comforty and well executed. The chicken Yakitori was a great success so were the burgers!! I will definitely return. ",5,2023,05,22

138,Thomas the Mixologist with his secret mix not advertised. Don’t be afraid to ask.,"I cannot rave enough about Thomas our bartender! We arrived here every night for drinks after dinner. Our experience at the tables with T and Samuel were wonderful but once we hung out at the bar, while watching him make his magic. After he made us what we were interested in, he presented us a few of his own concoctions, which really tickled our fancy. A few of the ladies asked why his drinks are not shown on the menu. I agreed that management should place them for others to enjoy. Several of them were lovely summery drinks which reminded me of the beach or enjoying pool side sun. 

We returned a few times to experiment with several more. He made a cocktail with his own ingredients he created by mixing the zest of a brown lime he prepared himself and few other items which brought out some flavors I never knew I had. One we named on the spot with him called the Lady D. 

I highly Recommend going to the bar and asking Thomas, who has a nice outgoing personality to make one of his creations or maybe it will be on the menu by the time we return. He has a talent for thinking outside the box with his incredible creativity and adaptability. He’s very knowledgeable about different concoctions and quick to prepare while still keeping conversations going. Real crowd pleaser. Either way he will not disappoint.",5,2023,05,09
138,Vacation ,"Hotel exceeded expectations. room was laid out well, quiet and loved the free minibar. Great location and close to a tube stop. Would definitely return and would highly recommend to others. Oh and the bed was delightful!",5,2023,05,05

138,Dank Dandyz,"My man T-bone was amazing, he kept our night popping. Very friendly and was very attentive. Definitely had some good reccomendations. Speaking of, shout out to the kitchen, you guys killed it on the food. 10/10 you should keep cooking forever. Dandy Randy behind the bar was like a mix master. He was shaking the shakers like Shakira in her prime. 11/10 fantastic skills. Pierre was also great behind the bar, he gave a lot of fun reccomendations and really knew what he was doing. Doowayne was a great help tonight as well, very attentive. He was like the flash, coming up outta no where to help out. Very great service out of him tonight. Overall this is a fantastic bar and anyone would have entirely too much fun here. Don't come if you want a boring night, good vibes only. ",5,2023,05,01
138,"T-Pain, D-Man, Pierre, and the Randy Dandy Bar Experience",T-pain was the best part of this experience. This bar has awesome vibes and great staff. The drinks were flowing and the laughs were a coming. Randy Dandy has the best drink suggestions and concoctions. Pierre was a great addition to the team. D-man was just vibes. Overall great experience and this bar should be visited by anyone looking for a fun night.,5,2023,05,01
138,7 days of Paradise,"The Mayfair Townhouse is fabulous. From the time of booking to the moment of checkout, we were looked after with genuine warmth and professionalism by the MTH team. Special mention must be made of the concierge team of Lee, Darren and Simon whose impressive knowledge and willingness to assist has been unmatched by that of any other hotel team I have encountered.

The hotel itself is charming and well-appointed, and ideally located in the heart of Mayfair. The famous Dandy Bar lives up to expectations, with a great selection of drinks made by expert bartenders, reliably tasty food and a vibrant atmosphere.
We cannot fault our stay at The Townhouse- it really enhanced our seven-night stay in London, and we are so looking forward to returning",5,2023,04,30

There was a warm greeting and I was thankful to have our luggage taken to our room (do tip). It was lovely to enter and be met with a birthday message, balloons and a sweet treat. The hotel is tastefully decorated and our room was comfortable and quiet. The bedding was lush.  There was a large walk in shower, tea & coffee and complimentary snacks. 
The cocktails in the Dandy Bar were great - we needed a ‘pick me up’ to prepare for our night ahead. The lovely staff suggested a couple of drinks, not on the menu, and which we’d not tried before. I loved my ‘Angel Face’ and the ‘Adonis’ was great too. 
All the staff were friendly and helpful. Its location is excellent for restaurants within a short walk.",5,2023,04,23

138,Lovely stay at the Mayfair Townhouse,"We had a wonderful stay at the Mayfair. From check-in to the last night of our stay, we were very impressed. Everyone was so kind and helpful. The doorman, the front desk, the bartenders, and the kind man that took  our luggage and put it in our room.  We were always greeted as we walked through the hotel and we were given excellent restaurant recommendations. The room was comfortable and had all the amenities we could want. It is very accessible to the Green Park Underground station. We would highly recommend staying here. ",5,2023,04,21
138,A gem,"The Mayfair Townhouse was a pleasure. I stayed for four nights on business. The location was perfect for seeing London. The room

138,Five stars for Mayfair hidden gem!,"I booked two Deluxe rooms for a very special birthday celebration:
Two mums and two teenage daughters.
The two girls were celebrating their 13th birthdays.
From the moment of contacting the hotel to arrange the visit until checkout after the weekend, the staff at every level were brilliant: friendly, warm, engaging, professional.
I had mentioned that it was the girls' birthdays and on arrival, both girls were welcomed with a happy birthday message in chocolate with macarons to enjoy and balloons!

The attention to detail was wonderful.
The friendliness of all staff at every level to ensure a happy and memorable stay was beyond all expectation.

The bar is funky cool!
Cocktails and mocktails were enjoyed.

The breakfast was of the highest of standards and delicious.

Quite rare I would think in a West End hotel to have this level of personal service and interest shown in every guest.
Five stars to everyone!
We are delighted to recommend this wonderful hidden gem just off Piccadilly.

138,Spring break,"Hotel is clean, very conveniently located.  The staff is wonderful, especially their Concierge staff!  Lee & Simon were wonderful and made the entire trip move smoothly.

138,Fabulous stay. I loved everything about it.,"Lovely hotel, great location for visiting the main attractions, or avoiding them. On the door step of lovely Shepherds Market, Green Park, Buckingham Palace etc. 

The hotel itself hits all the right spots . Service, decor, comfortable etc. The beds are huge but the rooms are quite small as always in London. 

London itself is always a joy. Culture, cuisine , history, diversity, friendliness.

Love it.",5,2023,02,21

Thank you so much and really looking forward to visiting you again",5,2023,02,18
138,"Cozy place in good location, with small rooms","The Townhouse is in a small and quiet street, in a perfect location in Mayfair. Close to Green Park subway and the key attractions, this makes it an ideal place for any London visit. The hotel is stitched together from a number of houses, thus if you walk along the corridors, you encounter stairs and nooks, where buildings were connected. This gives it a cozy flair, but can be a bit annoying if you bring along a suitcase. The standard rooms are small but nice, the low ceilings are a bit special. What I liked is that the noise isolation is very good, you neither hear the street nor the neighbours. Just be aware that they also have rooms on the ground floor - those with two-digit numbers - that I wouldn't recommend.

Staff is very friendly and did their best to make me feel welcome.",4,2023,02,17
138,Great Location!,"A superb hotel all around.  Perfect location for a walk to many tourist attractions.  Also a block from the tube if you have a longer journey.  Very comfortable and stylish.

138,Best bar and great location!,"This is central and walkable to everywhere you’d want to be in London. And every night, we had hand crafted cocktails made to perfection by Thomas.

138,Valentines Cocktails,My husband and I went for cocktails to celebrate Valentines Day and we were mighty impressed by Duane and the attentive service we received.

138,"Location, staff and service of an exceptional calibre","Stayed here in 3 rooms  for 5 nights 2 weeks ago with our grown up family on their first trip to Europe. Everyone from the front-desk - Gary, Lee,Stacy,Darren and the manager with his lovely dog helped the Australians  negotiate the vagaries of a freezing London winter. Nothing was too much trouble. Location super central - I can highly recommend Jeru restaurant which Lee on the desk sent us to - my son says best meal he had in 5 weeks.The rooms were spacious, immaculate and breakfast more than sufficient  for 2x30 yo 6ft4inch males. A highlight was Mr T and staff in the cocktail bar. Stay dandy as they say and we will be returning-  however without kids!",5,2023,02,02
138,A mini luxury break in London,"We booked into this genuinely warm, friendly and fabulous Mayfair hotel for 1 night when meeting family in London.

The breakfast was great with a good choice for all.
Overall this was the best London hotel we have stayed in with a charm and cosiness that was a delight along with service that could not be faulted.   Superb.",5,2023,01,29
138,Gem of a hotel,"The Mayfair Townhouse is a gem. Exactly what I was seeking in a hotel that is cozy/charming, but operates as a well-oiled machine. During my recent trip to London and one where I split my stay between 3 hotels, this one certainly had the most character.

Love the convenient location, but that it's tucked away on Half Moon Street away from the fray. A plethora of conveniences just outside the door: coffee, meal options. Not to mention, a stone's throw away from Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly. I loved my daily walks.

Room was very comfortable and the small but efficient Dandy Bar adjacent to the lobby was a great respite be it for some work, or having a drink to wind down the night.",5,2023,01,29
138,"Great vibe, superb service, and comfy rooms.","Excellent service. The staff goes above and beyond. Reception has always been efficient and caring. Concierge is top notch.

138,Great experience at great location,"Spent 5 days here for the new year, the check in is amazing and fast as they gave me the room before check-in time, the room was clean and furniture was new and clean (I had cabin room), room was not that big and enough for one person (if have no big luggage and quick trip), I upgraded my room to Deluxe room, it was big and have more space for luggage. Hotel offered a complimentary minibar (non alcoholic beverage). Gym is great, and have brand new equipments. House keeping service are very good too. I requested a late check out and they were flexible with that too. Overall I recommend this hotel as it had a great location, reasonable price, nice gym, great service.",5,2023,01,10
138,Dissapointing,"About the hotel, service and more
We rarely complain but this is well deserved.
 
Upgrade
We upgraded the room to a junior suite in advance.
I specifically asked in a mail about view and space. We where concerned about the views that where complained about from unsatisfied guests on the internet. Unfortunately we got the exact same room with tiny windows (top height 150cm) facing a cramped atrium with a brickwall within 3m.
We complained about this but where informed about bad views from all rooms.
A street view isn’t a bad view and we would have been pleased by at least receiving this.
 
The room
Unfortunately the bathroom was colder than the fridge for the whole stay. We complained about it the first day. Your first fix was to tune in the general heating of the room to 30degrees c (thermostat). We didn’t want a sauna in our room to get normal temperature in our bathroom
The second day the caretaker tried to fix it without success blaming the cold weather and capacity of the heating system. It was still not working by the time we left.
There was also an overload in one of the wire in the closet which we complained about. I didn’t get fixed either.
 
The service
The service the first night in the reception was strange. It’s  what we would call polite-unpolite. I told about our issues with the view and the cold bathroom but the response was indifferent.
 
The bar
Was an interesting visit. The first night we spent a couple of hours in the bar. There was 1 bartender and 3 waiters
+ 4 guest, me and my wife. They had trouble serving the few guests and twice forgot which table had ordered what.
In a way charming… But its not so charming when the smell of sweat is stronger than the odour of my wifes perfume. Not so Dandy in my eyes…. The drinks where good though.
 
         Summary
I understand and respect the policies of the hotel.
For a successful stay in our sake it’s better for to pay double price and be satisfied than being irritated by bad conditions and service. We experienced our concerns trying to be wiped away instead of solving the issues.
We where not pleased with our stay or how the staff solved(or didn’t) our issues/problems.
 
NB! The concierge was a nice guy with excellent service and knowledge about restaurants and places to visit.
 
In the end one bad review counts more than one hundred good ones.
This time I feel for publishing it.
-Because they deserve it.
 
And we know: of course this is first world problems… Even though. This is the business they are in",1,2023,01,06
138,The Dandy Bar,Loved the mezcal grapefruit cocktail Randy made! It was so good. Everyone at The Dandy Bar was fantastic! My room was very cute & I loved the heated floors. I will definitely stay there again. What a lovely hotel.,5,2023,01,03
138,Lobby Bar,"Came here for drinks in the lobby bar and the staff was so friendly and welcoming! Duane was incredible - very attentive and great drink recommendations! Espresso martinis were amazing, highly recommend. ",5,2023,01,02
138,Fabulous hotel!,"I booked this hotel through United airlines and I’m so happy I did! I booked the cabin room as I was traveling solo and didn’t require a lot of space  - it is so cute, comfortable & stylish as is the entire property. The staff here could not be more helpful and friendly. Shout out to the amazing bar staff! - Rheon, Randy, Thomas & Dowayne - thanks for my super pretty, super delicious cocktails! 
Will return for sure (actually didn’t want to leave!)",5,2023,01,02
138,Charming Hotel,"Charming Hotel in a perfect area of the city, on a quiet street.
The amenities are exactly what you need. The property is well maintained very clean, and staff pays attention to detail from a housekeeping perspective.
Staff is delightful, very helpful in all areas, dining, bar, front desk and concierge.
Very inviting and warm.",5,2022,12,28
138,Christmas Holiday,Great place!  Great staff.  Great location.  We visit London frequently and will definitely be back.   The staff in the Dandy are to be accommodated.  They are friendly and could not do enough for you.  The guys at the door would walk to the corner in the rain to hail taxis so that we would not get wet.  It has become our property of choice.,5,2022,12,28
138,Thomas at the Mayfair Townhouse Lobby Bar.,BEST BAR in London. IMPECCABLE service. Craft cocktails and FABULOUS drinks. Great location. MUST DO while in London! Concierge is amazing. Scheduled dinner reservations and private transportation on moments notice. Front desk staff is friendly and knowledgeable.,5,2022,12,27
138,Wonderful holiday weekend for two,"I cannot give enough stars for this review. The staff here has been exceptional. Thomas. Is an outstanding bartender and host. This morning, Christmas Day we had a gift from “Santa”. Everyone here is welcoming, helpful and truly Outstanding. Thank you Mayfair for making these Floridians Christmas extra special. ",5,2022,12,25
138,The perfect Mayfair hotel,"Only good things to say about this hotel. The service was really good. The staff was super friendly and helpful - and breakfast was excellent.
Easy to get to and really central to all London activities :))",5,2022,12,23
138,2 stay review,"Staff are great, friendly and helpful.
Rooms are tiny other than the suites, no hanging space for dresses or longer clothes.
Location is good, beds are comfy, food is good and so is the hotel atmosphere. 
",4,2022,12,23
138,Reccomend!,We stayed for a honeymoond and the staff left a note in our bathroom and gave us free range of the minibar which was a nice touch. Staff was attentive and location is great just a few blocks from the underground. Would go back!,5,2022,12,22
138,SHORT BREAK WITH FAMILY IN LONDON PRIOR TO CHRISTMAS 2023 ,"Great hotel in centre of London within walking distance of lots of visitor  attractions and historic buildings. Lovely beds, rooms, breakfast buffet , bar and staff! No problems at all. We had a family get together based on staying here in run up to Christmas. I will definitely return ",5,2022,12,21
138," Beware","All very clean and beautifully presented. The ‘free’ minibar with a suite is very misleading as there is absolutely no alcohol which is complimentary!
There is a scam going on in the bar as we were asked to sign 3 times for the same drinks! I spoke to the Night Manager who said we were not the first to complain….
Beware!
We shall sadly not go back as the financial skullduggery was unacceptable ",3,2022,12,21
138,Great location!,"Great place to stay that is central to most holiday attractions in Central London.  The classic room is cozy but a little tight for a couple.  Still, the staff was friendly and the place was very well kept!",5,2022,12,20
138,Incredible Bar Experience,"Where do I begin. I suppose I’ll begin with Thomas, who gave us what I can only describe as a life altering drinking experience. We ordered margaritas, but each successive drink (we had a few) had nuance, grace, complexity, and sophistication - much like the creator himself. 

If you happen to have the opportunity to have Duane as your bartender, I hope you buckle your seatbelt. The level of class and curstomer service will send you right through the proverbial windshield. 

I can’t say enough about these two - and in truth, the entire staff working the bar here. If you happen to be in London, and don’t stop by this bar, then we’re you actually in London at all? I say no.",5,2022,12,19
138,Incredible experience!,The staff at Mayfair is amazing! Our rooms were clean and cozy. Great location to everything. We had a floor room and it was quiet! Will be back and will highly recommend to others! Thank you for a wonderful stay! ,5,2022,12,18
138,Amazing bar!!,"Duane and Thomas were fantastic and provided excellent service from the time we entered the bar. Amazing, creative drinks in a wonderfully ‘20s atmosphere. We had the Satin Sheets, a specialty of the bar, and I would 100% recommend it!

Viva La Tequila!",5,2022,12,18
138,Excellent stay,"Booked for a family weekend before Christmas and we cannot  recommend this hotel enough, from location, comfort, food and the friendly and attentive staff. Bedrooms were very comfortable. Will definitely return in 2023",5,2022,12,18
138,The amaizing ad hoc place!,"Amazing service; they made it feel like my extended living room. Drinks are amazing, the service goes beyond amazing. 

When you are here - ask for Duané (floor host) and Mr. T (also an amazing floor host)! 

Skål - och njut av en underbar kväll! ",5,2022,12,15
138,Dandy Bar,"Thomas behind the bar and duane W on the floor are a killer team rocking the dandy bar, amazing  drinks spot on service , just the perfect place to grab a drink chill or maybe finish some work

 

PS: its my second time here.",5,2022,12,15
138,Mayfair Townhouse,"friendly, helpful and professional service. Clean and comfortable rooms. Cabin rooms are pretty tiny and kind of overpriced, but ok for three nights. The beds are really comfortable. We would definitely return.",5,2022,12,15
138,The Mayfair Townhouse,"Arriving at the Mayfair my daughter and I were met by Gary who was very charming and took us up to our room. He was pleasant and made us feel special during entire stay! The concierge Darren was beyond helpful on suggestions and my daughter said he was the kindest person she’s ever met! Not to mention, a very quick wit of humor! We enjoyed our stay and the beds were amazingly comfortable and we slept well. Upon checkout we were graciously attended to by G and Gary and left feeling we would definitely visit here again! 
",5,2022,12,15
138,Truly Magical,"We had the most wonderful stay at The Mayfair Townhouse. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful, especially Gary the head doorman who was a complete star. 

We loved the bar which was buzzy and had a really friendly vibe. We enjoyed chatting to other guests and drank amazing cocktails. 

Our room was beautiful and it may have been the comfiest bed ever. Along with the staff, it’s the attention to detail in this hotel is what makes it stand out, from the brass foxes on the doors to the gorgeous peacock themed Christmas decorations. 

I can’t recommend The Mayfair Townhouse highly enough and will most definitely return!",5,2022,12,11
138,Superb Bar & Staff!,"I visited the Dandy Bar in the hotel in December 2022 and I was highly impressed with the drinks and especially the staff/servers.  They were very attentive, professional and engaging especially Duane or Dwayne (not sure on the spelling).   I ordered a classic Woodford Reserve Rye Old Fashioned and it was superb.  I highly recommend this bar for a relaxing sophisticated drinking experience.  ",5,2022,12,09
138,A beautiful hotel in a wonderful location,"The Mayfair Townhouse is a lovely hotel, really well styled and thought through. It is in a great part of town perfect for exploring Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Hyde Park. 
The rooms are not huge and the storage was a little lacking, even some coat hooks would be helpful. Whist there are little improvements nothing detracted from our stay and we would certainly stay again. ",4,2022,12,09
138,Great hotel,"Everything was perfect! And special thanks to Dwayne who masters the hospitality that every 5 star hotel should have.

Elegantly furnished rooms, helpful staff and central location, highly recommended.",5,2022,12,08
138,Lovely hotel and a star at the bar!,A lovely hotel with very friendly staff. I stayed on business for a week and returned a week later for a night. Duane is an absolute star .. a complete credit to the hotel and hospitality business.. every hotel needs a Duane!! ,4,2022,12,08
138,James Blunt Fox & Pheasant Lunch,"Such a lovely hotel, beautiful rooms, great location, easy access for Green Park station and Green Park and the staff were really friendly. Breakfast was amazing I had Eggs Benedict and it was delicious. I would highly recommend staying i n this hotel.",5,2022,12,08
138,Family trip to visit Winder Wonderland,An absolutely excellent place to stay located right in the heart of Mayfair.  They are business and children friendly and make you feel so welcome while providing exceptional service throughout your stay.,5,2022,12,06
138,Rude and Disrespectful staff,Never have I ever been insulted by a hotel staff as I have in this place. Most unhelpful. Most rude. Most disrespectful. To the point where I had to take my belongings and leave. And when I asked to speak to the manager on duty I am told by the reception staff she is the manager on duty. Unbelievably unhelpful insulting and disrespectful.,1,2022,12,04
138,Great Stay The Mayfair  way,"Great, location, great breakfast,  clean and spacious rooms and big comfy beds. The staff was friendly and the ambiance was really relaxing. Close to restaurants and lots of shopping. The price wasn't bad.",5,2022,12,04
138,Fabulous bar and hotel!!,What a fabulous bar with great service!! The cocktails are delightful and the staff in the bar second to none…my favourite was Duane W who was just a star…so friendly and funny too! 5 star!!  They even made a cocktail to suit! Wonderful!,5,2022,12,02
138,***Definitely not a 5 star property,"I was disappointed in this hotel, which I would never consider a 5-star hotel. The only upside -  location in Mayfair,. The pictures are VERY misleading about the rest of the hotel. It  looks rundown even though it's relatively new. this is disgusting - but we had dirty sheets in one room (urine) and dirty towels in the other ! This was our last stay on a 12 day trip through the UK and our trip ended on such  a bad note. The staff was the most unfriendly we came across throughout our entire trip. We booked months ago and our only request for twin beds wasn’t honored - and even when requested upon arrival- they said they would be to our room in an hour, never came. No apology, seemed we were bothering them ? There was no sense of luxury or thoughtfulness. With so many options in London- we will stay somewhere else for our next trip.",1,2022,11,29
138,Cute Cozy Fun! ,This hotel is amazing. It is in a great location it has a very very bar the champagne is amazing and the staff is wonderful! I only stayed one night but it was worth it. I do love the fact the hotel is smaller...enjoy your stay! ,5,2022,11,27
138,Disgusting breakfast,"This hotel, predicated on luxury, produced the worst breakfast we have ever eaten at a hotel. Nothing from the hot buffet was warm - have you ever tried to eat a stone cold fried egg? It’s disgusting! Over cooked dried up vestige of a full English. Powdered scrambled egg again cold. We may have enjoyed a reasonable room and a late night drink but the lasting legacy of this hotel was the disgusting food",1,2022,11,21
138,Good location,"The negative is only the size of the classic rooms, they are small! Could only have 1 person in the bathroom. The bed super king size is great, can just walk round it though! The wardrobe… well it’s not really, it’s a cupboard with hangers, not deep enough to even hang a shirt in! The rooms at the front have the windows sealed, so can’t get fresh air in. A little on the claustrophobic side. The positive however, is it’s a great location, great staff, very attentive and the cocktail bar is wonderful. Will definitely try the other Iconic hotels.",3,2022,11,21
138,Upmarket prices for tiny rooms and poor service,"15 minutes check in time, malfunctioning credit card terminals. Avoid rooms on ground floor and in particular room 21, a basement room without daylight and a bathroom so tiny a male Dane had to walk in sideways. I had to relocate the furniture to be able to open my Rimowa carry on luggage.",1,2022,11,17
138,Home from Home Experience,"We had a great stay everyone at the Hotel welcomed us, all the staff were extremely professional and helpful but most of all human with a sense of humour, big shout out to the team at the Bar who engaged brilliantly.. just a shame most of them were Arsenal fans !",5,2022,11,15
138,Elegant Getaway,"This was our first visit to the Mayfair Townhouse and we will, no doubt, visit again. We were very warmly welcomed and throughout our 3 days were consistently greeted and made to feel at home. A special mention to Mr. D Muylders (Head Concierge) who helped us secure a car despite a tube strike. We made it to our party without a hiccup!! The staff in the lobby bar were also a delight and very personable. 
The elegance and decor were top notch and we loved every detail. 
Well done and we look forward to coming back again.",5,2022,11,15
138,Excellent stay,"My first stay in this hotel. Noted professional warm welcome. Excellent location in city center and near underground. The classic box room is rather small, but very comfortable bed too relax after busy day of work. ",5,2022,11,13
138,Elegant and excellent,"This was my second visit this month to The Mayfair Townhouse this month and it suited my purposes perfectly. Excellent  service, beautiful accommodation, tranquil and relaxed restaurant and bar with the perfect breakfasts and my stay was finished of with a decadent pistachio chocolate mousse cake and coffee. Big thanks to the Concierge Team headed by Darren Muylders and the Reception - Antoinette and Sam at the Fox Parlor downstairs. Will definitely visit again.",5,2022,11,12
138,One of the loveliest hotels in London,"This hotel is truly amazing, and we love it!  Every little detail has been carefully thought through. The staff are incredible.  Nothing is ever too much trouble.
It is difficult to single individuals out but Paul in the dining room is a lovely young man.  So kind and attentive.  George the doorman is also lovely and extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  This was our second visit, and we will certainly be returning!",5,2022,11,11
138,Makes you feel at home!,The Mayfair Townhouse was wonderful as always. The team provide a very personable service and make you feel at home. I was welcomes by Klaudia and Ante. Further looked after by Darren during my stay helping me work my way around London. Sam was fantastic on the bar and really made an effort to look after me and make me feel welcome when dining alone. All in all would really recommend the service is like no other.,5,2022,11,06
138,Wonderfully quirky hotel in a fantastic location!!,"We had a short visit to The Mayfair Townhouse and already planning our next stay! This gem is just a 9 minute walk from the palace and in the heart of everything exciting!
The doorman were attentive as soon as we walked towards the front door. Reception were warm and knowledgable and talked about our plans for the weekend. The room was more spacious than we expected (a delux) and the beds were the comfiest hotel beds I’ve slept in in a long time!!
Had late drinks in the bar which was a lively atmosphere.
We loved thee morning as the choice for breakfast the next day was endless! My only disappointment was that there were no beans in the buffet which is solely personal choice. But the granola and the avocado on toast were perfect. 
Thank you Mayfair for a fabulous stay!",5,2022,11,04
138,A week-long getaway,"Fantastic location, good service and breakfasts, comfortable bed. Hope that the renovations to the building at the entrance to the Half Moon Street from Piccadilly will be completed soon.
I recommend this hotel for the first-time visitors to London. ",5,2022,10,29
138,A great New Hotel to stay,"Really Smart and a little quirky.
Great location for London parks, Buckingham palace and shopping
Friendly knowledgeable staff
very relaxed atmosphere around breakfast
a quiet and very personalised room for our arrival - thank you",5,2022,10,24
138,Great location and hotel,"We chose hotel because of location and it was amazing. Rooms vere nicely done and bed was comfortable. They have a nice bar downstairs. Staff was welcoming, we got an upgrade which was nice. I recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,23
138,"Beautiful, wonderful hotel",This hotel is exquisite. It is in the perfect location and rooms are perfect. Darren and all of the concierge team were so personable and friendly. They went out of their way to make me feel at home. I truly felt welcomed and appreciated at this hotel and would recommend to everyone!,5,2022,10,21
138,"Lovely luxurious townhouse hotel, let down by breakfast","The Mayfair Townhouse is a large traditional townhouse hotel with a stylish and quaint feel in the heart of Mayfair. Fabulous location!

The hotel is luxurious with some of the next front of house staff I’ve experienced. Our room was a nice size for central London with excellent features.

The bed though, the bed! It was heavenly and the pillows, oh my god!

The Dandy bar was excellent and the cocktails were wonderful.

Honestly worth five stars but the breakfast was really disappointing. Service was slow, especially for hot drinks, and the buffet could have been far better. Eggs looked liked they were reheated from yesterday, the toaster hardly toasted, lots of things looked quite stale or dry. Such a shame.

So stay in the fabulous bed and get Maccy D’s delivered for breakfast!",4,2022,10,16
138,London visit,The Mayfair hotel is in an excellent location with a lot of restaurants/bars and places of interest within walking distance. The hotel bar is always lively and fun. The rooms are a little small but beautifully decorated and the mini bar is included in your stay. The staff is very attentive and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2022,10,12
138,Central London Visit,Visiting London and had the pleasure of staying in the The MayFair Townhouse.  Excellent location near Green Park and walking distance to all the restaurants & local attractions.  This is a excellent boutique hotel that is fully appointed and provides exceptional service.  Only thing to consideration is there is construction in the immediate area and noise can be an issue to those who prefer a quiet sleep as I experienced this first hand in the early morning with loud noises. Would recommend a room facing away from the the interior towards the back of the property. Staff is very friendly & provide great service.,4,2022,10,08
138,Love!!,Amazing hotel & experience. The bar had amazing food and drinks. The staff was so accommodating & helpful! We had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrive along with yummy snacks! Everything was amazing! ,5,2022,10,08
138,Wonderful stay at a London gem,"I enjoyed my stay at the Mayfair Townhouse so much that I extended my trip for an extra day and night. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the room was perfect - the heated bathroom floors were such a nice touch. The staff is so friendly and kind, especially Gary at the front door, who remembered me and took a genuine interest in how my trip was going. The Dandy Bar has a fun atmosphere and such a great cocktail menu - the drinks were incredible and unique, with interesting and creative combinations that I’d never seen before. I enjoyed chatting with the bartenders and getting to know them, especially Rheon and T. They are true professionals who kept up with the pace of the bar, even when it was really busy, and they made sure every guest was happy. Overall, I can’t speak highly enough of the Mayfair Townhouse and I can’t wait to be back.",5,2022,10,08
138,My home in London,"Best location, great hotel, wonderfull people, all good to me! Beding, decor, comfort, lights and ambiance in all ereas, all perfect. You can walk from the hotel to some of the best quartiers of London. I always stay there when in town, will come again.",5,2022,10,08
138,A Memorable Stay at a Real Gem,"We had a wonderful stay at the Mayfair Townhouse in late September. The room was tastefully decorated, and the complementary mini-bar was a lovely touch. The staff were also very courteous and attentive. The location is also perfect for tourists. We will gladly be returning. ",5,2022,10,06
138,Avoid Room 216,"We had stayed at MTH previously & had no complaints, this trip was not so good.  On check on we were allocated a room on the 4th floor, entered the room to find another guest in it.  Back to reception to complain to be told that there was another guest with the same name ?  We were then given room 216, the room has a door into the adjacent room, that door offers zero sound insulation !  We could hear every word spoken in the room next door along with their TV and the 4.30 Am alarm clock. !! To top it all off, we have been charged twice on 2 separate debit cards for our stay, 4 days after check out, its still not been corrected.  ",2,2022,10,05
138,DOG Friendly boutique stay in London,This a great little Townhouse with super friendly and welcoming atmosphere in the perfect to location.  I need for nothing extra and we we’ll looked after by all the staff that I met. Plus Pepper got a stay and a treat too. ,5,2022,10,05
138,Perfect hotel in a perfect location,"If you're looking for a luxury hotel in a great location, then this is the hotel for you. From the moment you arrive to the time you leave; you will feel like royalty. The staff are amazing, friendly, attentive and very professional. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated throughout and the rooms themselves have a classic look but are very modern with the most comfortable beds available. The individually controlled air conditioner and underfloor heating in the bathroom are a nice extra touch. The mini bar is stocked with a variety of items which were included in the room price and replenished daily. Breakfast was also included for us which was not only the buffet but anything from the menu too. Again, another nice extra touch. The hotel is located within walking distance of some of the most iconic locations in London and for those that like to travel, the tube station is only 3 minutes' walk away. Stay here and you will not be disappointed.",5,2022,10,04
138,Style and comfort,Beautiful hotel with superb service. Staff are super friendly and attentive. The room was very comfortable with user friendly technology. Breakfast was delicious both hot food and the pastries.specially enjoyed the homemade muffins. Had a very enjoyable weekend stay.,5,2022,10,03
138,Exceptional Service,"This hotel is in the heart of Mayfair and close to many restaurants, shops and coffee shops.  The rooms are extremely comfortable. They provide hair dryers which are excellent quality, so if you are traveling from the states there is no need to bring one. ",5,2022,09,30
138,September stay,Booked months ago based on reviews but was disappointed with the room provided the first night. The room was on the ground floor facing out to the street. No privacy to cars and people walking on the street unless the curtains are closed. Then the small room becomes a cave. The value was not there for the price. Staff moved us to another room once available. Poor first room experience. ,3,2022,09,30
138,Jewel Box in the heart of the City,"The Mayfair Townhomes is a jewel box in the heart of the city.  Not a bargain, but lovely and service oriented, and very comfortable.  Well located, excellent and helpful staff.  Beautifully appointed.  Luxury bedding.",5,2022,09,29
138,"Perfectly good, not too much more","The Mayfair Townhouse was a perfectly adequate place to stay: clean, with a friendly staff and a first-rate location. It’s not too much beyond that. Our deluxe-level room had virtually no extra floor space and no extra closet space. In combination, this meant that there was literally nowhere to stow our suitcases, and we spent the stay stepping over them as we moved around the room. (Also not to be found: a luggage rack—which suggests this is a known issue.) When I inquired at the desk, a very kind man explained that the room sizes, even at the same level, vary due to the design quirks of the space. We were put on a request list to be moved to a less cramped room, but this never came through. The oddest thing, from my point of view, was that the hotel seemed to have no late food service. We came back from a long show one evening to find everything shut down. The front desk attendant suggested one restaurant nearby, which turned out to be closed; when we got back, the desk very kindly arranged for a frozen-type personal pepperoni pizza to be heated up and sent to the room, at a charge of twenty pounds. This was welcome, but maybe surprising at a London five-star. Amenities seemed to run lean. That said, there were no crises, and the location is great. ",3,2022,09,26
138,London 2022 September,"The location of this hotel is amazing.  The facilities are extremely nice facilities. The bathroom in our was was very small.  All the staff was very friendly, except one, what looked like an Asian man working in the restaurant.  He was rude and was mean to a staff member.",5,2022,09,26
138,Most memorable weekend in the Queen's Honour,"This gem of a hotel was perfectly located not only for shopping at the venerable Harvey Nichols & Harrod's, but also has easy access to the beautiful Royal Parks of Green, Hyde & St. James, and close to most of London's main attractions. In one word, Perfect!",5,2022,09,25
138,One night in Mayfair,"Thoughtful, attentive staff, lovely room, really good food and cocktails, and a fabulous location for walking into the West End where we had tickets for Back to the Future - the Musical.
Also well placed for seeing the floral tributes to our late Queen in Green Park.",5,2022,09,25
138,Great hotel in an even better location,"Mayfair Townhouse has great walkability to all the attractions around Mayfair. Clean, newer rooms with the amenities you would expect in a hotel at this price. Friendly staff willing to help any way they can. Hotel has a great bar with reasonably priced cocktails. They have a good breakfast too!",5,2022,09,24
138,Superb hotel in a great location.,"We discovered this gem in the funeral weekend, I stayed there before but this time was amazing. It's a boutique hotel next to Hyde Park where every detail is covered. We've been upgraded to a larger room, that was also a plus :)",5,2022,09,23
138,Room above a pub,"Room smelt badly of cigarette smoke, and was positioned at the back of the hotel above a noisy pub backing onto Shepard Market. One of the worst nights sleep I’ve had due to 0 soundproofing. The room was dark with a dingy view of waste bins and a wall.",1,2022,09,11
138,Excellent hotel,"This was our fourth visit and we were very happy with this hotel. The location is great, close to parking and close Central London. It's is within walking distance of most of the the places we wanted to visit. The hotel is newly renovated and spotlessly clean. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. In particular Gary at the door and Po at breakfast. The food in the bar is good although disappointing that the excellent cauliflower steak is no longer on the menu!
The only issue that we had was that there was no green tea in our room, we phoned reception 3 times and asked for some to be delivered to us, they said it would be and it never arrived! We eventually gave up and asked for some at breakfast and took it back to our room ourselves!
This is definitely our hotel of choice in London and look forward to visiting again.",5,2022,09,05
138,Last minute booking,"We booked to stay at very short notice and the hotel were able to accommodate us even though London was exceptionally busy.

Staff very attentive, especially the check in staff, bar area and Darren and his colleagues on the concierge desk.

Everyone made us feel very welcome without the ""stuffiness"" of similar standard properties. We instantly felt welcomed and comfortable and everyone on the team was happy just to have a chat when appropiate.

Great location just minutes from Green Park but quiet enough away from the hustle and bustle of Park Lane & Piccadilly.",5,2022,09,05
138,"Sorry, no sleep for you.","We reserved a garden room.  Outside was a construction zone. A new building was being constructed along side the outside space which was a small deck, nothing garden about it. Could not not be out there for a second without inhaling dust from the construction. 
 The room ended up being above the bar.  Which at night became a hot spot.  Loud music till early morning.  No sleep. Called about it. Was told that it would end by 12:30 AM. That wasn’t the case.  
When I was asked by the hotel how I enjoyed my visit, I relayed my experience to them, I never received a response.  Perhaps they were listening to the music.",2,2022,09,04
138,A wonderful hotel with the kindest of staff  welcoming us from the first minute.,Darren & Gary at the door step took care of us during the stay in a personal way. Beautiful breakfast and a nice fully equpied gym. The dandy bar offererd us all We wished for - We recomend the cocktails and espacially the ”night cap”.,5,2022,09,04
138,Excellent Location & Staff,"This hotel was an absolute delight. I traveled to London solo and was a bit apprehensive about the experience, but upon my arrival, I was greeted by the friendliest staff ever at the reception. You can tell that there's a laid-back, beautiful harmony between the staff and it made me feel extremely at ease. I had the loveliest time in The Dandy Bar with all the guys who made the stay quite unforgettable.
This hotel also had an excellent location in the heart of London. Everything (and I mean everything) was within walking distance. The walk to the palace, Green Park, Hyde Park, Leicester Square, Her Majesty's Theatre, Apollo Victoria Theatre, Picadilly Theatre, and China Town ranged from 5-20 minutes. The Museums were also about 10 minutes ride by tube.
I'm so glad I chose TMT for my London experience, and I will definitely be back again before my flight back.",5,2022,08,26

138,Great location,Hotel location was amazing. Breakfast delicious. Only reason i gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the size of our room and the smell. Staff was very attentive. Everything i called down for showed up at my door in a few minutes!,4,2022,08,12
138,Perfect for the occasion,"Staying in town for a birthday dinner, we chose this hotel because it was close to where we were meeting our friends. It is situated in a quiet street, close to Green Park tube and convenient for just about everything.
Our room was upgraded and had a wonderfully comfy bed and spacious shower room en suite. 
The feel of the place is sort of art deco, stylish and comfortable. The staff were delightful and super friendly.
We didn’t have an evening meal there but the breakfast was excellent. It’s not cheap but, for where it is, it’s good value for money. It was a real treat.",4,2022,08,09

138,TOP NOTCH,"I recently stayed at the Mayfair Towhouse and I must say it was amazing!  The hotel is top notch and the service/staff are even better. The rooms are awesome the décor is superb and my favorite thing is they are CLEAN.  The breakfast is delicious as well.  The location is excellent as it is walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The ONLY place to stay is the Mayfair Townhouse, Hubert and his staff have made a guest for life!  Thank you very much I thoroughly enjoyed my stay is a massive understatement!",5,2022,07,26
138,Unimpressive,"I was disappointed in this hotel, which I would never consider a 5-star hotel.  The best aspects of it are the location in Mayfair, superb AC (during 40(C) weather!), and the wonderful door staff.  The hotel itself looks rundown even though it's relatively new.  The hallways are narrow, and the room was a hodge-podge of space with a tiny set of cheap looking chairs.  There was no sense of luxury or even of thoughtful decoration.  The view was a blank wall.  I won't be staying here again.",3,2022,07,26

It will be my first choice next time I return to London. ",5,2022,07,20
138,Stay here,"My wife and I had a wonderful experience at Mayfair Townhouse. The bar at the hotel is fantastic with the best cocktails in London and the most friendly bartenders.

138,"Small, nice room in a perfect location","Our room at the Mayfair Townhouse had a large, very comfortable bed and a small, well-appointed marble bathroom with a heated floor. The room itself was very, very small--barely larger than the bed, which was awkward; there wasn't really anywhere to put our suitcases so they were out of the way, and we had to maneuver strategically to get around each other. Breakfast was expensive, but really delicious. Perfect location, newly renovated, beautiful, expensive--recommended if you are not worried about price, don't have a lot of luggage, and are not planning to hang around your room (and why would you?).",4,2022,07,11

138,Simply the best,"Amazing experience!! Simply the best hotel stay I have ever experienced. From the unbeatable location to the high-quality facility and their welcoming and helpful staff, all of them will refine your London trip. I personally really love how thoughtful they are trying to make your stay better. The bathroom’s floor is always warm, the bath runs fast to let you enjoy the bubble sooner. Lights can be turned off from multiple places, forget your travel adapter? No worries they offer USB ports also! The huge closet gives you plenty of room for your suits, suitcase and souvenirs, and the mattress, sheets and pillows bring all your experience to the next level. So don’t hesitate, if you are reading this review just go to the book page and book this place, you won't regret it.",5,2022,06,29
138,Wonderful stay at the Mayfair Townhouse,"Had an excellent stay at the Mayfair Townhouse. While the rooms are small, everything about the hotel more than compensated, from the friendly staff, the quality design and finishes, and the great location. As a family with small kids, we never felt out of place. Staff were fun to engage with, and we learned a lot about the hotel's history and the significance of the art throughout the hotel. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,06,29
138,LOVED this hotel!!,"This hotel was quaint and quiet and we absolutely loved staying here while in London. It is in the Mayfair area which makes it very easy to walk places. The staff was what made the stay special, they were kind and helpful and made it feel like home away from home from the bellman to the bartenders. Shoutout to Gary for being the sweetest!! If you are traveling on business or pleasure, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,06,29
138,Good location. Excellent breakfast.,"Excellent location just a few meters from Green Park and less than five minutes’ walk to Buckingham Palace.
Excellent service. Very comfortable (if slightly small) small rooms.
The breakfast is brilliant, both the a la carte and buffet options.
Bar is cute.
Good basic gym.
Only points for improvement would be the toiletries provided and the total lack of anything alcoholic in the mini bar.
This place is far from cheap but seems good value when compared to other ridiculously priced Mayfair hotels.",5,2022,06,29
138,Truly 5 star boutique hotel,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Mayfair Townhouse with a friend and our two 12 year olds. The service from arrival to our departure was impeccable with staff ready to help without being ostentatious. Rooms are tastefully decorated with an old style relaxed bar plus as you would expect the place is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The hotel is located about a 5 minutes walk through Hyde Park to Buckingham palace so fab location.

Particular thanks goes to Darren the concierge who literally walked us to a lovely, reasonably priced Italian and got us a table when we arrived late on Friday evening and as well as being to help with directions and make recommendations all weekend. Oh and did I mention we shared the breakfast room with Keanu Reeves. Now if it is good enough for Mr Reeves....",5,2022,06,28
138,Magnificence Hotel in Mayfair.,"The Mayfair Townhouse is the definition of Beauty and Magnificence. This is my second visit to the Mayfair Townhouse and it is truly a place you need to experience. 

In Dandy bar, you can come for a coffee and pastry in the early morning, and at night you can get the greatest cocktails in Mayfair, they also serve lunch and dinner with amazing options to choose from

The food and drinks service was incredibly professional and are one of the best places I have ever been to in London. 

The staffs were extremely helpful, kind and welcoming, you will be in hands of exceptional people.   If you looking to have an extraordinary experience in one of the best luxury hotels in Mayfair I highly recommend this Hotel. ",5,2022,06,27

138,Excellent Stay,"Stayed 2 nights at The Mayfair Townhouse Hotel. Absolutely amazing hotel, rooms are to a very high standard and beautiful, food and service is exceptional.

138,Great service,Very professional establishment. Have no complaints great in all areas. The food was also very good and the staff were very accommodating and the room i stayed in was one of the cosiest bedrooms I have been in a while so overall a very good experience which I would recommend.,5,2022,06,15
138,Noisy room and poor management,"Stayed  in a junior suite for one night.

The experience started well enough; concierge and reception were very helpful and our room seemed very nice (143 I think). The room was clean, well-furnished and of the size we expected. We dropped our luggage in the room and went straight out.

After a night out we returned to the hotel at 10.30 for a drink at the bar. The bar was quiet when we arrived but rapidly became overwhelmed. Staff lacked leadership and organisation. Frustrated guests including us were leaving due to lack of service
When we went to our room we discovered that our room was above the tube line and that every 10 minutes or so a train would send vibrations through the room.
We managed to get to sleep at around 1.30 but were then awake again at 5 greeted by the noise and vibrations. 
In addition, the room overlooked an alley which we assume was used for staff access to the hotel.
Late at night and early in the morning individuals would gather there and have full volume conversations. These could be clearly heard in the room - the windows were completely ineffective at keeping out any noise.

For over £600 for a night this is not the experience I would recommend to anyone

I complained at reception this morning and was told that if I'd contacted reception at the time something would have been done - at 1 in the morning that's not what comes to mind!
I was simply given a card for the duty manager to contact if I decided to return.

I followed up with a formal complaint via email to the manager. The hotel has not bothered to respond",2,2022,06,14

138,Not quite meeting expectations,"The staff were lovely and friendly, and the concierge went out of his way to make us a dinner reservation, which we appreciated... but given the price and the description on the website we were a bit disappointed with the room and facilities (which didn't match the website description).",3,2022,06,10

138,Excellent stay,"Wish I'd had a chance to stay longer! As a solo traveler, my little ""cabin"" room was plenty for me and very cozy (in a good way). Luxurious bathroom. Complementary food and drinks in the room a HUGE plus. Bar was great and lively in the evening, but not overly rowdy.",5,2022,06,09
138,Platinum Jubilee Overnight Stay Sat 4 June 2022,"My mother and I stayed overnight at this hotel with breakfast included. I am a doctor and had won tickets in the national ballot for the Platinum Jubilee Concert. Very friendly staff and the greeting out on the pavement by the concierge where our cases were taken from us pleasantly caught me off guard and was an excellent level of service. Check in was painless. Free room upgrade to a deluxe room from a classic room due to the fact we requested twin beds rather than a double bed. Steak at dinner was amazing. The lady on reception on the day of check out had a lovely telephone manner and allowed us a complimentary check out at 2pm rather than noon due to arriving back late the night before from the concert. She could not have been more helpful. The complimentary bar and Nespresso machine exceeded my expectations. The underfloor heating was a pleasant surprise and the toiletries were very high quality. The beds were comfortable. The restaurant and bar manager (I think he was called Bruno) was very attentive and very friendly. We have never had such a pleasant experience at dinner and breakfast before. He was informative and chatty and had a lovely manner. All staff were excellent. The breakfast especially the scrambled eggs were the best I have ever tasted. This is a hidden gem of a hotel and I would recommend returning as the location is great also. The staff went over and above from concierge to reception staff to restaurant manager. We were so happy with our stay. Only 2 minor things which are not criticisms: 1. one dressing gown in room rather than 2, and 2. we were advised that there would be a charge for breakfast but when we pointed out that our booking included breakfast already this was quickly resolved and the charge taken off. This is easily done however one area for feedback would be just to double check a customer's booking at check in. Thank you! Dr Ryan Paterson and Ms Diane Paterson",5,2022,06,06
138,A great and pleasant surprise,Everything was very good but I was misled about the convenience of the car parking.  On a bad weather day this would be unpleasant as it is really not that close to or easy to the hotel. Otherwise our stay was a very pleasant surprise,4,2022,06,06
138,See you soon Mayfair!,"It was my third time staying at The Mayfair Townhosue. Staff are very welcoming, friendly and attentive.
I got upgraded to a suite on arrival, with a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room. I stayed for two nights.
The breakfast is very delicious and the best part is that in the weekend is open until 11:30 AM.
The suite itself (519 Skylight) was very spacious, with a beautiful decor and large bathroom with bathtub and walk in shower. 
So always coming back to stay here because of the very attentive staff. 
Thank you all and see you soon again!",5,2022,06,05

138,Excelent Townhouse - 5* our of 5*,"I see there are mixed reviews on this Hotel. However, my parrtner and I stayed here for 3 nights and by far this was the best choise (in terms of Hotel/Location).

The Townhouse is very close to all the attractions and perfect for shopping break, very close to the subway too.

The staf is extremily attentive, friendly and professional.
Rooms are lovely ( a bit small but I am sure they have another categories that are much biggar, so no complaints on that).

The Dandy Bar is a FENOMENAL place to indulge a cocktail  and very and the staff are knowlegible.

In a short sentince if you know what Townhouse means and you want to experience that in Mayfair than choose THE MAYFAIR TOWNHOUSE.

By far THE BEST PLACE to stay in and we will always stay here when traveling to London for any purpose.

Well done to all The Mayfair Townhouse team!",5,2022,06,05

One star service and tree star standard while charging for five stars or a learnings from a less good hotel experience

It seems as a blessing in disguise that The Mayfair Townhouse in London and it´s owner is portraited as the standard bearer for good customer service. This blog tells a totally different story.

The experience started on minus as we checked into the Mayfair Townhouse Hotel in London. The lady on duty did not find our booking and started to question if we in fact had a booking. It was then up to us to prove that we had a booking and she did not believe us until we both had to show our passport and the booking confirmation. Never happened before at any hotel independent of the number of stars. Off course there was a booking and then the blame-game begins. It was Expedia´s fault -as it could not be her fault.

Once checked in we come to our room, which turns out being next to a building construction site (see enclosed photos) The room was also much smaller than the photos on the booking confirmation (se enclosed photo). Only one of the doors to the closet was possible to open as the other was built-in. There were no drawers to put clothes in and no foldable table to put our luggage on or to stow away the bags.

Back to reception and pointed out that what we got was not what we expected and that there had been no warning on website or booking confirmation regarding the construction work going on. The blame game continues – now it is again Expedia´s fault as the have incorrect photos of the room. She cannot give us a better room as the hotel is fully booking according to her, but she would ensure that she would try to fix another room for the next day. Why there had been no advance warning on the construction work she could not answer. 

Day two and back to the front desk. No progress had been made and we communicated our discontent with the next lady. We informed the desk that we had been a small towel short and that the cleaning staff had not refilled with shower gel. We were given a big towel. Next day we were again a towel short and so for the remain of our stay. The shower gel was replaced on the 2nd day and when it ran out no more refill.

The complementary minibar that we paid extra for only contained mineral water, tonic and other soft drinks. Yet a disappointment.

Day three and back again to the front desk. As you as reader will notice is that there are no initiatives from the staff to get back to us. As we question this, we are told that desk lady one has reported that we were happy with her response and lack of action on day one. She had then gone on leave and not ensured that our matter was handled by another member of the staff. According to the desk manager on day tree we could not expect matters to be handled in a sequence and were supposed to understand that she was on leave and therefor nothing had happened.

Now that story changed once more – it was no longer Expedia´s fault that the photos on the confirmation showed a much larger room. According to him there were rooms in this category with this size. The hotel was still booked up and we were offered to talk a more senior manager. She never appeared but suddenly there was an available room. This was even smaller which is why we declined it.

After three days we still lacked feedback why guests are not informed about the construction site.

Were there any bright sides of the hotel? Yes – to put everything in balance the breakfast was nice and so were the breakfast staff. The shower was very nice. 

Most of us don´t mind paying for good service and excellent quality, but I think most customers feel that they are shortchanged when paying for something and then getting much less in return. Compared five-star hotels in India, Scandinavia, Germany, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Italy, Canada, the US and even in London. Most of these hotels charge less that the Mayfair Townhouse Hotel and still deliver better service.",1,2022,06,02

138,"Great Hotel, Terrible Room","Good staff, location and quality. Sadly my stay was ruined by being assigned a small room of which a large proportion was taken up by a winding staircase within the room. Precarious stairs at that. Please clarify if such a room is acceptable or not when you make the booking as no one boithered to point it out. I would say those stairs are a health hazard other than the very youthful!

138,"Lovely hotel in a fantastic area, but cabin rooms are tiny.","I was traveling for work and the rooms that fit my travel budget ($300/night) were called ""cabin"" rooms, so I should have probably taken that literally, but I thought ""How small could it be?"" Its really small. Room for a bed and nothing more. No closet even. I needed at least a desk and chair from which to conduct zoom meetings, so I ended up upgrading for an extra 50 quid a night (which had to come out my own pocket unfortunately). Once upgraded, I will say, the bathroom in my new room might be my favorite hotel bathroom ever. It had a heated floor and towel bar! Construction behind the hotel was happening loudly right under my room, but I was so jet lagged it didn't matter. Loved the breakfasts. And if you go left and another left out the door of the hotel you end up in Shepherd's Market, which is the most charming, magical little part of London I hadn't been in before.  Highly recommend.

Through no fault of the hotel (except, perhaps, for not mentioning it as a special note during the booking process), the building attached to the hotel is undergoing major re-construction and from the look of things, it could carry on for a little while yet. This meant that during working hours, we got a treat of not only the sounds but also the vibrations (you'd normally have to pay extra for 4D IMAX cinema for this experience!). I must be fair though, that after working hours, it was nice and quiet.

We had one of the standard/smaller rooms (Room 9, with patio) and it was fine for us but there was not much wardrobe space which could be a problem for some. There was also not much table-top space for sponge bag or other items in the bathroom.

The most disturbing part was the persistent unpleasant smell in the room which in fact smelt like mildew or stale smoke. We mentioned this to the hotel and we noticed a faint hint of air-freshener upon our return but the smell persisted. Turning off the air-conditioning and keeping one of the patio doors opened seemed to have helped which was what we did during our stay.

Another incident baffled me till now. To keep it short, let's say we asked for a coffee mug which they would normally have in the rooms but they seemed to have a problem locating a spare one... in the entire hotel?? When we finally got one, it was an hour later.

Despite the smell, the noise and the bewildering wait for a mug, it was not all bad. The staff attitude made up for everything in many instances. The shower was very good. There was floor heating in the bathroom and the bar experience was excellent. The best part was, of course, the location which was the reason we chose this hotel.",3,2022,05,21
138,Great Mayfair boutique,"Great boutique hotel in Mayfair, good size room and double bed, excellent location walking distance to greenpark tube station, attentive staff, new facilities and quiet room despite being on street side, key issue is weak AC in the room...",4,2022,05,21
138,STAY AWAY!,"I stayed  in the Mayfair Townhouse - 2 nights May 2022 and it was the worst experience I have had in London, worst experience ever. 
This hotel has an attitude in everything they do that is “No I can not” -  with a million excuses - instead of “YES I can “ even before I arrived they were difficult on important things. Staff was always pleasant and polite , but it seems management has imposed policies that make even the smallest things difficulty. 
There is no flexibility,  as a guest you are never left with a feeling that you are a valued guest / it is rather a feeling that one should be thankful for getting a room. The rooms are small, very stuffy if it is hot. Air con does not work and no help offered to fix it 
For the high rates the rooms and the hotel is really not worth it ! Even  at sensible rats I would never choose this hotel again ! 
There is no bottle water  offered to guests , only at a charge , no evening service .  
The dandy bar is cozy - but so dandy that it closes at 22:30!!?? ! So if you want a drink after Dinner you are ordered to your room and room service ! I  
This hotel would really benefit from paying more attention to details, service flexibility and putting their guests first !",1,2022,05,18
138,"Great hotel, great staff","I had an amazing experience at this location! 

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, and the staff was 10/10. 

Also wanted to give a shout-out to Mustapha for going out of his was to accommodate our visit.
He was incredibly helpful throughout the whole trip.",5,2022,05,17
138,Best Service and Experience,"I don't know where to start, but I'll try. I booked this hotel last minute for a long weekend over Easter break. I booked an executive room and from the moment you even come up to the door, someone is there to greet you and help you with your bags. The staff (every one of them) is so cheerful and pleasant. The room was beautiful with a clean marble bathroom. The free mini bar saved me many a day and there's free water, too. I booked car services through the hotel for airport pick up and drop off and they both were great. 

On the way home, however, I tested positive for covid. Being a solo traveler, I had to find a place to keep me quarantined for 10 days. The Mayfair Townhouse allowed me to stay there (masked up upon arrival, of course) and gave me a room immediately. Obviously I couldn't have housekeeping services, but they would drop off anything I needed outside my door for the 5 days I had to stay inside my room. Darren - the best Concierge I have ever had the pleasure to know - arranged my prescriptions and even got them from the pharmacy and dropped them at my door. He ensured I had anything I needed.. dropping off packages, food deliveries, laundry, etc. It made my quarantine so easy and it felt like they truly cared. I wound up ordering room service almost every night and it was so good! The chicken schnitzel, asparagus small plate... even a side of broccoli had care and attention to it. Everything was delicious. When I was past my quarantine and not contagious, I could go down to breakfast and it had just enough of everything that you could want (and it was all yummy.) Mary and another gentleman (who I forget his name) were so welcoming and attentive. Everyone knew me at that point because I was the girl who had covid (haha) but they only treated me with the utmost respect and a genuine warmth. The bar was nice...I could work in there and also get served delicious cocktails. Also, when it was possible for people to come into my room, they got a team of housekeepers to completely clean it with care. 

This is the only hotel I will stay at when I go to London. I am forever thankful for all they did for me at my most vulnerable time. Thank you!",5,2022,05,15
138,Mayfair's best kept secret!,"Excellent location, service and facilities.  I found the hotel on booking.com and I was delighted with the location, facilities and service.  It was a pleasure to stay there and I recommend it as a great value place to stay in Mayfair.",5,2022,05,14
138,Not impressed,"I am not sure how this hotel gets its 5 star status. Our room was small, dark  and a little  bit grubby in places. The Conciege and doormen were very helpful, but that’s the best I can say about the staff.  We weren’t told where breakfast was served, or shown around the facilities, whatever they were. The reception desk was small and the team there seemed overwhelmed at times. There was confusion over our bill. We won’t be returning. The complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the mini-bar were a nice touch, but I would have probably traded them in for enough milk, tea bags and a shower cap. Our room overlooked a very active building site. We  were attending a Buckingham Palace Garden Party, so we had a brilliant time in London anyway. ",3,2022,05,12
138,Excellent Stay,Really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very nice and clean. The service was top notch. Everyone really goes out of their way to make the stay enjoyable - from the concierge to the oat milk for your coffee being heated. No detail is missed. The only downside (which is not their fault) is that it is very noisy from the construction going on down the street. Everything else was perfect. ,5,2022,05,10
138,My favorite hotel in London,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel. Everything about it is absolutely fantastic - the location, amenities, rooms, super comfortable bed and the staff. Everyone made my stay, but I just have to especially mention and recommend Mustapha, duty manager - he was always highly dedicated to all of the guests and always made sure I had everything I needed, just being one of those employees who would go the extra mile to make a guest happy.",5,2022,05,09
138,My new favourite hotel!,"A fantastic hotel in a great location.
The service from all the staff was exceptional and the attention to detail was exemplary.
We also loved the touch of the complimentary mini bar.  What a treat!
This is my new favourite hotel!",5,2022,05,09
138,Excellent stay,"As a solo female traveler, I wanted to stay somewhere in a great location where I also felt safe. The Mayfair Townhouse exceeded all expectations. The complimentary mini bar and heated bathroom floors were a surprise plus! I was able to walk almost everywhere I wanted to go in London from this location. I loved how close I was to Hyde and Green park. I definitely felt safe and I slept comfortably. Having such a nice place to stay made my trip all the better. I would stay here again.",5,2022,05,07
138,Noisy hotel,"Service is excellent 
Rooms are noisy and it's difficult to sleep, isolation is  bad and you can hear people walking in your floor. 
Also we got woke up every morning due to workers on a building in front of the hotel.
Breakfast is great. 
Won't come back :)

138,Mayfair Townhouse raises the bar for service.,"We normally stay at a competitor 5 star hotel very near Mayfair Townhouse, but due to construction there weren't enough rooms available.  With some online research for ""Best Hotels in Mayfair"", we were delighted to find this gem. While the hotel is comprised of 15 townhouses, it feels quite small and intimate.  The service was impeccable in all respects.  The 4 rooms we had were all sufficient in size, and the king-size beds were supremely comfortable.   The highlight of our stay was Darren at the concierge desk. There was no request he couldn't satisfy...Friday night drinks at one of the most famous London bars, no problem! Saturday night dinner for 5 at a Michelin star restaurant...confirmed!  And these were same day requests. We will definitely be back.",5,2022,05,03
138,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for the third time. It is a lovely hotel in a great location and the staff are very welcoming, especially Lee the consierge who is very helpful indeed. The hotel is brand new and the decor is lovely. The food at the bar is good, especially the cauliflower steak! We had a problem that a non vegan platter was left in our room, although we had informed them that we were vegan. This was sorted out for us by Jitesh who was incredibly helpful. We will definitely return.",5,2022,05,03
138,Stay in Mayfair,"Great location , and great service overall. I  travelled to Mayfair on business trip and exceeded my expectation . The location is most convenient , access to metro and the central city itself . We had a great time to stay there . Excellent services , the food was delicious in the bar and breakfast.",5,2022,05,02
138,Perfect Hotel in a Great Location,"We stayed at the Mayfair Townhouse for 8 days in April 2022. The hotel just opened in 2020, so everything was very up to date. We booked a deluxe bedroom, which was a good size for 2 people. The bathroom was a tiny bit small, but it was beautiful with marble walls and heated floors. The best part about the hotel is the concierge staff. Darren and his team were so friendly and so attentive that it made our stay that much better. The hotel is also 2 blocks from the Green Park tube station and a 5 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, so the location cannot be beat. I would highly recommend staying here and cannot wait to come back. ",5,2022,05,01
138,10/10,"I had a wonderful stay at The Mayfair Townhouse. The staff are wonderful and attentive, and no request is too big or small. The hotel itself is magnificent but what really stands out is the staff and atmosphere ",5,2022,04,29
138,Really lovely,"The rooms are spotless and housekeeping does a phenomenal job in resetting rooms everyday. The beds are comfortable and cozy! Super important. I appreciated being able to control the temperature as I like to be cold when going to sleep.

138,Fantastic staff.,"We stayed for two nights while we got married at Marylebone town hall and the staff were superb. They were extremely friendly and helpful at all times and made us feel special on our stay. Special mention to the three bar staff and Darren on the concierge, thank you all.",5,2022,04,26
138,Lovely hotel with attentive staff,"Mayfair Townhouse is a lovely hotel... with updated decor, fun art and whimsical features (peacock in lobby, fox door knockers).  The bathrooms are beautiful and there is a separate closet for storing luggage and hanging clothes.  The menu items and complimentary fridge contents are well thought out and the bartenders make good cocktails.  The ability to adjust to cooler temperatures and better blinds would better ensure high sleep quality.",5,2022,04,22
138,A little gem...,"A really lovely little spot, helpful staff, friendly and very clean and smart. The room was cute, comfortable and a really nice retreat after a busy day. Awesome Mayfair location and walking distance to everywhere! Drinks in the bar were delightful, the room service ordered arrived very quickly too. Will definitely return if more meetings in the Mayfair area.",5,2022,04,18
138,Terrific hotel,"I stayed here for five nights in early April. It was a terrific experience. The front desk staff were amazing. The bar had excellent drinks. While we did not try the restaurant, it looked fantastic. We were unable to get a reservation during our stay. The room, the Newman suite, was truly one of the best I’ve stayed in during a trip to London. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends. The only negative that comes to mind is the elevator or lift. It was out for most of the trip. It wasn’t a major issue, but it would’ve been nice if it worked. All in all, it was a terrific experience and would most definitely return.",5,2022,04,14
138,Very nice staying,"Breakfast could be a little bit better. But the rest was excellent. The hotel is new renovated, good size of the room, very comfortable. Very nice and helpful staff. I will stay again if I visit London. Excellent!!",5,2022,04,12
138,Superbly located rooms,"Mayfair Townhouse is a great place to stay if you want to be close to the Parks, Bond Street, Piccadilly and St James’s. The rooms are quiet, very comfortable and impeccably furnished and fitted out. There’s an attractive all day bar and a good breakfast service in the basement. ",4,2022,04,11
138,Excellent throughout,"The level of service was superb. Friendly, courteous and efficient. Great food and drink, lovely touches in the room and amazingly comfortable bed. Can't wait to return. We heartily recommend this hotel in a superb location.",5,2022,04,10
138,glamour at Mayfair,"Great location, with very ptofessional staff in a small and beatifull hotel.

138,Gorgeous,Just a special little place. Feels quiet and personal. Beautifully finished. Incredibly polite and helpful staff that weren’t over the top. This place is a true gem. Amazing location too. Really nothing bad to say. Our room really made the most of its size. Look forward to our next visit.,5,2022,04,04
138,Our second stay,"We discovered this hotel last fall and returned this March once again. We love MAyfair area. This hotel is perfect, cool design and wonderful staff. Lots of great restaurants ( quite a few Michelin ones) in a walking distance. Massive park just across the street that leads you to Buckingham palace. Great shopping as well. ",5,2022,03,31
138,Lovely boutique hotel,"Very comfortable, well appointed rooms, with 2 flat screen TVs and bluetooth speaker.  Wonderful comfy large bed with high quality linen.  Complementary soft drinks in the mini bar an added bonus. Great breakfast.  Attentive staff.          
",5,2022,03,28
138,Fantastic location and staff,"This hotel is in a great location and very centrally located.  From the moment you walk into the hotel, you are treated with such genuine kindness and respect, that separates it out from other hotels.  Not just fake kindness - the staff are truly nice people.  The concierges stand out for us as they were so knowledgeable and extremely helpful.   The only reason I give the hotel a four star is the rooms & bathrooms are very small and the dining is not the best in town.  Yes, adequate for breakfast but there are better spots close by.  However, loved the amenities - i.e. snacks in the room that are complimentary.  But if you like turn down service with water at night, you need to request it and the water is an extra cost.  There is complimentary water in the room, but if you go through the bottles there on the first night, it is not refilled.  Most five or six star hotels will provide as much water as you need without an extra fee.",4,2022,03,24
138,Intimate and quiet hotel in the middle of Mayfair,"Elegant and discreet hotel in fantastic location close to all that Soho/regent street/Trafalgar Square has to offer. Service was genuinely superb - friendly, warm, pro-active, discreet. Can’t find much to fault!",5,2022,03,22
138,Quite simply fantastic,I simply cannot fault this hotel but more importantly the team that work there are fantastic. The care and attention they showed was truly amazing. Nothing and i mean nothing was too much trouble for them. Location is first class as well.,5,2022,03,21
138,Excellent stay.,"I cannot fault this hotel for the quality of the food or the attentiveness of the staff. Excellent WiFi enabled me to keep up with emails etc during my stay. A great location for exploring London, a relaxing hotel to return to.",5,2022,03,20
138,Our new favourite hotel in London,"From the moment we arrived and one of the concierge team, Lee, spotted us leaving our taxi with suitcases to the day we checked out and couldn’t persuade the front of house ladies not to run to the end of the road to flag down an available cab, the service experienced at Mayfair Townhouse was warm, friendly and the kind of relaxed professionalism, without the over-theatrical stuffiness of other highly star rated establishments, which makes you want to return again and again. As the trip was to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday we were very impressed with the effort the team had gone too. We had a fun welcome message amusingly written across our bedroom mirror and a lovely bottle of quality Prosecco with delicious cakes. We were very impressed by this as none of it was asked for, nor expected.

The accommodation is, as one would expect in London, relatively compact whilst being larger than many places I have stayed in the capital. However, the most important factors were all there and on-point. The bed was as large and as comfortable as one could wish for. The bathroom was lovely, with quality soaps and a clever air system which meant it never steamed up, no matter how hot your shower. This many seem like a minor benefit, however it meant we never had to worry about wash-bags etc. getting covered in that annoying condensation. The complimentary snacks in the room were high quality and very welcome.

We didn’t dine at the hotel during our stay however we enjoyed a couple of excellent cocktails, served with tasty complimentary snacks, in the bar. We requested a couple of cocktails which weren’t on the menu, which was no trouble at all. Upon ordering Margaritas, we asked if we could have them served without crushed ice (being our preference) which was no trouble at all. We were enticed by the suggestion of a spicy option, which was absolutely superb. The drinks were beautifully made and, again, the welcome and service were just right - that perfect mix of professionalism and friendliness.

We found Mayfair Townhouse to be an unassuming, modern establishment without the superficially impressive, yet unnecessary, grandiosity of other five star hotels. It has a boutique, homely feel, with an effortless professionalism that comes usually after many months of operation, not just a few weeks as we discovered to our surprise. The location is excellent, too. Mayfair Townhouse gets all the important things right and its a reason we will return again on our next visit.",5,2022,03,12
138,"Great value, boutique hotel in heart of Mayfair","I was looking for a small, high quality hotel in Mayfair that wasn't ridiculously expensive. That's why I chose Mayfair Townhouse, but when I arrived I was so happily surprised at how lovely it was and how good the service was. It felt very personal, the room was lovely (i chose a small cabin room and it was perfect for a couple of nights, including a day working in the room). I'll definitely be back.",5,2022,03,11
138,"Traditional Courtesy, Luxury and Cleanliness",Our stay at this beautiful hotel was outstanding. The service and attention to detail is second to non.

138,Best hotel I've tried in London,"Great location, clean room, great service. Perfect!
The only reason I would prefer not to rate it, is so that the price won't go up ;) 
Thank you for the birthday surprises you prepared for my wife. It was great! (and tasty) ",5,2022,03,03
138,It‘s a NO from me,"It was a disappointing stay. First it has started well, when early  check-in was possible without any fuss. And generally, reception and concierge were excellent - competent, polite, friendly. But the room was tiny (the classic room) - even for me, and I am a tiny person myself.  There was no space for the luggage (small hand luggage !). Neither for my coat, since the ridiculously small/narrow wardrobe was crammed full with an ironing board… Bathroom is minuscule : no shelf or space for personal care items. Also, be aware of the fact that The Townhouse is just few yards away from busy Piccadilly and the windows are not well enough isolated. Additionally, the neighbouring house  is a construction site where works started at 8:00 on Saturday too. I mean, sure, they have no control about the constructions around but the quality of the hotel is suffering and prices shouldn‘t stay the same as without the noise…. Also, the furniture started to show the signs of time already. 
The pros : the bed is huge (but then again, there’s no space between the bed and the window…) and the bar is nice…",3,2022,02,28
138,An all too brief delight,I just spent a single night at Mayfair Townhouse as I was briefly passing through London and it was great.  I very much look forward to paying them another visit and extending my stay.  There was nothing about the hotel and its location that I did not like. ,5,2022,02,28

138,Good hotel in good location,"We enjoyed a lovely two nights in the hotel.  The staff were all friendly and helpful and it did feel like a boutique rather than a chain.

The hotel is beautiful, very well decorated and spotlessly clean. The staff are all very helpful, especially Lee the consierge who was always friendly, welcoming and is knowledgeable. 
The location of the hotel is perfect and within walking distance of many of London's top attractions: restaurants, museums, parks and theatres.
The bar is lovely and the vegan food that that is on offer is excellent, especially the cauliflower! Thomas the bar manager was excellent and happy to make cocktails of your choice. Breakfast was also excellent.
The room was very well serviced by Dora who was also very helpful.
We will definitely be back.",5,2022,01,17

138,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel excellent service. 
Warm, cosy, approachable, beautifully decorated, delicious food. 

That being said there’s something else here, something special, that I havent experienced at any other hotel before.

It comes in the form of ambiance, atmosphere. It’s very intriguing, dark, moody even sexy. Time stands still here, nights are long and you feel like something is happening just underneath the surface. Very interesting vibe I enjoyed it very much.

138,Skillfully combines luxury with friendly informality,We are Londoners but I wanted to treat my daughter and myself to a 2-day stay in the heart of town. The Mayfair Townhouse turned out to be a wonderful choice. We are not VIPs but we were treated as though we were. I am usually a bit nervous of doormen and butlers and the staff of posh hotels but the people at the Mayfair Townhouse were just lovely. They managed to combine the level of service you would expect from a Mayfair Hotel with a real human touch. Highly recommended.,5,2021,12,23

Room was spacious, clean and had plenty of space to work. The shower in the bathroom was luxurious and I appreciated the heated bathroom floor after a winter day. Can't wait to back and spend time in the lovely bar - did not have a chance to sample the cocktails which change seasonally. Excellent dining options in the area and the hotel is a two minute walk from the Shepherd Market and DAM COVID testing.",5,2021,12,13
138,Relax in luxury,"Luxurious hotel, wonderful service but without being over pretentious.
From the moment we walked in and had a warm friendly welcome from Mitchell, until the moment we left 48 hours later nothing was at fault.

The Mayfair Townhouse was spectacular in every way from reservations, to pre-trip communications, to the very warm welcome, and the brilliant Dandy Bar.

138,Mayfair Gem,"I have used the groups other great hotels, Cliveden, Chewton Glen and The Lygon Arms, so my expectation level was high and this lovely Mayfair Gem did not disappoint. Beautifully decorated throughout it has a warm and very welcoming feel. The rooms are spacious and have every amenity and the bed was so comfortable. The staff were vey friendly and so helpful the service was exemplary. The buffet breakfast had everything you could possibly desire. To top it all the hotel is perfectly located opposite the Ritz and around the corner from Bond Street",5,2021,11,24
138,Disappointed by hidden information,"My husband and I stayed at The Mayfair Townhouse as we were spending a few days in London to celebrate our wedding anniversary. 

Upon arrival, the hotel put a 'discretionary' service charge on our bill of over 15% despite the booking information claiming it would be 5%.  As the rooms aren't cheap at this hotel, that was a significant uplift for 'services' we still don't really understand other than the usual room clean and bed turn down that every other hotel seems to include in the room price.

We had booked the Deluxe Garden Room because it had an outdoor space (which costs more than a Deluxe Double obviously). When we arrived at the room, we opened the door to the patio only to be directly faced with 10 construction workers on a huge building site no more than about 10 feet away from our room. 

There was an overwhelming stench of tarmac, lots of dust and people everywhere so we had no privacy at all.  Needless to say, we spent very little time out there as a result and spent the entire stay with the curtains closed as the workers could see directly into our room.

When we mentioned this to the hotel, we were told as a gesture of goodwill they would remove the discretionary service charge (which is something surely we should decide if included or removed?) and a lunch that had been charged to our room seemingly by a total stranger, as we didn't eat at the hotel.  Brilliant. 

I totally accept that the Mayfair Townhouse can't be held responsible for the construction site that backs on to their hotel however we feel it inappropriate to not at least mention it on the website, at the time of booking or even when you check in to give you the option of opting for a cheaper room or just accepting the situation.  We wouldn't have paid for a garden room if we had known.

In addtion to the removal of the discretionary service charge and the lunch we didn't eat, we were also offered a free upgrade 'next time we stay' which suggests we would need to fork out another £900 to be eligible for any kind of compensation for this particular stay.

A couple of other things to be aware of that again aren't mentioned on the website are that the free mini bar is alcohol free (we weren't expecting a bottle of Moet but just making people aware as this piece of information isn't forthcoming anywhere) and the bar shuts at 10pm with last orders at 9.30pm which is oddly early for a central London hotel.

On the upside the staff were excellent, the hotel was very clean, the bar was cosy and the bed was super comfy. But the whole thing was completely marred by the lack of information upfront or acknowledgement of the same.

We feel we were rather hoodwinked which is so disappointing especially at that price 😞",3,2021,11,24
138,So good we are returning,"We stayed at the Townhouse for 3 nights in June from the moment we arrived to leaving this hotel make you feel like you have a second home all the staff are excellent not fussy or OTT just right both our room and our sons room where immaculate the bar staff have a great repour with you and the bar food was fantastic 
so we are returning for another break in December and can not wait 
yes we would recommend you try and yes its worth the money",5,2021,11,23
138,Wonderful hotel in a great location!,"We booked this hotel as we live near one of the others in their group and were not disappointed. 

The room was cosy and immaculately clean. Well stocked snacks and drinks, and a really comfy bed we did not want to get out of! ",5,2021,11,22
138,Lovely stay,"Excellent location, staff, amenities, clean, great breakfast, shower (lots of hot water and good water pressure). Nice towels. Tea, coffee, water in the room. Good internet. Nice bed, pillows, bedding. Noisy outside but I understood that most of the rooms were quiet (we were a group of 20 people).",5,2021,11,21
138,Mrs,"Amazing MUSTAPHA indeed
 
I visited Mayfair Townhouse few days ago and I read many reviews about the hotel before arriving, I was concerned about the size of the rooms but decided to give it a try. I must say even though the room I stayed in was not the biggest it was simply good enough for me. At the end of the day when you come to London you don't expect to stay in the room for too long as there are so many places you could visit or things to do. The Mayfair Townhouse is located perfectly if you come to London to do exactly that, it is just a stone away from Hyde Park and Oxford Street. From the minute we entered the luxurious hotel, we were welcomed by the kind-hearted Mustapha. He directly helped us with checking in and getting a suitable room and showed us the touristic places that we should go to; Mustapha was extremely amazing. I've stayed in many hotels around the globe and met with hundreds of their employees but Mustapha for me stood out above all of them. I have never met such a happy person. You can tell that he is truly enjoying his job, his genuine smile makes him the most approachable person in the hotel, no wonder why he gets his name mentioned in Trip Advisor comments. He helps with anything you ask him to do. I must say well done to the management for employing such a STAR. I hope you can keep him at Mayfair Townhouse for many years to come. I will be recommending Mayfair Townhouse to all my friends, and I will definitely return to meet Mustapha again. Thank you",4,2021,11,20
138,"Understated elegance at private Mayfair Townhouse...excellent service, rooms and location","excellent location and service,  friendly and informative staff, rooms were cosy but small

138,visit,"The only problem was noise affecting the rooms we had over the front of the hotel .ie
Traffic during the night and early next morning with waste collection and linen etc collection.
This will be resolved on our next visit when we will have the same arrangement but at the rear of the hotel . 
Otherwise the hotel staff were helpful and friendly - just as would be expected .",5,2021,11,07
138,Great location and friendly staff,"All of the staff were professional and friendly. The doorman was able to answer our questions and told us about Shepherd Market, which is lovely spot very close to the hotel. The room was comfortable and equipped with a Hypnos bed. The mini bar was stacked with complimentary soft drinks and snacks. The location is in a smart area, opposite Green Park. Breakfast was high quality but not cheap, however it is possible to order one item, such as porridge or eggs on sourdough, and this was reasonable and could be delivered to your room if required.",5,2021,11,05
138,Great hotel,"It was a great experience at the hotel. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Special thanks to Mustapha who very attentive and caring.

Great bar
Exceptional drinks
Great vibe

",5,2021,10,29
138,The bad and the good,"Nice hotel in central location.
Small rooms…
The issue is that for 400 pounds a night you would expect much much better street noise insulation - the windows in the room may be double glazed (?) but street noise comes easily through….
I have stayed in far cheaper hotels with far far superior noise insulation ….for the price the hotel charges per night they can replace all the windows per room….
Quality sleep is far more important than anything else - so will NOT come back or recommend this hotel; very disappointed and surprised.
Bring solid earplugs.
Staff is great though…it is the management of the hotel that are greedy.",2,2021,10,27
138,Excellent hotel in a great location,A luxurious five star hotel in the middle of Mayfair - beautifully restored hotel - on a fairly quiet side road near to Green Park tube station - great location.  Everyone at the hotel was very professional and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble.  The room although quite small was very quiet on the top floor and beautifully presented.  The huge bed was like sleeping on a cloud - it was absolutely fabulous.  The breakfasts were excellent - nothing was too much trouble.  The bar drinks were quite expensive but it is Mayfair.  Can fully recommend this hotel - were really had a great stay and it was so relaxing and a real treat.,5,2021,10,25
138,Couldn’t fault,"Just come back from a few days spent here, absolutely nothing I can fault about the hotel. Garden Suite was superb and satisfied all our needs, service was wonderful and all of the staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable ",5,2021,10,25

138,50th birthday,"Excellent. Overall our experience at the Mayfair Townhouse was an excellent one and we would certainly stay again and recommend to friends and family.

The only critic I have is that the blinds were tricky so a fully closing curtain would have been better for us and I thought the bed could have been a little firmer. However on saying that we both slept very well. 

A nice beer or small bottle of wine in the mini bar would have been a treat too. No alcoholic drinks available in the mini bar.

Lovely clean town house, great staff, great location 

",5,2021,10,18
138,Top quality and friendly service.  Snug but superbly appointed room.,"New hotel recently opened after conversion of 15 townhouses, hence name.  Super friendly staff, great service with superbly appointed if somewhat snug rooms.
Great bar for cocktails and light meals and one of the best hotel breakfasts I can remember.  Complimentary soft mini bar and snacks, heated towel wall and other little details make the difference and the feeling the staff can’t do enough for you.
Convenient to Mayfair and a short walk to soho and theatre land.  Highly recommended.",5,2021,10,17
138,A fine place in a lovely position,A top tip for lovers of London and the beauty of Mayfair. Excellent service and a caring attitude makes this an exceptionally good choice for couples and singetons enjoying a few days in town. Highly recommended,5,2021,10,16

138,luxury accessible accommodation,"As a wheelchair user finding luxury accommodation can be tough, this place is a real gem, just spent a few days here, the room is compact as you would expect for a central london room, the room is very well equipped and the staff are all superb, nothing is too much trouble and they really seem invested in making your stay as comfortable and stress free as possible. 

Really central location and really close to a tube station, next time I am back in london this hotel will certainly be high on my list",5,2021,10,08

138,Great location & excellent staff!,"This was our second stay at this hotel. The first time was in August and we were very impressed hence why we booked again. Both times we booked an executive room. The first time we were in a room looking out the front of the hotel which was lovely. The second time we were in an end room which unfortunately had a funny smell. We mentioned this to staff and we were moved straight away. The staff here are brilliant, very attentive and friendly. The hotel itself is fresh and clean. The dandy bar is definitely worth a visit, or two (it’s only open until 1030pm). The mini bar is complimentary which is amazing, however there is no alcohol in it…..I wouldn’t expect this to be complimentary but to have it there as an option to purchase would be nice. The only bad point I have is that the rooms don’t seem to be very sound proof, we could hear people in the corridor or other rooms at night. We will definitely return - best bits are the location, the deco and the staff. Oh and it has a great little gym! All in all the hotel is probably 4.5 out of 5.",5,2021,10,07

We stayed in a Deluxe room and the bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was the best we've ever experienced!
We ate and drunk cocktails in the Dandy Bar for both nights. Really relaxing atmosphere and the food was delicious, especially the Cod dish.
Gary the bell boy is a credit to the hotel, extremely helpful in making our plans for exploring London. 
We would highly recommend the hotel and can't wait to visit again!",5,2021,10,01

Breakfast was fine but not amazing so next day I ate at Hide round the corner! Pillows were a bit hard (staff brought me a selection of softer ones) but bed super comfy and huge!",5,2021,09,26
138,"Great hotel, Great location, but Grating amount of road noise affecting sleep","The hotel is well appointed and well managed with a nice contemporary vibe. Great location for all you exercise lovers who want to hit the 3 parks for early morning/ late night runs to keep active. But the big drawback for me was the noisiness of the Half Moon Street the hotel is on. It’s a bit of a rat run into Mayfair and late into the early hours (like 3am) there are limos hovering with their engines on waiting for their clients, people loading/unloading vans, lots of people talking, motorbikes and cars accelerating then braking down this street as they turn off Green Park heading to Mayfair. I’m someone who needs fresh, cool air to sleep well and the street was just so noisy that my 3 nights were all interrupted (Mon/Tue/Wed .. so not even weekend activity!). I was in a first floor room. I don’t think the hotel management satisfactorily acknowledged my remarks when I checked out and nothing was
offered to me as a gesture. I got the feeling I am not the first guest to have raised this complaint .. sad because otherwise it’s a great hotel for what I was looking for.",4,2021,09,25
138,Excellent best hotel I've stayed at in London,"Super helpful staff, girls on reception are amazing, the concierge very helpful, the breakfast head waitress was so lovely and polite, English breakfast superb, rooms like new, great bed and bathroom and spotlessly clean",5,2021,09,23
138,Lovely staff,We stayed for a birthday celebration and the location was perfect to do shopping and go for dinner! The staff were lovely and definitely made the trip. I would just say that the food was pretty average and the portion sizes were very small.,4,2021,09,23

- staff at reception were resourceful and friendly
- the room was clean and fresh every day, although it was slightly small 
- breakfast service was good, delicious with no issues and rajeswari was an attentive waitress who had a conversation with us in fluent German 
Overall we would stay here again and it was a great place for us to stay to explore London. The hotel is also very stylish.",4,2021,09,19
138,Could do better,"We were very much looking forward to staying at The Mayfair Townhouse, particularly as it's part of the Chewton Glen group. The staff are warm and welcoming but I'm not sure the hotel has quite got itself going.

The bar is understaffed and there's no real atmosphere. The room we stayed in was immaculate but the bathroom was so small you had to shuffle in sideways to get in. Standing at the sink meant your legs touched the toilet.

I think the Townhouse has rushed to open post-Covid and hasn't quite got its mojo together. We will, however, return to see if they up their game.",4,2021,09,14
138,our stay,Very good hotel bar and food however our experience was not as good as expected because we had to deal with an aircon issue that could have been solved by changing rooms as soon as it was reported but instead dragged on and when they finally offered to change rooms in the middle of the night it was too late as we were leaving in the morning.,3,2021,09,13
138,Excellent,"I booked a night at the Mayfair townhouse hotel to ask  my girlfriends To marry me  and have been communicating with the hotel over email in advance to out booking and wanted them to set the room up for me whilst we was out and organise flowers and balloons and they exceeded my expectations the staff was amazing helpful and such lovely people, nothing was too much of an ask!! I cannot fault them and would recommend them any time! The hotel room was beautiful and elegant and the hotel it self was just amazing, I would love to say Thank you for making our special occasion amazing and thank you for being apart of your new journey 

We will most definitely be returning

138,Sublime Sartorial Elegance,"A no lockdown lunch! Perfectly perfect!

Here we thoroughly enjoyed a sartorial and bespoke  experience set in an environment oozing old style elegance combined with the charm of a bygone era, expertly blended with subtle modernism 

It is hard to describe how present, efficient and attentive the service was, yet at the same time, expertly invisible; this  left us ensconced in our own bubble of serenity.

The cuisine and beverages need no description bar sublime.

The venue would be so awesomely perfect for a wedding. The subterranean level offers up hidden delights.

Here you will find the ultimate tranquil jewel in the throbbing heart of London city life.",5,2021,09,11
138,Amazing stay!,"First ever visit to London, Staff were so friendly, polite and helpful and made it an easy check in. As we didn't know London the staff was very helpful with recommendations.

138,Wanted luxury and definitely found it,"This would normally be outside our price range but we treated ourselves and took advantage of an offer. Rooms were exceptionally well appointed, extremely comfortable bed, fully stocked minibar (FOC) and fresh milk. Think we had an Executive Room - it had a small seating area. Staff were so welcoming, made us feel like VIPs. Hope to return. Just to mention that Aug-21 there is some building work at the back - might be worth checking which room you're allocated (not a massive noise problem, just a slight distraction at times - we don't go to hotels to sit in the room all day and it didn't disturb our sleep). Rooms were extremely well sound-proofed I'd say, didn't hear any 'neighbour' noise.",5,2021,09,06
138,LONDON IPG,"Very good quality and service at a hotel that deserves to do well. Staff attentive and food at breakfast was very good. 
Bed was extremely comfortable which is important and we felt relaxed and looked after throughout our visit.",4,2021,09,06
138,A great stay,"Such a lovely stay in central London.  What I particularly liked about it was that even though we had a delicious dinner in the bar, we were never made to feel that we had to eat there.  Being in the heart of London means that you have your pick of places to go, so it was inviting without you being made to feel guilty about going elsewhere to eat or drink.  A fabulous stay and will be recommending it .  ",5,2021,09,06

138,Quirky yet decadent ,"This is a beautiful hotel with lots of character and charm. The rooms are well appointed with sumptuous beds that guarantee a fantastic night's sleep. Despite being in the middle of Mayfair, this is off the main road so very little traffic noise. Bathrooms have under floor heating plus a heated wall rather than just the towel rail. 
Staff are extremely polite, professional and friendly. 
I will certainly recommend this hotel to anyone I know heading to the capital.

What really made the stay was the attention to detail and care of the staff. They really cannot do enough to help and ensure your stay is smooth and perfect.
Oh and the beds are incredible!",5,2021,08,22
138,Do not recommend,I have just witnessed the most appalling scene at this hotel. A young lady and her friends trying to resolve an issue by jumped up patronising staff who instead of trying to resolve an issue arguing back and calling the lady a liar. Not an experience we would expect to see if Mayfair. We would not stay here again.,1,2021,08,21
138,Please do not book here stay somewhere else in Mayfair where they look after their customers,"This is the worst hotel I have stayed at in my entire 45 years on this planet. Absolute mess from their side which not only did they refuse to resolve but the deputy manager was beyond passive aggressive, no accountability, no the customer is right. We ended up cutting our trip short and checking out to travel home. This should not be a 5 star hotel regardless of its interior the customer service is disgusting.",1,2021,08,21

Also, every single room is gorgeous - no matter where you are. The design is so whimsical in nature, but yet still elegant. The service is par to none and all the staff is so friendly and accommodating. 

Bathrooms are gorgeous and the floor is heated. My favorite part is you can cast your phone onto the television so you can watch Netflix, Hulu, or whatever else you desire. Such a modern touch. ",5,2021,08,18

The room service menu is fabulous and well worth it. 
Considering the price we paid and the service we received, this stay was exceptionally good value.

Dandy bar was a lovely relaxing bar to enjoy a cocktail the bar staff went out their way to make us cocktails that weren’t on the menu. 

Located in a beautiful quiet street and parking wasn’t that far away 10 min walk to the Q-park at Hyde park. 

We are looking  forward to  our next visit with our friends  to celebrate my husband’s “year belated” 40th birthday next month.",5,2021,08,13

138,"Lovely place, exceptional stay","Myself and my partner travelled down to London for a mini break.
We arrived at the hotel it was lovely, the staff were lovely and it was very clean.
Everybody was very polite and friendly.

My only personal gripe is I didn't  want to see staff in masks, to me they shouldn't be wearing them.
It makes no sense, that the visitors don't have to but they do. I understand the situation and the management want the customers to ""feel safe"". Nobody cares now and its unnecessary to carry it on. 

Im over it now, and the majority of people are I bet... masks make me feel uncomfortable. I want to see people's faces, and wearing a mask for 8-10 hrs a day is unhygienic and not a nice. 
Im saying this from experience.

But overall, it's a great hotel and we loved it.",5,2021,08,10

138,Great hotel with the loveliest staff,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Mayfair Townhouse. Beautiful hotel and the staff make it. Great location in the heart of Mayfair and a walk away from Buckingham Palace, Berkeley Square restaurants and Carnaby Street, which we enjoyed. Check in was unfortunately not great as had to wait a long time, as our room wasn't ready. The staff at the front desk and in reception were so lovely and made sure that once we got our room we we were happy and apologised for our wait.  Gary in reception was also brilliant and always checked we were happy and had everything we needed.  The room (we had the executive room) was very clean with a super comfy bed and lovely decor.  Our only disappointment was that the bathroom was ridiculously small. To get in the door we had to go in sideways (I am not big!) and once in the bathroom, to use the shower we had to open the shower door which then blocked the toilet and towel rail! The room service was brilliant and food was delicious. Vegan burger was best we have had and Veggie Antipasti delicious. Nick and Josephine were brilliant. The breakfast was our favourite part.  Eggs cooked to perfection and so tasty and fresh. Lovely choice of Cocunut Yogurt, homemade Granola, fruit, sourdough toast and full English etc.  Smashed Avo & Poached eggs on sourdough was our favourite. Service at breakfast was outstanding. Nick was brilliant and Rachel always so accommodating.  The staff are a credit to this hotel and made us feel so welcome and made our stay a special one. Thank you.  Mr & Mrs Reeves",4,2021,08,09

They have a cocktail bar within the hotel called the Dandy bar which serves a perfect cocktails at a very reasonable price. All the staff are very polite and always there to help.
Location is also good on a fairly quiet street within walking distance of many attractions,bars and restaurants but if you need a cab there’s always one passing the hotel.

Before we arrived the concierge helped us to locate the garage 7 mins walk away, that was outside the congestion charge zone, it was also discounted for hotel guests. The public areas are very discreet and just enough for what it a smallish hotel, the bar had a lot of atmosphere. The room (deluxe) was just the right size with all the facilities you need and the heated marble wall in the bathroom was great. We had a lovely stay and plan on going back when we can.",5,2021,08,03
138,Best Hotel in Mayfair,"From start to finish our stay was AMAZING. Brilliant concierge Lee and the best reception team. Stylish hotel with all the comforts you aspect from a top hotel.

138,Lovely new hotel,"We have just returned from a few days at this hotel and would certainly return. The welcome from Gary the doorman and Lee the concierge (who went above and beyond replying to my email on his day off!) was very warm and friendly and made us feel very welcome indeed. 
The room (deluxe) was small but beautifully decorated. 
The Dandy bar was very nice with lovely cocktails and a nice menu that was adapted on the three occasions that we visited to cater for us as vegans (there are vegan options anyway but they were more than happy to adapt other things to make them suitable for vegans). The bar manager was very welcoming and very helpful.
The breakfast was excellent, again they were more than happy to adapt to make things suitable for vegans. Po, our waiter, was absolutely brilliant, such a lovely manner.
We had three small issues while we were there: 1. Our room was turned down on our first night and so we had expected it to happen again but the next two nights we did not get a turndown service. 2. I had contacted the hotel in advance to ask that only vegan snacks were left in our room and was assured that this would be the case, however every morning we had a mix of vegan and non vegan snacks left in our room which we returned every day and which they then replaced with vegan snacks. 3. We did not have our body lotion replenished one day and when we asked for some we were delivered two bottles, one of which was half full and had clearly been opened and used.
There may well be a few small teething issues but we had a lovely time, the hotel is beautiful and the staff were excellent. We will definitely be back.",5,2021,07,25
138,Outstanding,"Outstanding hotel. Incredible service from the moment you arrive from knowledgeable and friendly staff. Wow…. The decor is just perfect with the right balance between classy, quirky and modern whilst capturing the quintessential traditional Mayfair vibes. Hats off to the interior designers! The rooms are excellently fitted with super comfy beds, plenty of mirrors, charging points and lights. The rain head walk in shower is world class. Complimentary minibar also generous and with a saucy selection of thirst quenchers. Location is perfect…. No more to say on this. The gym is super clean and modern and has enough to do a basic workout but is somewhat style over substance if you’re a bodybuilder looking to keep those gains. Only negative of the stay is the toilet/bathroom to the bedroom was a little small but not a deal breaker in any way as the shower makes up for it.

138,A home away from home,"The Mayfair Townhouse is a hidden gem in London’s crown. Situated a stone’s throw away from Green Park, the hotel has easy access to some of the Capital’s most beautiful areas, notably Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, St James’ Palace and much more. Mayfair itself is an untouched jewel - so much to explore if you truly look closely. 

The Townhouse itself is beautifully presented l. The rooms are incredibly well-equipped and decorated to a very high standard. The facilities (gym, bar, restaurant) are all lovely - the gym suits anyone’s requirements, the cocktails are creative, and the breakfast is delicious! The hotel itself is truly fantastic. 

Putting all this aside, the staff is what makes this hotel the perfect getaway. They are all so conscientious. From the moment you arrive to the moment to you leave each and every staff member is unbelievably welcoming, engaging you in conversation at every moment. They are helpful to the core - from replacing drinks to providing room service to fulfilling your every request. A truly magnificent team. 

10/10 - an amazing stay and a hotel that I have already recommended far and wide!",5,2021,07,21
138,Fantastic Hotel with caring and professional staff. Home from home.,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Mayfair.

Welcomed by wonderful George who was always on hand to assist with anything we needed. The full team went above and beyond. A home from home experience. 

Beautiful appointed bedrooms and the eggs royale are an absolute must for breakfast. 

Thank you team Mayfair Townhouse. 

We will be back. 

Many thanks, William ",5,2021,07,19
138,Exceeded my expectations,"We had a wonderful night stay at The Mayfair Townhouse. The hotel is 5 minutes from Green Park Tube Station and some wonderful things to see nearby. 

The room was exceptionally well presented and clean, we made use of all of the amenities they had to offer.

The staff were extremely professional and friendly. They had great knowledge of things to do in the local area and attentive for our needs as a guest (umbrella as it was raining on the day). 

The bar staff in their Dandy Bar were brilliant, they were able to recommend cocktails to our preferred tastes rather than reading off their menu. Attention to detail was incredible, they knew exactly when to top up the champagne glasses.

Breakfast in the morning was brilliant, great selection of choices and met all of our dietary requirements.  

Special thanks to Gary at front of house for being so welcoming and thank you to Jitesh for taking the time to ask us for our feedback on our stay; he showed a genuine interest in our experience.",5,2021,07,19

Rooms were lovely and bright and great modern ensuite.  The rooms were to a high quality spec and so easy to switch off and relax.    The complimentary drinks and snacks in the room were nice gesture and much appreciated after a day of sight seeing.  Loved the location, as it was easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go either as a short walk or taxi ride.  The friendly service continued in the Dandy Bar, with a great range of cocktails.

 Everything catered for. Room service fast, efficient and spot on. Menu hit the spot.
Great vibe in the bar. An Amalfi cocktail is a must, forget the humdrum espresso martini. 
Location? A short walk from just about everywhere.
Countless top notch restaurants within a stones throw. Sympathetic renovation of ten Georgian townhouses. If only the walls could talk.
In one word? Luxury",5,2021,07,09
138,Great hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Fantastic stay at the wonderful Mayfair Townhouse.

Our third time and it didn’t disappoint.

Thank you very much, The staff are excellent and very helpful from the doorman to the room service. Thank you all.",5,2021,07,06
138,Avoid,Stylish and great service but....the rooms at the back of the hotel overlooking a noisy construction site are not fit for purpose. Forget having a relaxing lie-in and be ready to be tormented by excessive construction plant and concrete placing noise from 8am - 6pm. Appreciate that this is beyond the hotel's control but placing guests in rooms at the back overlooking the site instead of the quieter front is totally within their control. If you want a quiet stay do not stay here.,1,2021,07,06
138,Exceptional,"Had the most wonderful two nights at the townhouse. The staff are exceptional! Everyone was incredibly welcoming and it felt like they truly took an interest in you. Everytime we came and went from reception we had a lovely conversation. There was one particular young man (who I don’t think we caught his name) but every time we spoke to him in reception he made us laugh and really took the time to get to know us. Piero in the cocktail bar is exceptional. The cocktails were so delicious and beautifully presented and he even remembered which ones we had the night before and recommended which ones we should try knowing what we like! The bar itself is beautiful, we wish we had spent more time in there. 
Pre our arrival Dianna on the concierge team recommended restaurants to us and secured us a very last minute and sought after reservation at Amazonico, and as we had booked through her they welcomed us there with complimentary champagne and knew already we were celebrating our anniversary, a really wonderful touch thanks to Dianna. 
We stayed in an executive room and on arrival the team had written a lovely note on our mirror, again a great touch. The bathroom is beautiful and very luxurious, but my one critique (if I am going to be very picky!) was that although the room was well equipped with complimentary drinks and snacks, the decor didn’t feel quite as ‘wow’ and luxurious as the rest of the hotel. 

Overall I would highly recommend the mayfair townhouse, I cannot wait to get back there and stay again! The best hotel staff I have ever experienced. ",5,2021,07,05
138,Fantastic boutique hotel,Location was excellent right near Green Park but on a quiet side road .

138,great new hotel in W1,"we stayed for 2 nights and hotel open in may 2021 and the hotel has been excellent fitted out 
the only fault was the breakfast as it was a bit poor on what was on offer the cost was high for they served  ",5,2021,07,04
138,Chic Mayfair Townhouse,"A beautiful hotel with 172 rooms spread across 15 Georgian townhouses, though it feels much more boutique & personal. The location on Half Moon Street is ideal for being in the thick of things, just a few minutes walk from Green Park tube. This street & its surrounds was a stomping ground for Oscar Wilde & he is referenced as the  inspiration for the styling of the hotel. Decor is classy & vibrant but understated, & it manages to feel luxurious yet laid back. The Townhouse is part of the Iconic Luxury Hotels Collection, a group which includes big players such as Chewton Glen & Cliveden. The greeting was warm, with staff, particularly the lovely Mitchell, friendly but professional. As a solo traveller on this trip I opted for the entry level Cabin Room. These bedrooms are the smallest on offer but I was pleasantly surprised by the free space, the outlook over Half Moon Street, & the amount of natural light from the two good sized windows. The fit out is high end with lux linens, powerful shower, nice products plus complimentary mini-bar. I didn't bother with breakfast but this is served in a basement room called The Club. I had a light dinner in The Dandy Bar, an upscale clubby type space which serves a concise, fairly casual all day menu. Food was ok, cocktails, wine & service, excellent. 
Overall, a great stay & a great addition to the London hotel offer.",5,2021,07,04
138,"Great stay, coming back.","Enjoyed my stay here, was for my girlfriends birthday and they were very helpful with decorating and setting up the room, will be coming back for sure, breakfast was also amazing an overall enjoyable experience",5,2021,07,04

138,"Excellent stay , Hospitality at its best.","Just come back from a night away at this hotel after seeing it on the TV program and being connected to the Chewton Glen, which we know well.  It doesn't disappoint at all. The friendly , yet professional approach from the staff were lovely and they were very accommodating and delivered a personal service.  The room was beautiful and the attention to detail was prevalent throughout the decor. We also had breakfast which was well cooked and presented beautifully. In a city where there are countless hotel options available, I would wholeheartedly recommend this one , as it is small, beautifully presented and in a perfect location with staff trained on excellent customer service.",5,2021,07,02
138,Best staff in the business ,"I dont think I have ever stayed at a hotel where the staff are so friendly and helpful, they truly made our stay 5 star and we cannot thank them enough. We were lucky enough to receive a free upgrade and with no reminder at all they remembered it was my mums birthday and brought a bottle of champagne up to the room! Beautiful room, lovely touches, wonderful location.  We cannot wait to come back xx",5,2021,07,02

138,My new London home-away-from-home,"This was my third time staying in the hotel since it reopened in May after the most recent lockdown. I've got nothing but superlatives to offer. The rooms are great but for me it's the staff that makes all the difference in the world. From check-in to check-out and everything in between, the team at the Mayfair Townhouse never fails to make me feel special and welcome each time I stay. I'm in London at least once or twice a month, usually over weekends, and I've stayed in several other well-established hotels in the Mayfair area. But the Mayfair Townhouse has become my go-to. It's like a home away from home.",5,2021,06,28
138,Nice location ,"We were greated by the lovely employees at the reception, the check in was a bit long, we booked two rooms, they offered an upgrade for one room which was nice, rooms are tiny, and the suite that was offered to us was a bit smaller than the room we had booked, with a large sofa that took half of the space, although it had a nice big bathroom. The fridge was full of complementry  drinks and snacks.
The location was superb and it was the highlight of this hotel, not to forget the pleasant employees and concierge.

138,Perfect!,"Myself and my boyfriend had a lovely stay at the Mayfair townhouse. Definitely will return! 
Great location, plenty to do around the hotel as well as being close to green park underground station. 

Staff were very helpful and did anything they could to make our stay comfortable. 

Beautiful hotel, very luxury. 
Thank you!!",5,2021,06,16
138,Wish we'd stayed for longer!,"Couldn't wait to stay here, it looked so lovely in the build up to it reopening.  Sister hotel, or would that be brother hotel, keeping the Dandy theme, to the Chewton Glen.  It is luxury in an understated way, no pretentiousness here!  We stayed in the Garden Terrace room with a small outdoor area.  The bed (and bedding) was the comfiest we've ever had.  My partner always says he doesn't sleep, so don't set the alarm.  I had to wake him!  He wanted to take the shower home with him.  Piping hot instanst water, no temperature fluctuations and a powerful massaging spray.  The mini bar, treats and coffee machine are all welcome treats after a hard day walking around the Capital.  I may have devoured the maccaroons, whoops.  Definitely try a cocktail in the Dandy Bar.  And oh my word, the breakfast!  So much choice, the porridge was amazing and the Eggs Royale.  In fact, all of it.  Except that my stay wasn't long enough",5,2021,06,15
138,Great hotel in a quiet location,"A perfect location in Mayfair which offers a quiet retreat away from the crowds.  We opted for an Executive room which was spacious with a great bathroom.  It did feel a little sparse in terms of furniture but was still comfortable.  The bed was great and helped provide a good nights sleep.  

All the staff we interacted with were exceptional and keen to please.  The bar has a great ambiance and good selection of cocktails made with love.  Although I wanted a non alcoholic beer later on the evening which was not available, the bar team came up with an alternative for me as a non drinker.

Breakfast is very good and decent value for this part of London.  The staff at breakfast were a little too keen to please and could relax a little but that is being very critical.  

A good hotel and my wife and I will return again.",5,2021,06,13
138,Superb,Such a delightful hotel with a staff that welcome you and do happy to oblige. Lee and Valentina are exceptional. The decor in the hotel is absolutely divine and so individual. The luxurious feel to each room traditional with a contemporary twist and artistic flair is fabulous. Highly recommended and what a perfect location! It’s amazing that Oscar Wilde wrote The importance of being Ernest in this very location. The ability to walk 2 minutes to the gorgeous Shepherds Market restaurants and cafes and pubs and 5 minutes to the Ritz and surrounds make this hotel’s enviable position a total package. We will return!,5,2021,06,11
138,Excellent end to end,"Our trip had been postponed during the pandemic. During this time the reservation team kept in excellent contact with us through all of the uncertainty of covid restrictions, we new we were in capable hands. From the guy at the complimentary parking to arrival at the Hotel, the check in, the stay itself and food, check out and then lost property return through the post, the service was excellent. The fabric and decor of the hotel is wonderful and worthy of the accolades.",5,2021,06,10
138,Excellent,"Spent a wonderful anniversary weekend at this new property on quiet side street off Piccadilly 5 mins walk from green park tube station.
Beautifully appointed throughout, room immaculately clean, comfy bed and pillows, complimentary mini bar with soft drinks and snacks.
Like any business it’s the people who make it. I can honestly say these are the friendliest, knowledgeable and professional people I’ve ever met at any establishment.
My thanks to you all especially Mitchell, Antonina, Josephine, Gary and a special mention to Lee who must be the greatest concierge in London.
We had our anniversary breakfast at shard Shang ri la and waiting for us on our table an anniversary card from Lee.Wow
We will be back to see our friends at The Mayfair Townhouse.
Don’t hesitate just book it.",5,2021,06,10
138,Find somewhere else.,"No sense of service whatsoever.  Staff just ‘there’.  Do not use this hotel if you have alternatives.   After a lovely evening for dinner,  back at 10.45 post dinner for pre bed cocktails.  To be told no chance!  Find another hotel!

This is an expensive place to stay.  The follow through, standards and associated elements do not justify the cost.  Our wardrobe door fell off when we looked around our room!

So sorry to report this but all true!  Find somewhere else!!’n",1,2021,06,09

138,2 night stay in this smart hotel.,"The hotel is in an excellent  location close to all the amenities  of Mayfair but quiet enough to enjoy a good nights sleep. The hotel is a smart conversion of several grand townhouses and gets the mix of traditional  and modern just right. Staff are polite and attentive without being overbearing and provide a warm welcome.
Breakfast offers plenty of quality choices in a relaxed environment.
My room was well equipped and smart with a comfortable  bed and quality furnishings.

Check in was seamless and the reception staff were always on hand for any queries and to add a dash of cheer to the day.

I can safely say that the room was impeccable. My husband and I visited to celebrate our wedding anniversary and received a complimentary bottle of wine in the room and a card from the reception team, which we came back to after a day wondering the city. ",5,2021,06,05
138,FANTASTIC - MUST TRY HOTEL,"We stayed 4 nights at this fantastic , and attention to detail Hotel.

From the management and all the way to the reception staff are warm and welcoming. 

We found the whole team singing from the same 'hymn' sheet. We found the team flexible and so accomodating.

The Decor from the entrance and throughout the hotel is immaculate. It gives you a true sense of 5 star. The breakfast room downstairs and toilets are oozing with character and depth.

The Bedroom - Junior suite - had the softest pillows and most comfortable mattress you can ask for. The bathroom was modern and every inch of it clean. You couldnt fault the bathroom at all, from the soaps to the Bath robes.

The Manager , Federico Ciampi, is very polite and responsive to you individual needs. He is as bespoke as they come. Federico team, including his reception Manager and his reception team are caring and responsive to your individual needs. 

The Townhouse Mayfair is a must visit if your travelling into central London. Its a perfect location to reach to all of the great landmarks and restuarants. This Hotel sits in the Heart of it all. !!!!

This is a fabulous relatively small hotel in central Mayfair, close to everything so fantastic location.  Everything was to a high standard; room, welcome by the reception team, concierge, as you would expect from iconic.  This is a discreet, confident hotel that offers very high standards. Special mention to the reception team who were wonderful.",5,2021,05,31
138,Truly FANTASTIC hotel. Absolutely beautiful!,"What a beautiful new hotel in London. My partner & I come to London regularly and are always keen to try out the new hotels & this one blows the rest right out of the water!

First, the location is fantastic! Perfect if you like to wander around the parks, pop down to Knightsbridge, or to the Westend. The hotel itself is stunning, the townhouses really stand out & have been transformed to a very high standard. 

When entering we were greeted by the friendly concierge team who were incredibly helpful. To be honest, I don’t think I’ve ever stayed in a hotel with such friendly staff. Everyone we met, from the reception staff, waiters & bar staff, were all knowledgeable, super friendly & made us feel very relaxed. 

Now onto the room... WOW! Truly spectacular. We stayed in the garden suite and I have to say, we were blown away. Every small detail has been thought out. The bed was huge & comfortable. The sofa area was beautiful & we even had our own courtyard which was a slice of heaven. Ideal for a nightcap after our evening meals. It felt like our sanctuary away from the hustle & bustle of London. Oh & the bathtub, it was HUGE! That was a treat after a big day out in London.

Breakfast was also delicious & the cocktails were to die for. As you can tell, I absolutely loved my stay and very much look forward to going back. Many thanks to everyone at The Mayfair Townhouse.",5,2021,05,28
138,Unfulfilled Potential,"Given that this hotel's sisters include Cliveden and Chewton Glen, it demonstrates little of the disitnctive style and unique character of either. Having opened only two weeks ago it has all of the luxurious fluffy towels, beautifully comfortable beds and smart paintwork one would expect but it sadly lacks anything special to set it apart from many alternatives that can much more easily justify their tariff. The lack of a restaurant, which is understandable, being so close to Shepherd Market, it nevertheless leaves a feeling of being incomplete as informal 'snack' dining is offered in the Dandy Bar rather than in a dedicated area - a bit something and nothing. Having originally booked in the Dandy Bar we chose to cancel this and venture out. Our visit was rescued by the personable and extremely helpful staff, namely Lee and Gary as Doormen/Concierge who supplied excellent recommends and Josephine as efficient and friendly receptionist. Although undoubtedly a quality hotel, The Mayfair Townhouse is very much a lost opportunity to enhance the group portfolio.",3,2021,05,28
138,Fabulous from start to finish!,"Wow, what a fantastic midweek city break we just experienced staying at the Mayfair Townhouse. First time back to London for nearly 2 years and first time staying at this hotel. 

From the moment we arrived we were treated royalty! We had a cool nice drink whilst we had our check in sorted by the staff. Bags had been promptly whipped from us (by the bellman) and doors held open by the ever present concierge. 

Our room was perfect, spotlessly clean, nice Hildon waters awaited and a great mattress. The sound proofing on the windows and doors was superb.

The location was great too, we came via train to Waterloo and then tube transfer couldn’t have been simpler (2 stops on jubilee to green park) and a short 5min walk to Half Moon Street. We spent our main day on foot, walking from the Hotel across Hyde Park to Notting Hill, Portobello Rd, Primrose Hill and eventually Camden using the tube to get back. 

Great cosy lobby bar at the hotel, bar staff even remembered us from the day before at check in and they make a wicked Dirty Vodka Martini! Even the free bar olives are fantastic! Pic attached before it all got too blurry!

Breakfasts were included on our rate, couldn’t fault anything. Smoked salmon and scrambled eggs both mornings (which wasn’t on menu specifically, but accommodated without any fuss). 

By the time we had to check out we didn’t want to leave! Back to reality with a bump and busy train ride home. 

Even the hand sanitizer was top notch and our room had a complimentary bottle to take with us. 

We will definitely be back, it’ll probably be 2022 before we can but we will eagerly anticipate it!",5,2021,05,28
138,A new excellent hotel near Green Park,The hotel has not been open very long but it operated smoothly. Very professional staff. Ticked all our boxes. Part of the same group of hotels as Chewton Glen it deserves to do well. At the moment the room rates are excellent value.,5,2021,05,28

Great food, comfort and attention to the clients. Would definitely recommend.",5,2021,05,24

A boutique gem quietly nestled just off Piccadilly so access to everything you might need for the long-awaited R&R is on the doorstep.  The Staff here, all of them, are as immaculately turned out as their professional skills on display and have seemingly found a perfect balace of welcoming and service without being stuffy.  Our beautiful 5th floor room had  everything  and the bathroom included a much coveted bath :  In Room Tea/Coffee and soft drinks all provided but we chose to avoid the ironing in favour of enjoying  expertly crafted cocktails from their Dandy Bar!  Breakfast marginally underwhelming but once ""normal"" service resumes I have no doubt this small prompt will be addressed.  The staff are what will continue to set this hotel apart and we are already looking forward to our next visit!",5,2021,05,21
138,Shopping Break,Me & my partner stayed here in December just after the hotel opened & it was wonderful & in an excellent location! The team were very friendly & went out of their way to help us with all of our questions & the Concierge had some great recommendations. We had drinks in the Dandy Bar which had a lovely atmosphere & the cocktails were great. We have booked to return once the hotel has reopened & cannot wait.,5,2021,05,06
138,"It's a stretched 5/5, but to open in this period you must be a hero","Me and my wife, living and working nearby, picked this hotel to spend a few nights while our flat was under urgent 'refurbishment'. 
The look is that of a boutique hotel, a fresh new one, elegant, but discreet - we liked it.
Rooms are not impressive, small, as often happens in Mayfair, but the price reflects a 5 stars which I still can't see.
Staff members are very polite, attentive although there is still some fine tuning needed. Communication was not perfect, but it could be forgiven.
I am afraid the food was disappointing, just sufficient. Not at a proper standard for the price of the hotel and closer to a gastro-pub than a Mayfair establishment. Limited choice and quality could be improved. It's an encouragement to do better and I trust the main issue are still the covid restrictions - I hope.
For this I still give a 5/5, while I would have given 4/5. It's not easy to rate a hotel in the City you live in, but I try to be fair and I hope this hotel can grow despite this awful period... and you need to be a hero to open and offer work to so many in such a moment.",5,2020,12,19
138,Oasis of luxury,"We spent the night at the Townhouse on a Saturday in December. It was superb- the level of comfort, staff attention to detail, service at both breakfast and in the bar- delightful cocktails. The bedroom had an extremely comfortable bed, pleasant scented toiletries, complimentary non alcoholic mini bar, Nespresso machine...

Such a treat to have a bit of luxury and pampering, within a very ‘COVID safe’ place. The safety measures the Townhouse have implemented mange not to detract from keeping the personal touch and high standards for guests. Most of all it was the excellent customer service which sets them apart from most hotels.",5,2020,12,14
138,"Style, Service and a Sumptuous sleep","Walking through The fabulously restored Georgian facade of the ‘Mayfair Townhouse’ guests are transported back to the grand era of Edwardian hotel service, mixed with a dash of Art Deco style, stirred with 21st century luxury, resulting in a memorable cocktail of experiences.

The Iconic Hotel group should be applauded for opening this ground breaking hotel despite the challenges of the past year.  Staff are exceptional, clearly hand-picked to create a welcoming, casual, yet ultimately professional atmosphere where guests instantly feel at home and yet realise from the outset that they are in for a special treat during their stay.  

We were greeted by Mitchum and Barbara who introduced us to the facilities of the hotel and invited us to have a drink in the exquisite Dandy Bar whilst we waited for our room to be ready.  We can highly recommend the artichoke croquettes, and arincini balls as a stunning appetiser to accompany The Dandy, cocktail itself.  

On arrival to our room (414) itself, we were equally impressed with space, natural light, furnishings, decor and exquisite detailing.  Large sash Windows, dressed with beautiful fabrics continued the Art Deco styling through a contemporary and sleek interpretation.  Even the generous bathroom had a sash window and subtle luxuries such as a heated wall for towels. 

The highlight of the stay however has to go to the sumptuous bedding, towels and dressing gowns - exceptional quality, making for a perfect nights sleep.  

Next morning, the breakfast again maintained the high standards, with the quality of produce matching the expectations set by the bedding.  There were a few hiccups with staff getting used to service procedures as it was still the hotels first week, however nothing that won’t be ironed out. 

My only slight disappointment was around the highly hyped complimentary minibar including ‘Dandy Tipples’ which included numerous quality mixers but no actual alcohol to mix with them.  Either reduce the hype and expectations or leave a gin to mix with the fabulous tonics. 

Overall a wonderful and memorable stay, and a welcome reprieve from the realities of the past months.  It is tragic that the hotel will be restricted by further Tier 3 restrictions after only 2 weeks in operation, but i am sure their resolve and professionalism will still be there next year and I highly recommend a visit to experience the Mayfair Townhouse before everyone discovers its delights and you can’t get a room.

138,Gorgeous new Hotel in Mayfair,"What a wonderful stay we had here! The staff were friendly, professional and willing. The room was extremely comfortable with a lovely big bed. The bathroom was positively sumptuous with delicious smelling bath products. We had an excellent breakfast - perfectly cooked. We ate in the little fox themed snug room off the main restaurant which was quirky and comfortable. This new hotel has been decorated to a really high standard. It’s smart, stylish and extremely comfortable and welcoming. Not at all stuffy. We will definitely be back. ",5,2020,12,11
138,Mayfair townhouse new look is awesome!!,"The hotel has been completely renovated and I stayed last night - what a treat, just a week after newly opening.  Luxurious and unique, I had a very good stay, pity it was only for a single night.  Of particular note is the extremely comfortable bed.  Great location too, within a minute I was jogging in Green Park this morning.  Team are friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable.  Thanks for the welcome and fabulous night’s rest!  Sean",5,2020,12,09
138,What a gem,"Stayed at the hotel just after it's opening. What to say. It's been absolutely amazing. The staff is extremely attentive, the food is excellent, the design just stunning. Couldn't have chosen a better place for my post lockdown getaway. Everyone at the hotel is wearing masks, hand sanitiser is available everywhere you go. Will for sure be back soon.",5,2020,12,06
138,Chic and cozy,"Charming hotel in a strategic position, close to the park and in the center. Very comfortable bed, rarely have I slept so well! But the room was supposed to be a double single use but it was tiny. Nice bathroom and pleasant amenities. Good breakfast, but not great. 
Staff so .. I had to wait for checkout because there was only one person at the desk and they did not open the door to go out despite being loaded. Upon my arrival I was asked for payment even though the room was prepaid!! 
A little more attention wouldn’t hurt",4,2024,09,15
138,"FIDELIDAD, muy buenos empleados y equipo.","Hemos estado alojados 5 noches en el hotel, su ubicacion es muy buena, el hotel esta reformado y sus habitaciones estan bien, los ws muy pequeños. El desayuno es muy completo y puedes pedir a la carta lo que uno desee.
El personal de; conserjeria, botones y recepcion muy bien, tengo que trasladar que los dos recepcionistas uno era de Canarias y la otra creo se llamaba Anna nos resolvieron todas nuestras necesidades, un diez para estos dos empleados que defienden la buena estancia de los clientes como si el hotel fuera de ellos, muy comprometidos por hacer de la estancia un lujo a nosotros.
Gracias.",4,2022,10,18
138,Just great and a wonderful experience,"Ich war eine Woche alleine in London. Dieses Hotel war eine ausserordentlich positive Erfahrung. Man fühlt sich sehr wohl und willkommen. Von der Lage her ist es ideal gelegen. Vieles kann man zu Fuss erreichen. Das Personal ist extrem freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war klein (cabin room), aber für mich als Einzelperson ausreichend, sehr gemütlich, sehr sauber und sehr modern eingerichtet. In einer Seitenstrasse gelegen, war mein Zimmer im 5. Stock auch ziemlich ruhig. Alles bestens. Das Frühstück war wunderbar mit frischen Früchten, vieles kann man dazu bestellen. Die Qualität der Sachen ist sehr hoch. Wer ein riesiges Buffet erwartet, ist hier falsch. Ich finde das Konzept sehr gut, das verhindert food waste. Auch das Frühstückspersonal war sehr freundlich. Ich wurde jeden Tag mit Namen begrüsst. Nebst Tee war auch der Kaffee sehr gut (ich hatte Cappuccino). Das Hotel hat eine schöne Bar wo man auch kleinere Sachen essen kann. Da so zentral gelegen, können unzählige Restaurants dann auch zu Fuss erreicht werden. Die Gegend ist sicher. Ich war als Frau auch nach 11 Uhr abends von Theater, Konzerten oder Restaurants zu Fuss unterwegs zurück ins Hotel. Absolut kein Problem. Ich komme sehr gerne wieder und kann das Hotel nur empfehlen!",5,2022,03,30
